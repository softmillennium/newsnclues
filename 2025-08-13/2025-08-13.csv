            NASA is planning to decommission premier satellite missions that gather information on planet-warming pollution and other climate vital signs beginning as soon as October, sources inside and outside of the agency told CNN.
    


            The destruction of the satellites — which will be abandoned and allowed to eventually burn up in a fiery descent into Earth's atmosphere — marks the latest step by the Trump administration to scale back federal climate science.
    


            President Donald Trump's budget proposal takes a hatchet to NASA's Earth science spending for fiscal year 2026, which begins in October.
    


            The greenhouse gas monitoring missions, known collectively as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, are some of the many Earth science casualties in the proposal.
    


            Other satellites and instruments on the chopping block include the long-lived Aqua satellite, which carries a high-resolution Earth imaging instrument called MODIS, that among other uses, helps detect wildfires worldwide. Also at risk are the Terra and Aura missions, each of which have climate science applications, and planned satellites that would precisely measure solar radiation, heavy precipitation and clouds.
    


            While the Trump administration says it is looking to end the OCO and other missions to cut costs, scientists involved in the projects see an anti-climate science pattern at work.
    


            Congress is still considering Trump's budget request and may reject some, or all, of the Earth science cuts, but NASA is proceeding as if the White House spending blueprint will be implemented as-written.
    


            David Crisp, a former NASA scientist who worked on the OCO missions and managed them until he retired in 2022, confirmed the decommissioning planning for OCO-2 and OCO-3. Other sources, including one NASA employee, also confirmed this plan, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't approved to discuss the issue.
    


            NASA calls a mission's closeout phase — the period when the program team works out how to end it — “Phase F.” The Phase F state of planning for the OCO missions was first reported by NPR.
    


            In response to questions from CNN, a NASA spokesperson pointed to Trump's budget request. “It would not be appropriate for us to comment at this time as the budget process is still happening. Should the budget pass as proposed — it still needs to make its way through Congress — this will be implemented upon the start of the next fiscal year.”
    


            Together, the OCO-2, a free-flying satellite, and OCO-3, which is mounted on the International Space Station, measure the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, specifically sniffing out climate pollution.
    


            The OCO missions are particularly useful for tracking fossil fuel and ecosystem-related emissions, scientists told CNN. The instruments also help scientists monitor plant productivity — critical for farmers and the researchers studying forest loss.
    


            While OCO-3 could be switched off and remain attached to the ISS, perhaps to be turned on again in the future, the decommissioning process for OCO-2 is far more complicated — and fiery. The satellite would be moved into a much lower orbit and exist there as space junk for years until it burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.
    


            The purposeful abandonment or destruction of multimillion-dollar satellites and instruments is essentially unprecedented, scientists told CNN. They are particularly baffled by the decision to destroy OCO-2, given it already has enough fuel on it to last through 2040.
    


            The OCO missions are still functioning and are thought to have many years left of data-gathering, in addition to the fuel onboard, which has already been bought by American taxpayers. It is not business as usual to shut off working satellites without conducting a comprehensive review, sources told CNN, nor is it typical to kill functional spacecraft that can cost billions to put into space in the first place.
    


            “The reality is that as long as these instruments are producing high-quality data, it's essentially unheard of to decommission the satellites, because keeping them going is so cheap compared to building them and launching them in the first place,” Anna Michalak, a climate researcher at Carnegie Science and Stanford University who works with greenhouse gas emissions data, told CNN.
    


            The OCO missions are important for other countries, too, since they also use the data, Michalak said: “It's not just that these are the only two NASA-funded missions. It's that these have been the most impactful missions in this space, globally, period.”
    


            Losing the OCO missions would hurt US leadership in climate science and create a multiyear gap in space-based climate pollution measurements, said Ben Poulter of Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit focused on climate risks and innovative fixes. Poulter was previously a NASA scientist and helped lead greenhouse gas monitoring efforts for the Biden administration.
    


            “Losing these satellites prematurely gives away the leadership to Europe and to China in terms of monitoring CO2 concentrations and emissions,” Poulter said. Prematurely ending the OCO missions is consistent with the perception that the Trump administration “doesn't want to do anything related to climate science and climate services,” he added.
    


In scathing letter, NASA workers rebuke ‘rapid and wasteful changes' at agency



            Crisp, the former NASA scientist, also told CNN that decommissioning so many Earth science missions at the same time fits a pattern.
    


            “My guess is that they perceive these missions as missions that were designed for climate, for reinforcing climate hysteria or something,” Crisp said of the Trump administration. “They think these missions were designed for a regulatory reason, for example. But I want to point out NASA is not a regulatory agency.”
    


            There are at least two possibilities for saving the carbon observatory mission, though researchers are not optimistic about either one coming to fruition.
    


            The first is Congress. Lawmakers could reject Trump's proposal and offer NASA the budget it needs to maintain US climate and Earth science status quo. Trump would also have to sign such a bill.
    


            The second possibility is to create a public-private partnership that pays the expenses for maintaining these instruments and processing the data back on Earth. This could take the form of a philanthropic organization, a wealthy individual or perhaps a university taking over OCO-2 or OCO-3, or perhaps both, for a period of time.
    


            The space agency has already issued a call for partnerships for OCO-3, and it is expected to put out a similar call for operating OCO-2 at some point this week, multiple researchers who work with OCO data said.
    


            “There's this scramble to see what can be done before any sort of decommissioning or Phase F protocols go into effect later this year,” Poulter said.
    


            However, involving the private sector in operating OCO or other Earth-observing satellites can present complications, Michalak said, as it could diminish NASA's role in providing an accurate backbone of Earth observations.
    


            As the search for a partnership to save OCO-2 and OCO-3 begins, NASA only has less than two months to figure out how to keep the missions going.
    


NASA scientists describe ‘absolute sh*tshow' at agency as Trump budget seeks to dismantle top US climate lab

            Monica Seles first noticed the symptoms of myasthenia gravis — a neuromuscular autoimmune disease she discussed during a recent interview with The Associated Press — while she was swinging a racket the way she'd done so many times during, and after, a career that included nine grand slam titles and a place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
    


            “I would be playing with some kids or family members, and I would miss a ball. I was like, ‘Yeah, I see two balls.' These are obviously symptoms that you can't ignore,” Seles said. “And, for me, this is when this journey started. And it took me quite some time to really absorb it, speak openly about it, because it's a difficult one. It affects my day-to-day life quite a lot.”
    


            The 51-year-old Seles, who won her first major trophy at age 16 at the 1990 French Open and played her last match in 2003, said she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis three years ago and is speaking publicly about it for the first time ahead of the US Open, which starts on August 24, to raise awareness about what is known as MG.
    


            The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls it “a chronic neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the voluntary muscles” and “most commonly impacts young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60) but … can occur at any age, including childhood.”
    


            Seles said she'd never heard of the condition until seeing a doctor and being referred to a neurologist after noticing symptoms such as double vision and weakness in her arms — “just blowing my hair out … became very difficult,” she said — and legs.
    


            “When I got diagnosed, I was like, ‘What?!'” said Seles, who is partnering with argenx, an immunology company headquartered in the Netherlands, to promote their Go for Greater campaign. “So this is where — I can't emphasize enough — I wish I had somebody like me speak up about it.”
    


            It's been three decades since Seles returned to competition at the 1995 US Open, making it to the final, more than two years after she was attacked by a man with a knife at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany.
    


            “The way they welcomed me … after my stabbing, I will never forget,” Seles said about the fans in New York. “Those are the moments that stay with you.”
    


            She talks about learning to live a “new normal” nowadays and characterized her health as another in a series of life steps that required adapting.
    


            “I had to, in tennis terms, I guess, reset — hard reset — a few times. I call my first hard reset when I came to the US as a young 13-year-old (from Yugoslavia). Didn't speak the language; left my family. It's a very tough time. Then, obviously, becoming a great player, it's a reset, too, because the fame, money, the attention, changes (everything), and it's hard as a 16-year-old to deal with all that. Then obviously my stabbing — I had to do a huge reset,” Seles said.
    


            “And then, really, being diagnosed with myasthenia gravis: another reset. But one thing, as I tell kids that I mentor: ‘You've got to always adjust. That ball is bouncing, and you've just got to adjust,'” she added. “And that's what I'm doing now.”

            Sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson addressed her recent domestic violence arrest in a video on social media and issued an apology to her boyfriend Christian Coleman.
    


            Richardson posted a video on her Instagram account Monday night in which she said she put herself in a “compromised situation.” She issued a written apology to Coleman on Tuesday morning.
    


            “I love him & to him I can't apologize enough,” the reigning 100-meter world champion wrote in all capital letters on Instagram, adding that her apology “should be just as loud” as her “actions.”
    


            “To Christian I love you & I am so sorry,” she wrote.
    


            Richardson was arrested July 27 on a fourth-degree domestic violence offense for allegedly assaulting Coleman at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. She was booked into South Correctional Entity in Des Moines, Washington, for more than 18 hours.
    


            Her arrest was days before she ran the 100 meters at the US championships in Eugene, Oregon.
    


            In the video, Richardson said she's practicing “self-reflection” and refuses “to run away but face everything that comes to me head on.”
    


            According to the police report, an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, Coleman, the 2019 world 100-meter champion.
    


            The officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman's backpack and yank it away. Richardson then appeared to get in Coleman's way with Coleman trying to step around her. Coleman was shoved into a wall.
    


            Later in the report, it said Richardson appeared to throw an item at Coleman, with the TSA indicating it may have been headphones.
    


            The officer said in the report: “I was told Coleman did not want to participate any further in the investigation and declined to be a victim.”
    


            A message was left with Coleman from The Associated Press.
    


            Richardson wrote that Coleman “came into my life & gave me more than a relationship but a greater understanding of unconditional love from what I've experienced in my past.”
    


            She won the 100 at the 2023 world championships in Budapest and finished with the silver at the Paris Games last summer. She also helped the 4x100 relay to an Olympic gold.
    


            She didn't compete during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 following a positive marijuana test at the US Olympic trials.

Russia has already won the Ukraine conflict and it is now up to the West to acknowledge this, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said.

Orban made the remarks on Tuesday, shortly after he snubbed the latest joint EU statement in support of Ukraine issued ahead of the meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Friday in Alaska. Speaking to the ‘Patriot' YouTube channel, the Hungarian leader said he partly opposed the statement as it only made the EU look “ridiculous and pathetic.”

“When two leaders sit down to negotiate with each other, the Americans and the Russians ... and you're not invited there, you don't rush for the phone, you don't run around, you don't shout in from the outside,” Orban stated. “If you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.”  

Moscow has already won the conflict against Ukraine, the Hungarian leader added, claiming that Kiev's backers were in denial. 

“We are talking now as if this were an open-ended war situation, but it is not. The Ukrainians have lost the war. Russia has won this war,” he stressed. “The only question is when and under what circumstances will the West, who are behind the Ukrainians, admit that this has happened, and what will result from all this.”

A member of both the EU and NATO, Hungary has consistently opposed Brussels' policies on the Ukraine conflict since its escalation in February 2022, including weapons supplies to Kiev and sanctions against Russia. Budapest has also opposed the idea of Kiev joining either of the blocs. 

Relations between Budapest and Kiev have been further soured by tensions around the Hungarian ethnic minority in Western Ukraine. Last week, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Kiev has no place in the EU and “doesn't even belong among civilized nations,” citing the recent death of an ethnic Hungarian allegedly at the hands of Ukrainian draft officers.

This week's summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, will take place at the Elmendorf-Richardson military base in Anchorage, Alaska, CNN has reported, citing White House officials.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed on Tuesday that the two leaders will meet in Alaska's largest city on Friday to discuss the Ukraine conflict and bilateral issues, but declined to name the exact venue of the summit.

CNN reported several hours later that Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson has been chosen as the location as it meets the security requirements for the high-profile meeting.

The Trump administration “hoped to avoid the optics of hosting the Russian leader and his entourage on a US military installation,” but could not find a better site due to summer being the peak of the tourist season in Alaska, sources told the broadcaster.

Trump earlier described the Alaska summit as a “feel-out meeting” that will help him determine whether the Ukraine conflict can be settled. He also stressed that he sees great potential for trade with Russia, which “has a very valuable piece of land” as well as “tremendous potential… to do well.”

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Tuesday that Moscow views the meeting as a chance to mend strained relations with Washington and tackle long-running disputes. The hope is that it will “give an impulse to the normalization of bilateral relations” and help the two nations “move forward” on several issues, he said.

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the US Air Force's Elmendorf base and the US Army's Fort Richardson. Located on the northern edge of Anchorage, it currently hosts 5,000 military personnel and civilians, covering an area of 339 sq. km.

Israel's ambassador to the EU, Haim Regev, has urged the bloc to stop focusing on Israel's human rights record and has warned against taking any actions to punish the country for its military campaign in Gaza.

Israel has faced mounting backlash over the conflict, with several Western countries recently announcing plans to recognize a Palestinian state and, in some cases, reduce military or trade cooperation with Israel. 

In an interview with Politico published on Wednesday, the envoy claimed that some EU states have an “obsession” with Israel's human rights record and singled out Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, and Slovenia as the most unfair. He also accused France, Germany, and the UK of making statements that play into the hands of Hamas and anti-Semitic groups.

Regev insisted that Israel was a “dream” neighbor for the EU because it is a democracy, has no migration issues, and protects gay rights. “Israel is the only player in the region that serves directly the interests of the EU,” he added.

The envoy warned that attempts by EU states to exert pressure on Israel over Gaza “will never work” and would only damage relations and weaken the bloc's influence in the Middle East. He noted that moves to suspend Israel's participation in EU research programs or cut trade would make it difficult to see the EU “playing any role” in the region in the future.

Regev claimed that Europe is “going back to the old days” when anti-Semitism was common, adding that being a Jew in Europe is “not safe” now.

The Gaza war broke out in 2023 when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives. Since then, Israeli forces have killed more than 61,000 people in the enclave, according to recent estimates. 

The UN has reported “mounting evidence” of famine, with spokeswoman Olga Cherevko warning that “the lives of over 2 million people are at stake.” Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 200 people, including 98 children, have already died from malnutrition.

MOSCOW, August 13. /TASS/. The leadership of the European Commission is aiming to achieve regime change in Budapest, which Brussels perceives as an obstacle to a ""united Europe,"" as follows from a statement by the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), received by TASS.

""The European Commission is aiming for a change of power in Hungary,"" the press release reads. ""The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation informs that, according to the information coming to the SVR, the European Commission perceives Hungary's current leadership as an increasingly serious obstacle to a united Europe.""

The press bureau noted that ""Brussels is outraged by the attempts of Budapest to pursue independent policy and influence collective decision-making, primarily on Russia and Ukraine.""

""Hungary's recent decision to veto the new seven-year EU budget project, which Budapest believes is designed for the militarization of Europe and preparation for war with Moscow, has become the last straw that made the euro-bureaucrats lose their patience,"" the SVR added.

According to the SVR, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is seriously studying Hungary's regime change scenarios.

She sees the leader of the opposition party Respect and Freedom, Peter Magyar, who is loyal to the globalist elites, as the main candidate for the post of head of government, the press bureau added.

""The European Commission expects to bring him to power in the parliamentary elections in the spring of 2026, ""if not sooner.""

The SVR drew attention to the fact that ""significant material, administrative, media, and lobbying resources have been mobilized to support Magyar. German party funds, a number of Norwegian human rights NGOs, as well as the European People's Party (EPP) are ready to provide financial support.""

""Kiev, ‘offended' by Budapest's blocking of Ukraine's EU integration process, has actively joined the campaign to ‘dismantle' the Hungarian government on orders from Brussels.

Mendenhall Glacier outburst threatens homes, with scientists warning events are intensifying

Alaska's capital city of Juneau is urging many residents to evacuate, bracing for the arrival of what could be record floodwaters flowing downstream from a basin dammed by the area's Mendenhall Glacier, with the event being driven by climate change amid glacial retreat, according to a federal agency.

Summer glacial flooding, known as a glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF, threatens parts of the city due to a combination of rainwater and snowmelt.

Authorities say flooding from the Mendenhall River will probably crest around 4pm Alaska time, or 8pm ET on Wednesday. They hope that recently installed emergency flood barriers will hold back the waters and protect Mendenhall valley, where a majority of Juneau's 32,000 full-time residents live.

On Tuesday morning, authorities confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam, with flooding expected into Wednesday. Some Juneau residents in the flood zone have already evacuated as officials intensified their warnings on Tuesday, saying “Don't wait, Evacuate TONIGHT.”

The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Juneau said in an X post late on Tuesday that local hydrologists had adjusted their Mendenhall flooding forecast, anticipating that the river would crest at over 16ft on Wednesday morning.

Nicole Ferrin, with the NWS, said during a briefing on Tuesday that the flood warning was issued after “a lot of analysis” but the calculations were complicated by rainfall causing significant rising of the lake and river and confirmed that a sub-glacial release had occurred.
  “This will be a new record based on all of the information we have,” Ferrin said, according to the Juneau Empire.

The Mendenhall Glacier fills a large valley north of Juneau, creating an ice dam for a meltwater lake that fills Suicide Basin. Since 2011, outburst floods from the depression have been pouring into Mendenhall Lake and rushing down the river toward Juneau each year.

But the annual Mendenhall glacial lake outburst flood is judged to be intensifying as a result of climate change.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (Noaa), said in a statement that Alaska had warmed twice as fast as the rest of the US over the last several decades.

Over the last century Alaska's average annual temperature has risen 3.1 degrees fahrenheit and the overall trend continues to increase, according to data from Noaa's National Centers for Environmental Information.

Scientists have attributed the retreat, melting and thinning of glaciers over the last century to Earth's warming climate. Alaska's glaciers are among the fastest-melting glaciers on Earth and have been in steep decline since the late 1980s, according to the Alaska Climate Science Center.

On the record amounts of water now threatening Juneau, Rick Thoman, Alaska climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told Climate.gov, Noaa reported: “Without climate change, there is no reason to think that this would be happening on the Mendenhall Glacier, then in the lake, and downriver.”

An outburst in August 2023 sent record amounts of water into Mendenhall Lake and down Mendenhall River toward Juneau, inundating areas that had not experienced flooding before, the NWS office in Juneau said at the time, causing significant erosion.

The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from Juneau and considered a popular tourist attraction. Juneau lies 800 miles from Anchorage, where Donald Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, are due to meet on Friday to discuss the war in Ukraine.

Flooding from the glacier has become an annual concern for almost 15 years, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes.

It is blamed on the retreat of a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier – a casualty of the heating climate – and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer.

When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the blue ice Mendenhall glacier.

The Mendenhall was originally named Sitaantaagu (“the Glacier Behind the Town”) or Aak'wtaaksit (“the Glacier Behind the Little Lake”) by the Tlingit Indians, but later called Auke (Auk) Glacier, for the Auk Kwaan band of Tlingit Indians, by naturalist John Muir. It was renamed in 1892 for Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, who had helped determine the boundary between Canada and Alaska. It is considered a relic of the little ice age that lasted until the mid-18th century and is now receding at about 100 to 150 feet a year.

Robert Sullivan, 61, on ‘personal leave' after Heather Jones, now 33, brought allegations, sexual in nature, to diocese

A Roman Catholic priest in Alabama is under investigation, church officials say – and he abruptly announced he is taking “personal leave” – after a woman alleged to his superiors that he traded financial support for “private companionship” including sex, beginning when she was 17.

The accuser, Heather Jones, has also alleged that the clergyman, Robert Sullivan, recently paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars to remain silent about it, a claim she supported with bank records, an email and a copy of a legal agreement.

Jones, 33, provided the Guardian with a formal written statement that contained her allegations against Sullivan, 61, and which she provided to the diocese of Birmingham.

She said she came forward because Sullivan had continued working closely with families and their children as the pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows church in Homewood, Alabama, leaving her fearful that “others may be vulnerable to the same type of manipulation and exploitation” she says she endured.

Jones gave permission to be publicly identified by name, saying she hoped it would boost the credibility of her account.

Birmingham diocese spokesperson Donald Carson said on Tuesday that the allegations against Sullivan were under investigation by an independent review board advising the local church. As was its protocol, Carson said, the diocese had forwarded the allegations to the Vatican entity which investigates cases of clergy misconduct.

And Carson said Sullivan would be prohibited from public ministry until the resolution of the allegations against him.

Voicemails the diocese left with Jones – and which she shared with the Guardian – offered her free therapeutic counseling.

It was not immediately clear how much scrutiny Sullivan might draw from lay authorities. Carson said the diocese had reported Sullivan to the Alabama state agency that investigates child abuse cases because of the age Jones said she was when she met him. But officials at Alabama's department of human resources had said the case did not fit the criteria of one in which they could get involved.

Law enforcement investigators have been reluctant to act in some cases of religious clergy accused of having sexual contact with teens who had reached the legal age of consent, which in Alabama is 16. Furthermore, Alabama is not among the US states with laws that say it is impossible for there to be consensual sexual relationships between clergy and legal adults who are under the clerics' spiritual guidance.

Sullivan could, however, face consequences within the Catholic church. Canon law to which clergymen are subject has considered people younger than 18 to be minors – and sexual contact with them to be abusive – since the early 2000s, when the worldwide Catholic church implemented reforms amid the fallout of a decades-old clerical molestation scandal.

Multiple attempts by the Guardian to contact Sullivan for comment were not successful Tuesday.

As she wrote in her statement to the diocese in late July and recounted to the Guardian more recently, Jones grew up in foster care after being removed from her mother's custody “due to severe neglect”. She wrote that she lacked “consistent adult support” during her upbringing, leaving her ill-equipped to maintain employment or pursue a formal education – so she tried to make ends meet by working as a dancer at an “adult establishment” outside Birmingham.

Jones reported meeting Sullivan at that establishment when she was 17. He was a regular patron, tipped her during her shifts and soon offered to “help change [her] life” if she called him on his phone number, she wrote.

Sullivan proposed “to form an ongoing relationship that would include financial support in exchange for private companionship”, wrote Jones, who told the Guardian that the term encompassed sex. Jones said Sullivan subsequently began taking her shopping, dining, drinking, and to hotel rooms in at least six different Alabama cities in part to engage in sex – beginning when she was 17 and over the course of several years.

Jones wrote that she “was a minor with no experience navigating adult relationships” when she met Sullivan. She wrote: “I was hesitant but ultimately agreed due to his persistence and the state [of mind] I was in.”

Jones said Sullivan bought her a phone on which he frequently contacted her. He initially presented himself as a “doctor”, though she later learned he was a priest while his brother was a physician, she said.

She wrote in her statement that discovering Sullivan belonged to the Catholic priesthood – whose members promise to be abstinent and teach that sex out of wedlock is sinful – was disturbing because she had attended church services throughout her youth and had difficulty reconciling “his public role and private behavior”.

Sullivan paid for Jones to attend a rehabilitation program after she experienced depression, emotional instability and addiction during their arrangement, she wrote.

Jones wrote that Sullivan and an attorney representing him eventually had her sign a non-disclosure agreement in return for $273,000.

She shared an unsigned copy of the NDA with the Guardian. She also provided a copy of a 27 March message from Sullivan's Our Lady of Sorrows email address, which had the sentence: “Someone will be calling you to sign the NDA.”

Four days after that email, bank records which she shared with the Guardian showed, Jones received a wire transfer of $136,500 from an account under the name of the attorney's law office. She received another $136,500 wire transfer from the same law office account a day later, the bank records indicated.

Separately, in more than 125 different transactions from 18 July 2024 to 26 March, a Venmo account under Sullivan's name paid nearly $120,000 to Jones, according to a copy of records from the financial app that Jones shared with the Guardian.

Jones said it was never clear whether Sullivan took that money out of his personal finances, and remembered wondering whether it possibly came from some other source. Jones said he gave her the Venmo money of his own accord to aid her in covering her living expenses. Jones recalled Sullivan telling her he was also happy to give her that money because he loved her – and so did Jesus Christ.

Jones wrote that she later proposed to revise the NDA with Sullivan and requested $100,000 more. She said the agreement “heavily favored his interests and offered no meaningful protection, healing or justice” for dealings with Sullivan she had come to regard as “exploitative and predatory”.

Sullivan and his attorney ignored her, Jones wrote. She provided her statement to the Birmingham diocese a few days after writing it on 23 July. Jones said she was willing to share phone records and pictures which she contended would corroborate her version of events with church investigators if they sought the materials.

At Our Lady of Sorrows' 3 August mass, Sullivan told his congregants that Birmingham bishop Steven Raica had authorized him to take “personal leave” that he requested after “prayer and reflection”.

“Please continue to remember me in your prayers – as I will do the same for you,” Sullivan said shortly before the conclusion of the mass.

On 10 August, Birmingham diocese vicar general Kevin Bazzel told congregants that Raica had appointed him as Our Lady of Sorrows' temporary administrator in Sullivan's absence.

Sullivan had in June celebrated the 32nd anniversary of his ordination into the priesthood. He had also served six years as president of Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic high school and in 2023 was appointed director of its educational foundation, as the local Homewood Star newspaper previously reported.

He announced his leave nearly four years after Raica had appointed him to serve as one of the diocese's vicars general, a high-ranking administrative post.

In 2020, Sullivan had appeared on the ABC show Good Morning America, in which he discussed recovering from Covid with a helping hand from his brother, an infectious diseases doctor.

Jones said she recently began law school and defied the NDA mentioned in her statement about Sullivan to the Birmingham diocese – which has an estimated membership of roughly a quarter of a million Catholics – because she was confident it would not hold up in court.

She also wrote that she considered it vital to speak out about Sullivan because “behind closed doors, his behavior toward me was not in alignment with the values he teaches”.

Carson, the Birmingham diocese spokesperson, said the allegations against Sullivan were “unfortunate for all involved”.

“We keep father … Sullivan and the woman who's making the allegations here certainly in our prayers,” Carson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

They aren't related to whales, but take their name due to their enormous size. At full maturity, whale sharks measure around nine or 10 meters long and can weigh from 15,000 to 40,000 kilograms. Whale sharks live in warm waters, with about 75% of them found in the Indo-Pacific region. They can migrate thousands of kilometers to different feeding grounds, but at a slow speed of 5 km/h on average.
  Whale sharks have a broad, flat head and are typically brown or gray in color. Their distinguishing characteristic

Whale shark reproduction has long been a mystery for scientists. However, a significant discovery in 1995 off the eastern coast of Taiwan provided valuable insights. Researchers examined a pregnant female of the species and found over 300 embryos inside her body, ranging from about 40 to 60 cm in length. This discovery revealed that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. Instead of laying eggs in the ocean, the mother carries them internally until they hatch, giving birth to fully developed live young. Since the eggs don't hatch all at once, embryos at different stages of development can all exist within

Editor's note: The story is being updated.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Berlin on Aug. 13 to meet German Chancellor Friedrich Merz before talks with U.S. and European leaders.

Suspilne, Ukraine's public broadcaster, released footage of Zelensky arriving in Germany by plane ahead of upcoming high-level meetings.

Zelensky and Merz will hold a bilateral meeting before joining a video conference with European leaders, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and U.S. President Donald Trump, spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov has said. 

The German government said the call between Zelensky, Trump, and European leaders is expected to take place at 2 p.m. local time, according to Reuters. A separate call with Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and European leaders is expected an hour later, according to the news agency.

The talks will take place just two days before Trump's planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since the start of Trump's second term. 

Trump has described the Alaska talks as a ""feel-out"" meeting in his efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. He has said both Kyiv and Moscow would need to cede territory to reach a deal, a stance that has alarmed European capitals and Kyiv. 

An undisclosed source familiar with U.S. deliberations told Reuters that it is possible that Trump might attempt to strike a deal directly with Putin without involving Ukraine or Europe.

In a press conference on Aug. 11, Trump confirmed Zelensky would not attend the Alaska meeting with Putin, saying ""he wasn't part of it."" Trump added that he ultimately intends to bring the Ukrainian and Russian presidents together, either with him present or not.

Putin has publicly demanded a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership and a full withdrawal from partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as a precondition for talks. 

Zelensky has rejected recognizing the Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory and ceding additional land, calling for a ceasefire as the first step toward peace negotiations, a position supported by Kyiv's European allies.

Zelensky's spokesperson also said an online meeting of the ""coalition of the willing"" will take place later in the day. According to the German government, the meeting is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. local time and will focus on support plans for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.

According to Reuters, the sequence of talks on Aug. 13 will give Zelensky and European leaders a chance to present a united front before Trump's meeting with Putin. Ukraine hopes the call with Trump will serve, at least in part, as a counterweight to the Alaska summit.

Zelensky said he has held over 30 consultations with international partners over the past few days to discuss perspectives on ending the war.

""Pressure must be exerted on Russia for the sake of a just peace. Ukraine's and our partners' experience must be used to prevent deception by Russia,"" he said on X.

""At present, there is no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war. Our coordinated efforts and joint actions – of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, and all countries that seek peace – can definitely compel Russia to make peace.""

Five undisclosed senior European officials told Reuters that they ""see a risk"" of an unfavourable deal for Europe and Ukraine's security at the Aug. 15 meeting.

President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who offered to host future peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey.

The Aug. 12 call came just days before U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet Aug. 15 in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine — without Ukraine's participation.

During the phone call, which both sides reported on social media, Zelensky and Erdogan discussed the ""current diplomatic situation"" — likely referring to the Trump-Putin summit — and the opportunities it presents.

""President Erdogan clearly stated that any negotiations without Ukraine will not bring lasting peace. We equally understand all the risks and threats,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram.

Zelensky also noted that Erdogan expressed readiness to host a summit involving Ukraine, the United States, Russia, and Turkey. 

The Turkish president's office said the call was made at Ukraine's request and covered bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues. Erdogan said he valued the progress made in earlier Ukraine-Russia talks in Istanbul and hoped for meaningful results in the next rounds toward a ceasefire.

Zelensky has sought to rally support from Kyiv's allies in the days since the Trump-Putin summit — and Trump's proposed ""land swap"" – were first announced.

To that end, European leaders issued a joint statement on Aug. 11, affirming their support for Ukraine and stressing that ""international borders must not be changed by force"" and ""the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.""

Google rolled out its AI Overview feature last year.Jeff Chiu/The Associated Press

News publishers say the AI-generated summaries that now top many Google search results are cutting into their online traffic – and experts are still flagging concerns about the summaries' accuracy as they warn the internet itself is being reshaped.

When Google rolled out its AI Overview feature last year, its mistakes – including one suggestion to use glue to make pizza toppings stick better – made headlines. One expert warns concerns about the accuracy of the feature's output won't necessarily go away as the technology improves.

“It's one of those very sweeping technological changes that has changed the way we . . . search, and therefore live our lives, without really much of a big public discussion,” said Jessica Johnson, a senior fellow at McGill University's Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy.

“As a journalist and as a researcher, I have concerns about the accuracy.”

Google's unleashes ‘A.I. Mode' in the next phase of its journey to change search engine

While users have flagged mistakes in the AI-powered summaries, there is no academic research out there yet defining the extent of the problem. A report released by the BBC earlier this year examining AI chatbots from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity found “significant inaccuracies” in their summaries of news stories, although it did not look at Google AI Overviews specifically.

In small font at the bottom of its AI summaries, Google warns users that “AI responses may include mistakes.”

The company maintains the accuracy of the AI summaries is on par with other search features, like those that provide featured snippets. 

“As people use AI Overviews, we see they're happier with their results, and they come to Google to even ask more of their questions,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “The vast majority of AI Overviews are highly factual and we've continued to make improvements to both the helpfulness and quality of responses.”

Chirag Shah, a professor at the University of Washington's information school specializing in AI and online search, said the error rate is due to how AI systems work.

Generative AI doesn't understand concepts the way people do. Instead, it works by making predictions based on massive amounts of training data. Shah said that “no checking” takes place after the systems retrieve the information from documents and before they generate the results.

“What if those documents are flawed?” he said. “What if some of them have wrong information, outdated information, satire, sarcasm?”

A human being would know that someone who suggests adding glue to a pizza is telling a joke, he said, but an artificial intelligence system would not.

It's a “fundamental problem” that can't be solved by “more computation and more data and more time,” Shah said – and better technology could actually make the problem worse.

“If anything, I worry that they will get so good . . . people will get comfortable enough with them that we will just trust them beyond what their abilities are,” he said.

He said online searches in general are changing in a fundamental way. As Google integrates AI into its popular search function, other AI companies' generative AI systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are acting as search engines themselves.

Canadian CEOs are embracing generative AI's speed and efficiency. The impact on their employees is less certain

Search engines were designed originally to help users find their way around the internet, Shah said, but now the goal of those who design online platforms and services is to get the user to stay in the same system.

“If that gets consolidated . . . that's essentially the end of the free web,” he said. “I think this is a fundamental and a very significant shift in the way not just the search but the web, the internet operates. And that should concern us all.”

A study by the Pew Research Center from earlier this year found users were less likely to click on a link when their search resulted in an AI summary. While users clicked on a link 15 per cent of the time in response to a traditional search result, they only clicked on a link eight per cent of the time if an AI summary was included.

That's cause for alarm for news publishers, both in Canada and abroad.

Paul Deegan is CEO of News Media Canada, which represents Canadian news publishers. He said the AI summaries are acting as a drag on news media outlets' online engagement.

“Zero clicks is zero revenue for the publisher,” Deegan said.

Alfred Hermida, a professor at the University of British Columbia's journalism school, said Google used to be a major source of traffic for news outlets.

“People would search for something on the web, find a link to a news story and think, oh, that sounds interesting, I'll click and read it. Of course, if you have an AI summary, it's done that for you,” he explained.

“When you have most people who are casual news consumers . . . that AI summary may be enough.”

Last month, a group of independent publishers submitted a complaint to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority saying that AI overviews are causing them significant harm.

Keldon Bester, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Monopoly Project, said there is a competition issue at play and there could “potentially” be a case under Canadian law.

He noted that Google has been hit with competition cases in the past, including one which saw the company lose an antitrust suit brought forward by the U.S. Department of Justice over its dominance in search.

“We have a single company which is and has been the front door to the internet,” Bester said. “As we appear to move to this kind of narrowing approach, whether that's AI summaries or chatbot interactions, it really is in my mind just another iteration of those same concerns.”

In a post last week, Google's head of search Liz Reid said “organic click volume” from searches to websites has been “relatively stable year-over-year.”

Reid said that pattern contradicts “third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic – often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search.”

She said Google cares “passionately – perhaps more than any other company – about the health of the web ecosystem.”

Clifton van der Linden, an associate professor and director of the Digital Society Lab at McMaster University, noted many AI summaries are accurate.

“I think the reason you're seeing these rapidly changing dynamics in referral traffic is in part because users do find these AI-generated summaries useful . . . but useful does not necessarily equate to credible, authoritative, or correct,” he said.

He said that if users bypass a link to a news site due to an AI-generated summary, that “compounds an existing problem” in Canadian media, which is dealing with a ban on news links on Facebook and Instagram.

Justin Trudeau's Liberal government passed the Online News Act in 2023 to require Meta and Google to compensate news publishers for the use of their content. In response, Meta blocked news content from its platforms in Canada, while Google has started making payments under the legislation.

The future of that legislation seems uncertain. Prime Minister Mark Carney indicated last week he is open to repealing it.

Johnson said Canadian media has now experienced a “one-two punch” – first from Meta pulling news links and now from the emergence of AI search engines.

“The point is, and other publishers have raised this, what's the point of me producing this work if no one's going to pay for it, and they might not even see it?”

In Florida alone, around half a million Canadians own property, from houses and condos to RV sites People walk along the beach in Surfside, Fla. in December, 2024.Lynne Sladky/The Associated Press

Prior Smith is the host of Canada Calling, a radio show based in Lakefield, Ont., that broadcasts winter-season Canadian news and commentary to Florida, the U.S. Sunbelt and beyond.

Way back in the early 1950s, Toronto CBC radio broadcaster Dave Price came up with a really good idea.

As the story goes, he and several friends were sitting on the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., soaking up the sun in late winter while watching spring training for the Toronto Maple Leafs (the Triple-A International League baseball team that moved to Louisville, Ky., in 1967, not the National Hockey League squad whose most recent Stanley Cup win came that same year.) They were trying, without success, to get the results of the previous night's Maple Leafs game (the aforementioned hockey team) when one of the guys in the group turned to Dave. “You're in the radio business,” his friend said. “Put a show on down here...the place is wall-to-wall with Canadians.” And so, on Jan. 4, 1954, he did just that, launching a daily winter-season program called Canada Calling.

Over the years, the numbers of Canadians who winter in Florida kept growing and growing. Mr. Price expanded his broadcast coverage throughout the state to the point that the show could be heard daily in every traditional destination for Canadian travellers, from Panama City Beach and Key West to Vero Beach and Tampa Bay. 

Opinion: Will life ever go back to normal for Canadians in Florida?

I came onto the scene in 1977, and the Canada Calling tradition hasn't missed a day (with the exception of the 2020-21 winter of COVID-19) in 71 years.

As the host of the daily show for 48 winter seasons, I've had a ringside seat to the Canadian winter-visitor market. As Dave Price learned back in the early 50s, it didn't take me long to figure out that one of the biggest Canadian radio markets each day of each winter isn't in Canada – it's in Florida!

Travel numbers vary from year to year. An estimated 3.2 million Canadians spent time in Florida in 2024, and reportedly infused more than US$6-billion into the Florida economy. Even though visits from Canadians represent only about two per cent of the state's annual tourist business, we're still a big deal in Florida and in other traditional vacation spots “down south”: in places like South Carolina, Texas's Rio Grande Valley, Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona, and Southern California, Canadians add hundreds of thousands of visits to that total and billions more in revenue to the U.S. economy.

In Florida alone, around half a million Canadians own property, from houses and condos to RV sites. In fact, when it comes to foreign buyers of Florida real estate, we've been number one for years! We buy even though it's an expensive undertaking, given the increased costs of just about everything in recent years including property insurance (if you can even get it in the wake of one costly and devastating storm after another) and condo maintenance fees that have surged since the deadly collapse of the Champlain Towers South building in the Miami suburb of Surfside four years ago. Then, there's that's nagging 70-cent-Canadian-dollar thing, even if tough conversion rates didn't seem to hold Canadians back before, when there was an opportunity to get away from nasty weather for a few days or weeks. Florida may have been a cheap place to visit for years, but no longer. 

And while Florida has been welcoming, you now need to capably stickhandle around the political reality of the Donald Trump-Ron DeSantis ecosystem. The Florida Governor even recently mocked Canadians and their boycott – though he cited a report that predated the trade war. “Maybe they wanted to get a glimpse of what a Stanley Cup-winning hockey team actually looks like,” he said. 

Canadian retirees in the U.S. take flight from RV parks amid tensions, new requirements

For a long time, Canadians' southward travel has been taken for granted, and Florida has done little in the scheme of things to attract our business. As the state's tourism marketing director once told me, “When the weather gets lousy up there they'll be here...we just leave the door open.” Many Floridians I've encountered have no clue about anything related to Canada. It's nothing personal – we're simply not on their radar. From their perspective, it's just good news that year after year we keep showing up by the millions, leaving behind billions, and returning home come mid-April.

But this March, I started hearing something I've never heard before: one Canadian after another cancelling their plans for a trip south in response to Mr. Trump's annoying and repeated “51st state” rhetoric, his ridicule of Canada's former prime minister, and his threats to Canada's economy. Many who were already down south were packing up and leaving early, and others still were putting their properties up for sale, only to discover it's not exactly a seller's market right now. 

We're in the middle of the summer now. It's the time when Canadians start thinking about making winter travel, lease and rental arrangements. But trying to figure out what the White House and an erratic President are going to do next is a mug's game. Given all that's unfolded in terms of Canada-U.S. relations over the past six months, travel to and from the U.S. has declined. The Buy Canadian movement and travel within Canada are all the rage. Canadian airlines are reading the tea leaves and easing back their schedules to the southern U.S. while boosting frequency to warm-weather destinations in other countries. 

It's not clear yet whether we're in this for the long haul. Will thousands of Canadians continue to leave their properties sitting empty or in a rental pool as a matter of principle? Will Canadians' RVs stay here, parked all winter, at significant cost to them? Will “mean and nasty” Canadians (as Mr. Trump described us in July) abruptly change what they've been doing for decades and pass up the seasonal relationships they've had with American friends? Will the billions in Canadian tourist dollars normally spent in the southern U.S. each winter go somewhere else?

I suspect we'll know the answers to those questions soon. Winter is coming.

An international coalition of foreign ministers has condemned the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, calling for Israel to allow vital aid into the besieged enclave.

This blog is now closed. Here is a roundup of developments in the Middle East on Tuesday, August 12.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on Israel to allow it to restock urgently needed medical supplies in the Gaza Strip before any Israeli plans to ""take over"" Gaza City exacerbate an already ""catastrophic"" health emergency.

""We want to quickly stock up hospitals following the whole discussion about [a further] incursion into Gaza,"" said Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories.

""We need to be able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in [but] we currently cannot do that,"" he continued. ""We hear all about [Israeli claims that] 'more humanitarian supplies are allowed in' … well, it's not happening yet. Or [at least] it's happening at way too slow a pace.""

Over half of the Gaza health system's medicines are running at zero stock, Peeperkorn told the AFP news agency, speaking from Jerusalem, blaming the Israeli authorities' ""cumbersome procedures"" for preventing the entry of vital drugs into the enclave.

According to Peeperkorn, only 50% of hospitals and 38% of primary health care centers are operating at all, and none to full functionality. In northern Gaza, he said bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the Al-Shifa hospital and 300% in the Al-Ahli Hospital.

""The overall health situation remains catastrophic,"" he said, saying that nearly 12,000 children under five were found to be suffering from acute malnutrition in July. ""Hunger and malnutrition continue to ravage Gaza.""

The Council of Europe — a human rights organization representing 46 countries but not affiliated with the European Union 

— has urged its members to halt deliveries of weapons to Israel ""where there is a risk that they may be used to commit human rights violations.""

The call comes shortly after Germany said it would authorize no military equipment exports that can be used in the Gaza Strip.

Michael O'Flaherty, the Council's commissioner for human rights, said member states should do ""their utmost to prevent and address violations of international human rights"" in the ongoing conflict.

He also said it was ""essential to intensify efforts to provide relief to those affected by the conflict, by supporting efforts to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian assistance and by pressing for the immediate release of [Israeli] hostages.""

The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which launched a deadly surprise incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting the ongoing Israeli retaliation, is still holding around 50 Israelis hostage, around 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that the plan to target the remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza City is ""the best way to end the war.""

But several world leaders have condemned the decision to widen the war, fearing it will result in even further displacement, destruction and death for the Palestinian civilian population, not to mention danger for Israeli troops and hostages.

Gaza's shattered healthcare system is stretched beyond its limits and its personnel pushed to the brink of exhaustion, according to Dr. Mohammed Fadlalla from Doctors Without Borders (MSF). He describes facilities as ""overrun with patients.""

The strain is compounded by the fact that medical staff are enduring the same hardships as their patients, he told DW.

""Everybody is hungry, nobody has eaten the day before, everybody is losing weight, everybody is exhausted and burnt out, and they're still working,"" Fadlalla said, noting that it has become ""routine"" for medical staff to share stories of loved ones lost in the war.

""The only difference between the staff and the patients is that the doctors and nurses haven't been shot yet,"" he said.

Dr. Fadlalla also conveyed the deep frustration expressed by his Palestinian colleagues, who feel increasingly abandoned by the international community.

""We're losing hope in America,"" he said. ""Somebody needs to step up and and stop what's going on.""

The doctor said the United States has the ""power to stop and influence this"" and begged President Donald Trump to ""step up.""

Spanish doctor Raul Incertis volunteered for four months in Gaza, working at the Al Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.

He describes to DW the conditions inside the hospital as it was overwhelmed by mass casualties, including young children and civilians he claims were targeted intentionally by the Israeli military.

Israel's ambassador to Germany has said that diplomatic relations between the two countries have been ""strained"" by Berlin's decision to partially halt arms exports.

""This is a cause for celebration for Hamas,"" Ron Prosor told Welt TV after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced a pause in the authorization of weapons exports to Israel that could be used offensively and cause further civilian suffering Gaza.

Merz made the decision in response to much-criticized Israeli plans to expand military operations in the besieged enclave by fully occupying Gaza City.

Ambassador Prosor accepted that critics could take issue with the Israeli strategy but said leaving Israel ""without defense, without weapons"" meant leaving the state ""defenseless.""

For clarification: Merz stressed that the German export restrictions do not affect equipment required for Israel's self-defense, such as air and naval defense systems; only offensive weaponry.

A group of 26 foreign ministers have once again condemned the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and called for immediate action to combat hunger and starvation.

""The humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels,"" read a statement signed by the foreign ministers of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Later on Tuesday, the EU sent an updated statement that included Italy and Latvia as signatories. Germany did not sign the statement.

""Famine is unfolding before our eyes. Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation. Humanitarian space must be protected, and aid should never be politicized,"" the ministers stressed.

The statement, which was also signed by European Union figures, criticized ""restrictive new registration requirements"" which it said were preventing international NGOs from distributing aid.

""We call on the government of Israel to provide authorization for all international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating,"" it read.

The signatories called for a ""ceasefire that can end the war, for hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered.""

Hello and welcome to DW's coverage of developments in the Middle East on Tuesday, August 12.

A group of 24 foreign ministers from around the world have called for urgent action as the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip continues to deteriorate as a result of Israeli restrictions on aid.

The Balochistan Liberation Army and its Majeed Brigade have carried out several separatist attacks. The US designations follow a recent trade agreement between the US and Pakistan.

The United States on Tuesday officially designated Pakistan's Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its armed wing, the Majeed Brigade, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO).

Washington said the group is responsible for deadly attacks in Balochistan, including a train hijacking in March that killed 31 people.

""Today's action taken by the Department of State demonstrates the Trump administration's commitment to countering terrorism,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Pakistan welcomed the designation on Tuesday.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but least populated province, home to the Sunni Muslim ethnic minority known as the Baloch.

Separatists have fought since the early 2000s for autonomy and a greater share of the region's rich natural resources. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is the largest militant group operating in the province.

In March, the BLA claimed responsibility for an attack on a train traveling from Quetta to Peshawar, killing 31 civilians and security personnel and holding more than 300 passengers hostage.

Pakistan says it has quelled the insurgency, but violence continues in Balochistan. Troops killed 50 militants in the Zhob district over the past week, according to the military.

On Monday, at least nine Pakistani soldiers were killed when dozens of militants attacked a police station and border force compound in southwestern Balochistan.

""Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counterterrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security,"" Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

The US first labeled the BLA a terrorist group in 2019. Now, it has formally designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization — a move analysts say will tighten scrutiny of its supporters in the US and Europe.

The designation coincides with a visit to Washington by Pakistan's army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir. It also comes less than two weeks after the US and Pakistan signed a trade agreement expected to allow American firms to help develop Pakistan's largely untapped oil reserves in resource-rich Balochistan.

French President Emmanuel Macron has acknowledged the violence committed by French troops as Cameroon fought for its independence. It comes as African leaders reassess France's ongoing presence on the continent.

French President Emmanuel Macron admitted his country used ""repressive violence"" in Cameroon during the 1950s, as the West African nation fought for its independence.

In a letter sent to Cameroonian counterpart Paul Biya last month, Macron acknowledged the actions of French colonial troops.

The letter was made public by Macron's office on Tuesday, and comes at a time when France's current presence in its former African colonies has become increasingly contested.

This comes following an official report, commissioned by France in 2022, which found that France used mass forced displacement, pushed scores of Cameroonians into internment camps and supported militias known for their brutality, all with the purpose of battling the country's aspiration for independence.

The report was compiled by a 14-person committee made of French and Cameroonian historians who looked at France's role in Cameroon between 1945 and 1971, noting that the French army's repressive measures continued after the country's independence in 1960.

""The historians of the commission made it very clear that there was a war in Cameroon, during which the colonial authorities and the French army carried out repressive violence of several kinds that continued after 1960,"" Macron said in the letter.

""It is incumbent on me today to accept France's role and responsibility in these events.""

The French president also acknowledged France's role in the death of Cameroonian leaders Ruben Um Nyobe, Paul Momo, Isaac Nyobe Pandjock and Jeremie Ndelene, all of whom were killed between 1958 and 1960 in French-commanded military operations.

France's repressive measures in the fight against Cameroon's independence cost ""tens of thousands of lives,"" Macron said.

Most parts of Cameroon came under French rule in World War I, after the country's previous colonial ruler, Germany, suffered a defeat in the war. The rest of the country was colonized by Britain.

Cameroon started pushing for independence during World War II, with France reacting with repression and violence, the report said.

The report is part of Macron's push for France to come to terms with its own colonial history, even though many argue his moves do not go far enough.

A report released in 2021 found that France bore ""overwhelming responsibilities"" in the Rwandan genocide that took place in 1994, while a 2020 report looked in to France's role during Algeria's war of independence, ending up calling for a ""truth commission"" and other measures.

Macron ruled out officially apologizing for the abuses carried out by French soldiers in Algeria.

			US president armed with money-making opportunities to encourage Russia to end Ukrainian war

Donald Trump is preparing to offer Vladimir Putin access to rare earth minerals to incentivise him to end the war in Ukraine.

The US president will arrive at the much-anticipated meeting with his Russian counterpart on Friday armed with a number of money-making opportunities for Putin.

They will include opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow and lifting some of the American sanctions on Russia's aviation industry, The Telegraph can reveal.

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is understood to be among administration figures briefing Mr Trump ahead of his sit-down with Putin in Anchorage. Mr Bessent is exploring the economic trade-offs the US can make with Russia in order to expedite a ceasefire agreement.

Proposals include giving Putin access to the rare earth minerals in the Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia.

Mr Trump said Putin would face “severe consequences” if he did not agree to end the war in Ukraine during their meeting on Friday.

The US leader revealed his intention to seek an immediate second meeting with Putin, this time involving Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, after their one-on-one talks in Alaska.

Mr Trump said: “If the first one goes okay, we'll have a quick second one. I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they'd like to have me there.”

Mr Zelensky said Mr Trump supported security guarantees for Ukraine.

The two leaders attended a virtual summit along with other European leaders on Wednesday.

“There should be security guarantees,” Mr Zelensky said at a press conference alongside Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor. “President Trump said that he supports this and America's readiness to take part.”

Sir Keir Starmer said his so-called “coalition of the willing” was ready to implement a ceasefire plan as soon as a peace deal was agreed.

The plans “are now ready in a form that can be used if we get to that ceasefire”, the Prime Minister said, adding that “real progress” on security guarantees for Ukraine had been made.

European leaders, including French president Emmanuel Macron, said the calls with the US president were “positive”.

Putin is “bluffing” when he says “he does not care about the sanctions and that they're not working”, Mr Zelensky added.

Ukraine is thought to hold 10 per cent of the world's reserves of lithium, used in the production of batteries.

Two of its largest lithium deposits are in areas held by Russia, and Putin has staked his claim to the valuable minerals found in the regions his forces occupy.

“There are a range of incentives, in which a potential mineral/rare earth deal could be one,” a source with knowledge of the proposals told The Telegraph.

In May, the US signed a rare earth mineral deal with Kyiv, allowing it to exploit Ukraine's ample natural resources. Washington will need to establish new mining operations, which could be accelerated by Russian co-operation.

The president's America First policy has seen him strike several mineral deals since his return to the Oval Office, most notably with Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

After Olzhas Bektenov, the Kazakhstani prime minister, visited the White House, the State Department said it was “looking forward to working with Kazakhstan to deepen economic ties in... critical minerals sectors”.

Other incentives include lifting export bans on parts and equipment needed to service Russian planes, swathes of which have fallen into disrepair.

Western countries have restricted Moscow's access to crucial spare components and other equipment since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, forcing airlines and the military to cannibalise old aircraft for replacement parts.

Nearly 30 per cent of Russia's western-made planes, cut off from maintenance, could be grounded within the next five years, Sergei Chemezov, the head of Rostec, Russia's state-owned defence conglomerate, suggested this year.

Lifting sanctions on Russian aircraft could prove lucrative for American manufacturer Boeing.

With a fleet of more than 700 planes dominated by Airbus and Boeing, Russian airlines could return to the American suppliers for critical parts and maintenance.

Recent major incidents highlight an urgent need to prevent the fleet degrading. In late July, a Soviet-era Antonov An-24, built in 1976, crashed in the country's far east, killing all 48 people on board.

Days later, flag carrier Aeroflot grounded dozens of flights following a crippling cyber attack.

Mr Trump is also considering offering Russia opportunities to tap into the valuable natural resources in the strait which separates it from the US.

Alaska, which is separated from Russia by by just three miles of the Bering Strait, is estimated to hold significant undiscovered oil and gas reserves, including 13 per cent of the world's oil.

Developing Russia's presence in the strait would bolster Putin's strategic interests in the arctic region, which accounted for 80 per cent of Russia's gas production in 2022.

UK government sources told The Telegraph that such incentives could be acceptable to Europe, as long as Putin was not seen to be rewarded for the invasion.

“The sense is that it has to be presented to align with public opinion around this, it cannot be seen as a reward for Putin,” a source said.

Israel's occupation of the West Bank could be used as a model for ending the war in Ukraine.

Russia would have military and economic control of occupied Ukraine under its own governing body, similar to Israel's de facto rule of Palestinian territory.

The idea was raised in discussions between Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's special envoy and his Russian counterparts, according to The Times.

The White House is tempering expectations ahead of the summit on Friday, portraying it as a “listening exercise” for the president.

“This is really a feel-out meeting, a little bit,” Mr Trump told reporters on Monday, predicting he would know “probably in the first two minutes” if Putin was serious about peace.

European diplomats say there has been no notable change in Putin's overall war aim, which is to topple Mr Zelensky's government and replace it with a Moscow-friendly proxy.

The Russian president's aides described the tete-a-tete primarily as a discussion on “Russian-American relations”, hinting at boosting trade co-operation.

A White House official said: “We do not comment on deliberative conversations that may or may not be happening.

“From the beginning, the president has been clear about his commitment to ending the bloodshed and achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire.

“As the president stated, everyone agrees this war must come to a close, and that is what he is working towards.”

			State department report reveals concerns over free speech and says UK's ‘human rights situation worsened' year that Labour came to power

The US has warned that censorship of free speech is getting worse in the UK.

On Tuesday, the US state department released its annual Human Rights Report, claiming there are “credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression” in Britain.

The “human rights situation worsened” in Britain in 2024, the report said, frequently referring to the period after Sir Keir Starmer won the election last July. It also criticised the Online Safety Act.

Following the Southport attack last year, the UK Government “repeatedly intervened to chill speech”, the report said.

Although not mentioned by name in the report, the White House has previously expressed an interest in Lucy Connolly, a former childminder and wife of a Conservative councillor, who is serving a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence over a social media post published in the wake of the Southport attack.

After rumours spread online that the killer of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class was an illegal migrant, Connolly called for “deportation now” in a post on X, adding: “Set fire to all the... [asylum] hotels... for all I care.”

Three Court of Appeal judges rejected the 42-year-old's case application in July, meaning that she will not be released until late August.

Critics have claimed that her lengthy jail sentence is “a clear example of two-tier justice”.

The report said that while media observers deemed these to be “especially grievous” examples of government censorship, “censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech”.

It also cited the example of Adam Smith-Connor, who was convicted last October for silently praying outside of an abortion clinic in Dorset for his unborn son.

The 51-year-old army veteran was given a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £9,000 ($12,000) for breaching a ban on protests within a buffer zone around the clinic in November 2022.

Mr Smith-Connor claimed that he had the right to silently pray for an unborn son whom he now regrets aborting 24 years ago and that prosecution amounted to “criminalising someone's beliefs”.

The case caught the attention of JD Vance, the vice-president, who invoked it during a speech at February's Munich Security Conference in which he warned that Britain was “undergoing a crisis of censorship”.

In March, Mr Smith-Connor was one of five pro-life activists to meet with a delegation of state department officials who visited the UK to report back to the White House on the erosion of free speech, The Telegraph previously revealed.

The delegation outlined a number of “specific areas of concern”, including restrictions on political speech deemed “hateful” or “offensive” and safe-access zones, such as those surrounding abortion clinics.

Officials who clamped down on free speech following the Southport murders should have been reprimanded, the report also appeared to suggest.

It specifically referred to Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, who warned those who “repost, repeat, or amplify a message which is false, threatening, or stirs up racial/religious hatred” in the wake of the unrest that they could be prosecuted.

While the British Government “sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses”, the subsequent “prosecution and punishment for such abuses was inconsistent”, the report added.

Among a host of “significant human rights issues” raised by the state department's report were people being threatened with arrest “in order to limit expression”, as well as “crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by anti-Semitism” on British soil.

It comes as ministers face claims that the UK is censoring social media with the Online Safety Act and enforcing a system of “two-tier” justice, whereby certain groups face sanctions for exercising their right to freedom of expression while others appear to be treated with impunity.

Tammy Bruce, the state department press secretary, said that limitations placed on freedom of speech in the UK and Europe are “intolerable in a free society”.

“We consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy,” Ms Bruce said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion, and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.”

The report indicates fraying ties between the Trump administration and Sir Keir's government over the issue of online censorship and free speech.

The report was delayed for months as Trump appointees edited an earlier draft to bring it in line with “America First” values, a state department official told Reuters.

It comes after The Telegraph revealed earlier this month that the Government has been using a secretive Whitehall “spy” unit to flag videos with “concerning narratives” to social media giants, including TikTok, warning that they were “exacerbating tensions” on the streets.

The British Government's efforts to police the web are part of the Online Safety Act, which was brought into law to protect children from harmful content.

Social media giants who fail to fulfil policies targeting content that is deemed harmful can be fined up to 10 per cent of their global revenue, up to £18m ($24m).

However, the rule has been criticised as clamping down on free speech, with some “overzealous” firms blocking users from viewing material, including parliamentary debates about grooming gangs.

Donald Trump's inner circle sees the potential penalties, which can be levied at US companies, as an unwarranted foreign intervention into US free speech.

“President Trump has made it clear that free speech is one of our most cherished freedoms as Americans,” a senior US state department official previously told The Telegraph.

Jim Jordan, the chairman of the US House of Representatives' judiciary committee, said: “[In the UK] mean tweets get you a longer prison sentence than many violent offences.”

Lorcan Price, a barrister and legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom International in London, said: “Whilst these developments are deeply concerning, it's encouraging to see Britain's US allies highlight these issues, as more and more Brits speak out in defence of our hard-fought freedom of speech.”

Sir Gavin Williamson, a Conservative MP and former education secretary, said: “I think what's become increasingly clear is the Government does believe in free speech as long as you agree with the Government and their world-view.

“We've seen this demonstrated not just in terms of sometimes the heavy-handed and draconian approach that they have taken towards people's views being expressed on social media, but how they tried the legislation to underpin free speech in universities.”

Mr Williamson added: “At every stage, the Government seems to want to crowd out the freedom for people to disagree.

“I think this report highlights the concerns on that, whether it's the heavy-handed approach that's been taken towards Lucy Connolly, or whether it is so many other instances where people who, if they'd been expressing a similar Left-wing view, would never have been approached.

“You just don't expect this draconian, heavy-handed approach to free speech and it's just not something we should see in this country.”

With firefighters in southern Europe battling blazes that have killed people in multiple countries and forced thousands to evacuate, Spain's environment minister on Wednesday called the wildfires a “clear warning” of the climate emergency driven by the fossil fuel industry.

While authorities have cited a variety of causes for current fires across the continent, from arson to “careless farming practices, improperly maintained power cables, and summer lightning storms,” scientists have long stressed that wildfires are getting worse as humanity heats the planet with fossil fuels.

The Spanish minister, Sara Aagesen, told the radio network Cadena SER that “the fires are one of the parts of the impact of that climate change, which is why we have to do all we can when it comes to prevention.”

“Our country is especially vulnerable to climate change. We have resources now but, given that the scientific evidence and the general expectation point to it having an ever greater impact, we need to work to reinforce and professionalize those resources,” Aagesen added in remarks translated by The Guardian.

The Spanish meteorological agency, AEMET, said on social media Wednesday that “the danger of wildfires continues at very high or extreme levels in most of Spain, despite the likelihood of showers in many areas,” and urged residents to “take extreme precautions!”

The heatwave impacting Spain “peaked on Tuesday with temperatures as high as 45°C (113°F),” according to Reuters. AEMET warned that “starting Thursday, the heat will intensify again,” and is likely to continue through Monday.

The heatwave is also a sign of climate change, Akshay Deoras, a research scientist in the Meteorology Department at the U.K.'s University of Reading, told Agence France-Presse this week.

“Thanks to climate change, we now live in a significantly warmer world,” Deoras said, adding that “many still underestimate the danger.”

There have been at least two fire-related deaths in Spain this week: a man working at a horse stable on the outskirts of the Spanish capital Madrid, and a 35-year-old volunteer firefighter trying to make firebreaks near the town of Nogarejas, in the Castile and León region.

Acknowledging the firefighter's death on social media Tuesday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez sent his “deepest condolences to their family, friends, and colleagues,” and wished “much strength and a speedy recovery to the people injured in that same fire.”

According to The New York Times, deaths tied to the fires were also reported in Turkey, Montenegro, and Albania. Additionally, The Guardian noted, “a 4-year-old boy who was found unconscious in his family's car in Sardinia died in Rome on Monday after suffering irreversible brain damage caused by heatstroke.”

There are also fires in Greece, France, and Portugal, where the mayor of Vila Real, Alexandre Favaios, declared that “we are being cooked alive, this cannot continue.”

Reuters on Wednesday highlighted Greenpeace estimates that investing €1 billion, or $1.17 billion, annually in forest management could save 9.9 million hectares or 24.5 million acres — an area bigger than Portugal — and tens of billions of euros spent on firefighting and restoration work.

The European fires are raging roughly three months out from the next United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP30, which is scheduled to begin on November 10 in Belém, Brazil.

As kids prepare to return to school, parents confront constricting vaccine access and a dearth of sound medical advice.

It's August, and parents and caregivers are frantically preparing their kids for a new school year by buying supplies, filling out forms and meeting teachers. This year, many parents also face a question that's more complicated than usual: Should my child get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, and will I even have that choice? For some, that decision may have already been made by chaotic federal policy, just as COVID-19 cases are rising nationwide.

As a pediatrician and researcher who studies vaccine delivery and health policy, I am hearing uncertainty from both parents and health care providers. If that describes you, you are not alone. A poll published Aug. 1, 2025, by the health policy organization KFF found half of parents are unsure whether federal health agencies are recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children this fall.

The process that normally provides clear, consistent recommendations and ensures availability for vaccines before respiratory virus season has been upended, and this year's COVID-19 vaccine guidance for children is a prime example.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

For over two decades, there was a predictable, well-coordinated process to ensure recommended seasonal vaccines, such as the flu shot, were available for anyone who wanted them by early fall. In recent years, COVID-19 vaccines have been incorporated into this same annual cycle.

Beginning in February, the Food and Drug Administration, including its independent committee of experts, reviewed data and approved the optimal formulation. After FDA approval, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reviewed the evidence in public meetings and issued clear recommendations.

Manufacturers then scaled up production; insurers confirmed coverage, which is tied to the advisory committee's recommendations; and doses were distributed nationwide so vaccines would be available in clinics and pharmacies before the leaves started turning. This usual series of steps ensured that guidance incorporated input from scientists, epidemiologists, public health experts, clinicians, manufacturers, insurers and consumers. It also fostered trust among health care providers and, in turn, provided parents with clarity and confidence when making decisions.

Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as secretary of Health and Human Services in February 2025, that usual, tightly choreographed dance has become a chaotic scramble marked by uncertainty and a lack of transparency. Decisions about vaccine guidance have been made through internal channels without the same level of public discussion, review of the evidence or broad stakeholder input.

In May 2025, Kennedy and FDA leadership bypassed the agency's independent review committee and announced that some COVID-19 vaccines would be approved only for children with high-risk conditions. One formulation has yet to be FDA-approved for children at all. The secretary first announced updated recommendations for children on X, stating COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children. Shortly after, the CDC posted guidelines that differed from that announcement and said healthy children “may” receive them. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was disbanded by Kennedy and replaced with a smaller, hand-picked panel that operates with less transparency and has yet to weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children.

Public messaging has added to the confusion. Statements from newly appointed federal health leaders have questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the long-standing processes for ensuring their safety. Funding for mRNA technology, which supports several COVID-19 vaccines and is being explored for use against other diseases and even some cancers, has been cut. And many of the claims used to justify these actions have been challenged by experts as inaccurate or misleading.

For parents, the result is uncertainty about whether their children should be vaccinated, when and where the vaccines will be available, whether insurance will cover them, or whether their choice has effectively been made for them by newly appointed health leaders operating outside the guardrails of the normal vetting process. This uncertainty comes at a time when the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in children is already lower than that of other routine vaccines.

Currently, CDC guidelines say healthy children six months and older “may” receive a COVID-19 vaccine based on shared decision-making with their health care provider. The CDC recommends that children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive it. These guidelines differ from FDA approvals and Kennedy's guidelines announced on X, and they have not been reviewed or voted on in an advisory committee on immunization practices meeting.

Parents can start by talking with their child's pediatrician about benefits and potential risks, confirming eligibility and checking on insurance coverage. Pediatricians welcome parents' questions and work tirelessly to provide answers grounded in the best available evidence so families can make truly informed decisions about their child's health.

In some cases, unfortunately, even if parents want the vaccine and their pediatrician agrees, they may not be able to get it due to any number of factors, including local supply shortages, lack of insurance coverage, policies that prevent administration by pharmacists and other health providers without clear federal guidance, or an unwillingness of providers to give it “off-label,” meaning in a way that differs from the FDA's official approval. For those parents, their decision has been made for them.

Whether or not a child receives an updated COVID-19 vaccine, parents can still take steps to reduce illness, including keeping children home when sick, teaching them cough-and-sneeze hygiene and encouraging frequent hand-washing. The CDC provides national and state data on seasonal respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, while local public health websites often offer community-level information.

Parents should also remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not the only thing to consider before school starts. Routine immunizations such as those for measles, mumps and rubella, known as the MMR vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, called DTaP; and influenza are essential for keeping kids healthy and in school. These are widely available for now. This is particularly important, as this year the United States has experienced the highest number of measles cases in decades.

Uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, and potentially other vaccines, may worsen in the coming weeks and months. It is possible parents will continue to see shifting guidance, conflicting statements from federal agencies and reduced access to vaccines in their communities.

In this chaotic environment, parents can look to trusted sources such as their pediatrician or organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which will continue to provide independent, evidence-based vaccine guidance.

South Sudan's government refuted reports of the talks, though they shine a light on Israel's approach.

Israeli authorities are reportedly in discussions to resettle Palestinians to war-torn and hunger-stricken South Sudan, as Israel seeks to advance its plans for the forcible expulsion of all Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

The Associated Press reported on the talks on Tuesday, citing six sources familiar. This includes former Bush administration official Joe Szlavik, the head of a U.S. lobbying firm, as well as South Sudan civil society leader Edmund Yakani. 

Egyptian officials told AP that they have been lobbying against the proposal to resettle Palestinians in South Sudan. Szlavik said that the U.S. isn't directly involved in the discussions, but is aware of them; officials in South Sudan are seeking favors in return from U.S. officials, according to Szlavik.

However, South Sudan's government “firmly” refuted the Associated Press's report on Wednesday. 

“These claims are baseless and do not reflect the official position or policy,” the government said. 

Haaretz also cited an Israeli source who said that there are “quiet” talks to find a partner in Israel's ethnic cleansing project, but “there has been no progress beyond that at this stage.” Israeli media reports that Israel's deputy foreign minister is traveling to South Sudan on Wednesday for the first official visit by an Israeli government official to the country.

Even if the reported talks don't progress, it raises significant human rights concerns that Israeli officials would consider such a plan. Expelling Palestinians to South Sudan would mean that Palestinians would go from one humanitarian catastrophe to another. 

Violence has plagued South Sudan for years, with the country on the brink of civil war. Food insecurity is at its worst point since South Sudan gained independence in 2011, UN officials say, with parts of the country on the verge of famine and 7.7 million facing severe food insecurity. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled South Sudan in recent months alone, while millions have been internally displaced in recent years due to violence.

Foreign powers, including Israel, have played a major role in fueling this violence and instability. The UN has previously warned Israel against selling weapons to militants in South Sudan saying that the arms sales are fueling violence against civilians in the region, helping to create the horrific conditions faced by people in the country today. In fact, Israel had sold weapons to South Sudan ahead of the country's civil war that began in 2013, despite arms embargoes from the EU and the U.S. at the time.

For months, Israel has been seeking partners for its horrific and illegal plan to force Palestinians out of Gaza and “allow” them, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, to be expelled to other countries. Arab countries have refused, saying that they fear Israel will never allow Palestinians to return.

However, Israeli and U.S. groups are reportedly seeking to demonstrate financial incentives for countries to accept Palestinians. Last week, Financial Times reported that U.S. firm Boston Consulting Group has modelled economic scenarios for Palestinians to relocate, including potential economic benefits for countries that accepted people.

As the Israeli government prepares for the military takeover of Gaza City and, many fear, lay the groundwork for full seizure and occupation of Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stirred anger at home and abroad. Overwhelming evidence that large numbers of Gazans are starving has left Israeli leaders facing worldwide condemnation, the threat of partial arms embargos from allies, as well as growing charges of genocide.

In Israel itself, Netanyahu and his cabinet have been under intense criticism for months from former military and intelligence chiefs, opposition leaders, and intellectuals, as well as military reservists and tens of thousands of public protesters. At the heart of the rift between the Israeli people and their government are the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, of which around 20 are believed to be still alive. Yet on August 8, the Israeli cabinet decided to ramp up the war, and the new plans will de facto advance a full occupation of Gaza with the possible objective of long-term military rule of Gaza, as some cabinet members have advocated. The government insists that by expanding military operations, it will save the hostages. But Israelis are not convinced.

Following the announcement, a survey by Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, found that only 28 percent support the new plan. The family members of hostages believe it will spell the death of their loved ones. In direct contrast to the government's determination to prolong and expand operations, a consistent and growing majority—more than 70 percent in some recent surveys—supports a hostage deal and an end to the war as soon as possible. “Now!” and “There's no time!” have been core slogans advocating such a deal ever since the initial weeks following Hamas's October 7 attack. Since the new Gaza plan was announced, demonstrations have swelled, and the hostage families have called for a general strike.

All of which has contributed to the perception that the country has been hijacked by a fanatical religious far-right minority—one that has gained extraordinary leverage and influence by helping Netanyahu cling to power despite his legal predicaments.. Seemingly bearing out the image that the country has been captured by extremists, polls have consistently found that, if new elections were held today, Israelis would oust the current leadership. In other words, if only the government were more aligned with public opinion, the country would be taken in a decidedly different direction.

But the assumption that a post-Netanyahu Israel can chart a new course misses the extent to which Israelis concur with the government on many deeper, longer-term issues. Based on a number of surveys over the years and throughout the current war, both the anti-Netanyahu public and the main opposition parties differ little from the current leadership on the future status of Palestinians, the inevitability of ongoing Israeli occupation in general, and the acceptability of denying self-determination, or alternately, democracy and civil rights to Palestinians in the territories, among other issues. Polls show that, like their current leaders, the large majority of Israeli Jews do not empathize with the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, which Israeli television and mainstream newspapers barely cover. Many believe civilian deaths and harms are the fault of Hamas and are exaggerated or even fabricated, as government and Israeli commentators constantly claim.

This underlying reality points to some hard truths. Removing Netanyahu from power might well help bring an end to the unfolding disaster in Gaza and could even cause the religious right to relinquish its grip on Israeli politics. But it is unlikely to fundamentally reorient Israeli policies toward the Palestinians or to present a true alternative to the decades-old policies of expanding Israeli control and suppressing Palestinian self-determination. These strategies, together with Palestinian spoilers, have fueled the broader conflict all these years and ruined Israel's prospects for being a democracy, and they will drive future violent escalations for years to come. No matter how much politicians and commentators in the United States—or the Israeli opposition for that matter—focus on Netanyahu, the fact is that when it comes to Israeli intransigence regarding Palestinians, the prime minister alone is not the problem. The problem is Israeli society, politics, and culture as it has evolved over decades.

For all his vaunted staying power, Netanyahu's political future in Israel is uncertain. As of now, the prime minister could well lose the next elections, which are scheduled for late October 2026. Since July, when two ultra-Orthodox religious parties abandoned the ruling coalition, he has presided over a precarious minority government. If it collapses, elections would most likely be held in early 2026.

Opposition to the prime minister is deeply entrenched. Well before the October 7 attacks, the government came under extraordinary criticism for its judicial overhaul, which many saw as a move to consolidate Netanyahu's grip on power, weaken his corruption indictments, and undermine Israeli democracy while empowering theocratic forces in society. Through much of the nine months preceding the attacks, hundreds of thousands of Israelis mounted weekly demonstrations against the government, and reservists threatened to refuse to show up for duty. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, in early 2023, when the government first announced the reforms, between 58 and 66 percent of Israelis rejected them, numbers that have held broadly steady ever since, although the pace and type of reforms have changed during the war. Despite these trends, the government has pushed ahead, politicizing judicial appointments and dismissing the attorney general.

Since October 7, 2023, public grievances have intensified. In contrast to those of most wartime governments, the poll ratings of Netanyahu's ruling coalition did not rise but plunged to a low point, where they remained for the first six months of the war—numbers that would have given Netanyahu's Likud Party and its coalition partners just 41 to 46 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, had elections been held then. Surveys have consistently shown that two-thirds or more of the public want Netanyahu to resign, either immediately or when the war ends. According to current polling, if the election were held now, the parties that constituted Netanyahu's original coalition would still be unable to win a majority in the 120-member Knesset. (With the exception of polls that are affiliated with the far right, for more than a year, nearly all credible Israeli opinion surveys have shown the coalition parties winning at least ten seats fewer than the 64 they won in the 2022 elections.) Not even the heady 12-day war with Iran in June, which was widely supported by the Israeli public, managed to improve the coalition's popularity.

The reasons for widespread disaffection with the government are clear. Above all is the government's serial refusal to prioritize the hostages Hamas is holding by reaching a deal to bring the remaining hostages home. Many Israelis believed the government would have avoided the first such deal in November 2023 if not for public pressure, and since early 2024, a majority of them have regularly supported a deal to bring home those that remain. From the start of the two-month cease-fire in early 2025, over 70 percent supported the continuation of that cease-fire to allow further hostage returns, according to surveys by the Israel Democracy Institute. By June, more than three-quarters of Israelis said they supported releasing all remaining hostages in return for a full end of the war, according to a survey by Agam Labs, affiliated with Hebrew University.



Large majorities of Israelis are also incensed by the government's evasion of responsibility for October 7. In a survey I conducted in late November 2024 for Zulat, a liberal think tank, 69 percent said that an independent state commission should be established to investigate the security failings surrounding the attack, with another 27 percent supporting a government-appointed commission to do so. These numbers have only grown: In March, a survey for Israel's found that 75 percent of Israelis supported an independent commission. But after nearly two years of war, the government has not established any commission at all.

Yet another complaint against the government concerns ultra-Orthodox Jews' exemption from Israel Defense Forces conscription. A sweeping majority of Jewish Israelis want to end this historic practice, yet instead of doing that, the government has mooted a law that would require limited and incremental draft targets for the ultra-Orthodox—which most Israelis view as a “draft-evasion law” designed to establish permanent and widespread exemption for most members of this group. In July, the Institute for National Security Studies found that 73 percent of Jewish Israelis believe that such a law would harm the security of the state. For the moment, the government has not enacted the law, although it has been under intense pressure to do so by the religious erstwhile coalition partners. The delay caused two ultra-Orthodox parties to quit the coalition in July, and they could theoretically vote with the opposition if there is a motion to disband the Knesset in the coming months. As a result, the fate of the country is now in the hands of ultra-Orthodox parties who represent a mere 14 percent of the Israeli population, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.

For much of the public, the avoidance of a hostage deal with Hamas, the ultra-Orthodox exemption, and the lack of accountability for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks and the ongoing assault on the Israeli judiciary, are evidence of the coalition's moral and political decay. Many also see these issues as a continuation of the illiberal, theocratic, and authoritarian or corrupt tendencies that drove the 2023 judicial overhaul, now supercharged by the wartime opportunity to advance a messianic agenda of permanent occupation, de facto annexation in the West Bank, and resettlement of Gaza. Given the level of public grievance, it is tempting to assume that a post-Netanyahu leadership would mark a repudiation of the right-wing fundamentalism that has prolonged the war in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza, creating an appalling starvation crisis, and done untold harm to Israel's global reputation. Yet such assumptions cling to an idealized view of Israeli democracy that misses a larger truth about the Israeli electorate.

Notwithstanding their growing distaste for the Netanyahu government, mainstream Israelis do not significantly diverge from the prime minister and his far-right cabinet on many underlying and essential longer-term issues. This convergence is no accident: Netanyahu has long been adept at capturing underlying public sentiment, and very often molding and manipulating it. This is particularly the case on issues related to Israel's self-image as a country under constant existential threats, whether from Palestinian terror, Iran, global anti-Semitism, or its own internal enemies such as the left wing or Arab citizens of Israel.

Consider the two-state solution. The prime minister is well aware that the majority of Israelis oppose this concept. In June, Tel Aviv University's Peace Index Survey found that just one-third of all Israelis supported establishing a Palestinian state next to Israel. Among Jewish Israelis, the figure is even smaller, with less than one-quarter supporting the idea. Thus, when Netanyahu insists that he will resist international efforts to advance a Palestinian state, or any real form of Palestinian national self-determination, he is reflecting the attitudes of a firm majority of Jewish voters. Hardly any of Israel's mainstream opposition leaders risk contradicting him. Israeli security hawks such as Benny Gantz, the Israeli general who was considered a moderate member of Netanyahu's “war cabinet” during the first eight months of the war, are highly agnostic about Palestinian statehood; leaders of the secular right, such as Avigdor Lieberman, openly oppose it. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who polls show as a front-runner among opposition candidates, has in the past been to the right of Netanyahu and has always opposed a two-state solution.

Israel's centrist parties are little different. Even Israel's consolidated Zionist left-wing party, the Democrats, led by Yair Golan, a major general and a former IDF deputy chief of staff, mostly avoid discussing a Palestinian state or the two-state solution. Yair Lapid, the official head of Israel's opposition and leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, has similarly mostly avoided the issue since the war started, although he was the last Israeli prime minister to support a two-state solution publicly during his own brief term in late 2022. Only the leaders of Arab parties speak freely in support of Palestinian statehood. One such leader, Ayman Odeh, has already announced he will not run again—but the Knesset still sought to impeach him recently over what right-wingers insisted was a distasteful social media post in which he expressed sympathy for Palestinian prisoners alongside Israeli hostages, which they suggested drew a moral equivalence. Six opposition members voted together with the government, although the impeachment failed to garner enough votes.



In part, the growing Israeli dismissal of a two-state solution reflects the hard-line belligerence toward Palestinians that has emerged since October 7. But this has built on existing mutually hostile, negative attitudes, as demonstrated by joint Israeli-Palestinian surveys I conducted with the Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki well before the war. Undeniably, the war has unleashed further extreme sentiment. Israeli ministers have regularly called for besieging, starving, flattening, and possibly dropping nuclear bombs on Gaza, and Israeli mainstream media have rarely shown or discussed the vast human suffering unfolding there, allowing Israelis to opt out of such images if they choose—although this information is readily available through critical Israeli media, international networks, and social media.

In the Peace Index survey of January 2024, by which point more than 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed, 88 percent of Jewish Israelis said that the Palestinian casualties (without specifying civilians or combatants) were justified to achieve Israel's war aims. By July 2025, the number killed had risen to 60,000, including many thousands of young children, yet the same Peace Index series found that 72 percent, still a strong majority of Israeli Jews, think the casualties are justified. In the July survey, nearly the same portion, 74 percent of Jewish Israelis, support “voluntary emigration” of Gazans, and a majority of Jewish respondents support “forced evacuation.” (Arab citizens of Israel show such minuscule support for these policies that the total Israeli average is lower but misleading.)

Even some of the government's harshest proposals for Palestinians in Gaza have drawn significant public support. In May, for example, the Penn State researcher Tamir Sorek published a poll showing that 82 percent of Israeli Jews would support the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza. Although some questioned the poll's methodology or findings, shortly afterward, the Israel Democracy Institute found in its monthly survey that 77 percent of Israeli Jews thought Israel should not concern itself with Palestinian civilian suffering in Gaza, and 63 percent opposed humanitarian aid there. Moreover, in the institute's July survey, 79 percent were not personally troubled by “reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza.” A survey commissioned at the end of July by the Israeli newspaper Maariv found that 47 percent of Israeli Jews believe starvation in Gaza is a Hamas lie. In the July Peace Index, over 60 percent of the Jewish population supported Defense Minister Israel Katz's plan to build a camp to concentrate Palestinians near Rafah, where they would be allowed to leave only for another country.

Israeli attitudes toward the government's latest plan for a full military occupation of Gaza have not crystallized yet. Polls have generally shown that a substantial minority—but not a majority—of Jewish Israelis now support full annexation of “the occupied territories.” According to the Peace Index survey in July, 40 percent of Israeli Jews support annexation. The same survey also found that 46 percent of Israeli Jews now supported building Jewish settlements in Gaza.

The hardening of views about Palestinians also reflects longer-term trends in Israeli society. As a matter of political orientation, a decisive majority—60 percent—of Jewish Israelis now identify as right wing, compared with 12 percent who consider themselves left and just over 25 percent who say they are in the center, according to a June survey by the Israel Democracy Institute. But these trends did not begin with October 7. Already in the run-up to the 2022 election, hardly anyone—candidates or most of the Jewish Israeli public—would talk about the Palestinians or about Israel's nearly six-decade occupation regime. This included Israel's control of Gaza's borders, airspace, territorial waters, and (along with Egypt) all traffic in and out of the territory—what the International Committee of the Red Cross classified as an ongoing occupation even before October 7.

Paradoxically, public acceptance of long-term military rule over a large portion of the Palestinian population has coincided with growing concern about Israeli democracy. Thus, for the huge masses of Israelis who shouted “Democracy!” on Saturday nights throughout 2023 to protest Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, the gravest threat to Israeli democracy—the military rule over a huge disenfranchised Palestinian population—was ignored. At the peak of the protests, in the summer of 2023, a survey I conducted for an umbrella organization of peace groups, the Alliance for Middle East Peace, funded by the U.S. Institute of Peace, found that among Jewish Israelis between the ages of 15 and 21, 88 percent believed Israel “can be a democratic state even though it controls the West Bank and Gaza (de facto), where Palestinians cannot vote in Israeli elections.” In other words, the rising generation of young Jewish Israelis—and this was before October 7—overwhelmingly took it for granted that millions of Palestinians could be deprived of basic rights indefinitely without compromising Israel's democratic foundations.

During the 2023 protests, Israelis also failed to connect the judicial overhaul with the government's annexationist aims. Even as the protests were unfolding, extremist, Jewish supremacist political leaders such as Israel's current minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir, were transforming the police and security forces to tolerate or even condone settler violence as a means of expanding Jewish control over occupied territory. The government has also sought to weaken the supreme court or attorney general, which pose potential obstacles to laws designed to facilitate land grabs and seizure of Palestinian property. In August, the Netanyahu government made the unprecedented decision to fire the attorney general, a move that the Israeli Supreme Court has temporarily blocked, leaving the country in a crisis of governing authority.



By ignoring the larger reality of Israel's occupation, the main opposition parties have abetted the further erosion of the country's democratic institutions. Consider the multiparty government that was briefly in power between 2021 and late 2022, without Netanyahu or the current coalition parties. It sought to make tiny adjustments designed to ease quality-of-life strains among Palestinians yet made no substantive move toward Palestinian self-determination, save for a prominent speech in September 2022 at the United Nations by Lapid, then prime minister, supporting a two-state solution, just ahead of fresh elections. Golan, the leader of the left-wing Democrats, prefers to advocate for what he refers to as “separation”—meaning some sort of partition between Israelis and Palestinians—but he barely discusses the issue unless asked.

Since October 7, a growing political consensus has emerged in Israel around the view that military might is the exclusive basis for Israel's survival. There were no dissenting voices during Israel's war with Iran in June, only blanket support. Opposition leaders rarely if ever speak against the IDF's ongoing presence and strikes in Lebanon, or its bombing campaign against the new regime in Syria, either; at best offering slogans about the need for a “diplomatic” component to complement Israel's significant military achievements against regional enemies such as Iran and Hezbollah. And the latest political figure to excite Israelis opposed to Netanyahu is yet another former IDF chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot. To the extent that opposition politicians or military experts criticize the government over its Gaza policy, they argue that the government lacks a clear strategy or has failed to cultivate an alternative governing force to Hamas—but not in the context of any long-ranging political solution to the conflict.

If Netanyahu loses the next elections, his downfall would bring a wave of relief among many Israelis at home and abroad for removing the uncouth populists and religious fundamentalists who openly broadcast their intentions to destroy and starve the population of Gaza and annex the territory. But a new government is unlikely to make much more progress than its predecessor on a durable, just, or feasible peace with Palestinians—or to address the underlying dynamics of occupation that have led to so much conflict in the first place. Instead, the situation will continue to fuel expansionist dreams in Israel and probably regular, worsening military escalations. If neither the Israeli public nor the world demands a change, the opposition parties seem unlikely to offer either the vision or the leadership to put Israel on a path toward peace, democracy, or even fundamental, long-term security.

American companies are world leaders in technology—be it innovative software, cloud services, artificial intelligence, or cybersecurity products. Yet beginning as many as three years ago, hackers believed to be backed by the Chinese government did something the United States, the tech powerhouse, could not adequately defend against: they gained and maintained access to major U.S. telecommunications networks, copying conversations and building the ability to track the movements of U.S. intelligence officers and law enforcement agents across the country. The attack, dubbed “Salt Typhoon,” constituted a large part of a global campaign against telecoms, and it penetrated systems at many U.S. carriers so thoroughly that officials will almost certainly never know the full scope of the capabilities China achieved to spy on Americans' communications.

Salt Typhoon was more than a one-off intelligence success for China. It reflected a deeper, troubling reality. Mere decades after the widespread adoption of the Internet opened a new realm of geopolitical contestation, China is positioning itself to dominate the digital battle space. The United States has fallen behind, failing to secure a vast digital home front—and the physical assets that depend on it. Because cyberspace has no borders, the U.S. homeland is always in the fight. Every hospital, power grid, pipeline, water treatment plant, and telecommunications system is on the frontlines, and most of the United States' critical infrastructure is unready for battle.

China's cyber dominance extends well beyond telecommunications espionage. Chinese malware has been discovered embedded in U.S. energy, water, pipeline, and transportation systems. These intrusions show little evidence of traditional intelligence gathering. Instead, they appear to be designed for sabotage, preparing China to disrupt both Americans' daily lives and U.S. military operations. During a future crisis, China could use these pre-positioned capacities to delay military mobilizations, impede air traffic control systems, or cause cascading power outages. Even barring an outright attack, their existence could deter the United States by raising the specter of disruption at home.

The Salt Typhoon attack was able to secure such wide-ranging access in part because of the fundamental asymmetry between the authoritarian approach Beijing takes to its cyberdefense and Washington's more democratic perspective. American values forbid the kind of comprehensive monitoring that undergirds China's cyberdefense and frees Beijing to pursue offensive operations with less fear of retaliation. And myriad private actors manage the United States' critical infrastructure, with minimal government oversight or hands-on assistance. Their levels of investment in cybersecurity are variable, driven by commercial bottom lines. That means that when cyberattackers are found, it is hard to prove that they have been removed from networks or systems. Even when their removal appears certain, it is likely they will return.

Chinese operations now pose the largest challenge to the United States' cyberdefense, but it isn't the only one. Vulnerabilities in U.S. infrastructure networks have made them attractive targets to other adversarial countries as well as to criminals. In the past several years, Russia and Iran have disrupted the operations of U.S. water systems in multiple states, and hackers mostly based in Russia have played havoc with the workings of hundreds of American hospitals. Washington can—and must—do much more to protect the United States' critical infrastructure and deter Chinese attacks. The artificial intelligence revolution will only exacerbate the United States' disadvantages unless policymakers urgently develop a new approach.

Washington must establish a new cyber-deterrence policy built on the principle that robust cyberdefense enables credible cyberoffense. Artificial intelligence offers the key to making this new deterrence policy feasible. The United States should leverage its AI expertise by mounting a national effort to use AI to model its sprawling network of critical infrastructure, identify the most important vulnerabilities, and fix them. Washington must also ensure that it has the offensive cyber-capabilities to deter China. And it must make its messaging about cyberattacks more coherent, clarifying that pre-positioning in specific kinds of infrastructure constitutes a redline and carefully signaling its capacity to retaliate.

By developing AI-powered defenses and investing more tactically in offensive capabilities, the United States can transform an inadequate cyber strategy into proactive deterrence. The U.S. government must convey the message to China that it remains committed to defending American lives. It can do so only by finding and securing the most sensitive vulnerabilities in the digital infrastructure on which Americans rely.

Salt Typhoon was a sophisticated, multistage operation. To gain administrator access to telecommunications networks, the attackers exploited flaws in U.S. telecom companies' cybersecurity products—such as firewalls—and used passwords stolen in unrelated hacks. Once inside, the hackers installed malware and hijacked legitimate processes and programs to maintain control. The attackers then used computers, servers, routers, and other devices they had compromised to move across different companies' networks and find the most rewarding spying positions.

The roots of China's cyber advantages lie in structural differences between authoritarian and democratic forms of governance. When cyberattacks emerged with the advent of the Internet, both China and the United States faced similar vulnerabilities. But China has systematically built up its cyberdefenses while the United States has struggled to balance securing its cyberspace with its attention to civil liberties.

The Internet's explosive growth in the 1990s worried Beijing. The Chinese government feared the Internet's potential to enable free expression and, as is natural for an authoritarian regime, opted to restrict it. Beginning in the late 1990s, Beijing deployed an array of technologies and laws to censor online speech and block websites and applications developed in the West.



Outside observers still often describe this so-called Great Firewall as a domestic censorship project. But having accomplished that task, the Chinese government discovered that its creation had another powerful function. As well as screening for subversive speech, the Great Firewall's technologies can identify malicious code before it reaches critical systems, providing Beijing with tools to defend against cyberattacks. As a consequence, Chinese water treatment plants, power grids, telecommunications networks, and other critical systems operate with layers of protection that most U.S. systems lack. If foreign hackers attempt to penetrate Chinese infrastructure, they may encounter not only their target's specific defenses but the Chinese government's integrated monitoring capabilities.

The United States, meanwhile, faced the opposite dynamic. Unlike in China, where critical infrastructure operates under direct state control, American systems are owned by thousands of private companies with varying cybersecurity capabilities and threat awareness. A small-town water treatment plant in Ohio, for example, operates with the cyber-protections it can afford—which often means vulnerable software, default passwords, and outdated systems that are easily hacked.

And the U.S. government is legally prohibited from monitoring many of these companies' networks for threats without their explicit consent, to avoid transgressing the constitutional ban on governmental “search and seizure” of private communications. So the United States came to rely on a patchwork approach to digitally securing its most crucial infrastructure: companies that own and operate America's most sensitive systems, such as power grids, are responsible for securing them with limited government oversight.

This gap in defense enabled China to develop offensive capabilities with less fear of retaliation. Beijing invested heavily in offensive cyber-capabilities, establishing programs that now rival Washington's in both sophistication and scale. China has integrated these capabilities into its broader military doctrine of “active defense,” or the principle that the best defense involves striking first to prevent enemy action.

China and the United States first engaged diplomatically on cyber-espionage in 2015, when U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping brokered an agreement proscribing the theft of intellectual property by hackers for commercial gain, but China soon breached the agreement. The first Trump administration, which took over in 2017, favored taking enforcement actions over engaging diplomatically: for instance, in March 2018, it released indictments and sanctions against hackers linked to Beijing who had stolen proprietary data from U.S. companies and government agencies.

After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, his administration initiated regular high-level diplomatic engagement with China to manage the strategic competition between the two great powers, including in cyberspace. For instance, Biden extracted a promise from Xi that China would not interfere in the 2024 U.S. elections. But the Biden administration also realized that China's offensive cyber-campaigns were intensifying.

In 2023, for example, Chinese state-sponsored hackers exploited a flaw in Microsoft's cloud services to breach high-level officials' email accounts. The Biden administration regularly declassified intelligence and gave escalating public warnings that China's cyber-­activities were expanding from espionage to potential sabotage: in January 2024, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to a House committee that hackers linked to the Chinese government were targeting critical U.S. infrastructure and preparing to cause “real-world harm” to Americans.



China's cyber-operations have become a clear threat to U.S. national security. Consider the scope of China's pre-positioning. Intrusions have been discovered in water infrastructure, power grids, and other critical systems across the American mainland. These attacks follow a consistent pattern: the intruders gain administrative access to supervisory control systems, establish the capacity to maintain that access over time, and then remain dormant while keeping the ability to activate malicious code on command.

The targets reveal strategic thinking. Water treatment plants serve essential civilian needs while also supporting military installations. Power grids enable everything from hospital operations to ammunition production. Telecommunications networks support both civilian communications and military command systems. By pre-positioning cyber­attack tools in these dual-use systems, China is readying itself to impose significant civilian costs while degrading the U.S. military's effectiveness.

During a crisis over Taiwan, for instance, these capabilities could prove decisive. Imagine the dilemma facing American leaders if China could credibly threaten to delay military mobilization by disrupting U.S. rail networks or to trigger power failures across the Eastern Seaboard. Beijing need not actually execute such attacks. The mere possibility could alter U.S. decision-making by raising the domestic political costs of an overseas intervention.

China's pre-positioning also serves tactical military objectives. U.S. military bases depend on surrounding civilian infrastructure for power, water, and communications. By threatening these systems, China could impede U.S. military mobilization without directly attacking military targets—avoiding the clear escalation that bombing American bases would represent. Similarly, disrupting seaports and airports could delay reinforcement deployments to the Pacific while appearing to target civilian infrastructure with nonlethal tactics.

Chinese military theorists explicitly embrace this logic, describing offensive cyber-operations as a form of “strategic deterrence.” More than most conventional forms of deterrence, cyber-­operations offer plausible deniability. China can threaten civilian infrastructure while maintaining that any disruptions might result from the targeted country's own system failures rather than a deliberate attack. Indeed, the Chinese government has consistently denied that it was behind Salt Typhoon or the malware discovered in U.S. infrastructure.

That deniability has made traditional diplomacy a weak tool to manage cyberwarfare. The United States cannot rely on direct negotiations. It must turn urgently to bolstering its defenses. The Biden administration used emergency authorities to impose new minimum cybersecurity requirements on pipelines, rail systems, airports, and water utilities, overcoming decades of bipartisan resistance to mandating private-sector security standards. These requirements did drive improvements in basic protections. And they allowed government regulators such as the Transportation Security Administration, which regulates pipelines, to periodically inspect infrastructure owners' cyberdefenses and offer guidance.

Although this represented an important step, even these enhanced requirements cannot match Beijing's direct monitoring of equivalent networks in China. Biden mandated that U.S. pipelines, water systems, rail networks, and health-care industry firms report cyber-incidents to the government, but only after they occur; Chinese authorities can monitor their systems in real time to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. New cybersecurity mandates on U.S. water utilities, meanwhile, were paused after several states challenged their legality, leaving this sector exposed.

Cyber-operations do resemble conventional warfare—airstrikes, naval battles, or ground combat—in that they involve both offense and defense. The United States deters conventional threats through superior military power, but it completely lacks that dominance in cyberspace, where defense and offense are inextricably linked. Currently, U.S. presidents face an impossible problem: they cannot make persuasive deterrent threats because they lack enough confidence that U.S. defenses could withstand a potentially escalatory tit-for-tat battle in cyberspace. The United States needs a policy that acknowledges the reality of cyberconflict while aggressively leveraging American technological advantages to restore strategic balance.



First and foremost, Washington must understand the vulnerabilities in its cyberdefenses. In conventional warfare, force-on-force comparisons guide strategy: for instance, the U.S. military runs regular tests and simulations to see whether its defenses can protect against Russia's missile-launch capacities. But the government cannot assess how the United States' critical infrastructure could withstand Chinese cyberattacks because it cannot even see what defenses secure its thousands of privately owned systems.

Artificial intelligence, with its rapidly growing abilities to synthesize a vast amount of data, offers a new opportunity to take on this sprawling problem. Indeed, it can be the key to a new U.S. cyber-deterrence policy—specifically, so-called AI-generated digital twins. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical object (such as a wind turbine) or a system (such as a power grid) that uses real-time data and sensors to mirror its real-world counterpart's behavior and performance. These dynamic digital models allow organizations to monitor, analyze, and optimize their physical assets remotely.

Recent advances in AI have turbocharged digital twins' usefulness by dramatically improving their ability to model ever-larger and more complex entities. Industry is rapidly adopting digital twins to advance product safety—Rolls-Royce, for instance, now operates digital twins of its jet engines to monitor safety and performance. Ford and BMW have created digital twins of manufacturing processes to improve efficiency. And governments are exploring their potential: Singapore, for instance, has created a digital twin as well as test beds for its water and power plants. NATO has used these systems in its annual, large-scale cyberdefense exercise, during which security teams simulated attacking and defending Singaporean infrastructure.

In the United States, a national effort to create digital twins for several hundred of the most sensitive critical infrastructure systems—done with private-sector owners' cooperation and consent—would allow these systems' security teams to safely test dangerous attack scenarios without risking the actual provision of core services. The teams could simulate cyberattacks against various system components within the digital twin to understand which vulnerabilities, if exploited, would cause major disruptions. This information would allow companies to focus their limited resources on fixing the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat rather than attempting to address every security flaw equally.



Digital twins could also establish baseline behavioral patterns that help detect anomalies that could indicate cyberattacks. When a water system's digital twin, for instance, suddenly shows unusual valve operations or pressure fluctuations, its security team could quickly identify potential intrusions before they cause physical damage. The potential impact goes beyond individual companies. Virtual replicas of regional power grids could be used to simulate cascading failure scenarios, identifying nodes whose protection would prevent widespread outages. Digital twins of urban water systems could model contamination attacks, suggesting potential technical countermeasures and emergency response procedures. And over time, digital twins would enable the kind of force-on-force comparisons that the national security community routinely conducts in conventional domains. A digital twin of the Hoover Dam's control systems, for example, could simulate attack scenarios, helping its operators develop more precise and sophisticated defenses, as well as ways to recover more quickly if an attack does occur.

A national effort to create digital twins of critical national infrastructure could be piloted quickly for the U.S. energy grid by the Department of Energy. The department already possesses models of the grid and could draw on classified insights regarding China's cyberwarfare capabilities, as well as the AI expertise at institutions such as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia and its close partnerships with U.S. energy firms. The lessons learned while establishing that pilot could then be used to build digital twins for other critical sectors.

Creating comprehensive digital twins will involve substantial technical challenges. It requires a detailed knowledge of infrastructure systems and network data that owners may consider proprietary. It will take time for government AI and intelligence experts to forge new kinds of partnerships with private owners and operators. But the United States needs a bridge between its physical and digital worlds. It cannot and should not simply mimic China's cyber-­barriers, which rely on an intrusive surveillance state. Digital twins, however, would give U.S. national security officials a continuous picture of American cyberdefenses and provide decision-makers with real-time assessments of the country's readiness to foil cyberattacks. A future president contemplating a response to Chinese aggression could access complex modeling of how U.S. infrastructure would perform under sustained attack nearly immediately—the kind of tactical intelligence that is sorely lacking today.

Even AI-enhanced defenses cannot entirely overcome the cyberdefense gap that gives China its structural advantage. Current U.S. law gives infrastructure operators full authority to monitor their networks, and federal legislation adopted in 2015 ensures that these operators are able to share information with their peers and with the federal government to facilitate collaborative defense. Still lacking in some key sectors, however, is any requirement that owners and operators actually monitor their networks. In sectors that have these requirements, regulators need to conduct more consistent oversight to ensure that operators are maintaining their cyberdefenses and collaborating with peers and the federal government.

And defense alone, however sophisticated, cannot fully address China's advantages. True deterrence requires the capacity to continuously undermine an adversary's capabilities and prepare to impose unacceptable costs. The United States must ensure that it builds and maintains offensive cyber-­capabilities that can hold at risk targets that Beijing values—and clearly communicate that it can and will strike if China crosses American redlines. Instead of attempting tit-for-tat intrusions into Chinese civilian infrastructure, the United States could focus on targeting military assets that China depends on during crises, which would conform with international law and may have a greater effect on the Chinese government's strategy.

Finally, the United States must strengthen its messaging. It must clarify that targeting specific critical civilian infrastructure whose disruption would cause major societal impact, even with pre-positioning attacks, is unacceptable. This would build on the Biden administration's message to China that cyberattacks with physical impacts would be treated as an act of war. The United States should communicate three core principles: We will attribute attacks to their perpetrators. We are resilient. We will retaliate. Specificity matters for credibility—vague threats invite probing and miscalculation.



The message must be credible and persistent, including enough detail to prove that the United States' offensive capabilities are real but not enough to let an adversary fix its vulnerabilities. Russia's decision to use cyberattacks to induce blackouts in Ukraine years before its 2022 full invasion illustrates the danger in signaling cyber-­capabilities too explicitly: the demonstration convinced Ukraine to significantly improve its power grid defenses.

There are reasons the United States has lagged in bolstering its cyberdefenses—political obstacles as well as technological ones. Congress has shown little appetite for extending the legal authority and sustained investment that comprehensive cyberdefense requires. Private companies resist mandated security requirements that increase costs.

Yet a wait-and-see approach has become unacceptable. If Washington does not move fast, artificial intelligence will only accelerate China's advantages. The United States possesses the technical capabilities, economic resources, and innovative capacity to reclaim the advantage in the digital battle space. What the United States needs now is the vision and political will to take comprehensive action. Countries all around the world are watching. If the United States succeeds, it can serve as an example of how to achieve the benefits of digitization and a free Internet without compromising its national security. If it fails, the world will also take away a lesson: that democracies are less capable of defending against cyberthreats. And China's strategy of “active deterrence” will only gain more global power.

            Jenna Ortega's eyes are lightly smudged, framed by dark shadows. Her face is pale, and her cheekbones are accentuated by a dash of gray. Her lips are tinged purple. She looks exhausted, but that's the point. The latest Gen Z makeup trend, “Tired Girl,” celebrates the look of not having been to bed.
    


            For as long as beauty standards have existed, people have collectively fought against looking tired. Concealer, eye cream and corrector sticks are, at least in part, designed to make us look fresh and alert. Historically, appearing fatigued has been associated with poor health, aging and unattractiveness. Tired Girl beauty celebrates the opposite; it's about embracing the imperfections we've traditionally tried to conceal.
    


            The modern poster girl for the trend is Wednesday Addams, the Addams Family's morbid and emotionally reserved daughter, who is the focus of Tim Burton's Netflix series starring Ortega in the role. Much like the first season, series two sees the actor showcasing shadowed under-eyes and pale skin, a look that she recently recreated on the red carpet for the show's premiere in London. Those born outside of the Gen Z age group will recognize earlier references — think Angelina Jolie in “Girl Interrupted,” or a young Natalie Portman in “Leon.”
    


            Other contemporary famous fans of the makeup trend include the actor Lily Rose-Depp, model and musician Gabbriette and influencers Emma Chamberlain, Danielle Marcan and Lara Violetta. As of late July, tired girl makeup is now a TikTok category, with numerous tutorials on how to achieve the sleep-deprived look, with some of the most popular having gained over 300,000 views so far.
    


            In one of her recent videos, Violetta — who smudges dark eye shadow under her eyes to create a “moldy makeup” aesthetic — said “eye bags are so chic because you actually have to work for them.” Overall, the look is messy and undone with a rebellious edge. “It's a celebration of realness,” makeup artist and Glass magazine beauty director Kim Brown told CNN. “The Tired Girl look has an edge and personality. It's tough and cool.”
    


            Tired Girl is not to be confused with goth, a music-based subculture that spawned a moodier look involving much paler skin and heavier and pronounced dark eyes. It is also different to South Korea's viral aegyo-sal makeup trend, which emphasizes the puffy area of fat under the eyes to create a more youthful appearance. Grunge fashion, known for its disheveled, lived-in aesthetic and popularized by Courtney Love in the '90s, is perhaps the look's most recent relation.
    


            But, as with other fleeting TikTok trends, the roots of Tired Girl don't run anywhere near as deep. “Grunge grew from anti-establishment values, music scenes and community solidarity, where aesthetic and cultural rebellion were inseparable,” said Dan Hastings-Narayanin, the deputy foresight editor at The Future Laboratory, a trend forecasting firm.
    


            The Tired Girl look, on the other hand, is part of the transient “core” phenomenon, a word used to describe niche internet aesthetics, such as “cottagecore” (nature-inspired, romantic) or “Barbiecore” (playful and hyper-feminine). “It's a quick way to show who you are or what mood you're going for,” said Hastings-Narayanin. The challenge, he argued, is that it is “fleeting, commodified and poised for replacement by the next viral moment.”
    


            The trend has a distinctive Tim Burton energy, so it comes as no surprise that it appeared on both seasons of Wednesday. “The core principle was to achieve a polished but natural look using minimal products and highlighting Jenna's natural features,” said hair and makeup artist Tara McDonald, who created Ortega's look in season one. As Ortega's foundation was lighter in color than her natural skin tone, and McDonald “didn't want to conceal her natural under-eye area with makeup,” the darker circles around her eyes stood out more than usual, McDonald explained. “The eyeshadow was dark, but it was only ever a light application, and the illusion of naturally flushed lips — almost like they've been gently bitten — was key,” she added.
    


            Like with any pronounced beauty look, there is a message in Wednesday's makeup. “The intention was always that she's not going to be the kind of girl who spends hours doing her hair and makeup,” said Nirvana Jalalvand, who was behind Ortega's beauty look for season two. “She's just not that kind of person. She has cases to solve and important places to be. Putting her face on isn't going to be high on her priority list.” In that regard, Wednesday's nonchalance about her appearance serves as the antithesis to traditional, polished, fresh-faced beauty ideals, and a subversion of femininity.
    


Is Kylie Jenner's surgery revelation a setback for beauty standards?



            It is a clear departure from the “clean girl” aesthetic, a fresh-faced look that involves flushed cheeks, radiant skin and minimal makeup, popularized by Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner over the last few years. “It's not just the makeup though; it's part of something wider,” said Jalavland. “Even the way people post their Instagram photos now has shifted with photo dumps and blurry images. We've all grown tired of overly curated, perfectionism. This messy culture is a fight against that clean girl aesthetic. Tired Girl is a different way of presenting yourself. It's almost like we went so far into perfection that people are going back on it.”
    


            This is also true of its execution; applying concealer and blush requires little effort. “Most people can do this makeup,” said McDonald. “You don't necessarily need to be a great makeup artist. You don't need a steady hand. You can achieve this look without makeup brushes.”
    


            While Tired Girl may be unlikely to make a lasting cultural impact, its origins might say something deeper about the challenges that young people face. Hastings-Narayanin views Gen Z's embrace of the Tired Girl trend as a return to vulnerability and relatability amid “relentless pressures” that include juggling academics and extracurriculars, managing student debt and navigating a fragile job market, all while striving for personal goals like saving the planet. “Flaunting vulnerability and dark humor becomes a coping mechanism that proclaims, ‘I am exhausted and uncertain about my future, and I will laugh through the gloom,'” he said.

            New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Wednesday that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu has “lost the plot” and that Israel's planned occupation of Gaza City is “utterly unacceptable.”
    


            Luxon's comments come as his conservative coalition government weighs whether to join other members of the Five-Eyes security alliance, Australia, Britain and Canada, in moving to recognize a Palestinian state; and as international condemnation and anger builds over Israel's recent decision to expand its war to take control of Gaza City, the throttling of aid and mass starvation in the enclave.
    


            Luxon, who leads the right-leaning National Party, said Netanyahu is “not listening” to the international community's demands for “unfettered” humanitarian aid to be delivered to Gaza.
    


            “I think Netanyahu has gone too far. I think he has lost the plot. And I think what we are seeing overnight with the attack on Gaza City is utterly, utterly unacceptable,” Luxon said, in some of his strongest comments against Israel's actions in Gaza to date.
    


            Netanhayu's office has not yet responded to Luxon's comment.
    


            Israel has continued its intense aerial attacks on Gaza this week and Netanyahu's planned military takeover of Gaza City, expected to force up to a million people to leave the city, has been widely condemned.
    


            “We have said a forcible displacement of people and an annexation of Gaza would be a breach of international law,” said Luxon.
    


Here are the countries that have recognized a Palestinian state



            Chaotic scenes continue to emerge from Gaza, with violence and starvation deepening amid Israel's tight control of aid to the territory. At least 227 people – including 103 children – have died from malnutrition since the beginning of the war, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
    


            Foreign ministers from dozens of countries on Tuesday jointly said that suffering has reached “unimaginable levels” and “famine is unfolding before our eyes” as they demand that Israel allow more aid into Gaza and permit humanitarian organizations to operate there.
    


            Luxon is not the only western leader to openly criticize Israel's Prime Minister in recent days. On Tuesday, Australia's leader Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to Netanyahu but found him to be “in denial” about the human cost of the war in Gaza.
    


            “He (Netanyahu) again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,” Albanese told Australia's public broadcaster ABC.
    


            Earlier this week, Australia announced it would move to recognize Palestinian statehood at the United National General Assembly meeting in September, leaving New Zealand as the only member of the Five Eyes security alliance, except the United States, not to pledge to do so. French President Emmanuel Macron has also said France will recognize a Palestinian state in an announcement to the United Nations General Assembly in September.
    


            “The urgent need today is to end the war in Gaza and to rescue the civilian population,” said Macron in a July statement, reiterating calls for an immediate ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid for the population of Gaza, the release of all hostages and the demilitarization of Hamas.
    


            Washington has found itself increasingly at odds with key western allies over Israel and how the war in Gaza is being conducted. Both Israel and the US have condemned moves to recognize a Palestinian state.
    


            Luxon announced Monday that New Zealand would consider its position on recognizing a Palestinian state over the next month, prompting fierce criticism at home for what is considered by some to be a lack of action on Israel.
    


Anas Al-Sharif became the face of the war in Gaza for millions. Then Israel killed him



            Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, who went on to lead the United Nation's Development Program after exiting domestic politics, lambasted Luxon's coalition government on Tuesday for not moving quickly enough.
    


            “We now really seem to stand for nothing except you know, somehow wanting to save our own skin in a tariff war,” she told New Zealand's public broadcaster RNZ on Tuesday. “I think it's really quite a humiliating position for New Zealand to be in.”
    


            On Wednesday, Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick was kicked out of Parliament for refusing to apologize for comments she made suggesting coalition lawmakers grow a spine and support a bill to sanction Israel.
    


            “If we find six of 68 government MPs (members of Parliament) with a spine, we can stand on the right side of history,” said Swarbrick Tuesday.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — A mother, father and child were killed when a tree fell on their car during heavy rain and flooding in Tennessee, an official said Wednesday.

The three were killed when saturated ground caused a large tree to fall in the Chattanooga suburb of East Ridge just after midnight, Hamilton County Office of Emergency Management spokesperson Amy Maxwell said.

A search was also ongoing Wednesday for a man who walked through a flooded road in Chattanooga on Tuesday night but hadn't been seen since, Maxwell said.

The full extent of the damage isn't yet known. County officials planned to tour the damage Wednesday morning, Maxwell said. 

The flooding prompted rescues of people stuck in homes and swamped vehicles on Tuesday, and the region was bracing for more rainfall and flooding Wednesday. Hamilton County Mayor Weston Wamp declared a local state of emergency Tuesday night. Residents were urged to exercise extreme caution.

The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of middle Tennessee through Wednesday night, warning of scattered flash flooding with tropical-like heavy rainfall and the possibility of training storms, especially over already saturated areas.

Chattanooga Fire crews rescued people trapped in vehicles and residents stuck in their homes, fire department officials said. Flooding closed parts of Interstate 24 in the area, but it reopened once floodwaters receded.

Swiftwater rescue teams rescued residents of three East Ridge homes trapped by rising floodwaters, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Austin Garrett said the flooding was more extensive than he had seen before, noting that it is usually concentrated in one area, The Chattanooga Times Free Press reported.

“This is extremely widespread. It made it difficult for us to even get here ourselves to try to help other people,” he said. “So no, I've never seen it to this extent, this widespread in so many areas and impacting travel the way it is.”

It turns out many Americans aren't great at identifying which personal decisions contribute most to climate change.

A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren't very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned.

Many Americans overestimate the impact of small climate actions like recycling and underestimate high-impact choices like avoiding long-haul flights, a recent PNAS Nexus study finds.

“People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,” said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.

The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.




Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.

How the human brain is wired also plays a role.

“You can see the bottle being recycled. That's visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that's invisible to the human eye. So that's why we don't associate emissions with flying,” said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia. 

Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. “Recycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It's less discussed,” she said. “As a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.”

Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations. 

“There has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.

Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy. 

“People just don't associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people's minds,” Zhao said.

Not all pets are the same, however. Zhao owns a dog and three rabbits. 

“I can adopt 100 bunnies that will not be close to the emissions of a dog, because my dog is a carnivore,” she said. 

 The owner of a meat-eating pet can lower their impact by looking for food made from sources other than beef. Zhao, for example, tries to minimize her dog's carbon footprint by feeding her less carbon-intensive protein sources, including seafood and turkey.

Planes emit a lot of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, also greenhouse gases. Additionally, planes emit contrails, or vapor trails that prevent planet-warming gases from escaping into space. A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency. 

Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates. 

Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.

Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.

Experts say the best way to combat the human tendency to miscalculate climate-related decisions is with more readily available information. Zhao said that people are already more accurate in their estimations than they would have been 10 or 20 years ago because it's easier to learn. 

The study backs up that hypothesis. After participants finished ranking actions, the researchers corrected their mistakes, and they changed which actions they said they'd take to help the planet. 

“People do learn from these interventions,” Vlasceanu said. “After learning, they are more willing to commit to actually more impactful actions.”

Palestinians in Gaza City were anxiously awaiting the arrival on Wednesday of a truck to bring clean drinking water to families living in crowded tents and poor conditions. That happened as large plumes of smoke were seen rising into the sky above Gaza City and Deir al-Balah as Israel continued its offensive in the enclave.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli gunfire killed at least 25 people seeking aid in Gaza on Wednesday, health officials and witnesses said, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will “allow” Palestinians to leave during an upcoming military offensive in some of the territory's most populated areas.

Netanyahu wants to realize U.S. President Donald Trump's vision of relocating much of Gaza's population of over 2 million people through what he refers to as “voluntary migration” — and what critics have warned could be ethnic cleansing.

“Give them the opportunity to leave! First, from combat zones, and also from the strip if they want,” Netanyahu said in an interview aired Tuesday with Israeli TV station i24 to discuss the planned offensive in areas that include Gaza City, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people shelter. “We are not pushing them out but allowing them to leave.”

Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals, which received the bodies, said people were shot on their way to aid distribution sites or while awaiting convoys entering Gaza.

Efforts to revive ceasefire talks have resumed after apparently breaking down last month. Hamas and Egyptian officials met Wednesday in Cairo, according to Hamas official Taher al-Nounou.

Israel has no plans to send its negotiating team to talks in Cairo, Netanyahu's office said.

Israel's plans to widen its military offensive against Hamas to parts of Gaza it does not yet control have sparked condemnation at home and abroad, and could be intended to raise pressure on Hamas to reach a ceasefire.




The militants still hold 50 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war. Israel believes around 20 are still alive. Families fear a new offensive endangers them.

When asked by i24 News if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal, Netanyahu responded that he wanted all hostages back, alive and dead.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce.

Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The militant group has refused to disarm.

Israel and South Sudan are in talks about relocating Palestinians to the war-torn East African nation, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.

The office of Israel's deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, said she was arriving in South Sudan for meetings in the first visit there by a senior Israeli government official, but she did not plan to broach the subject of moving Palestinians.

South Sudan's ministry of foreign affairs in a statement called reports that it was engaging in discussions with Israel about resettling Palestinians baseless.

The AP previously reported that the United States and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for Palestinians uprooted from Gaza.

Among those killed while seeking aid were 14 Palestinians in the Teina area approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from a food distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to staff at Nasser hospital.

Hashim Shamalah said Israeli troops fired toward them as people tried to get through. Many were shot and fell while fleeing, he said.

Israeli gunfire killed five other Palestinians while trying to reach another GHF distribution site in the Netzarim corridor area, according to Awda hospital and witnesses. The Israeli military said it wasn't aware of any casualties from Israeli fire in that area.

GHF said there were no incidents at or near its sites Wednesday.

The U.S. and Israel support GHF, an American contractor, as an alternative to the United Nations, which they claim allows Hamas to siphon off aid. The U.N., which has delivered aid throughout Gaza for decades when conditions allow, denies the allegations.

Aid convoys from other groups travel within 100 meters (328 feet) of GHF sites and draw crowds. An overwhelming majority of violent incidents over the past few weeks have been related to those convoys, the GHF said.

Israeli fire killed at least six other people waiting for aid trucks close to the Morag corridor, which separates parts of southern Gaza, Nasser hospital said.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that it killed last week a Hamas militant who took part in the 2023 attack that started the war. It blamed Abdullah Saeed Abd al-Baqin for participating in the abduction of three Israeli hostages. 

The Hamas-led attack abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's air and ground offensive has since displaced most of Gaza's population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. The offensive has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.

An Israeli settler shot dead a Palestinian on Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks toward an off-duty soldier and another person carrying out “engineering works” near the village of Duma, lightly wounding them. It said the soldier initially fired warning shots, then opened fire in self-defense.

The Health Ministry identified the deceased as Thamin Dawabshe, 35, a distant relative of a family targeted in a 2015 firebombing in the village by a settler. That attack killed a toddler and his parents. The attacker was convicted and handed three life sentences.

The West Bank has seen a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks since the start of the war in Gaza, and the Israeli military has carried out major military operations there. Rights groups and Palestinians say the military often turns a blind eye to violent settlers or intervenes to protect them.

Gaza's Health Ministry says 106 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war and 129 adults have died since late June.

The U.N. says it and humanitarian partners still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities who prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed.

Gildan Activewear is buying the struggling HanesBrands for $2.2 billion in a deal that gives the basic apparel maker access to household name brands like Hanes and Maidenform.

The companies put the transaction's valued at about $4.4 billion when HanesBrands' debt is included. 

Gildan, in addition to its namesake brand, also makes American Apparel and Peds. 

HanesBrands' sales have fallen for three consecutive years and it hasn't turned an annual profit since 2021. 

The North Carolina company sold its Champion brand last year to Authentic Brands Group for more than $1 billion. In February Target announced a multiyear strategic partnership with Champion, with products from the brand rolling out in the retailer's store and on its website starting this month.

“As part of Gildan, HanesBrands will benefit from an even stronger financial and operational foundation that will provide new growth opportunities – helping to power further innovation, a broader product offering and greater reach across channels and geographies,” HanesBrands Chairman Bill Simon said in a statement Wednesday.

HanesBrands shareholders will receive 0.102 common shares of Gildan and 80 cents in cash for each share of HanesBrands common stock. They will own about 19.9% of Gildan stock once the deal closes.

Gildan has been experiencing some upheaval as well. In May 2024 its entire board resigned and appointed the nominees of activist investor Browning West as their replacements. CEO Vince Tyra also stepped down. 




Gildan's headquarters will remain in Montréal after the transaction is complete. The combined company will maintain a strong presence in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where HanesBrands is located.

Gildan said that it plans to conduct a strategic review of HanesBrands Australia, which could include a sale.

The deal is expected to close later this year or early next year. It still needs approval from HanesBrands shareholders.

Shares of HanesBrands dropped nearly 4% before the market opened after spiking 28% Tuesday on rumors of a buyout.

University of Alabama Zeta Tau Alpha member Kylan Darnell says she is taking a pause from this year's recruitment activities to focus on her mental health (Credit: kylan_darnell via TikTok)

University of Alabama senior and Zeta Tau Alpha member Kylan Darnell has announced she is taking a ""step back"" from recruitment and from posting about the sorority rush craze sweeping college campuses.

Darnell, the reigning Miss Ohio Teen USA, has spent the past three years sharing an inside look at sorority life, becoming one of the most recognizable faces in the ""Bama Rush"" phenomenon that has captivated college campuses and social media users alike. But this year, she says, will be different.

""I just wanted to come on here because I am somebody that has painted my whole college life, my whole sorority life online,"" Darnell said in a TikTok video. ""There's been good and bad. But today, I'm not all dressed up for recruitment. I've personally decided to take a mental health day for the next three days.""

Raised in Ohio, far from the deep-rooted Southern sorority traditions, Darnell admitted she arrived at the University of Alabama with little understanding of rush.

""I had no idea my life would turn into what it has,"" she said. ""I didn't know you weren't supposed to post on social media. I didn't know it was frowned upon. I had no idea about the backlash, or the positivity, that would come with it.""

Brandis Bradley, a sorority coach, referred to the recruitment process as ""psychological warfare"" in an interview with PEOPLE.

""It's emotional boot camp,"" Bradley told the outlet. ""And their frontal lobes aren't even fully developed.""

Darnell's introduction to Greek life came when her mother took her to Sorority Row before freshman year. ""I was hooked,"" she recalled, despite initial hesitation from her parents. With no friends and no knowledge of the houses, she threw herself into rush with fresh eyes.

On the first day of recruitment, Darnell filmed a short TikTok explaining the process to her family's group chat. That casual clip went viral before she'd even finished orientation, catapulting her into influencer status. Since then, she's garnered 1.2M faithful followers and 82.7 million likes, sharing everything from philanthropy events to sisterhood activities.

While she described the journey as ""fun"" and ""something I wouldn't trade,"" Darnell said it hasn't been easy.

""It's also been really hard to navigate college while being under a microscope,"" Darnell previously told Fox News Digital. ""People forget that we're real people.""

The scrutiny has intensified over time, she said, and this year's rush feels ""a lot worse"" and ""more amped up."" She asked followers not to tag her in posts about other girls, saying it only fuels unnecessary drama.

""I put myself in a position to be talked about online, but please… just don't involve me in other girls' posts,"" she urged.

Darnell said her decision to step back isn't about discouraging others from rushing; in fact, she still supports it, but wants to protect her own well-being.

""I was somebody that my freshman through junior year, I lived for my sorority. I loved my sorority. I loved waking up and showing you guys the sides of it, what we would do, the activities, the sisterhood, the philanthropy. It was so much fun to me,"" Darnell said. 

""There was a point in my life that my personality was sorority, but I've grown, and it's not really like that anymore.""

Darnell said her decision to ""take a couple steps back"" is to protect her own peace.

""I personally feel that if I was to post this year and to promote it (rush), then I would be doing those girls an injustice,"" Darnell explained. 

""Now I'm not saying don't rush. I loved it. But I'm just saying that I'm in a mental health spot where I've been struggling. I can't go online this year and I won't lie to you guys about it. I've just not been enjoying it. I've not been having fun."" 

Support poured in from followers, with one commenter praising her ""integrity at such a young age"" and another writing, ""Always choose you and what's best for you. Your TikTok fam has your back!""

Darnell said while she is still an active member of her sorority, she will take the next three days off from posting online and helping with recruitment to help her little sister with rush and enjoy time with her family.

""My family's here, my friends are here and I'm gonna help my little sister go through recruitment because I can already tell it's gonna be really hard for her. That is why I'm not participating this morning. I just need a break because I can't lie to myself anymore this week because I'm really struggling with it. Anyway, I love you all."" 

Bid Day for thousands of Alabama sorority hopefuls is set for August 17, but this year, Darnell will be watching from the sidelines, prioritizing peace over performance.

The small town of Mason, Tenn., has approved plans to turn a former prison into a migrant detention facility. 

CoreCivic, a private company, is set to operate the site following the approval of its contract, the Associated Press reported. The facility, which is now slated for conversion into a migrant detention center, was shuttered in 2021 after then-President Joe Biden ordered the Justice Department to halt the renewal of contracts with private detention facilities. 

On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump rescinded Biden's order.

NEW JERSEY'S BAN ON PRIVATELY OPERATED ICE DETENTION CENTERS STRUCK DOWN BY COURT

The Tuesday night meeting was attended by dozens of protesters and the scene frequently devolved into shouting matches, according to Fox 13 Memphis. Mason Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan told the outlet that while he voted in favor of CoreCivic, he ""really had to do some soul searching"" and ultimately decided to abstain from the second vote, which concerned ICE's contract.

Census data shows that Mason has a population of just 1,337 and has a median household income of just over $47,000.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman told Action News 5, an NBC affiliate, that the town saw this as a business opportunity and that it has ""nothing to do with"" anything going on inside the facility. The mayor, who is an Egyptian-American immigrant, also said that he is ""looking for the best interest of the town,"" which in his view is to bring back jobs.

TRUMP SAYS ONLY WAY OUT OF ‘ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ' IS DEPORTATION

However, some of the townspeople's ire may be because CoreCivic has faced $44.7 million in fines across multiple prisons, with the latest case happening in February, but it has had problems since 2022, including understaffing violations, the Associated Press reported. The outlet said it had reviewed documents showing that the company spent over $4.4 million to settle 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints about mistreatment, which included at least 22 inmate deaths.

As the Trump administration pushes to deport illegal immigrants, some states have moved to partner with the federal government to expand ICE detention facilities. This includes Florida's Alligator Alcatraz, which recently hit a roadblock after a federal judge blocked construction at the facility. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has vowed to fight back.

On Aug. 5, ICE announced its second state partnership, this time with Indiana, which will use part of the Miami Correctional Center for the ""Speedway Slammer,"" which will house migrants.

""Thanks to Governor Braun for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country. If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Indiana's Speedway Slammer. Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

Fox News Digital reached out to CoreCivic but did not receive a response in time for publication.

State Rep. James Talarico, D-Texas, discusses how Democrats are standing up to the redistricting move in his state on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants the Justice Department to investigate groups tied to Beto O'Rourke and George Soros for allegedly funding Texas Democrats' exodus from the state.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to open an investigation into whether O'Rourke's Powered by People political action committee (PAC) and the Soros-linked Texas Majority PAC have acted ""in violation of federal public corruption and election laws"" for raising funds to help Texas state Democrats leave the state during the redistricting special session.

""I write today to encourage an investigation of the entities funding this charade,"" Cornyn wrote in a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital. ""News reports make clear that PACs tied to Beto O'Rourke and megadonors such as George Soros are supporting the legislators, along with other campaign entities.""

The Texas Democrats fled the state in an effort to kill a special session called by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to redraw maps in the Lone Star State. The lawmakers fled in a bid to prevent a quorum to prevent legislation from moving forward.

Cornyn previously called on FBI Director Kash Patel to help find the legislators. His latest letter comes on the heels of reports from the Texas Tribune that O'Rourke's PAC has played a major role in financially supporting the roughly 50 Democrats who departed for New York and Illinois, paying for airfare, lodging and helping with the $500-per-day fines the lawmakers face for skipping the legislative session.

The Soros-aligned PAC is also reportedly working with national fundraising groups to secure additional funding for the legislators.

Fox News Digital reached out to both organizations for comment.

However, the Texas state Senate advanced the new maps on Tuesday night and the missing House Democrats are reportedly planning to return to the state. Now, the Texas state House must vote on the redistricting changes for them to become law. The special session is slated to end next Tuesday, though Abbott has said he would call another in the face of the Democrats' opposition tactics.

Cornyn charged that if legislators took money and gifts in exchange for using their official position to prevent a quorum call, then they may have committed honest services fraud or Hobbs Act Extortion. And by crossing state lines, he noted, the lawmakers could be in violation of the federal Travel Act, ""if they did so with the intent to break either federal or state laws.""

He said that ""at a minimum, it appears likely that Texas state bribery and corruption laws may have been broken"" by both the legislators who accepted benefits and the groups linked to O'Rourke and Soros ""who provided these corrupt funds.""

And O'Rourke's group may have violated federal campaign finance laws for spending money in prohibited ways, Cornyn noted, like ""expenditures being made for individuals' personal use, which would include food, lodging, and travel unrelated to electioneering activities.""

""I therefore request that you also work with the [Federal Election Commission] to examine both the sources of funding for the special interest groups and PACs funding the House members' dereliction of duty and how those funds have been spent to ensure compliance with all federal laws and regulations,"" he wrote.

Cornyn's request also follows a similar demand made by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The pair is locked in an already bloody primary battle to capture the Republican nomination for Senate in the Lone Star State.

Paxton on Tuesday requested that a Texas district judge jail O'Rourke over allegations that he violated a court order issued last week that prohibited fundraising meant to back the efforts by Texas Democratic lawmakers to blow up the redistricting effort.

Cornyn noted that the lawmakers' flight not only blocked the redistricting effort, but also harmed legislation that would provide aid to victims of the recent devastating Texas floods.

""The special session will end in a matter of days, at which point, assistance to flood victims and other needed measures will go unaddressed,"" Cornyn said. ""The absconding House members' dereliction of duty is truly shameful.""

Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff has the details on President Donald Trump's public safety emergency. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum pushes back against Democrats' claim that crime is down in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump on Monday moved to federalize policing in the nation's capital, following years of unchecked violent crime in Washington, D.C. 

The polarizing move has caused an uproar from opponents, and celebrations from supporters who want to see an end to violence in the city. The move comes after Washington has garnered national attention with a string of high-profile incidents in recent months and years that precipitated Trump's move. 

However, not everyone agrees with Trump's new plan.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)

Fox News contributor and former D.C. homicide detective Ted Williams is among those who oppose the federal intervention. ""While the president may mean well, this is going nowhere fast,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""D.C. is not a war zone. The lawsuits for constitutional violations are coming. This is overkill."" 

He also said criminals will just wait out the federalization, and return when National Guard troops are pulled from the streets. 

""Jo Jo and his boys are going on vacation and will return after this crazy experiment ends.""

National Fraternal Order of Police President Joe Gamaldi likes Trump's plan. 

""Their average homicide rate has doubled in the last 10 years. They used to average less than 100 homicides. Now they average over 200,"" Gamaldi said, a claim which is backed up by the city's own data. 

""And it's because you have a radical element on that city council that has defunded their police. They have embraced revolving door criminal justice policies. And frankly, they treated the hardworking men and women of law enforcement in that town like crap. So, of course, they need help. You have to do something, otherwise it's going to get out of control.""

Below is a list of some of the most notorious crimes the city has seen.

In the early morning hours of Aug. 3, an ex-Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer was beaten during an attempted carjacking in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood.

Edward Coristine, known as ""Big Balls,"" was confronted by a group of teens while out with his significant other. Police said he pushed the woman into his vehicle to protect her and bore the brunt of the wrath of the criminals. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

Nearby patrol officers intervened, and the attackers escaped on foot, but not before Coristine was left bloodied. 

A 15-year-old male and a 15-year-old female have been arrested in connection with the crime. They face charges of unarmed carjacking.

Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, was shot June 30 on the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest. He died a day later. He was a student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst and was interning for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan. 

Several people exited a vehicle and began firing shots. The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said Tarpinian-Jachym was not the target of the shooting.

A 16-year-old male and an adult female were shot, but both survived. The FBI is assisting MPD in the case's investigation. No suspects have been captured. 

On May 21, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed while leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. 

The victims were Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli, and Sarah Milgrim, an American. 

Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago was captured immediately. He has been charged not only with the murders, but with federal hate crimes. He allegedly shouted ""Free, free Palestine!"" while in custody.

TRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS

On the night of May 17, a mob of about 100 teenagers terrorized the Navy Yard neighborhood a block from Nationals Park. 

It was the second such teen takeover in less than a month. 

At about 8 p.m., police began receiving calls about disorderly conduct, but the situation quickly turned violent. One group of teens beat two bystanders, punching them, knocking them to the ground and then stomping on them, according to WUSA9.

A similar fight broke out later. Fox News Digital obtained video of the incident: 

On May 9, a staffer from California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs' office was the victim of an armed carjacking in the Navy Yard neighborhood. 

The staffer, who remained unnamed, was robbed of a government-issued iPhone, MacBook, ID and Capitol parking pass. 

The next day, the car was recovered, and a 15-year-old juvenile male of Washington was charged with armed carjacking, and a 14-year-old juvenile male of Maryland was charged with carrying a pistol without a license and unauthorized use of a vehicle.

In late 2023, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, was carjacked by armed, masked men outside an apartment building that is a popular residence for members of congress, also in the Navy Yard neighborhood. 

At the time, Cuellar said he made the conscious decision not to fight back for his own safety. 

He condemned the crime, calling the criminals ""punks with guns,"" and touched on soft-on-crime policies, noting that if criminals are put in jail, ""you've got to lock them up and keep them there.""

In February 2023, Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., was attacked in the elevator of her apartment in the nation's capital. 

Police identified 26-year-old Kendrick Hamlin as the suspect. Craig said Hamlin punched her in the chin and grabbed her by the neck. 

Craig said she fended him off with the hot cup of coffee she was carrying.

Vice President JD Vance speaks on gerrymandering concerns, President Donald Trump's calls for a new census, the latest on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Russiagate, the Epstein case and the possibility of a Vance-Rubio ticket in 2028.

Vice President JD Vance is poised to meet with U.S. troops at a military installation in England Wednesday – capping off a high-stakes trip to the U.K. meeting with European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine ahead of President Donald Trump's Friday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Vance's visit to the U.K. comes as he's sought to lay some groundwork with European allies leading up to Trump's talk with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska – and as he's turned up the heat on them to take greater ownership in the discussions since the conflict is in their backyard. 

The vice president is slated to visit Royal Air Force Base Fairford, where the U.S. Air Force's 501st Combat Support Wing and the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron are based. Vance, a former Marine, is expected to voice appreciation for their service, according to a source familiar with Vance's prepared remarks. 

VLADIMIR PUTIN TO RETURN TO US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE

Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (L) hosts a meeting with US Vice President JD Vance (R) at Chevening House, in Chevening, southeast England, on August 8, 2025.  

The military installation serves as a key location for U.S. Air Force operations and is Air Force Global Strike Command's preferred bomber forward operating base in Europe. U.S. Air Force bombers are regularly deployed to the military base as part of Bomber Task Force Europe 25-2 to integrate with NATO allies and sharpen the service's global strike capabilities. 

Days after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, several Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers from Fairford conducted joint operations with Germany and Romania over NATO's eastern flank.

There are approximately 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in the U.K., according to foreign policy think tank Council on Foreign Relations. 

Prior to addressing U.S. troops, Vance is poised to participate in calls with European leaders to discuss the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Fox News Digital has learned. 

The calls come on the heels of multiple other discussions with European allies on a series of topics – including the war – during Vance's U.K. visit. Vance has met with multiple U.K. leaders, including U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy. 

A U.S. official told Fox News Digital that Vance and Lammy discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. and the two allies' shared economic and technology goals during a meeting on Friday at Lammy's official residence, Chevening House, in Kent, England. 

SUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP'S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE

U.S. Vice President JD Vance fishes with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy at Chevening House on August 8, 2025 in Sevenoaks, England.  

Meanwhile, the two leaders also discussed the state of affairs in the Middle East, as well as negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. official said. 

The two also met with representatives of Ukraine and other European allies at Chevening House on Saturday. The meeting led to ""significant progress"" on ending the conflict in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. 

No other details were provided regarding the Ukraine talks. It's unclear if Vance will accompany Trump to Alaska for talks with Putin. 

However, Vance said in an interview with Fox News that he communicated to European leaders that the U.S. is ""done with the funding of the Ukraine war business,"" and that European allies must assume more responsibility in ending the conflict. 

""What we said to Europeans is simply, first of all, this is in your neck of the woods, this is in your back door, you guys have got to step up and take a bigger role in this thing, and if you care so much about this conflict you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself,"" Vance told Fox News on Sunday. 

Congress has passed multiple measures to support Ukraine, totaling at least $175 billion in spending to aid Ukraine since February 2022, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Meanwhile, Trump told reporters Monday that he'd know within minutes is Putin actually interested in a deal or not. Still, he said Moscow and Kyiv must come to terms with some ""land swapping"" issues to sign off on a deal. 

""If it's a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,"" Trump said. ""I may say, ‘lots of luck, keep fighting,' or I may say we can make a deal.""

Trump's meeting with Putin also comes as his relationship with the Russian leader has soured as peace negotiations have lagged. While the two seemed to remain cordial with each other publicly during Trump's first administration, that's changed in recent weeks as Trump has grown fed up with Putin's tactics. 

""We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on July 8. ""He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says homeless people in the nation's capital who refuse care could face jail time if they refuses assistance at a shelter.

The White House says those living in homeless encampments in the nation's capital will have two choices in the coming days: accept treatment at a homeless shelter, or go to jail.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the ultimatum during a Tuesday press conference as reporters prodded about President Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s law enforcement. She said many of the homeless encampments across the city have already been dismantled, and those that remain she expected to be dealt with this week.

""Seventy homeless encampments have been removed by the U.S. Park Police,"" Leavitt said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Department would be joining the Park Police in the effort. ""There are only two homeless encampments remaining in D.C. federal parks under the National Park Service's jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.""

Asked about what options are available to those in homeless encampments, Leavitt was blunt: ""homeless shelters, for addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now.""

Trump himself had floated the idea of relocating homeless encampments to locations well outside the city. Leavitt confirmed the administration is ""exploring"" the option, but said it is not yet on the table.

A tour by Fox News Digital found that many former hotspots for the homeless have been cleared, with only abandoned clothing and scattered food containers left behind as signs of recent life as of this week.

TRUMP INCREASES FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE IN DC FOLLOWING VIOLENT CRIME SURGE

In other parts of the city — including the heart of downtown — the homeless population continued to stake out places to sleep and gather in parks or on busy street corners.

At one park, about a dozen people were clustered together with their belongings and a few tents, seemingly unaware of the new crackdown. A dried red substance was splattered across the sidewalk outside their makeshift encampment.

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

Trump has repeatedly characterized Washington, D.C., as ""one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world."" On Saturday, Trump said his administration will ""essentially, stop violent crime"" in the nation's capital.

The renewed focus follows a series of violent incidents in the city, some involving federal staffers, including a high-profile former employee from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) who was a victim of an attempted carjacking.

""We have a capital that's very unsafe, you know, we just almost lost a young man, beautiful, handsome guy that got the hell knocked out of him,"" Trump said, referencing former DOGE employee Edward Coristine.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accused former President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder of “brutally” gerrymandering the country in the most recent U.S. census.

The topic of redistricting has been at the national forefront since Texas unveiled an aggressive plan to strip the Democrats of five congressional seats, threatening a nationwide gerrymandering arms race. In an appearance on Fox News's Hannity, DeSantis blamed the state of affairs on the Obama administration, alleging wrongdoing in its alleged influence on the 2020 census.

“Well, Obama and Holder gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade's census. They actually even got into Florida, and I had to veto the legislature's map, and I ended up proposing one which was a much fairer map and much better,” he said.

DeSantis then turned his ire toward the government of California.

“California is gerrymandered. They have a commission, but that's a ruse. They have Democrats on the commission, liberal independents, and liberal Republicans. And so their map now is gerrymandered, and Gavin wants to do it even more,” he said.

NEWSOM CALLS ON TRUMP TO END REDISTRICTING PUSH: ‘PLAYING WITH FIRE'

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has threatened to retaliate against Texas with an aggressive redistricting plan to rid the Golden State of many Republican seats if the plan goes through.

“We don't move unless they move,” Newsom said of Texas. “This is triggered. They drew first blood. We're responding to this action, and this is how we choose to respond.”

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to restore about a third of research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles by next week.

U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled the federal government's funding cuts late last month violated her June preliminary injunction that ordered the return of federal funding to UCLA. The latest ruling only applies to some 300 grants frozen by the National Science Foundation between July 30 and Aug. 12. About 800 UCLA grants, totaling $584 million, were gifted by the independent agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy.

“NSF's actions violate the Preliminary Injunction,” Lin wrote in the 12-page order.

Tuesday's ruling handed another win to six UC researchers who filed the lawsuit challenging the grant terminations.

The plaintiffs take issue with the administration's categorization of the funding cuts as “suspensions” instead of “terminations” to avoid the court's order. The government argued it treated the funding cuts as “suspensions,” allowing universities such as Harvard University and Columbia University to take “corrective actions” or enter settlement agreements. The judge finds no difference between the terms.

“Though there may be situations where a ‘termination' and ‘suspension' are not the same thing, there is no principled difference between a ‘termination' and the immediate, indefinite, and ‘final' ‘suspension' of funding in this context,” the San Francisco-based judge wrote. “The suspensions have the same effect, and are based on the same type of deficient explanations, as the original terminations.”

Harvard is reportedly nearing a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration to begin restoring the school's $2.2 billion in funding that was frozen over antisemitism allegations on campus. The deal would come after Columbia reached a similar settlement, totaling $221 million, to resolve a number of investigations into violations of federal antidiscrimination laws, particularly those related to antisemitism.

The Trump administration is actively pursuing a $1 billion settlement with UCLA, substantially more than Columbia's. UCLA has yet to make a decision on this development.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) vowed to sue the administration over the proposed settlement demand. The White House responded aggressively, telling the governor to “bring it on.”

WHITE HOUSE SAYS ‘BRING IT ON, GAVIN!' AS FIGHT OVER $1 BILLION UCLA PAYMENT INTENSIFIES

“This administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the First Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. “UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples I will forward to Gavin Newsom's press office if he hasn't seen them himself.”

The Trump administration is ordered to comply with Lin's order regarding UCLA by Aug. 19. Otherwise, it will have to explain why the funding was not restored. The federal government may appeal the ruling to the Ninth Circuit.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau has made 10 arrests as part of President Donald Trump's effort to crack down on crime in the capital.

In a post on X, Patel gave his first update on the FBI's effort to assist Trump with his initiative to “make D.C. safe again.” Over the first night, the FBI made arrests on a search warrant for a prior murder charge, unlawful possession of firearms, multiple outstanding warrants for DUI, and a violation of a restraining order, among others.

“These are just a few examples — we are just getting started,” he said. “Federal partners joined local police and arrested 23 in total. When you let good cops be cops they can clean up our streets and do it fast.”

“More to come,” Patel vowed. “Your nation's Capital WILL be safe again.”

On the first big push of FBI supporting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump initiative to make DC safe again, FBI reported 10 arrests with partners. These include:-One arrest on a search warrant for a prior murder charge-Multiple unlawful possession of firearms-Multiple outstanding…

On Monday, Trump announced “Liberation Day” for Washington, federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department and activating the National Guard. The FBI was one of several agencies assisting Trump's crackdown.

White House officials said Trump will mobilize roughly 800 National Guard troops to assist the MPD with logistics, transportation, and guarding federal and law enforcement facilities. The federalization is expected to last 30 days, and Attorney General Pam Bondi will be in charge of the federalized MPD.

“This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,” Trump told reporters in the White House press briefing room. “We're taking it back under the authorities vested in me as the president of the United States. I'm officially invoking Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act — you know what that is — and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control.”

He added that the National Guard troops would be “allowed to do their job properly.”

LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS DC ‘MOST DANGEROUS PLACE' ON EARTH IN DEFENDING TRUMP POLICE TAKEOVER

The move was met with backlash, with critics arguing the move was unnecessary, pointing to city data showing a significant decrease in crime over the past year. Defenders have accused city officials of manipulating the numbers. A Washington police commander was suspended last month after accusing MPD Chief Pamela Smith and other top department brass of falsely manipulating crime statistics.

Trump floated the idea of taking over Washington during his 2024 presidential campaign, bemoaning the state of the district. The first seven months of his second term went by without much focus on the issue until earlier this month, when a Department of Government Efficiency staffer was assailed by several juveniles. An enraged Trump held up the attack as symptomatic of the deteriorating conditions in the capital, vowing to take drastic measures to restore the city to its former glory.

President Donald Trump's decision to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has Democrats renewing calls for D.C. statehood, while Republicans cite the takeover as grounds to revoke Washington's home rule.

Trump announced Monday that he will, in addition to taking control of the MPD, activate the National Guard in coordination with several federal law enforcement agencies to combat violent crime in Washington.

DC POLICE UNION BLAMES COUNCILMAN FOR CRIME SURGE: ‘IT'S YOUR FAULT'

Democrats have been quick to blast Trump's decision to federalize the MPD, which is expected to last 30 days, as an unnecessary overstep of his authority, though Washington has unique control over the capital. The president's move also has reignited calls from national and local leaders, as well as voters, to grant Washington statehood.

While city officials have pointed to local police reports showing a 30-year decline in violent crime rates, the rise of crimes committed by juveniles in several Washington neighborhoods, some not even a mile from the Capitol building, has prompted the president to take action and “take our capital back.”

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), a longtime advocate for statehood, criticized both Trump's federal takeover of Washington and his suggestion that Congress repeal the D.C. Home Rule Act, which would abolish the D.C. Council and the office of the mayor and effectively leave governing the district to Congress.

“Even if crime in D.C. weren't at a historic low point, President Trump's comments would be misguided and offensive to the more than 700,000 people who live permanently in the nation's capital,” Norton said in a statement.

“Federal interference is the problem, not the solution,” she added. “The only permanent remedy that will protect D.C.'s ability to govern itself is enactment of my D.C. statehood bill into law.”

Nearly 700,000 voters in Washington do not have full representation in Congress. Norton is allowed to serve on and vote in committees, but she cannot vote on the final passage of legislation on the House floor.

Congress has exercised its power over the district more over the last few years than it has in decades. In 2022, then-President Joe Biden signed a law that overturned the D.C. Council's overhaul of the criminal code that would reduce penalties for homicides, robberies, and carjackings — the three areas that the district suffers from the most. It was the first time in 30 years that Congress repealed a local law passed by the council.

Earlier this year, the latest spending deal slashed $1 billion in the district's funding, reverting Washington to its 2024 budget as congressional Republicans began cracking down on spending. Trump has called on the House to take up a funding fix bill, which passed the Senate unanimously. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has said the fix has not made it to the floor yet due to the chamber's extensive work on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but no plans have been announced to bring the bill up for a vote when members return in September.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that the president would continue to push the House to pass the funding fix bill.

National Democrats and local activists have begun amplifying calls for statehood on social media as rallies and protests start creeping up across the district.

“STATEHOOD FOR D.C.,” the Democrats wrote on X.

The Free DC Project, which launched in January, has amplified the Democrats' and many others' posts over the last 24 hours advocating statehood. Several local groups, such as the NAACP, have urged “Hands off D.C.” and “Free D.C.” at demonstrations and rallies on Monday.

DC is our home. Trump can't have it. https://t.co/dOEYvjovgI

“Trump's actions over the last several days are increasingly dangerous for the people of DC and for American democracy,” Free DC Project said in a post. “DC belongs to the people who live here.”

The activist group's Instagram urged residents to “get loud” by going outside at 8 p.m. every day of Trump's “occupation” of Washington and “bang pots and pans, sing, chant, or make noise for five minutes.” The group has also asked residents to make posters, flags, and clothing with the #FreeDC “visible everywhere.”

Though Mayor Muriel Bowser offered a more neutral response to Trump's takeover than her Democratic colleagues, she did call the president's decision “unsettling and unprecedented” during a press conference.

“We know that access to our democracy is tenuous,” Bowser said. “That is why you have heard me, and many, many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for D.C. We are citizens. Our families go to war. We pay taxes and uphold the responsibilities of citizenship.”

Republicans, on the other hand, are rallying around Trump's federalization of the MPD and takeover of the district. While the president has threatened to do so since he arrived in office in January, the assault on a member of the Department of Government Efficiency by a group of juveniles appeared to be the last straw ahead of the president's declaration on Monday.

“Two of my staffers' cars have been stolen,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) posted on X. “Another was stabbed in the throat while his car was being broken into. DC crime is out of control and local leaders have failed to protect the public. [Trump] is right to take decisive action and bring DC police under federal control.”

Some Republicans argue that Trump's takeover of the district should serve as a warning to other Democrat-led cities.

“Hopefully, what every other blue-city mayor will do is look at what Trump's doing here and change,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) told reporters on Tuesday. “I'm optimistic that this will show D.C. you can have safety.”

Others are hoping to see the federalization of the district extend past the 30 days. To do so, both the House and Senate would need to pass a joint resolution authorizing the extension, due to the rules of the D.C. Home Rule Act.

“You should be able to walk down the street with your little girl or your little boy and feel safe in any street in America,” Rep. John McGuire (R-VA) told reporters. “And that's not the case. It seems like, over the past four years, our folks on the other side believe that criminals are good, police are bad, and no one cares about the victims. And there's so much evidence.”

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is advocating to get rid of the D.C. Home Rule Act altogether.

“We revoke DC Home Rule,” Lee wrote on X. “We govern Washington through Congress, as the Constitution originally provided. Our nation's capital deserves to be a shining example to the world, not a national embarrassment.”

In February, Lee and Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) introduced the Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident, or BOWSER, Act, which would repeal the D.C. Home Rule Act.

When asked if Trump is interested in ending the D.C. Home Rule Act, Leavitt said Trump is “very much still interested in working with Congress to address many of the issues that have plagued Washington, D.C., such as the cashless bail policy, which has been a complete disaster for the city. Juvenile delinquency is another major problem in the city that Congress can address.”

DC OFFICIALS CONDEMN TRUMP MPD TAKEOVER AS BOWSER STRIKES CALMER TONE

The House of Representatives has passed the statehood bill twice: once in 2020 and again in 2021 when Democrats had control of the lower chamber. However, the real hurdle is in the Senate, where a 60-vote threshold must be reached to pass the bill.

Given the GOP majority in the Senate, that statehood bill is all but assured to be dead on arrival if it manages to skate through the narrow margins in the House this Congress, though it is unlikely Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) would allow the bill to come to the floor. Democrats would likely need to turn to a discharge petition, but slim margins mean a few Republicans would need to join the minority to push the measure onto the floor.

The district is considered to be a solid blue territory, and its residents earned the right to vote in presidential elections in 1961. Republicans would be unlikely to support a measure that would grant the district statehood and likely two new blue Senate seats.

In the meantime, Norton and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said they will reintroduce their legislation to grant the district full control over the MPD and D.C. National Guard when Congress returns in September.

“Trump's raw authoritarian power grab in D.C. is part of a growing national crisis,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “He's playing dictator in our nation's capital as a dress rehearsal as he pushes democracy to the brink. While we continue to fight for statehood for D.C., Trump's assault on D.C.'s autonomy makes it all the more critical that we give the District full control over its own National Guard and police department. This is not just about self-governance for D.C. – it's also about preventing authoritarian overreach by a lawless president like we are witnessing today.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3498063/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

By design, antifa is a decentralized, left-wing movement of loosely knit “resistance” networks operating primarily in Democratic strongholds. But in recent years, antifa's forces have become highly organized and increasingly sophisticated, with organized crime cells cropping up across the country. Part 3 of this Washington Examiner series, Antifa, Inc., will explore what it would take to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and assess the implications of that designation.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have long entertained the idea of designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.

However, using the term “terrorists” to describe, identify, and sanction domestic groups remains a controversial topic and is considered politically charged by observers on both sides of the aisle.

As the federal statute stands, labeling antifa as a domestic terrorist threat would be largely symbolic, though some proponents support sending a public message as antifa's forces continue to terrorize communities.

Through an intimidation tactic known as “doxing,” antifa militants often publicize sensitive information such as home addresses, personal phone numbers, and private photographs of their intended targets. At times, antifa's followers have appeared outside victims' houses, answering “doxes” they see as calls to take “direct action.”

“Sometimes you have to use direct action to stop [‘fascists'] because protesting, signs, yelling is not going to do anything,” an antifa activist told VICE at the peak of the anti-Trump riots on the University of California, Berkeley's, campus. “You have to make them afraid.”

Rose City Antifa, the oldest-known and regarded as the most influential antifa chapter in the United States, has publicly posted about fighting “fascists” with militant violence: “We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy.”

LEFT-WING TERRORISM IS BACK IN BUSINESS

Now, some antifa cohorts are employing guerrilla-like tactics on par with paramilitary warfare.

In a well-coordinated July 4 “ambush,” heavily armed members of a suspected Texas antifa cell allegedly descended on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Alvarado, opening fire on law enforcement officers after luring them outside and shooting a local officer in the neck.

According to the charging documents, multiple gunmen fired from various vantage points, including at least one shooter positioned in the nearby woods. Alleged ringleader Benjamin Song, an ex-Marine reservist, reportedly provided weapons training to antifa militants in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.

MEET THE ANTIFA CELL CHARGED WITH TERRORISM AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OVER ‘AMBUSH' AT TEXAS ICE FACILITY

However, antifa attacks on ICE property and personnel, with the apparent intent to kill, are not new escalations of antifascist violence.

In 2019, self-identified “comrade” Willem van Spronsen firebombed an ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, allegedly to try to ignite a 500-gallon propane tank attached to the facility. “I am antifa,” van Spronsen's manifesto said in part. After he died in a police shootout, Seattle Antifascist Action hailed him as “another martyr in the struggle against fascism.” His death turned into a dog whistle for “direct action.”

A transgender-antifa (dubbed “trantifa”) cult called the Zizians has also emerged this year. Its kill count is allegedly up to six fatalities, including the January death of a Border Patrol agent who was shot in Vermont.

Both of President Donald Trump's administrations have supported identifying antifa as a domestic terrorism threat. However, their attempts to do so only amounted to proclamations or investigative pivots, with no actual effect on the legal landscape.

In early 2016, before Trump's first term, the Department of Homeland Security internally classified antifa activities as “domestic terrorist violence.” This description, used among officials to assess the movement's threat to national security, was not an official designation.

DHS CHARACTERIZES ANTIFA AS “DOMESTIC TERRORIST” GROUP

In 2020, at the outset of the George Floyd riots, Trump posted, “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.”

On the same day as his declaration, Trump's then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that federal authorities were treating riot-related antifa violence as domestic terrorism.

“The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” the Justice Department said in an announcement.

In accordance with this, law enforcement officials deployed the FBI's network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces to identify organizers and instigators, Barr said.

For federal investigative purposes, the FBI, whose stated No. 1 priority is protecting the U.S. against terrorist attacks, defines domestic terrorism as violent acts carried out to further ideological goals “stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.”

Antifa suspects can be subcategorized as an anarchist extremist under the classification of “Anti-Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremism,” one of the FBI's five “threat categories.”

While antifa extremists may be the subjects of domestic terrorism investigations, the federal government does not have the prosecutorial power to charge them as domestic terrorists explicitly.

FBI INVESTIGATING PEOPLE ANIMATED BY ‘ANTIFA IDEOLOGY'

This legislative session, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, has introduced H.Res.26, which would congressionally designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and deem certain conduct of antifa activists, “or any unlawful conduct performed at an Antifa-affiliated demonstration,” as domestic terrorism.

Greene's resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee in January and has not seen any congressional action since.

H.Res.26, along with Greene's 2023 version, is just one of several similar Republican-drafted resolutions targeting antifa that have been proposed. However, none of them advanced past committee referrals. Regardless, these resolutions are nonbinding, meaning they're simply declarative and would not result in punitive ramifications for antifa followers.

“The FBI's role in and dedication to investigating terrorism, both domestically and internationally, has not changed,” the agency's public affairs office previously said in response to a Washington Examiner inquiry asking if investigators were cracking down on antifa militancy.

The bureau deferred to the secretary of state regarding terrorist designations, although the State Department deals strictly with foreign matters and accordingly only designates foreign actors as terrorism threats.

No legal framework exists for designating a domestic group, antifa or otherwise, as a terrorist entity. Anti-terrorism legislation setting the criteria for State Department designations narrowly defines a terrorist organization as one operating primarily outside the U.S.

Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes the State Department to make these determinations, relies on definitions of terroristic activity and terrorism as delineated, respectively, by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act and the INA's guidelines concerning the inadmissibility of foreign nationals on terrorism-related grounds.

A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed that the agency, pursuant to statutory powers, does not designate organizations based mainly in the U.S.

The spokesperson said the department does not discuss deliberations related to designations when the Washington Examiner asked whether the U.S. offshoot of antifa, which originated in Europe, would fall within the purview.

Investigative journalist Andy Ngo, author of Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy, said he does not envision the U.S. antifa ever being deemed a domestic terrorist threat.

HOW THE ANTIFA MOVEMENT HAS METASTASIZED

Ngo, citing First Amendment protections, said the U.S. government cannot outright ban domestic extremist groups, even when certain cohorts incite terrorism and political violence.

“Any ‘labeling' of antifa as a terrorism group or network would be primarily political rhetoric, in my opinion,” Ngo told the Washington Examiner.

As specified in the FBI's interagency standards for investigating domestic terrorism, “mere advocacy of ideological positions and/or use of strong rhetoric” does not necessarily constitute violent extremism, without direct threats, nor does “generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics.” All are constitutionally protected speech.

Ngo noted that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas has not charged the alleged members of the Dallas-area antifa cell with any terrorism-linked crimes. However, the state of Texas did file state-level terrorism charges against them.

Domestic terrorism is defined in the U.S. criminal code as ideologically driven acts “dangerous to human life” and committed on U.S. soil that appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence policy via intimidation or coercion, or affect government conduct through mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.

As part of Greene's resolution, if passed, Congress would call on the DOJ to prosecute antifa-affiliated “crimes of domestic terrorism.”

However, domestic terrorism is not a stand-alone crime chargeable under federal law.

“I don't think it ever will be,” Cully Stimson, manager of the Heritage Foundation's National Security Law Program, told the Washington Examiner.

The matter has been debated on Capitol Hill for decades, but no federal authority has ever attached criminal penalties to domestic terrorism. Until an act of Congress codifies the crime of domestic terrorism, it is technically not criminalized.

Therefore, designating antifa as a domestic terrorist group is “performative” and bears no legal consequences, said Stimson, a former federal prosecutor.

“What you're doing is you're raising alarm bells that this organization is up to no good. They can be prosecuted for underlying crimes that they commit, and that may be the whole point,” he explained. “But the so-called crime of domestic terrorism does not exist.”

Indeed, the FBI's policy on opening investigations into domestic terrorism underscores that the federal statute is “definitional” and not “charging” in nature.

“[I]deology itself and the advocacy of such beliefs is not prohibited by U.S. law,” the FBI emphasizes.

Regardless of a formal designation from the DOJ, prosecutors focus on underlying criminal conduct rather than labels such as domestic terrorism, Stimson said.

COULD ANTIFA CO-CONSPIRATORS EVER FACE FEDERAL RICO CHARGES?

Stimson said he doesn't foresee lawmakers amending or adding penal code provisions with regard to domestic terrorism, given the expansive range of criminal offenses and legal procedures laid out under Title 18.

“They're not going to do it,” Stimson said. “And by the way, they don't need to do it. It's unnecessary … There's more than a sufficient amount of law on the books to go after criminal conduct.”

According to Stimson, domestic terrorism lacks criminal punishment due to these practical and political reasons.

“One person's domestic terrorist is another person's freedom fighter,” Stimson said.

The American Civil Liberties Union says terrorism is “an inherently political label, easily abused and misused.” Designating political opponents as domestic terrorists would raise due process and First Amendment concerns, the ACLU warns.

Dr. Eric Patterson, president and CEO of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, said groups seeking revolutionary violence are a cause for concern, and any criminal actions perpetrated in furtherance of a violent agenda are worth public condemnation.

WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER USE THE TERM ‘ANTI-FASCIST'

“Americans should rightfully be worried about groups that glorify the symbols of communist oppression, such as communist flags that symbolize the murder of 100 million men and women during the 20th century by Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Fidel, and other communists,” Patterson told the Washington Examiner.

“Every such movement began with misinformation campaigns and illicit violence against fellow citizens and government institutions,” he added. “As a society, we must be vigilant in calling out all forms of such intimidation and violence.”

Weapons is about a classroom of missing children—and the young schoolteacher whom all the parents want to blame.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

At the beginning of Zach Cregger's new horror film, Weapons, a spooky suburban fairy tale about the disappearance of 17 children, all blame is directed at the unmarried schoolteacher Justine (played by Julia Garner). She's the prime suspect—the one unifying factor in an otherwise unexplainable event. Each of the 17 children appears to have voluntarily fled their home at 2:17 in the morning, running into the night with their arms stretched backwards like the wings of a paper airplane. Home-surveillance cameras captured their flight, attesting to the fact that no one forced them to flee—but why were they all members of Justine's classroom? What was that woman doing to those children?

Over the years, movies such as Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, to name just a couple, have depicted chronic singledom as a condition that can make women obsessive, deranged, desperate to fill the void created by their unwantedness. But in these portrayals, it's not just that solitude seems to warp the mind: These ladies appear to disturb some kind of natural order—and be more likely to crack. Today, a growing number of Americans are romantically uninvolved. Yet pop culture continues to fixate on these single women, with horror movies in particular framing them as duplicitous and unstable—threats to the public good.

As he demonstrated in his previous feature, Barbarian, Cregger is interested in the dark forces rumbling under the surface of ordinary American lives. Weapons is set in a fictional Pennsylvania town, where the disappearance of the children sends the community reeling. School shuts down for a month, before resuming with no resolution. The police aren't much help. Everyone seems to be processing the tragedy in different ways, which is matched by the film's multi-perspectival structure. Townspeople such as Archer (Josh Brolin), the distraught father of one of the missing children, and Paul (Alden Ehrenreich), a lowly cop, are so fixated on their personal problems that they hinder the kind of collaborative action needed to save the children.

It's easier to villainize Justine, who is one of the only single women in the community. Archer, who displays vigilante tendencies, directs his rage toward Justine by digging up unsavory details from her past, such as a DUI charge, and nagging the police to further investigate her. An unseen stranger, heavily implied to be Archer, harasses Justine in her home, knocking on her front door and writing the word witch on the side of her car in stubborn red paint, forcing her to zoom around town branded with crimson letters. Grief-stricken parents and angry community members also revolt against her, pressuring the school's genial principal, Marcus (Benedict Wong), to do something about her.

Most people believe that Justine has done something wrong, though what, exactly, they can't explain. Women like her have been accused of being witches since the 13th century, perhaps because they deviate from maternal norms. In Weapons, Justine's lack of a family reaffirms her culpability. Elementary-school teachers are educators, but they're also parental figures. Across pop culture and in real life, mothers are supposed to do everything for their kids—even give their lives. Justine, who is as confused as anyone about what happened to those kids, seems most guilty to her neighbors because she's still alive.

Read: Time for scary movies to make us laugh again

Depressed and paranoid after all this harassment, Justine succumbs to a bad drinking habit, going about her purgatorial days with a tumbler full of vodka. She also hits up Paul for a one-night stand—and when Paul's fiancée finds out, she comes charging after Justine at the liquor store. To the fiancée, Justine must seem like a total succubus. But for Justine, the hookup is a bid for some much-needed intimacy during a period of intense alienation. (Paul had also told her that his relationship was on the rocks.)

Weapons balances this grim reality—the black-and-white way the world sees Justine, who in turn is trying to keep afloat—with a dry sense of humor and Justine's plucky resilience. She may be losing it, but she still takes it upon herself to play the sleuth, seeking out Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher), the one child in her class who didn't go missing. When she confronts him on the street, Alex runs off in a panic, but the exchange is genuinely motivated by Justine's concern. Because of the film's multiple points of view and Garner's protean performance, we're able to see how easily Justine takes on, or is foisted into, a variety of roles: nosy teacher, disgraced woman, forsaken lover.

Funnily enough, there is one other single lady in town, a recent transplant and a stranger to most: Alex's Aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan), a kooky spinster who wears bright, splotchy makeup. She knows no one and has nowhere to go before Alex's parents take her in—a kind of nightmare scenario for down-on-love bachelorettes everywhere terrified of dying alone. Cregger has previously tapped into the unsettling power of old dames: In Barbarian, a monstrous old woman who is obsessed with children is a key villain. Other recent films such as The Substance and The Front Room have used similar figures to communicate female madness and explore insecurities about aging in a culture that glorifies physical youth.

Gladys, despite her perturbing getup, doesn't arouse as much suspicion as Justine, because she steps into a maternal role as Alex's caretaker. Justine, meanwhile, continues to be a perfect scapegoat. Still, she emerges as the film's primary heroine, doggedly pursuing the truth of what happened to the kids. It's a brave choice; nobody would blame her for leaving town. But feared as she is for being a modern woman, she's brimming with personas and possibilities—some of which prove useful for unraveling awful secrets.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The only way out of our wreckage is to rewrite the cultural script, to make excellence in character admired again.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Jean Guéhenno lived in Nazi-occupied France, where, unlike so many of his contemporaries, he refused to write a word for a publishing industry under Nazi control. He felt shame about the Vichy government's collaboration with Nazi Germany. “What to make of French writers, who, to stay on the right side of the occupation authorities, decide to write about anything but the one thing all French people are thinking about,” Guéhenno asked in his journal, later published as Diary of the Dark Years, “or worse still, who, out of cowardice, bolster the occupants' plan to make it appear as though everything in France continues as it did before?”

In an essay for Liberties, Ian Buruma writes that Guéhenno's journal “is wise, witty, and scathing about his fellow writers” who had elected to proceed as if nothing had changed. “Incapable of being in hiding for long,” Guéhenno wrote, this type of literary figure “would sell his soul just to keep his name in print.”

The United States today isn't occupied France, and nothing currently in America is comparable to the worst of Nazism. But any number of regimes, though they fall short of the German Reich, act in ways that are morally problematic or even wicked. Collaboration and capitulation—the selling of a soul—take many forms, including in America.

INTEGRITY IS A VIRTUE on which good character is built. Other virtues can be admirable but isolated. One can be courageous in the pursuit of injustice. A person can be honest but ungenerous, forgiving but lazy. Al Capone, after all, sponsored a soup kitchen during the Great Depression.

Peter Wehner: The unconstitutional conservatives

Integrity—whose root word, integer, means wholeness, a thing complete in itself—assimilates other virtues. A person of integrity possesses an inner harmony, a moral coherence. As the philosopher Robert C. Solomon put it: “Integrity is not itself a virtue so much as it is a synthesis of the virtues, working together to form a coherent whole.”

Integrity is a subject of ancient interest. Plato believed that a tripartite soul included reason, desire, and spirit. For Aristotle, virtue was divided into moral and intellectual categories. Virtue was not a matter of isolated acts; it was an ingrained disposition, an orientation of the mind and heart, developed through practice and habituation. This led to a unified life, which in turn led to the highest human good: eudaemonia, or human flourishing, a life of purpose devoted to the good.

To be sure, people of integrity aren't perfect. But they are individuals who possess an internal cohesiveness among distinct parts. Their values and behavior display a consistency that is the foundation of trust and mutual respect.

“No man is a hero to his valet,” says the 18th-century proverb. Many of those who serve another see a different, darker side to those whom they serve. The closer you get to other people, the more obvious their flaws become. Their public and private lives are at odds with each other. In contrast, a life of integrity works in concert with itself, has a consistency regardless of the circumstances an individual finds themselves in. “Except for the point, the still point / There would be no dance, and there is only the dance,” T. S. Eliot wrote. People of integrity are still points in a turning world.

I'VE BEEN THINKING about integrity a lot lately, in part because more and more it's seen, certainly in politics, as unfashionable. It wasn't always this way. The central figure in the American founding, George Washington, was universally respected for his rectitude. Even the British recognized the quality of his character. (When King George III heard that Washington might surrender his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army, he reportedly said that if Washington did so, “he would be the greatest man in the world.”)

Washington was a complex and elusive figure, as his biographer Ron Chernow wrote, full of pent-up passion. But Washington was also a man of sterling character, brave, devoted to his country, civic minded, and possessed of an unsurpassed sense of duty. Although he was given great power, he never abused it. As Major General Henry Lee eulogized Washington at his funeral, “The purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.”

No other president, with the possible exception of Lincoln, was Washington's equal. But for nearly the entirety of American history, up until a decade ago, Washington set the standard. Presidents had to at least appear to be better than they were, offering the tribute that vice pays to virtue.

No more. Donald Trump's corruption is borderless, in ways we've never quite seen before. But what's also precedent-shattering is that he doesn't try to hide it. His depravity is all in the open.

That his supporters celebrate his bad behavior makes this even more discouraging. Many of them find his behavior thrilling, including large swaths of Christian fundamentalists and evangelicals, men and women who worship Jesus with their lips while giving priority to Trump and the MAGA movement in their heart. Add to the mix the craven, across-the-board capitulation to Trump by one elite institution after another—law firms and tech giants, universities and entertainment companies, news networks and once-great newspapers.

All of this ramifies through society. Every day, in a thousand different ways, Trump's corrosive ethic is validated and replicated. Cruelty is the coin of the realm; it's the way to get ahead. Americans ask themselves, and one another, the inevitable questions: If the president can get away with it, why can't we? If breaking the rules helps him, why shouldn't it help us? 

The only way out of this wreckage is to rewrite the cultural script, to make excellence in character admired again. And that starts with recognizing the power of moral example.

“Finally, brothers and sisters,” Saint Paul wrote to the church in Philippi, “whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.”

MY WIFE, CINDY, AND I have recently discovered a compelling and highly entertaining way to think about such things. We've been watching Foyle's War, a British detective series that began broadcasting in 2002, was canceled for a time, and was revived until it ended in 2015.

The series was initially set during World War II, in Hastings, a seaside town on the southern coast of England. The drama revolves around Christopher Foyle, a detective chief superintendent; his driver, Samantha “Sam” Stewart; and Detective Sergeant Paul Milner. The series, notable for its meticulous attention to historical detail, later shifts to London, as Foyle and Stewart join MI5 after the war.

The plots are multilayered and intricate; they deal with complex moral dilemmas—justice in ordinary times versus justice in wartime, for example, and which moral compromises should be made for the “greater good” of the war effort—with nuance. But what makes this series so remarkable, apart from the brilliant (and brilliantly understated) acting of Michael Kitchen as Foyle, is that the character is “a quiet man who makes a religion of honor, responsibility and competence,” as the television critic Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Foyle does so without ever appearing self-righteous or moralistic. Rather, he is a good man trying to do the right thing in a fallen world.

It's not so much that we know every ethical line Foyle draws is the exact right one; it's rather that we know he's doing the best he can to pursue justice. He does so even—and sometimes especially—when there's enormous pressure on him to buckle, including from those in power. Foyle's moral compass can't be demagnetized.

Foyle treats those over whom he has authority with respect. He's restrained, not glamorous; wry and scrupulous; a man of quiet strength; and uncompromised. It helps, too, that his private life is unstained. He is, to invoke a rather old-fashioned word, a gentleman. You can't imagine Foyle selling his soul for anything, which makes him particularly anomalous today, when we see soul-selling all around us.

THE SOCIAL SCIENTIST JAMES Q. WILSON, in his 1993 book, The Moral Sense, argued that our moral sense is rooted in human nature. He believed that we have a natural capacity for ethical behavior, but that it needs to be nurtured. “Mankind has a moral sense,” Wilson wrote, “but much of the time its reach is short and its effects uncertain.” And so, when it comes to cultivating moral excellence, we must take our allies where we find them.

Jonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump

The best allies are people in your life who personify integrity, who live with honor, and who show us the way. In my own life, I count such people among my greatest blessings. I think of them more than they may know. But fictional characters can help us too.

In his essay “On Three Ways of Writing for Children,” C. S. Lewis, who also wrote The Chronicles of Narnia, said, “Since it is so likely that [children] will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.” Lewis knew the power of stories, and the power of heroes, to mold the character of children, to inspire them, even to help shape how they see the world.

I'd add only that what is true for children is also true for adults. It may not be in quite the same way, but it can still make a difference. We all need to hear from time to time about brave knights and heroic tales—and even, perhaps, about police detectives in small towns on the south shore of England.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What—if anything—can a reader learn from a couple that survived four months floating in the ocean together?

In the late 1960s, Maurice and Maralyn Bailey sold their house in Derby, in Central England, and commissioned a 31-foot-long sailboat, the Auralyn. Seeking an escape from their boring lives and the dreary English weather, they planned to sail around the world. To “preserve their freedom from outside interference,” as Maurice put it, they did not bring a radio transmitter aboard. Nine months after departing from the south of England in 1972, they made it through the Panama Canal and into the Pacific when a whale struck their boat, sinking it.

A new book, A Marriage at Sea, tells the tale of what happened next: The Baileys transferred themselves, 33 tins of food, and some cookies and Coffee-Mate into an inflatable life raft and dinghy, each barely the size of a stretched-out adult. They hoped for a ship to sail by and spot them. For nearly four months, they floated around, filling their time by catching rainwater and turtles—first as pets, then as food. Together, they clung to life as starvation and illness set in. Somehow, they survived. And they stayed married. And they went on another months-long sailing trip together.

The Baileys' experience was, as the book's author, Sophie Elmhirst, put it to me, “hopefully completely unrelatable for most people.” It is not, of course, a marriage-advice book. But perhaps its story can offer lessons about marriage. The Baileys' seafaring appeared to be a type of “shared meaning” that relationship experts say can glue couples together. Their mission almost killed them, corporeally, but it also seems to have helped their marriage survive. And although most couples would not want to re-create the Baileys' experience, they can experiment with shared-meaning making in other—perhaps drier—ways.

The two Baileys were strikingly different. Maurice, who had a troubled childhood marked by illness and emotional neglect, was negative and socially ill at ease. Maralyn, meanwhile, was “as socially able as he wasn't,” Elmhirst told me, as well as confident and enterprising. They met at a car rally where Maralyn was driving a Vauxhall Cresta with a particular level of “chutzpah,” as Elmhirst writes. Maralyn suggested living aboard the sailboat even though she didn't know how to swim. “She just had that gung-ho quality,” Elmhirst said.

Read: What comedians know about staying married

As I read the book, I could not understand what Maurice offered Maralyn. Why had she married someone so difficult, with so many cockamamie schemes? I asked Elmhirst for her theory, and she speculated that in an era of deep social conformity, Maralyn found liberation in Maurice's atheism, his desire not to have children, and, well, the whole boat thing. They both loved adventure, and both had a sort of British chin-up mentality that can be useful when soldiering on through something horrible.

What Maralyn offered Maurice, though, was clear. Adrift at sea, Maurice started to give up hope quickly, and Maralyn seemed to view spurring him on as a kind of second project, alongside engineering their survival. She made dominoes from strips of paper; when four gallons of drinkable water drifted away, she tried to raise his spirits by opening their last tin of rice pudding in honor of her birthday. She would assure him that they were meant to survive. They did argue, Elmhirst writes, but after a fight ended, they would “unpick it, see why they had snapped or become intolerant, and apologise.” Later, Maralyn would claim to reporters that they hadn't argued at all.

On the raft, the Baileys discussed the next boat trip they would take as soon as they were rescued. During long days without food or water, they'd fantasize about the provisions for the new boat, the design of the new boat, and where they'd sail it—Patagonia, they figured.

This second boat trip was, in some ways, crucial to getting them through that first, ill-fated one. Maralyn's strategy for keeping Maurice going was to fixate on a future, one that contained a second, successful sailing mission.

The Baileys' near-death experience became their shared meaning—a way of defining “this is who we are; this is what we do,” says Carrie Cole, the research director of the Gottman Institute, which focuses on couples' counseling. It solidified the relationship and, in all likelihood, made it last. “A lot of times when people go through some ordeal like that and they survive it together, it really can connect to them,” Cole told me. “Nobody else has experienced what they have. It's like they have this deep sense of feeling known and understood.” She notes, though, that most people cultivate this shared meaning in less dangerous ways, such as through volunteering or hiking.

Read: A wedding reveals how much help is really available to you

Another possible takeaway from this unusual duo, Elmhirst speculated, is that perhaps the Baileys show that, on some level, we all need someone to love. Maurice needed Maralyn to prop him up, and Maralyn needed someone to prop up. In the interviews the pair gave in the years after their rescue, “he'd make this point again and again that, if it hadn't been for her, he'd never have lived,” Elmhirst said. Perhaps he wouldn't have survived without her even on dry land: Maralyn, Elmhirst said, “translated him for the world.” Maybe, she added, “there is something in us that is designed or works well in tandem with someone else.”

In the book, Elmhirst asks, “For what else is a marriage, really, if not being stuck on a small raft with someone and trying to survive?” Throughout all the dramas of daily life—the fender bender, the sleep regression, the surprise layoff—partners can start to feel trapped with each other. Maybe that's not the worst thing.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The sitcom returns with a vision of suburban America that's harder to come by.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Hank Hill, the stalwart, drawling protagonist of King of the Hill, returns to Texas, he kneels in the airport and kisses the floor. More than 15 years have passed since audiences last saw him—the show, which debuted a new season last week, ended its original 12-year run in 2009. Viewers learn that Hank and his wife, Peggy, have recently moved back to their yellow house on Rainey Street, in suburban Arlen, after several years living in Saudi Arabia. Hank had taken a job as a propane consultant there, where the couple had lived in an idyllic simulacrum of an American small town, a place that put Hank in mind of “what things were like in the '50s.”

Then and now, the slice-of-life comedy—which also stars Hank and Peggy's son, Bobby— mainly concerns neighborhood antics unfolding across Rainey Street's living rooms and lawns. (Bobby, for his part, is now a chef who lives in Dallas.) Yet its premise lands differently today than it did a decade and a half ago. Today, when only a quarter of Americans reportedly know most of their neighbors, and nearly as many say they feel lonely and disconnected from their community, King of the Hill's focus on neighborly relations is comforting, even idealistic—a vision of suburban America with strong social ties that, for the most part, isn't riven by cultural or political divisions. As such, the show feels like a playbook for a type of rosy coexistence that, in the real world, seems harder and harder to come by.

From the Hills' perspective, Arlen has primarily changed in ways they find inconvenient. Now Hank has to contend with ride-share apps, boba, and bike lanes that interfere with his commute—adjustments that are perturbing to him. But these signs of the times are easier for him to accept than the realization that some things, or people, haven't changed; they've deteriorated. Almost immediately after reuniting with his friends, Hank learns that Bill Dauterive, his longtime friend and neighbor, hasn't left his bedroom since the COVID lockdowns of 2020. Hank had been Bill's de facto lifeline for years, helping his friend even when it meant pushing himself wildly outside his comfort zone, such as getting a tattoo of Bill's name and donning a dress alongside him. Without Hank's stabilizing presence, Bill's well-being seems to have declined to the point that even Netflix—which he'd been watching nonstop—sent someone to his house to perform a wellness check.

Horrified by Bill's sorry state, Hank vows to get his friend “back on track.” But when his former boss calls to offer him an attractive job that would take him back to the Middle East, alongside all the amenities he could want, Hank's new dilemma seems to crystallize. Listening to the tempting offer, Hank stares across his lawn toward Bill, who's using a garden rake to drag a package in through his window without leaving his room. Does Hank really want to be back in this neighborhood, where his relationships create inescapable obligations and daily nuisances? By choosing to stay in Arlen, Hank and Peggy reaffirm King of the Hill's core message: that belonging to a community is a worthwhile enterprise that requires ongoing commitment. In the case of Bill, that ultimately means enticing him back into society with the appetizing waft and convivial chatter of a barbecue party—a small coup for social connection amid the inertia of alienation.

Mike Judge, one of the show's co-creators, has said that the character of Hank was partially inspired by neighbors he once had in suburban Texas, who saw Judge struggling to repair a broken fence in his yard and helped him fix it, unprompted. This habitual caretaking—the act of showing up for others, regardless of convenience or reward—is part of what the political theorist Hannah Arendt called the “web of human relationships,” conceived on an ethic of tolerance and responsibility that goes deeper than simply enjoying your neighbors' company. After all, Bill can be a buzzkill, and the Hills' other neighbors, such as the conspiratorial Dale Gribble across the alley and the holier-than-thou Minh and Kahn Souphanousinphone next door, are flawed too. For the Hills, staying in Arlen means forgoing a more comfortable life to lump it with some weird personalities. But without taking pains to help one's neighbors, a resilient, tolerant community could not exist. And without that web of relationships, even the most Stepford-perfect town is a spiritual desert.

While Bill's storyline dramatizes how isolation can hollow out an individual's life, King of the Hill also explores how withdrawal can fray community ties more broadly. One episode finds Peggy aghast that her neighbors are pulling away from one another and receding into their technology: Many Arlen locals now pretend not to be home if their doorbell cameras reveal chatty-looking strangers on their doorstep; some even post paranoid warnings to an anonymous neighborhood forum, fearmongering about “strange people” sightings (half of which turn out to just be Dale).

Peggy takes it upon herself to bring the neighborhood together by erecting a lending library in her front yard. The initiative works well—until her books spread bedbugs, making everyone even angrier and more suspicious of one another. Peggy doesn't want to admit that she's responsible for a public-health fiasco, but the show underscores that a community can't function on good intentions alone. Sometimes, restoring harmony requires a willingness to lose face—which she does. After confessing to causing the outbreak, she leads a group effort to burn the infested books in a bonfire. “Texas morons have book-burning party,” is how one anonymous forum user describes them. But at least the whole street comes together in the end, with someone strumming a guitar as the pages crackle.

Read: The least politically prejudiced place in America

King of the Hill's belief in the innate power of moral character remains one of its most appealing traits—but the revival glosses reality in order to preserve its gentle equilibrium. Many viewers have described the series as “small c” conservative: Hank values the familiarity of his traditions more than he's vocal about his political beliefs, but he also once refused to lick a stamp with an image of Bill Clinton on it. Judge has described its humor as “more social than political.” In an episode of the original series, the Hills meet then-Governor George W. Bush at a presidential-campaign rally; world events that occurred during Bush's presidency, however—such as 9/11 and the Iraq War—never came up during the show's original run. Now neither do ongoing stories that have kept Texas in the news, such as the state's restrictive anti-abortion laws. The reveal that Dale was briefly elected mayor of Arlen on an anti-mask campaign is the closest the show comes this time around to commenting on today's culture wars.

Some viewers may find it difficult to reconcile the show's good-humored, inclusive portrayal of everyday suburban life with the political and social fragmentation found within many American communities today. A version of the show that more directly explored real-world tensions could have sharply captured the moment into which King of the Hill returns. However, its obvious distance from real life encourages viewers to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in its true politic: participating in the ritual of neighborhood life, regardless of whether that just means standing in an alley with a beer, contributing to a frog chorus of “Yups” until everyone's made it through another day together.

All of this principled neighborliness may sound Pollyannaish, but the show's optimism seems intentional. King of the Hill has always held a distinctive place in Judge's canon: Though his other film and TV projects, such as Idiocracy, Beavis and Butt-Head, and Silicon Valley, mercilessly skewer what some critics have defined as “American suckiness,” King of the Hill celebrates American decency. The show's narrative arcs continually reinforce that social trust is key to communities weathering any crisis, that being moral in the world can be a matter of looking out our windows and recognizing how we can serve one another, whether that's by fixing a fence or checking in on a friend. That's the evergreen charm of the Hill family: their pragmatic belief that helping out is just what neighbors do. Or, as a Girl Scout chirps to Hank while handing over a box of Caramel deLites, “It's nice to be nice.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Best Ranger Competition belies the idea that the Army is weak or “woke.”

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

The United States Army, in business now for more than 250 years, comprises more than 450,000 soldiers. Of those, about a third are in combat arms, serving in armor, artillery, engineering, cyber, and aviation units. Some 56,000 are in the infantry, the “Queen of Battle,” serving in units such as the 82nd Airborne Division and the 4th Infantry Division. These are the soldiers who go to battle on foot (or, in the case of Airborne units, by parachute—at least on occasion). Among them are some of the most physically fit humans on the planet—the soldiering equivalent of Olympic decathletes.

These are the sort who choose to attend Ranger School, the grueling 61-day Army course at Fort Benning, in Georgia, that is meant to push the body, and the spirit, substantially past the breaking point. Only about half of those who start Ranger School eventually finish, some after trying repeatedly. The most elite of those who graduate, the 1 percent of the 1 percent, show up each April to compete in what's known colloquially as the Ranger Olympics.

This event is not well known. It is not televised. Not one participant is sponsored by Nike. But the Best Ranger Competition may be the hardest physical competition in the world. Fifty-two teams of two soldiers each start the Ranger Olympics. Over the course of three days, the field is narrowed as soldiers march and run dozens of miles, crawl through obstacle courses, and navigate swamps at night. They carry 50 pounds in their rucksacks, climb 60-foot ropes, and sleep, at most, for four hours at a time. All told, the average competitor burns more than 30,000 calories.

These soldiers are, pound for pound, the fittest, most trained, and most disciplined the world has ever known. They are also, nevertheless, part of what President Donald Trump has called our “woke military that can't fight or win.” Trump has vowed to remake the armed forces, eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and excoriating generals (many of whom served in combat) as losers. His secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has moved to push trans service members out of the military (“No more dudes in dresses,” he said in a speech this spring) and has suggested that women should not serve in combat.

For three days in Georgia this spring, those culture wars felt very far away, in part because what I saw at Best Ranger belies the idea that the Army is weak or “woke”; in part because among the 104 soldiers on the starting line at Fort Benning was a 25-year-old first lieutenant named Gabrielle White, a West Point graduate who was the first woman to compete for the Best Ranger title; and in part because, to her opponents on the course, the fact that she was a woman did not seem to matter. The only thing that mattered to the Rangers I met was that she had qualified for the competition.

I've covered the military for more than 20 years and have seen soldiers in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through my travels, I've come to realize that the political class and civilians in general have little idea who soldiers are or why they serve. In the past, military service was almost an unwritten requirement of the Oval Office, but the only president to have served in the past three decades was George W. Bush (who did not see combat). And although the U.S. has one of the largest active militaries in the world, less than 1 percent of its population serves in the armed forces, which means that most civilians have little contact with the military.

During the 20 years of war that began in 2001, the military faced numerous crises of public perception. In fairness, the mission the armed forces were given during the War on Terror was near impossible, with an ever-evolving definition of victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq and competing agendas from administrations of both parties, not to mention a public more comfortable with thanking soldiers for their service than sharing the burden.

These days, debates over trans and women soldiers and other “wokeness” wars dominate the discourse around the military, all of which hides the fact that, in my experience, most people volunteer to serve because they want to be part of something bigger than themselves. Once among the ranks, most consider a soldier's politics or gender identity less important than their ability to do the job.

The military must now reinvent itself for a modern battlefield where it could face combat against Russia, China, or North Korea—or perhaps more than one at once. In this context, understanding the current force is crucially important. The Best Ranger Competition offers a glimpse of some of the most elite soldiers at work.

A month before the competition, I met the three qualifying teams from the 75th Ranger Regiment, a special-operations unit whose members had won the competition four years in a row. They were training on an indoor turf field with squat racks along one side and cardio machines along the other.

When I arrived, the soldiers were finishing a workout—doing planks with a 45-pound plate on their back and carrying 120 pounds 10 yards after a circuit of squats and bench presses. Speakers blared AC/DC and Johnny Cash. Nick O'Brien, who trains the regiment's 3,000 Rangers, looked on with his team of nine coaches, trainers, and dietitians.

For months, these six men had paused their day jobs with the regiment to prepare under O'Brien, practicing tasks such as assembling just about every handheld weapon in the American arsenal, marching and running for miles, and navigating the woods at night with just a compass and a map, eating only MREs (“meals ready to eat”), rations supplied by the Army that, over time, do demoralizing things to the standard human digestive tract.

First Lieutenants Kevin Moore and Griffin Hokanson, who composed Team 44, were favored to win this year. It was the first time that either man had represented the 75th and the first time they had been paired, but they had competed for other units in the past. Both look, a bit disconcertingly, like action figures. Hokanson, who's originally from Oregon, is a faster runner and more agile on the obstacles; Moore, from New York, is stronger. Both graduated from West Point in 2021. First Lieutenant Gabrielle White was also in their class, and the three started Ranger School together the following year. Moore had noticed that the leaders he respected all had Ranger scrolls on their sleeves. Hokanson had a battalion commander who was a Ranger, and saw that Ranger School was where lieutenants who wanted more of a challenge than what they found in the conventional army went.

Neither Moore nor Hokanson has faced combat, but they understand, as all Rangers do, that the battlefield in the age of drone warfare can easily become what a former senior Ukrainian commander called a “zone of continuous death.” Networks of tunnels mean threats can come from any direction—above or below. The infantry must prepare for action at night, or underground, to avoid detection.

Still, no other part of warfare is as unchanging as the soldier on the ground, holding the line, defending it, or taking it. The Ranger motto—said to have originated on D-Day, as German mortars and artillery fell down on Omaha Beach—is “Rangers lead the way.” Ranger battalions were deactivated at the end of World War II but called back into action again in Korea, where they executed raids, set ambushes, and led the counterattack during the winter of 1950 to regain land lost to the Communist offensive. The first Ranger School class was conducted around this time at Fort Benning, focused on individual combat skills and decision making under pressure, reflecting lessons learned in both World War II and the Korean War.

Later, as the armed services were becoming an all-volunteer force in the final years of the Vietnam War, generals saw the need for a specialized infantry unit capable of rapid deployment to troublespots around the world. The 1st Ranger Battalion was activated as a permanent unit in 1974. The idea was to build a unit that would act as a benchmark of excellence for the volunteer force. “The battalion is to be an elite, light, and the most proficient infantry battalion in the world. A battalion that can do things with its hands and weapons better than anyone,” General Creighton W. Abrams Jr. wrote in what would become the unit's charter. “Wherever the battalion goes, it must be apparent that it is the best.”

In recent decades, Rangers deployed during conflicts including 1991's Gulf War and the War on Terror. Rangers were among the special-operations forces who took part in the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993, in which two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers, including members of the 75th, were killed. In 2019, Rangers and Delta Force operators killed the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “I often think how many soldiers are alive today because they were led by a Ranger,” retired Command Sergeant Major Rick Merritt, who served 25 years in the 75th Ranger Regiment, including combat deployments to Panama, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, told me. Ranger School, Merritt said, is “the ultimate life-insurance policy for going to combat.”



This year's competition started before dawn at Camp Rogers, a training area at Fort Benning, in the pine forest of western Georgia. A crowd of spectators had gathered, a mix of family members, unit mates, and former Rangers. Midway through the first seven-mile run, the competitors picked up a 60-pound sandbag that they would carry for the rest of the race.

The 75th Ranger Regiment teams were among the first to return to Camp Rogers, barely pausing after dropping the sandbags before heading to Victory Pond. There, they dove into the frigid water and made their way toward the boat ramp on the opposite shore, about 400 meters away. Some dog-paddled, held up by their life jacket. Others paddled on their back, hoping to conserve energy. One by one, the Rangers shuffled out of the water, soaked and shivering in the cool morning air.

“This sucks,” one of the paratroopers of Team 34 said as they scrambled up the concrete boat ramp and a subsequent hill.

Without stopping, his partner answered with the universal infantry rejoinder, “Embrace the suck.”

That meant a day of marching with 50-pound rucksacks as the teams navigated from task to task, earning points for each. In the past, the competition had been linear: Each team followed the same sequence of events. This year's wrinkle—called “Ranger Reckoning”—left it to the soldiers to complete the remaining objectives in any order.

Each task presented a different problem. One was an urban-assault course where teams attacked a two-story building; after throwing a grenade into a makeshift bunker, they would rush forward to a yellow line and perform 20 burpees (an exercise in which a single rep includes a push-up followed by a squat jump). The exercise raised their heart rate, mimicking the stress of combat. Once the burpees were done, the team shot red balloons attached to two targets before moving inside a cinder-block house, where they then faced other targets meant to represent both enemy fighters (to shoot) and civilians (to avoid shooting).

In past years, completing events faster meant more time to rest between events. But this new format turned the first day into an endurance competition, O'Brien told me. In all, the teams marched about 35 miles to complete the course. Every task was graded by instructors from the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade, which runs Ranger School.

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Blain Reeves, a two-time competitor who won the Best Ranger competition in 1993 and served with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, told me that the first day was a “smoker.” (Ranger School is meant to “smoke”—exhaust—its students each day.)

Team 38—White and her partner, Captain Seth Deltenre—had a 20-person cheering section that followed them from station to station. White did not agree to an interview; it seemed that she wanted her achievement to speak for itself. Among her supporters was Kris Fuhr, a 1985 West Point graduate who recalled coming of age in a very different military. West Point “made it very clear that they did not want us there,” she told me. “We didn't have the protections of equal opportunity” or resources around sexual harassment and assault. “We had no advocates.”

Fuhr has tried to take on that role for younger women in the military, and has run a mentorship program for women attending Ranger School since they were first allowed to do so, in 2015. Later that same year, then–Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that all military positions would be open to women. (Although women had served near the front lines for years, this decision removed the remaining formal barriers to direct-combat roles.) The Army reports that 367 women have attempted Ranger School since 2015; 160 have earned the Ranger tab. In recent years, upwards of 1,000 men have earned a Ranger tab each year.

In my months of contact with the Army's event organizers leading up to the Best Ranger Competition, no one mentioned Team 38 or Gabrielle White. In different times, the Army might have celebrated White's history-making presence. But under Trump and Hegseth, mentions of historic achievements by women and minorities have been removed from military websites. As of this writing, trans service members have been banned from the military, and the Pentagon has taken the name of the slain gay leader Harvey Milk, a Navy veteran, off of a supply ship.

In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free, Hegseth wrote that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men,” arguing that they will mother soldiers in their units. “Dads push us to take risks,” he wrote, but “moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units.” On a video podcast last year, Hegseth said: “I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective; hasn't made us more lethal; has made fighting more complicated.” (He has since walked back some of his earlier remarks. On the Megyn Kelly Show in early December, he said, “If we have the right standard and women meet that standard, roger. Let's go.”)

During his confirmation process, Hegseth echoed President Trump's desire for a Pentagon focused on “lethality, meritocracy, warfighting, accountability, and readiness.” It is worth noting that Gabrielle White was given no accommodations or special treatment, and at no point did the Ranger instructors adjust her score because she was a woman.

Waiting to start the Malvesti Obstacle Course, Moore and Hokanson bounced from foot to foot and shook out their arms and legs. Both knew they had no more than four minutes of suffering before a break. When they got the order to go, Moore and Hokanson easily knocked out the six chin-ups and shimmied up the 30-foot rope. Jumping down a log ladder with nearly six feet between each rung barely slowed them down. Finishing the monkey bars over water put them on the edge of the notorious “worm pit,” a shallow, muddy trench covered with barbed wire that would-be Rangers must crawl through—sometimes submerged—on their belly.

Hokanson went first. Moore was next, slipping past the last rusty strand of wire and meeting Hokanson on the chin-up bar. Six more chin-ups and a run to the finish line later, they'd completed the obstacle course in three minutes and 35 seconds—a respectable time for rested soldiers, and an astonishing one for people who'd been going for almost 13 hours. They hadn't caught their breath before it was time for a pop quiz, which instructors give after some events to test competitors' cognitive powers. In which three conflicts did Army Colonel Richard Malvesti—the Ranger for whom the course is named—serve? (The answer, which Hokanson and Moore got right, was Vietnam, Grenada, and Operation Just Cause in Panama.)

Before a night ruck march, the field would be narrowed to 32 pairs. In the holding area, Moore pulled off his boots and propped his swollen feet, chewed up with blisters from his wet socks, on his rucksack. He was exhausted, but he and Hokanson were in first place and Moore knew all eyes were on them.

“I'm going to act like this is the first thing I'm doing and I'm fresh,” Moore said. “Everyone's going to look at me and realize that we are here to do business.” Competitors had deliberately not been told how long the ruck march would be, but at least they were hydrated and had gotten something to eat.

When it was time, Moore laced up his boots once more. “You look strong,” Hokanson told his partner. “I don't know if you're faking it or if you're being serious, but you look strong.”

Moore admitted afterward that he'd been faking it a little. Nevertheless, Team 44 took the lead and tore through the first four miles. Hokanson and Moore soon dumped their rucksacks to face the next test: They were each to carry two 45-pound water jugs for an unknown distance using only grip strength—no carrying the jugs on their shoulders, no wrist wraps, no resting the jugs on their feet, no setting them on the ground. As soon as one jug was set down, both men would have to stop and return to the starting line. The test, as the Ranger livestream commentator said, had a steep price for failure.

Team 44 came in second, but had the most total points for the competition. Team 38—White and Deltenre—sat near the bottom of the table.

Before the second day's events kicked off, the Rangers lay on the grass outside Doughboy Stadium, their boots and socks off. When they walked, they tended to do so with a grimace or a limp.

Inside the stadium were six stations, including one where the soldiers had to breach doors with a torch, a saw, and fire-rescue tools. At the first station, teams would toss a 100-pound medicine ball over one shoulder between burpees—30 in all—before hauling a 290-pound yoke 50 meters. Then they'd each climb a 15-foot rope 10 times. Later they'd sprint to a dummy, bandage its fake wounds, and haul it roughly 50 yards on a stretcher sled back to the starting line. At the last station, they would throw axes before they retreated to a neighboring baseball field to throw practice grenades.

For Team 44, this was light work. Moore, in particular, seemed to have a well of energy, and the men left the stadium area before lunch, giving them time to rest.

More was at stake for White and Deltenre as they entered the stadium to cheers from their supporters; only 16 teams would advance to the third and final day, and Team 38 would need good scores to make it. After each burpee and medicine-ball throw, White and Deltenre encouraged each other to press on. They skipped the rope climb, incurring a penalty but saving energy for other events, and went on to win the axe throwing, which moved them up to 17th place.

By the end of the afternoon, they were the only team that still seemed upbeat. They waited for the order to head toward the field where a Black Hawk helicopter would take them to Camp Darby for a mystery event before the night land-navigation test—historically the most difficult part of the competition. Once they got the order, White and Deltenre trotted to the helicopter.

For the night event, each team would have five hours to find five points in the tangled swamps near Hollis Branch Creek without using any roads or trails.

Hokanson took the lead on navigating for Team 44. Moore followed his partner's chem light as they bushwhacked through the swamp, in mud up to their knees, to the first point. But when they got across the swamp, Hokanson didn't see what he'd expected. Checking the map again, he realized they were going the wrong way.

“Kevin, I love you, but we're going to have to go through this again,” Hokanson said.

“Griff, I'm going to kill you,” Moore said. “I'm going to wring your neck.”

They had planned to hit one point each hour, but it took them almost two hours in the thorn brushes and mud to find the first one. With their bearings finally set, the men found two more points in under two hours and a fourth before the five-hour cutoff, leaving them with a lead of more than 100 points going into day three. (No team found all five points in the allotted time.)

Team 38, meanwhile, ranked second in the night navigation event, securing themselves a spot for the final day.

At 7:30 the next morning, as the first streaks of light came through the pine trees, the 16 remaining teams prepared to take on the Darby Queen, one of the toughest obstacle courses in the U.S. Army. The course comprises 24 stations made mostly of wood and rope set over a mile of rolling terrain. Some are as tall as three stories; others require crawling through trenches. Hokanson, who scored the fastest official solo time during the regiment's training period this year, moved effortlessly through them all, encouraging Moore as he went. They finished first, extending their lead.

Next, the teams retreated to a field where they packed their gear and wrapped it with their ponchos to create a raft before boarding a helicopter for a short flight to Victory Pond. Sitting in the door of the helicopter with his legs dangling, Hokanson was shivering uncontrollably. After two full days of competition, he couldn't wait to complete the final tasks.

The helicopter swooped past a rappelling tower and hovered over the middle of the lake. As the crew chief signaled for Team 44 to jump, they pushed their raft into the water before following it out. They swam their rucksacks to shore, then ran to a launch point where inflatable boats waited and paddled against the current, across the lake to the rappelling tower.

One more water event and Team 44 could rest before the final run, whose distance the competitors did not know. The Combat Water Survival Assessment, which also must be completed during the beginning of Ranger School, starts at the bottom of a 35-foot-tall metal ladder. From the top, with no safety harness, Moore calmly walked across a log suspended above the pond. He shimmied across a rope, plunged into the water and swam to a dock, then ran back and tagged Hokanson, who started up the 35-foot ladder to the suspended log. Moore, meanwhile, headed for a 70-foot tower. At the top of the tower's staircase, he slid down on a pulley attached to a suspended cable, and crashed into the pond. All of these tasks were timed. Even though their lead was insurmountable this late in the competition, Hokanson and Moore ran through the course at full speed; they didn't want to leave any doubt. They came in fourth for the event, all but assuring their victory.

Now the only thing left to do was run the final road race. Team 43—another 75th Regiment team, made up of Sergeants Emerson Schroeder and Tyler Steadman—was in third place but wanted to use this last event to push for second. When it was time to run, they kept a near-superhuman pace after having been almost constantly active for three days, and won the 4.1-mile race in about 30 minutes, becoming the first team to raise its rifles at the finish line.

Team 44 came in third in the race, and first in the overall competition. As they approached the finish line, Hokanson was so tired that he couldn't lift his rifle above his head. Tears welled up in his eyes as blood ran from his face onto his bib.

The loudest cheers were for Team 38, which finished the run second to last. Overall, though, White and Deltenre ended the competition 14th out of the 52 teams. After raising their rifles, they hugged and went to get checked by the medics, a standard safety precaution.

Kris Fuhr was at the finish line with the other Team 38 supporters. Watching White raise her rifle at the end of the race felt like validation, she told me, for the work she and her peers had done to make the military a more hospitable place for the women who came after them.

Jackie Munn: I felt more welcome in combat than I did on base

For their part, White's opponents seemed to respect her. “Anyone who makes it to day three and finishes the competition has achieved a standard far beyond anything in the Army,” Hokanson said.

In his speech at the awards ceremony, General Randy A. George, the Army chief of staff, asked a question that had hung over the whole three days: Why does the Army put so much time and so many resources into the Best Ranger Competition?

“Our Army is the best in the world,” George told the audience. “When tested in battle, we prevail time and again. Rangers are the best of our Army.”

Later, I asked George whether he thought that this generation of soldiers was less lethal than those that came before.

“I don't buy that,” George said, shaking his head.

In fact, he said, if you compare Rangers over the past three decades, today's are at least as capable as their predecessors—maybe even more so. “Everybody's going to have to shoot, move, and communicate on the modern battlefield,” George said. “They're going to have to be absolute experts at that. And that's what you get with any Ranger formation.”

Toward the end of the awards ceremony, George challenged every Ranger onstage to take what they'd learned and use it to inspire excellence among their peers. “Go back to your units and build Rangers,” he said. “Challenge your troops. Test them and push them. Send them to school and set expectations that they come home Ranger-qualified. Hold them accountable to being tough and lethal.”

In my conversations with the competitors, I saw this ethic firsthand. The Rangers had trained for months not in the hopes of attaining fame or fortune but for the chance to exceed even their own expectations. Perhaps this is why, after the competition ended, none of the soldiers I spoke with brought up the fact that this year's Best Ranger Competition had made history by being the first to include a woman—not because they did not want to draw attention to White or her performance but because the days-long physical and mental challenge demanded everything they had, leaving them no time to think about anything but putting one foot in front of the other.

How a stand-up comic's hours-long broadcasts explain the 2020s.

For more on the culture that has shaped the last quarter century, check out The 25 pieces of culture that explain the last 25 years.

Joe Rogan is many things — a comedian, a commentator, and a contrarian; a reality TV star and martial artist-turned-host of the most listened to podcast in America: The Joe Rogan Experience. His fans say he's just asking questions, calling out liberal hypocrisy, and defending free speech. His critics use other terms: a conspiracy theorist and peddler of misinformation and anti-trans rhetoric, who platforms not just off-the-wall ideas, but dangerous narratives that cause real-world harm.

There's truth in all these labels. There's another way to think of Rogan that may help put him in his rightful context for this decade: “Joe Rogan is the Walter Cronkite of Our Era,” declared British satirist Konstantin Kisin for Quilette in 2019. “Not one established newspaper or broadcaster can now compete with a popular YouTube host conducting a conversation from his self-funded studio,” he wrote at the time, reflecting on Rogan's three-hour interrogation of Twitter executives.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Kisin's declaration — before the global Covid-19 pandemic, before the 2020 election of Joe Biden or the 2024 reelection of Donald Trump — might have been a bit premature. But he effectively predicted what Rogan would yet become: not just one of the most influential voices in politics, popular culture, and social commentary, but also a harbinger for a new form of media, communications, trust, and truth in a post-pandemic world. There is no monoculture in 2025; but for a huge part of America, the realm Rogan pioneered and steers is as close as we might get.

He and his show have been at the crossroads of just about every major moment and societal change that defines the 2020s, from Covid misinformation and vaccine fearmongering to the expansion of the “manosphere” universe. His show is a mirror for a country that has grown more anxious, distrustful, and paranoid in the last decade.

When Kisin made his Cronkite comparison in 2019, Rogan's mainstream crossover was just getting started. Back then, The Joe Rogan Experience was well on its way to being the most popular podcast show in America — the second most downloaded Apple podcast in 2017 and 2018, before topping the list the next year. His YouTube uploads regularly attracted a million views each (racking up more than 2 billion by mid-2020), and the show had become a must-stop destination for both traditional celebrities and a realm of alternative and conspiratorially minded pseudointellectuals (think: Alex Jones, Kanye West, Elon Musk).

There is no monoculture in 2025; but for a huge part of America, the realm Rogan pioneered and steers is as close as we might get.

He had achieved that by developing a space for curious-minded average joes and those folks Slate once described as “‘freethinkers' who hate the left” to listen to his two-to-three-hourlong, anarchic episodes. In trying to understand what made Rogan's show work, the writer Devin Gordon summarized his roster as being roughly divided into three categories: fellow comedians, fellow athletes and fighters, and “‘thinkers.'” The latter label, Gordon wrote in The Atlantic, “requires air quotes because it encompasses everyone from Oxford scholars…all the way across the known intellectual galaxy to conspiracy theorists like Rogan's longtime buddy and Sandy Hook denier Alex Jones.” And gobbling up this content were millions of, primarily, American men, across every demographic.

Through it all, a handful of principles anchored the show. While he wasn't overtly political, he described himself as having essentially libertarian views with strong socially liberal leanings. Free speech, and the platforming of those who had been canceled in the mainstream, were a foundational goal of the show. Skepticism of government, big tech, and corporate media were a corollary. And a pseudo-Socratic line of curiosity and skepticism were his modus operandi. That led him to take traditionally liberal positions on social issues and civil rights, to criticize interventionist foreign policy, and to embrace the policies of political figures like Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as populist movement headed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who Rogan backed during the 2020 Democratic primaries.

Yet with the dawn of the pandemic, a few things changed. While originally critical of Trump, the tone of his shows, and his guests, began to move in a rightward direction after Trump's 2020 defeat. Rogan had been critical of pandemic shutdowns and mitigation efforts, questioned the efficacy of vaccines, and railed against what he called censorship and speech suppression on social media platforms. And once the “left,” and “woke” liberals became the establishment in the Biden administration, media, pop culture, and business, Rogan and his show had an easy foil to criticize and ask questions.

This post-2020 period was a time of growth and challenge for Rogan. He inked a reported $200 million multiyear deal with Spotify for the platform to exclusively host his podcast, but both he and Spotify faced intense calls by artists, liberal activists, journalists, and science communicators to either censor, deplatform or moderate his show to prevent the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation. He has previously described this era between 2020 and 2022 as “terrifying” — for the threats to free speech he felt were being emboldened by the Biden administration, by popular culture, and by mainstream media. This period contextualizes his feuds during that time with Facebook and Twitter for allegedly suppressing right-wing opinions and speech, with the Biden White House for pressuring social media companies to regulate speech, and with the mainstream media.

Yet he survived this controversy, and his show only grew bigger since then, aligning with his eventual drift to not only interviewing but endorsing Trump in 2024.

Rogan and his show are now perfect avatars of America's political and cultural revolution in the Trump era: The Joe Rogan Experience is now one of the key arbiters of truth and reality for scores of Americans who get informed from nontraditional and alternative media sources. His YouTube channel now boasts over 6 billion views across the episodes uploaded there; his episodes are rarely not the top shows across Apple, Spotify, and other podcast apps. He's become the mainstream, popular enough to cause strife during the 2024 election when he declined to interview Kamala Harris but hosted Trump and Vice President JD Vance. He also interviews the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, various politicians and entrepreneurs, and many more celebrities, actors, and comedians. His format has been imitated or adapted across the internet — yielding a web of right-wing, testosterone-driven, trash-talking shows collectively known as the manosphere.

In this realm, pioneered by Rogan, inquiry and curiosity can easily give way to conspiratorial thinking and paranoia. There's a sense that there are greater forces and powers trying to influence American minds, and thus requires radical skepticism.

In this realm, pioneered by Rogan, inquiry and curiosity can easily give way to conspiratorial thinking and paranoia.

In that way, Rogan's show encompasses the crossroads of three defining forces of the 2020s: the anti-incumbent, change-the-status-quo energy that permeated American politics in the last years of the Biden administration; the silo-fication of news, media, and truth into echo chambers and algorithmically powered feeds; and the political awakening and radicalization of low-information, low-political engagement, and low-trust Americans.

Rogan has successfully helped to yoke together a particularly reactive, ill-informed, and even paranoid group; a group that is now accustomed to having their beliefs confirmed by increasingly powerful people.

Yet now that he's the mainstream, Rogan finds his show in a potentially tenuous position: holding together a vast audience that could eventually come to question their loyalties and question him. His Trump endorsement, in particular, came with risks — opening him up to accusations of hypocrisy, flip-flopping, or misplaced trust should Trump end up walking back the policies and stance he promised. Those tensions are already playing out across the manosphere, as other hosts who endorsed Trump claim they were duped or regret their support.

Still, Rogan and the manosphere have come to represent the antithesis to liberal cosmopolitanism of the 2010s; and they now embody America's age of distrust, skepticism, and rejection of the status quo.

The blockbuster came out just three months after 9/11. The coincidence reshaped everything.

For more on the culture that has shaped the last quarter century, check out The 25 pieces of culture that explain the last 25 years.

When Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring debuted on December 10, 2001, it was considered a likely boondoggle. Hollywood hadn't launched a truly successful fantasy film franchise since the first Star Wars trilogy in the 1970s. If it was going to create one now, the savvy take was that the Harry Potter movies were a better bet, with a more active fan base and a simpler, more movie-friendly plot structure than that boasted by JRR Tolkien's labyrinthine Lord of the Rings trilogy. What's more, Peter Jackson's last major film, 1996's The Frighteners, was a flop. Jackson, Variety wrote at the time, with slight incredulity, “must have convinced someone that he would do it right.”

Yet The Fellowship of the Ring was a hit. It opened at $47 million domestically, the top of the box office by a record-breaking margin, and would go on to gross $889 million worldwide. It was nominated for 13 Oscars, including Best Picture. “By the end,” declared the Wall Street Journal in a rave review opening weekend, “you know you've been visiting a world truly governed by magic.”

Fellowship and its sequels became a template for what Hollywood success would look like over the next two decades. It showed executives that people were eager to see expensive, high-production value adaptations of intellectual property they already knew and loved, and that they would pay well for the privilege. It showed that audiences were willing to put up with a certain amount of lore — even labyrinthine lore — in exchange for high-stakes battles with a little artful CGI to make them look all the more epic.

But Fellowship had a special resonance with its audience because of the moment in which it came out: a mere three months after September 11, 2001. It met an American audience ready and eager to throw themselves into the story of an epic battle between good and evil — one that good was definitely going to win.

The parallels felt almost too good to be true.

It met an American audience ready and eager to throw themselves into the story of an epic battle between good and evil — one that good was definitely going to win. 

“With the world newly obsessed with the clash of good and evil, the time would seem to be ideal for ‘The Lord of the Rings,'” mused Variety. “Tolkien's tale of good people who band together against a Dark Lord and his minions has never been more timely than in our troubled age,” declared the New York Post.

The Fellowship of the Ring introduced audiences to the peaceful, prosperous Shire, only to show them how its vulnerable borders left it open to attack by the faceless, subhuman hordes of the forces of evil. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, with its pacifist hobbit hero, is frequently read as an antiwar tract. But to an American audience that felt newly vulnerable and desperate for revenge, Jackson's Fellowship felt like a perfect allegory for why a “war on terror” was not just desirable but in fact necessary.

Writing in the New York Times in 2002, film critic Karen Durbin ran through the “accidental echoes” between the Lord of the Rings films and the war on terror: “Evil or ‘Evildoers?' Sauron or Saddam? And how many towers?” The parallels were real. George W. Bush really did vow to rid the world of evil-doers, and Tolkien's characters really do spend a lot of time pontificating on the forces of evil. Incidentally, Lord of the Rings villain Sauron does sound a bit like former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and there is an unfortunate echo between the title of Tolkien's second volume, The Two Towers, and the twin towers of the World Trade Center.

Even without those echoes, Durbin went on, there was an uncomfortable blurring between the spectacle of the films' battle sequences and military propaganda. “Dehumanizing the other guy is the first step in training soldiers and fighting wars,” she wrote, decrying Jackson's plentiful scenes of animalistic and terrifying orcs marching on the small, scrappy fellowship. “The danger is that this is what makes not just warfare palatable but extermination itself.”

The interpretation of the whole Lord of the Rings franchise as an allegory of America's war on terror was so pervasive that when The Two Towers came out in 2002, Viggo Mortensen, the actor playing heroic Aragorn, spent a lot of his press tour trying to shut it down. “I don't think that The Two Towers or Tolkien's writing or our work has anything to do with the United States' foreign ventures,” he said on Charlie Rose, “and it upsets me to hear that.” (Tolkien, for the record, insisted that his story was “neither allegorical nor topical” when the books' first audiences wanted to read it as a World War II narrative.)

The message embedded in Fellowship would prove more apt as the war on terror went brutally on. In Tolkien's mythology, the ring's power will be misused by a nation that considers itself good just as surely as it will be misused by a group caricatured in the press as evil. No one can resist the corruptive force of pure power.

At the time, The Lord of the Rings parallels felt uncanny. Looking back, they betray how difficult it was for anyone in America to see the world through any lens outside of 9/11 at the time — and how seductive it was to imagine oneself as part of a grand conflict that was both ethical and morally pure. The Lord of the Rings offered Americans a vision in which the forces of good, no matter how corruptible, went to war under a white flag, and the forces of evil, no matter how complicated their backstory, went to war under a black flag. It was more than escapist enough for America's bruised and reeling spirit in 2001. We, too, could be Aragorn, heroic and brave and good — and we could make our nemesis into Sauron, too evil even to have a face.

Rising temperatures are rewriting the earliest stages of life.

This story is a collaboration between Vox and Grist and builds on Expecting worse: Giving birth on a planet in crisis, a project by Vox, Grist, and The19th that examines how climate change impacts reproductive health — from menstruation to conception to birth. Explore the full series here.

Climate change poses unique threats to some of the most foundational human experiences: giving birth and growing up. That's the conclusion of a recent summary report compiled by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which shows that climate change is exposing tens of millions of women and children to a worsening slate of physical, mental, and social risks — particularly if they live in the poorest reaches of the globe.

Extreme heat, malnutrition linked to crop failures, and air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels are driving higher rates of preterm birth and infant and maternal death, undermining many countries' efforts to improve public health. Already, 1 billion children experience a level of risk that the report characterizes as extreme.

“We're still just beginning to understand the dangers,” the authors wrote in their review of the limited existing scientific literature on the subject, “but the problem is clearly enormous.”

Here are the 5 biggest takeaways:

High temperatures are linked to premature births, stillbirths, low birth weight, and congenital defects, the report said, pulling from a study conducted by Drexel University researchers in Philadelphia who found that, for every 1.8 degrees that the city's daily minimum temperature rose above 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the risk of infant death grew about 22 percent.

“Whatever associations we're seeing in the U.S. are much, much greater in other areas, particularly the areas of the world that are most impacted by heat and then also already impacted by adverse birth outcomes,” said Rupa Basu, chief science advisor for the Center for Climate Health and Equity at the University of California, San Francisco.

“This is the tip of the iceberg,” added Basu, who was not involved in the new report.

Heat waves also raise the odds of early birth by 16 to 26 percent, according to the report, and women who conceive during the hottest months of the year are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that can become dangerous if left untreated.

In The Gambia, where 70 percent of the agricultural workforce is female, a survey of pregnant farmers conducted by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers found that women were being exposed to conditions that overwhelmed their capacity to regulate their internal temperatures 30 percent of the time. Up to 60 percent of women exhibited at least one symptom of heat stress and heat-related illness, such as vomiting and dizziness. Diagnostic tests showed that a third of pregnant farmers showed signs of acute fetal strain.

The burning of fossil fuels — and a related surge in wildfires burning over the earth's surface — are likely linked to a staggering proportion of low birth weight cases globally: 16 percent, according to the report. That's because the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas produces tiny toxic molecules, and wildfire smoke contains fine particulate matter that is infamous for causing a slew of adverse health effects. At least 7 million children in the U.S. are exposed to wildfire smoke every year, and that number is rising quickly as rising temperatures have driven a doubling of extreme wildfire activity around the globe over the past 20-some years. In 2010, researchers linked 2.7 to 3.4 million preterm births around the world to air pollution exposure.

“Risky, sublethal effects of air pollution are also coming into focus,” the report continues. One study conducted using data on 400,000 births in southern California found that a woman's exposure to fine particulate matter during pregnancy may increase her odds of spontaneous preterm birth by 15 percent, especially if that exposure happens during the second trimester.

Mothers may face mental health burdens as a result of air pollution, too: The odds of postpartum depression rose 25 percent in women exposed to a range of different types of air pollution in their second trimester.

One billion children worldwide are at “extremely high risk” from the effects of climate change — meaning they live in areas prone to sudden, disruptive environmental shocks and already experience high levels of poverty, food insecurity, and lack of access to medical infrastructure. The African continent, which is home to countries with some of the highest mortality rates for children under 5 years old in the world, saw a 180 percent increase in flooding between 2002 and 2021. And a study of 37 African countries published last year identified a steep rise in infant mortality due to drowning and waterborne diseases caused by flooding in the past five years. (Exposure to repeated flooding can overwhelm sewage systems and contaminate drinking water supplies with fecal matter and other pollutants that can lead to disease.)

Climate-driven drought in Africa is contributing to another adverse health outcome: malnutrition. Since 1961, climate change has led to a 34 percent decrease in agricultural productivity across the continent, according to the report. A deadly cycle of drought and flooding has wiped out crop yields, contributing to stubbornly high rates of infant malnutrition in many sub-Saharan African countries.

The report modeled what different emissions scenarios would mean for maternal and child health in two countries: South Africa and Kenya. In a low emissions scenario, in which average warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius — or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit — globally, childhood mortality in both countries would decline between 2040 and 2059, thanks in large part to projected gains in safeguarding public health that are already in the works. Those gains, however, are predicated on sustained aid from developed countries like the U.S., which have produced the lion's share of emissions driving the climate crisis. The Trump administration has made seismic changes to America's international funding infrastructure in recent months, including effectively eliminating the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and its related aid programs.

A medium emissions scenario, where average global temperatures increase by 2.5 degrees to 3 degrees Celsius, would override that expected progress, leading to a 20 percent increase in child mortality rates in South Africa and stable rates in Kenya, where there has been much investment in protecting child health. Preterm birth rates in both countries would also rise substantially even with low rates of planetary warming. Worldwide, climate-driven malnutrition could lead to an additional 28 million underweight children over the next 25 years.

Regardless of which emissions path the world ends up following, a shift toward a more isolationist approach among the world's richest countries threatens to exacerbate the risks pregnant women and children already face. As the planet continues to warm, those risks will keep multiplying.

Much can be done to prevent suffering right now. Solutions range from the straightforward to the complex: City planners can plant more trees in urban areas to keep pregnant people and children, whose internal systems are prone to overheating, cool. Organizations can identify ways to get public health data from the most underresourced parts of the globe. And nations can take steps to incorporate maternal and child health into their climate plans.

Both sets of solutions are achievable, and there are precedents. Since 2013, for example, local air pollution strategies in Chinese megacities have been forcing rates of respiratory illness down dramatically, an echo of what happened in the U.S. after the passage of Clean Air Act amendments in 1970. To combat climate-driven harm today, nations can direct resources to maternal health wards, cooling technologies for buildings, and flood-resistant infrastructure. They can also update building codes to make sure hospitals and other health facilities are keeping their patients safe from extreme weather events. Getting nutritional supplements to pregnant people in countries dealing with high rates of food insecurity can offset some of the dangers of malnutrition; researchers have found that reducing vitamin deficiency in pregnant mothers slashed neonatal mortality by nearly 30 percent.

In Philadelphia, city leaders implemented a $210,000 early warning system for extreme heat in 1995. It saved the city nearly $500 million in diverted costs over its first three years of operation. The new report argues that more cities in the U.S. and around the world should implement similar measures.

The best method of ensuring that mothers and children are shielded from the health consequences of climate change, according to the report's authors, is for countries to undertake aggressive climate adaptation plans and integrate maternal and child health considerations into those plans. Because, when it comes to climate change, the report's authors write, “the crisis is already upon us.”

AI will undoubtedly shape the next 25 years. We just don't know how yet.

For more on the culture that has shaped the last quarter century, check out The 25 pieces of culture that explain the last 25 years.

When it came out in 2013, the movie Her was set in the “slight future.”

That “slight future” is, astonishingly, here. After all, AI-powered chatbots actually are a real thing now, and people are falling in love with them. It's remarkable that the 2013 Spike Jonze sci-fi romance about a lonely mustachioed man, played by Joaquin Phoenix, talking to a robot in an earbud proved to be so prescient.

Still, much of our AI-dominated future is still taking shape.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

To be sure, millions of people already use AI in its various shapes and forms. ChatGPT set a record for the fastest-growing app in early 2024, and the United Nations forecasts that the global AI market will be worth nearly $5 trillion by 2033. A lot of this growth is bound to happen on an industrial scale as AI streamlines everything from data entry to warehouse operations. AI is changing how health care works and causing a cheating crisis in education. It's even showing up in Hollywood, promising to streamline the moviemaking process and to create scenes out of thin air.

AI will certainly shape the culture of the next 25 years, but its biggest transformations to our world still remain to be seen. 

Even in its most rudimentary iterations, the technology has caused us to question our grip on reality. One of the first moments that AI broke through as a cultural force was when a fake image of Pope Francis wearing a white puffy Balenciaga coat fooled the entire internet a couple of years ago (if only because it avoided the common AI mistake of six-fingered hands). On the darker end of the spectrum, nonconsensual deepfake porn created using AI has become nearly impossible to keep offline, prompting new legislation to be enacted banning the practice. As people turn to AI for companionship, just like Phoenix's character did in Her, some of them are losing touch with reality, becoming delusional, and in one case, an AI chatbot has been linked to a teen's suicide. These developments inevitably seem to signal that a more seismic shift is on the way.

AI will certainly shape the culture of the next 25 years, but its biggest transformations to our world still remain to be seen.

How will all of that play out? Well, that's the thing about the future: We won't know until it's barrelling down on us. In cultural terms, that could mean we're watching movies that are all at least partially AI-generated, hanging out with AI friends online, and listening to AI-generated music more than human bands.

It would be incorrect to say that the rise of AI is so far inconsequential. At the very least, it's minted a few billionaires. But to declare it one of the most transformational cultural happenings of this past quarter-century would be a bit premature. After all, it could take years for us to comprehend exactly how the technology has reshaped who we are — if that even proves to be true. Maybe artificially intelligent software will create an entire movie 10 years from now, and we'll look back at human actors and laugh. Or maybe we'll keep looking back at Joaquin Phoenix in Her, wondering when we'll finally stop being lonely.

The panelists shared their experiences and advice from their entrepreneurial journeys.

Last Thursday, Vox hosted a panel of New York City-based small business owners in an intimate Entrepreneurship, Explained panel discussion presented by Verizon Business. Nisha Chittal, Vox's VP of development and chief of staff, was joined by luxury jewelry and hair accessory designer Jennifer Behr and fashion brand owners and designers Tanner Richie and Fletcher Kasell of Tanner Fletcher. The panelists discussed the highs and lows of their entrepreneurial journeys — from how they started their companies to how they juggle wearing multiple hats as a founder and the advice they would give to people starting their own companies today. Here are some highlights from the discussion:

Jennifer Behr on blending creativity and business:

I do feel lucky that I am a creative person that's analytical as well because a lot of creative people aren't. The thing of starting a business with no money is that you have to be very practical from the beginning. You can waste money and you can't, you know. We always make some beautiful products that I know aren't good to sell because that's what actually brings me joy in it. But I also know that I have to make the things that are going to pay the bills.

Fletcher Kasell on building an inclusive brand

A lot of people give you advice when you start a business, “You have to have a defined customer, and your model should look this way…” We were like, “Okay, we don't want our customer to think that we're catering to one customer because it might close off all these other people who would wear our clothes.” We really wanted to be broad in that way. 

Tanner Richie also added:

We always say that our customer is “Bushwick meets the Upper East Side.” There's such a wide mix — our customer is the ladies who lunch all the way down to the East Village boys. It's just the most random mix of people but it might be the same product, right, it could literally be the same sweater but it's just all how people style it and I think it's just keeping the storytelling open.

Tanner Richie on what works well on social media:

Being ourselves on social media sells the products without having to mention it very much. I think they (our audience) want to see that we're real people and they want to support. I think people are having a harder time with big corporations right now, so I think seeing that your support to our business is just going to a small operation and real people who are doing everything. … They really appreciate seeing that. And it's fun too — because I can't think of too many brands that actually like to show they're kind of messy behind the scenes and I think we all have it, so let's expose it a little bit.

Jennifer Behr on her proudest moments as a designer:

There's obviously the press that everybody sees which people are like — oh this celebrity wore this or that which is great…but it's actually [when] somebody has chosen to wear you is kind of amazing, like just them making that choice, or people who get excited about [your brand] or care about it is ultimately the thing that kind of means the most. 

Fletcher Kasell's advice to entrepreneurs starting out:

(when starting a brand) Find your vision and stay true to it. … It's really easy to second guess yourself. It's really easy to…ask for tons of opinions and change your mind; like, for example, at first we took way too much advice. … At the end of the day they'll (our customers) buy what you are most proud of. … I think that really taught me that I need to be confident in what I see from my brand.

Budget airline flights could be about to get more expensive in the US.

In a quarterly report filed Monday, Spirit Airlines warned that it might not survive another year. If it did go under, then competitors would, in theory, be able to raise ticket prices, analysts have said.

Spirit previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last November before exiting the process in March.

However, it has continued to report losses, which totalled $245.8 million in the second quarter of this year, and said there was ""substantial doubt"" over its ""ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months.""

Analysts at Raymond James said that rival airlines Frontier, JetBlue, and Southwest overlap the most with Spirit, which means they could be the most likely to increase fares.

""The biggest benefits to industry pricing from further pullback or exit by Spirit would be in routes where both Spirit and Frontier compete,"" wrote Savanthi Syth, a senior research associate at the firm.

She added that fares on these journeys are typically 15% cheaper than those operated by only one of the two airlines.

Spirit Airlines' share price fell by 40% to $2.10 on Tuesday.

Frontier rose 29%, JetBlue by 12%, and Southwest by 5%.

Syth said Raymond James analysts hadn't expected stocks to move as much as they have, given that Spirit's warning was ""not necessarily a surprise.""

The airline said there was weaker demand for domestic leisure travel, the core of its business model. Economic concerns over Donald Trump's tariff plan have seen people cut back on travel, while post-pandemic fliers are more interested in paying for premium options.

Spirit could sell aircraft and the rights to gates at several airports to try to make money, as its credit-card processor is demanding collateral.

If it ceases operations, thousands of jobs would be at risk.

Some industry players have criticized the government's decision to deny JetBlue's attempt to buy Spirit for $3.8 billion over antitrust concerns, which went to trial in October 2023.

P.S. I'm 🤬. The objection to the merger was a fanciful idea that Spirit would just keep playing the ULCC “role” of consumer choice and competition with the majors (on the backs of workers, btw, and SNL's punchline every Saturday). Read the absurd DOJ arguments - that were wrong!

When JetBlue announced it had terminated the merger agreement last March, the then-attorney general, Merrick Garland, said it was ""another victory for the Justice Department's work on behalf of American consumers.""

In a Tuesday X post, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said: ""The objection to the merger was a fanciful idea that Spirit would just keep playing the [ultra-low-cost carrier] 'role' of consumer choice and competition with the majors.""

Spirit Airlines, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, and the DoJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside US working hours.

The lawsuit, filed last week in a Georgia state court by an anonymous DeKalb County mother and her young son, accuses Roblox of negligence as well as prioritizing growth over child safety.

It follows a recent wave of similar lawsuits lodged against the $90 billion company that accuse the popular gaming platform of not doing enough to safeguard children from pedophiles.

In a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said, ""We are deeply troubled by any incident that endangers our users, and safety is a top priority.""

""We dedicate substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours,"" the spokesperson said.

The latest lawsuit alleges that these predators harassed the boy for months and ultimately ""extorted"" him to send sexually explicit images and videos to his friends at school.

As a result, the boy has ""suffered devastating and life-altering psychological trauma"" and was eventually required to change schools, the lawsuit says.

""Had Defendant implemented even the most basic system of age and identity verification, as well as effective parental controls, Plaintiff would never have engaged with this predator and never been harmed,"" the lawsuit says.

In July, Roblox announced a new age verification system, which includes an age estimation tool based on a selfie-style video, for users who want to chat back-and-forth with so-called ""trusted connections."" ""If the system estimates that a user is actually under 13, then we will automatically correct the user's age to under 13 and remove access to features that are not appropriate,"" Roblox says on its website.

The Georgia mother's attorney, Matthew Dolman of the Florida-based firm Dolman Law Group, told Business Insider that he expects even more lawsuits to be filed in the near future and that his firm is currently investigating over 300 incidents on behalf of prospective claimants.

""Roblox has materially misrepresented that its product is safe on multiple occasions knowing full well that law enforcement investigations resulting in arrests of sexual predators are occurring nationwide,"" Dolman said.

Roblox, a top gaming platform among children and teens, hosts millions of user-generated games called ""experiences"" that range from racing to horror-themed.

The Georgia lawsuit, which seeks a jury trial and an unspecified amount in monetary damages, says that Roblox hosts a ""staggering number"" of games centered on simulated sexual activity.

The court documents also cited some games with titles like ""Survive Diddy"" and ""Escape to Epstein Island"" in reference to hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who was recently convicted of two prostitution-related federal charges, and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

When Roblox announced its latest earnings in July, the company reported an average of 111.8 million daily active users with a user base of nearly 40% under the age of 13.

The latest lawsuit — which includes identical pages of allegations cited in separate, but similar lawsuits against Roblox — said the Georgia boy is just ""one of countless children whose lives have been devastated"" thanks to Roblox's ""gross negligence and defectively designed app.""

The Roblox spokesperson told Business Insider: ""While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations.""

""We also partner with law enforcement and leading child safety organizations worldwide to combat the sexual exploitation of children,"" the spokesperson said.

Roblox recently deployed an open-source AI-powered system called Sentinel that it says was designed to help detect any early indicators of child endangerment interactions.

The AI system, the company said, helped it submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of the year.

Roblox has faced at least eight more lawsuits this year alleging the sexual exploitation of children. Three of those were filed by Dolman's firm, while the others were filed by the Pennsylvania-based personal injury law firm, Anapol Weiss.

The lawsuits come after an October 2024 report by the prominent short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Roblox of being an ""X-rated pedophile hellscape"" and ""exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.""

The group-chatting platform Discord has been named as a codefendant in some of those other lawsuits.

A Discord spokesperson told Business Insider that the company does not comment on ongoing litigation, but said, ""Any content or behavior that endangers younger users is not allowed on Discord.""

""Discord is deeply committed to safety and we require all users to be at least 13 to use our platform,"" the spokesperson said. ""Using a range of technological and human moderation approaches, we work hard to proactively detect and remove content that violates our policies, report violations to NCMEC, and maintain robust systems to prevent sexual exploitation and grooming.""

One lawsuit filed last month in a California federal court alleges that a 14-year-old girl was groomed on Roblox by an adult predator masquerading as another teen. The complaint says the conversation between them moved over to Discord where the man repeatedly sent sexually explicit messages and photographs.

The lawsuit says the man eventually lured the Alabama girl from her home and attempted to sexually assault her. Police intervened and the man was arrested, the lawsuit says.

It's been a tumultuous summer for markets, but investors have mostly ploughed through the volatility and pushed stocks steadily higher — but one top bank is warning not to get comfortable.

The S&P 500 is up 8% year-to-date, and the benchmark index is cruising near record highs in the late summer stretch. Solid earnings, a still-strong economy, and more AI hype have pushed stocks ever upward.

However, Morgan Stanley thinks there are a few things that could snap the winning streak.

Here's what the bank is looking at:

Since the July jobs report, fears have swirled that the recent strength in the job market may have been a mirage.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US economy added 73,000 nonfarm jobs, short of the estimated 105,000. The revisions for the prior two months were also sharply negative.

While the Trump administration has questioned the accuracy of the data, Morgan Stanley sees cause for concern. ""We believe that the trend, if not the exact level, is substantiated by the broad data mosaic,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of the bank's wealth management group, wrote on Monday.

""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' JOLTs survey, job openings fell to 7.44 million at the end of June, equating to a weak openings-to-job-seeker ratio of roughly 1:1,"" Shalett added.

The report highlighted several other economic data points that point toward slower economic growth, including a survey from the Institute for Supply Management which showed new employment contracting at levels that may indicate a coming recession.

Shalett acknowledged that Q2 earnings season showed strong growth for many companies, particularly those in the tech sector. S&P 500 earnings beats have managed to remain at or above the 80% benchmark with a few weeks left to go.

However, despite positive sentiment from investors, Shalett said that the a peak under the hood of the latest quarterly results tells a slightly different story.

""Only three of the 11 major equity sectors—information technology, communication services and financials—posted double-digit gains,"" the report said.

It added that while the members of the Magnificent 7 are growing at a rate of 26% for the year, that still leaves 493 companies that are barely up, if at all, on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.

""Is the economy really robust if most of the largest-cap companies' profits are only in line with nominal GDP growth?""

Shalett flagged two themes that have dominated economic conversations recently: inflation and the possibility of stagflation, which could curtail the forces pushing markets up.

With President Donald Trump's trade war still raging, concerns about inflation have spiked, but the overall economy appears to be in good shape for now.

However, Morgan Stanley said that this could be temporary.

""This may be a case of pain delayed, not denied, as the most recent final-reciprocal-tariff announcements set rates nearly double the 10% level to approximately 18%,"" the report stated.

Other analysts and commentators have raised similar concerns, noting that tariffs could cause the state of the economy to deteriorate, even as investor optimism remains robust.

Cristiano Ronaldo has proposed to his longtime girlfriend with a massive diamond engagement ring.

The footballer's girlfriend, Argentine-Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez, announced the engagement in a Monday post on Instagram.

She posted a picture of her hand with long, manicured nails — and a huge ring.

Rodriguez captioned the post, ""I do. In this and all my lives,"" written in Spanish.

A post shared by Georgina Rodríguez (@georginagio)

The central oval-shaped diamond was flanked on either side by two smaller diamonds.

Anya Walsh, a jewelry specialist at London-based retailer 77 Diamonds, told The New York Times that she estimates the ring's weight was around 35 carats and costs at least $5 million.

Ronaldo and Rodriguez have been dating since 2016. They met when Ronaldo walked into a Gucci store in Madrid, where Rodriquez, now 31, worked as a retail assistant.

They share two daughters and raise them with Ronaldo's three children from a previous relationship.

Their son, a twin of their younger daughter, was stillborn at birth.

Ronaldo, 40, is a Portuguese football player who is the captain and forward of the Portuguese national team and Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr Football Club.

Before joining Al-Nassr, he played for numerous other football clubs, including Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Juventus.

Representatives for Ronaldo did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Elon Musk has a bone to pick with Apple.

In a series of tweets late Monday night, Musk said xAI would take legal action against Apple for what he says is its bias toward OpenAI on the App Store.

""Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,"" Musk wrote in an X post. ""xAI will take immediate legal action.""

In a post earlier on Monday, he asked why the App Store hadn't placed X higher in its rankings. Musk said X deserved the spot because it is ""the #1 news app in the world.""

""Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know,"" Musk wrote.

xAI didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Apple's spokesperson said in an email to Business Insider on Tuesday that the App Store is ""designed to be fair and free of bias.""

""We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations, and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,"" the spokesperson said.

At press time, OpenAI's ChatGPT is ranked first on the App Store. Grok is ranked fifth.

""Unfortunately, what choice do we have? Apple didn't just put their thumb on the scale, they put their whole body!"" Musk wrote on X on Monday.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's threats on Monday.

""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote on X.

Altman said the ChatGPT maker would remain ""focused on making great products.""

But Musk was not done.

""Apple behaves like it's owned by OpenAI — why?"" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday morning. He was responding to a post containing several screenshots of banners from the App Store featuring ChatGPT.

Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015. Musk left its board in 2018. Since then, Musk has become a vocal critic of Altman's leadership of OpenAI.

In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of violating its nonprofit mission when it partnered with Microsoft. He withdrew the lawsuit in June 2024, only to refile it two months later.

Musk has previously leveled criticism at Apple and the App Store. In May 2022, Musk slammed the 30% fee Apple takes from sales on the App Store. Musk said Apple's fee was a ""tax on the Internet"" and ""literally 10 times higher than it should be.""

After acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Musk accused Apple of censorship and monopolistic practices.

""Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?"" Musk wrote on X on November 28, 2022.

""Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why,"" he wrote in a follow-up post, amid concerns that Musk's loosening of Twitter's content moderation policies could run afoul of Apple's content restrictions.

The dispute was resolved after Musk met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk said in an X post on November 30, 2022, that he had a ""good conversation"" with Cook and that they had ""resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store.""

""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so,"" Musk said.

August 13, 3:30 a.m. — This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Thinking of adding crypto and private equity to your 401(k)? Here are the 2 biggest risks you should know.","https://www.businessinsider.com/401k-executive-order-trump-crypto-btc-private-equity-risks-retirement-2025-8","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:44:00 GMT","

If you're nervous about retiring, you may have even more to worry about in the near future, depending on your appetite for financial risk.

On August 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could mean big changes for the many Americans with retirement accounts. It will make it easier for 401(k) investors to access non-traditional assets such as cryptocurrency and private equity.

The Trump administration has prioritized crypto-friendly policies that may help spur crypto adoption. This has sparked significant momentum for crypto markets, with bitcoin leading the way.

As Business Insider reports, though, the idea of opening up 401(k)s to alternative assets originally raised red flags for many people in the asset management and financial advisory spaces.

In their view, this policy change could compromise the low-risk, uncomplicated nature of 401(k)s, which is considered to be part of why many people trust them. However, the new executive order could mean both higher risk and reward for those who want to explore this new opportunity.

As Marcus Sturdivant Sr., managing member of The ABC Squared said, financial advisors had been discussing these issues with clients long before Trump's executive order.

Many people outside the financial sector may not fully understand what private equity is. This is partially because the private equity process of gaining exposure to companies that are not publicly traded has been reserved for high-net-worth individuals.

""Private equity lacks the transparency of publicly traded companies, and if they are placed inside a fund, the already lagging effect of the reported data will be increased,"" Sturdivant told Business Insider.

He added that the private equity industry also funds many companies that do not end up going public and, in some cases, lose a lot of money. That said, Sturdivant also acknowledged that some consider private equity to be one of the best long-term measures to grow wealth.

However, there are still tradeoffs, and opening up a 401(k) to private equity may disadvantage some users due to timing, specifically the lock-up period on an investment, which can be either a pro or con.

""If you are older and near retirement or leave it as an inherited account, the private credit portion may be locked in for a period that makes the ten-year period to use an inherited retirement account impossible to access the funds,"" he noted.

It is well known that crypto is subject to volatility, which has sparked concern among some policymakers who see it as high-risk for consumers.

A group of Senators recently raised it in a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director William Pulte, highlighting concerns with his plan to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac count crypto as an asset in some mortgage applications.

Sturdivant described the prospect of adding crypto to a 401(k) as intriguing but noted that coin and token performance can depend on a multitude of factors.

""How they grow can depend on the fund they are in, or whether they are individual, and if they are backed by a stablecoin,"" he said. ""If they are backed by a stablecoin, the returns will be tempered and inflation sensitive, not the outsized growth or loss as a token or coin, not a fiat-backed coin.""

That said, Sturdivant also described the typical crypto volatility as simply the cost of the technology as it progresses, highlighting the fact that some prominent policymakers hold bitcoin.

""This legislation will not be a complete backstop to a bitcoin decline, but could stabilize a move as the US and countries around the world already hold and are adding bitcoin to their reserves,"" he predicted.

Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon has reached a tentative agreement to buy the Portland Trail Blazers from Paul Allen's estate, Dundon told CNBC.

Dundon declined to provide the terms of the proposed sale but said he's ""very excited."" CNBC's latest Official NBA Team Valuations listed the Trail Blazers at a value of $3.65 billion.

The 53-year-old businessman is chairman of Dundon Capital Partners based in Dallas, Texas.

He's also a passionate sports owner. He agreed to purchase a controlling stake in the Carolina Hurricanes in 2017, and he's the majority owner of the Pro Pickleball Association and Major League Pickleball.

If his purchase of the Trail Blazers is approved, Dundon and his ownership team would take over ownership from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder. Allen's sister Jody Allen has been managing the the team since his death in 2018.

In 2022, Nike co-founder Phil Knight reportedly offered over $2 billion for the team, but Allen declined.

The NBA declined to comment. The Trail Blazers didn't immediately return request for comment. Sportico first reported news of the sale.

While last month's consumer price index showed that food prices were effectively flat month over month, tariff-sensitive items like coffee beans, specialty teas and spices are showing signs of inflation, worrying small businesses selling those products.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, coffee prices surged 14.5% in July year over year. The average retail price for a pound of ground coffee hit $8.41. Overall, food prices were unchanged from June to July but remained 2.9% higher than a year ago, the data showed.

Jessica Simons, owner of Bethany's Coffee Shop in Lincoln, Nebraska, told CNBC that her shop has seen prices go up 18% to 25% since January.

""We had to put a 3% fee on the coffee because we are waiting for our new menus to be printed, reflecting the new price,"" said Simons. ""But the prices have changed so quickly that we can't reprint menus every time the price goes up.""

Simons said in addition to coffee, the shop is paying increased prices on avocados and tomatoes.

""We also have a restaurant and we employ 24 people,"" added Simons. ""We are at a point where we don't have a choice but to raise prices. Our margins are thin. Small businesses are struggling with the rising costs of tariffs.""

The Tax Foundation recently calculated that almost 74% ($163 billion) of U.S. food imports will be facing tariffs.

Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel at Akin, said that companies that import unavailable natural resources such as coffee or coconut water don't have the option of on-shoring to avoid the tariff.

""Their ability to shift sourcing to other countries is limited,"" said Teitelbaum. ""They feel stuck facing a higher tariff no matter where they import from. The Administration does have a policy to accommodate this reality in some instances, but it's still a work in progress.""

Anjali Bhargava, founder of Anjali's Cup, which makes retail spice packages of Ayurveda-inspired turmeric and chai blends, said nearly all of their caffeine sources come from abroad. Bhargava's spices are sourced from Vietnam, Thailand, Africa, and South America; tea and peppercorn from India; saffron from Afghanistan; and special retail tin packaging is made in China.

""Consumers will still drink tea, but they may get lower quality products from companies that can weather these costs,"" said Bhargava. ""Small, bootstrapped brands that prioritize integrity and authenticity could be squeezed out entirely.""

Bhargava is concerned about the 50% tariff on tea from India, and said at the retailers where her product is sold, like Whole Foods, there is little room for major price changes.

""The president frames this as punishing India, but it will primarily harm American small businesses, companies, and their employees, as well as American consumers,"" said Bhargava. ""The 50% tariff on tea, not to mention the tariffs on my spices and other necessities, will devastate my already slim margins and could force me to raise prices that customers are already balking at, given the leverage my large competitors have.""

Bhargava has made concessions on her packaging, which was manufactured in China, but told CNBC she refuses to compromise on ingredients.

""This tariff forces a choice between maintaining quality and staying in business, and many small businesses won't survive that choice,"" said Bhargava. ""My chai concentrate uses organic single-origin Assam CTC tea that I can only get from India; There's no alternative source. I can't afford to stockpile like my larger competitors, especially given how unlevel the playing field already is.""

There are concerns as well that the impact of tariffs will flow further onto grocery stores into other products. That could be further amplified by the cuts to the SNAP program by the Big Beautiful Bill, all of which is leading to lower forecasts from retailers, according to Heather Rice, who leads the consumer, retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, and life science practice at KPMG.

""Almost 9% of spending comes from those recipients,"" said Rice. ""The amount of products on the shelves, I believe, will change based on where they source their products. Between our crops and exports, we can have blueberries 12 months out of the year. But I think with tariffs, we could see a change there, where you don't have blueberries all year long. I think we could see a product shift.""

Other fruits and beans not grown in the United States facing tariffs include bananas and kiwis.

Bhargava said the global trade war is going to hurt everyone.

""Coffee shops are already fighting for survival and need to protect their margins to keep the lights on. When authentic, quality products become unaffordable, the entire supply chain suffers. The tariffs will eliminate the diverse, authentic businesses that make American markets vibrant.""

The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when his term expires in May, including three who have not previously been publicly named, according to two administration officials who declined to be named.

The new names include Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock.

They now join a list of eight other candidates that CNBC has confirmed are under consideration, including Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, Fed Governor Chris Waller and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. The officials also confirmed the candidates include Marc Sumerlin, an economic advisor in the Bush administration, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.

President Donald Trump recently told CNBC in an interview that Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh were among those on his list.

The officials described a ""deliberative process"" where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will interview all of the candidates, winnow down the list and pass on a final list to the president for his decision.

The size of the list and the process described suggest a decision is not imminent and could take a considerable amount of time. But the officials would not offer a timetable.

The longer the process takes, the less likely there is to be a so-called shadow Fed chair in place for several months before Powell leaves, which some have suggested would be disruptive for monetary policy.

Though sharply critical — on an almost daily basis — of Powell, Trump has backed off suggestions he might replace the Fed chair before the end of his term in May.

While many of the candidates have advocated various levels of reform at the Fed, most have supported its independence and have experience in monetary policy and financial markets.

Top tech executives are at the forefront of a recent swathe of unprecedented deals with U.S. President Donald Trump.

In just the last few days, the White House confirmed that two U.S. chipmakers, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, would be allowed to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of their revenues in the Asian country.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, recently announced plans to increase the firm's U.S. investment commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. The move was widely seen as a bid to get the tech giant out of Trump's crosshairs on tariffs — and appears to have worked for now.

Altogether, analysts say the deals show just how important it is for the world's largest companies to find some tariff relief.

""The flurry of deal-making is an effort to secure lighter treatment from tariffs,"" Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC by email.

""In some shape or form, all of the big tech companies have been negatively impacted by tariffs. They can ill afford to fork out on millions of dollars in additional fees that will further dent profits as underlined by recent quarterly earnings,"" Pescatore said.

While the devil will be in the detail of these agreements, Pescatore said that Apple leading the way with its accelerated U.S. investment will likely trigger ""a domino effect"" within the industry.

Apple, for its part, has long been regarded as one of the Big Tech firms most vulnerable to simmering trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

Earlier this month, Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, albeit with an exemption for firms that are ""building in the United States.""

Apple, which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices and incurred $800 million in tariff costs in the June quarter, is among the firms exempt from the proposed tariffs.

The Nvidia and AMD deal with the Trump administration has meanwhile sparked intense debate over the potential impact on the chip giants' businesses and whether the U.S. government may seek out similar agreements with other firms.

Some strategists described the arrangement as a ""shakedown,"" while others suggested it may even be unconstitutional and comparing it to a tax on exports.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the legality and mechanics of the 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD were ""still being ironed out."" She also hinted deals of this kind could expand to other companies in future.

Ray Wang, founder and chairman of Constellation Research, described the Nvidia and AMD deal to pay 15% of China chip sales revenues to the U.S. government as ""bizarre.""

Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday, Wang said what is ""really weird"" is there is still some uncertainty over whether these chips represent a national security issue.

""If the answer is no, fine OK. The government is taking a cut out of it,"" Wang said. ""Both Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Lisa Su at AMD both decided that OK, we've got a way to get our chips into China and maybe there is something good coming out of it.""

While investors initially welcomed the deal as broadly positive for both Nvidia and AMD, which once more secure access to the Chinese market, Wang said some in the industry will nevertheless be concerned.

""As an investor, you're worried because then, is this an arbitrary decision by the government? Does every president get to play kingmaker in terms of these deals?"" Wang said.

""So, I think that's really what the concern is, and we still have additional tariffs and trade deals to come from the China negotiations,"" he added.

Looking ahead, Dan Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said the question for investors is whether the Trump administration's ""hands-on"" approach is positive or negative for U.S. companies.

""I think for each company, it is very different. So, it certainly it is something I take into account. The bigger thing for me is do you have some stability of policy? Do you have a policy one week and then it flips the next?"" Niles told CNBC's ""Closing Bell: Overtime"" on Monday. ""Right now, that is what concerns me a little bit more.""

Gildan Activewear has agreed to buy U.S. undergarments maker Hanesbrands for $2.2 billion in cash and stock, the companies said on Wednesday, as the Canadian firm looks to expand its foothold in basic apparel.

Gildan, whose brands include Anvil, Gildan and Gold Toe, will pay about $6 per Hanesbrands share, representing a 24% premium to Monday's close and implying an equity value of $2.2 billion.

Shares of Hanesbrands fell 2.4% in premarket trading after surging as much as 40% a day earlier, when news of the buyout first emerged.

The deal combines Hanesbrands' branded retail foothold through its popular brands such as Hanes, Bonds, Maidenform and Playtex with Gildan's strong wholesale market presence across the United States, Canada, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe.

""The combination of these two large manufacturers... makes sense on paper,"" Citigroup analysts said after news of the takeover, adding that Gildan could manage Hanesbrands' business more efficiently, given its expertise in low-cost manufacturing.

The Financial Times first reported on the potential deal on Tuesday, followed by other media outlets, including Reuters.

The deal caps a turbulent chapter for Hanesbrands that was marked by years of underinvestment, heavy debt and a string of acquisitions that produced mixed results since its spinoff from conglomerate Sara Lee in 2006.

Hanesbrands' sales have plunged over the last three years amid stiff competition in the athleisure market and cooling demand, but cost-reduction efforts and supply-chain improvements lifted its margins in the past year.

In a move to focus on its core categories, Hanesbrands has steadily offloaded assets, including selling its sportswear brand Champion to Authentic Brands in a $1.2 billion deal last year.

Gildan said it intends to initiate a review of strategic alternatives for Hanesbrands Australia, which could include a sale or other transaction, after the deal closes.

The transaction is expected to close in late 2025 or early 2026 and is likely to be immediately accretive to adjusted profit per share.

U.S. President Donald Trump will approach his encounter with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as a ""listening exercise,"" the White House said, taming expectations that this week's Alaska summit could yield a deal to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

""This is a listening exercise for the president. Look, only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present,"" White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. ""And so this is for the president to go and, again, to get a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end.""

The shift to downplaying the Friday meeting between the two heads of state — which will take place at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, according to NBC News reporting — takes place as Russia has deepened its advance in eastern Ukraine, in a likely bid for battlefield leverage ahead of negotiations. Moscow has persisted on a set of maximalist conditions to cease the devastating war in Ukraine, including the retainment of occupied territories, Kyiv's renunciation of its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and fresh elections in the invaded country.

Concerns have been growing in Kyiv and among its European allies that an increasingly frustrated Trump, who has criticized both Russia and Ukraine over the course of the U.S.-brokered discussions, could push through peace at the price of territorial concessions.

Trump on Monday circulated the notion of ""land swapping"" between the parties at war, although it remains unclear what Russian territories would be affected as part of this exercise, given Kyiv's lack of land gains.

""There will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also some bad stuff, for both,"" the U.S. president told reporters on Monday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the possibility of surrendering ground — with the European Union likewise touting the need to respect ""territorial integrity"" — and has insisted that Kyiv should be included in peace conversations aiming for a final outcome.

""As for the negotiations, in any case, they are important at the leadership level. But it is impossible to talk about Ukraine without Ukraine, and no one will accept that,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday in translated video footage carried by the Associated Press. ""So the conversation between Putin and Trump may be important for their bilateral track, but they cannot agree on anything about Ukraine without us.""

Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas lambasted Putin as ""just pretending to negotiate"" and stressed the Kremlin leader ""doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions.""

Benjamin Godwin, partner at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, on Wednesday told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" that the premise of land swapping had diminished the odds of success of the Alaska summit. 

""I think this all comes down to the fact that the entire basis for this meeting is based on something that is totally impossible for both the Ukrainians and the Europeans and really, the Americans to agree to,"" he said. ""So what you see from Karolin Leavitt is really the White House reeling back and back and back these expectations in the days leading up to the meeting.""

He noted that the best outcome for Ukraine would involve Putin overstepping the mark by way of excessive demands and kindling further frustration at the White House.

""This is a great opportunity for Putin to look big and strong on the world stage, it's a great opportunity also for Trump, he loves these set-piece events. But ultimately is anything going to come of this? It seems very difficult.""

The White House has signaled but so far resisted the impulse to directly confront the Kremlin by way of further sanctions, instead opting to apply pressure on Moscow's lingering trade partners. Last week, the White House announced the imposition of an additional 25% tariff on India, citing its Russian oil purchases.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

Hello, I'm Anniek Bao, a China economy and business reporter, filling in for Evelyn this week. Welcome to another edition of The China Connection.

This week, I look at how the World Robot Conference put China's ambitions for humanoid robots on full display, even as engineers and investors acknowledge that integrating them into everyday life is still a distant prospect.

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

At the World Robot Conference in Beijing, which concluded Tuesday, the mood was a blend of optimism and caution: Businesses showed off increasingly lifelike humanoid robots even as they conceded that technological gaps keeping these machines from mainstream usage remain wide.

Thousands turned up to watch humanoid robots to perform an array of unusual feats: from clumsily serving popcorn and drinks, spinning handkerchiefs, sparring in a boxing ring to playing chess and showcasing football skills.

But none of these feats amounted to a technological breakthrough. While there have been improvements in design, maneuverability and appearance, the androids still struggle to process and respond to their surroundings, a limitation that keeps them from most real-life workplace roles.

So far, their commercial use is mostly confined to guiding visitors at exhibition halls, shopping malls and, more recently, testing at factories for repetitive tasks like sorting materials and performing quality checks.

""When will humanoid robots be able to do 80% of the physical work that human can do? That's decades away,"" said Jay Huang, managing director and head of Asia industrial technologies sector at Bernstein.

""But what we will see is these individual tasks, like material handling, being multiplied into a much bigger scale. They can be used in very different format, different settings,"" Huang added.

Some tasks like using a robot to make a bed are still in the ""very early"" stage, with low success rate, Huang said, ""but that's the right direction to push the industry forward.""

Take PsiBot's mahjong-playing droid displayed at the event: It still misidentifies tiles, often confuses the game's rules and plays at a relatively slow pace, according to local media reports.

The technological bottleneck for large-scale integration of humanoids into daily life stems from a lack of cutting-edge AI models and insufficient training data, said Bob Chen, economist at Shanghai-based FG Venture. The venture-capital firm has invested in robotics startups including Hangzhou-based DEEP Robotics that makes quadruped-robots — machines that mimic movements of four-legged creatures.

Androids rely on vast troves of motion-capture, visual, tactile and audio data, along with simulations, to build the sensory and behavioral maps they need to navigate and interact in the real world.

""Large language models have rather narrow function: language in, language out. But robots require far more complex, multimodal inputs, and their outputs are not words but actions and behaviors,"" said Chen, according to CNBC's translation of his comments in Mandarin.

Several startups in China have invested in building ""data factories,"" hiring people to operate robots or wearables to capture machine-interaction data to train bots.

Humanoid robots are emerging as another front in China's tech rivalry with the U.S.— where they could prevail with cheaper prices and faster deployment.

""China, the U.S. and other countries are playing on a quite leveled playing field,"" Huang said. ""Just like in electric vehicles, autonomous driving, in humanoid robots, China acts extremely fast in product and use-case multiplication, while U.S. players seem to shoot for the holy-grail solution.""

In robot manufacturing, Tesla's humanoid project Optimus appears to be leading in the U.S., with CEO Elon Musk saying the company plans to produce about 5,000 units this year.

While Musk's ambitious plans could give it a leg up on other American competitors that have yet to hit the mass market, Chinese companies have been racing to make their models more affordable.

They are also believed to have been undercutting global peers in terms of price, thanks to superior cost controls. That's despite the real-world applications of robots remaining uncertain.

In the lead up to the WRC, Unitree rolled out its third version of R1 model, priced at 39,900 yuan ($5,249) on e-commerce site JD.com, significantly cheaper than the its other models. The company's H1 model was sold for 650,000 yuan per unit and G1 robot for 99,000 yuan.

At the conference, prices for a humanoid robot ranged from tens of thousands of yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and the high-end models capable of more complex tasks were priced above 500,000 yuan.

UniX AI touted its entry-level humanoid droids at just 88,000 yuan each. Shenzhen-based Engine AI has announced plans for a rival model starting at 38,500 yuan.

Some U.S. companies such as Apptronik could see their attempt to rival Chinese humanoid robots be further undercut by U.S. tariffs as they still rely on some components from China.

China already has an edge in integrating machinery into factory workflows and, in many cases, is outpacing rivals in marrying artificial intelligence with robotics, said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of China-focused economic research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.

Kroeber predicts that within two to four years, Chinese factories will achieve major efficiency gains across industries by combining top-tier industrial robots with AI systems that make them far more effective in varied settings.

Some of UBTech Robotics' humanlike droids have been deployed at factories of carmakers BYD and Geely, at electronics manufacturer Foxconn and logistics giant SF Delivery, Chinese state media reported in April.

However, during trainings, humanoid robots moved slowly, operating at just 20% of human efficiency, the report pointed out.

""Enabling humanoid robots to map their moving routes, speed up movements and operate for long periods of time in uncomfortable temperature environments still requires vast amounts of data,"" it said.

While widespread deployment of humanoid robots that enhance productivity might still be a distant prospect, Chinese companies are pushing ahead as their tech race with the U.S. heats up.

Jeff Moon, founder and president of China Moon Strategies and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China, said the U.S. and China's overtures are well-choreographed and happening in a planned sequence, but they won't solve many of the underlying problems between the two countries.

Graham Allison, Harvard professor and former assistant secretary of defense, said he expects a ""grand rapprochement"" or friendship between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, especially as Trump needs a strong economy heading into the midterm elections.

Hao Hong, managing partner and CIO of Lotus Asset Management, said traders and fund managers are not very concerned about weakening fundamentals in the Chinese markets as long as liquidity remains strong.

U.S. and China secured a truce extension. The two countries agreed to delay by another 90 days the higher tariffs, imposed in April, on each other's goods.

Beijing discouraging companies from using Nvidia chips. Chinese officials have asked companies to explain why they need to buy Nvidia chips instead of ones from domestic suppliers, according to a Reuters report.

Trump says open to Nvidia selling downgraded version of advanced chip to China. Trump indicated that he will meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang regarding the company's high-end Blackwell chip. Huang has said he hopes to sell more advanced chips to China.

China and Hong Kong stocks rose as Asian markets tracked gains on Wall Street after the latest U.S. inflation data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next month.

Mainland China's CSI 300 added 0.74%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — had gained 2.2% as of 2:22 p.m. local time (2:22 a.m. ET). The mainland benchmark is up over 6% year to date, data from LSEG showed.

The Hang Seng Tech index, which tracks the some of the largest mainland Chinese technology companies listed in Hong Kong, rose over 2%, lifted by Tencent Music Entertainment, which surged over 14%, a day after the company beat estimates for second-quarter revenue and profit.

China's 10-year government bond yield currently stands at 1.723%.

Record-breaking heat has swept across Europe in recent days, pushing temperatures well beyond 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in some areas and fueling regional wildfires.

In France, temperature records were obliterated in Angoulême, Bergerac, Bordeaux, Saint-Emilion and Saint-Girons on Monday afternoon, according to an update from weather forecaster Meteo France.

""Often remarkable, even unprecedented maximum temperatures, often 12 degrees above normal levels, were reached this Monday,"" Meteo France said Tuesday in a press release, according to a CNBC translation.

The forecaster said that a heatwave in the southwest was seen spreading to the center-east and northeast of the country through Tuesday and Wednesday.

In Croatia, temperatures climbed to 39.5 degrees Celsius in the Adriatic coastal city of Sibenik and 38.9 degrees Celsius in the popular tourist destination of Dubrovnik earlier in the week.

The temperature records come as scientists warn climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas is the chief driver of the climate crisis.

Europe is meanwhile known to be warming faster than any other continent, at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.

The EU's climate monitor has attributed this trend to changing weather patterns, reduced air pollution and the region's geography, noting that parts of Europe extend into the Arctic — the fastest-warming region on Earth.

In Spain, firefighters largely contained a blaze that broke out near to the capital of Madrid on Monday evening. Emergency services said one person caught in the blaze had died.

Nearly 6,000 people were evacuated from their homes in northern, central and southern Spain this week as wildfires raged amid a heatwave predicted to push temperatures up to around 44 degrees Celsius in some parts of the southern European country.

Wildfires have also been reported in Portugal, Croatia, Turkey, Greece, Albania, Montenegro and the U.K. in recent days.

It's not just Europe suffering from record heat, with temperature records also broken in Canada of late. Temperatures meanwhile soared above 50 degrees Celsius in Iraq, plunging the country into darkness on Monday during a nationwide power outage.

The chances that Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos will become the next Federal Reserve chair are jumping on prediction market Kalshi as the Trump administration considers several candidates to succeed current Fed Chair Jerome Powell once his term expires next year.

Users on Kalshi increased their bets that President Donald Trump will nominate Zervos to 15% on Wednesday after sources told CNBC that Trump is looking at 11 candidates for Fed chair, including Zervos as well as others such as former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and Rick Rieder – BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income.

Zervos' probability of becoming Trump's pick tied that of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh's, who was once considered the front-runner for the position. At one point early Wednesday, Zervos' chances even topped Warsh's at 17% to 15%, respectively.

Fed Governor Chris Waller still sits in the No. 1 spot on the platform, with odds at 31%, while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's odds are now at 20%.

Both Hassett and Warsh odds shot up on prediction markets after Trump talked up ""the Kevins"" on CNBC last week, saying they are both ""very good.""

The two have advocated for lower interest rates. Powell, whose term ends in May 2026, has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism for refusing to cut rates.

In the most recent Fed decision in July, Waller, along with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, publicly dissented with the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Waller, who was nominated by Trump to the Fed in 2020, said its wait-and-see approach is ""overly cautious.""

Bloomberg News reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter, that Trump's advisors like Waller's openness to adjust monetary policy based on forecasting, rather than current data. It also reported that Waller has met with Trump's team about the Fed chief role but hasn't met with the president himself.

UPDATE Bullish stock soars 143% in NYSE debut after $1.1 billion crypto IPO

Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has priced its initial public offering at $37 per share, above the expected range of $32 to $33 and giving it a total market value of $5.4 billion.

The company will raise $1.1 billion in the offering of 30 million shares. In a measure of increased investor appetite, Bullish expanded the number of shares sold in the IPO from 20.3 million, which were originally proposed to be sold at between $28 and $31 a share.

Bullish granted its underwriters, led by JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Bullish shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol ""BLSH.""

BlackRock and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of the shares.

Bullish, which is led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley and headquartered in the Cayman Islands, is a cryptocurrency exchange that's geared toward institutional investors and brings together decentralized finance protocols with the security of a centralized company.

Since its launch in 2021, total trading volume on the Bullish platform exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31.

Bullish also owns the crypto news website CoinDesk, which includes crypto indexes, data and analytics.

This is the second attempt by Bullish to go public in the four years since it was introduced. Backers, including billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are looking to take advantage of the Trump administration's favorable attitude toward crypto, which has invigorated capital markets this year.

In June, stablecoin issuer Circle made a highly successful stock market debut, raising more than $1 billion. That followed the transfer to Nasdaq (from Toronto) of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital and stock and crypto trading app eToro's IPO that valued it at $5.4 billion. Crypto custody startup BitGo and crypto exchange Gemini have also confidentially filed for U.S. listings.

Waiting for tariff-induced price increases in the U.S. to show up can feel like watching an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

July's consumer price index came in mostly benign. The headline annual rate of 2.7% was lower than the Dow Jones estimate of 2.8%. That said, the core figure was 0.1 percentage points more than expected, and the highest since February, before U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed his tariffs in April.

""The tariffs are in the numbers, but they're certainly not jumping out hair on fire at this point,"" former White House economist Jared Bernstein, who served under Joe Biden, told CNBC.

Things appear idyllic so far, but you know something's going to shock you out of your seats eventually — are the figures accurate, except that the decimal point should be shifted to the right? — which makes monitoring U.S. inflation a captivating experience.

Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs' chief economist, in a Sunday research note estimated that the big reveal (when the U.S. consumer admits, ""I see higher prices"") could happen by October. (That could have placed him in Trump's crosshairs.)

But markets hit record highs as investors saw the mild inflation numbers as a sign that the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates three times this year — or that tariffs might not drive prices that much higher.

Maybe the original premise was wrong: As far as inflation goes, could we be in a happily-ever-after Disney flick, instead of a Shyamalan movie?

— CNBC's Jeff Cox and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report

U.S. prices in July rose less than expected. The consumer price index increased a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, putting the annual figure at 2.7%. Economists polled by Dow Jones were expecting a 0.2% and 2.8% rise, respectively.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite close at new highs. On Tuesday, July's tame CPI report pushed the indexes up 1.13% and 1.39% respectively. Asia-Pacific markets traded higher Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 also hitting a fresh record.

Trump threatens Fed chair Powell with a 'major lawsuit.' In a post on Truth Social, the U.S. president said the potential proceedings would relate to Powell's management of the Fed's headquarters renovations.

Perplexity AI offers $34.5 billion to buy Google's browser. The bid for Chrome, which came unsolicited, is higher than Perplexity's $18 billion valuation in July, but the firm said investors have agreed to back the deal.

[PRO] Gold prices could reach $4,000, analyst says. Wall Street foresees another rally for the bullion after Trump confirmed that ""Gold will not be Tariffed!"" One strategist is so bullish on gold he thinks it could jump 14% from today's prices to break the $4,000 level.

Is London's financial future evolving or eroding?

London's reputation as a leading global financial center is increasingly in question, as it struggles to compete with the likes of New York, Hong Kong and Frankfurt. Brexit still hamstrings the economy, particularly through trade barriers, increased border costs and reduced productivity compared with staying in the European Union.

Despite the challenges and setbacks, all is not lost. Business leaders say there is still hope and opportunity for London.

China said Wednesday it warned and ""drove away"" a U.S. destroyer that had sailed near the coast of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea — one of the most valuable shipping lanes globally.

The destroyer, USS Higgins, ""illegally entered China's territorial waters off Huangyan Island without the approval of the Chinese government,"" the country's defense ministry said, according to a CNBC translation of the statement in Mandarin.

Huangyan Island is the name China uses to refer to the shoal, which has been the subject of a maritime dispute between China and the Philippines.

China accused the U.S. military of ""seriously"" infringing its sovereignty, adding that America's actions ""severely undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea, and violate international law and basic norms governing international relations.""

The USS Higgins is a warship with the U.S. Seventh Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan. Sarah Merrill, a spokesperson for the fleet told CNBC that the USS Higgins was conducting a ""freedom of navigation operation"" in accordance with international law.

""China's statement about this mission is false ... The United States is defending its right to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS Higgins did here. Nothing China says otherwise will deter us,"" Merrill added.

The incident comes at a time when Washington and Beijing are locked in a trade spat that has seen the two issue incendiary statements, with China in March warning that it was prepared for ""a trade war or any other type of war,"" with the U.S., before tensions subsided.

On Tuesday, a Chinese warship had crashed into one of its own coast guard vessels as it chased a patrol boat belonging to the Philippines.

China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own under its ""nine-dash-line,"" which rejects a 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court in the Netherlands, that found no legal or historical basis for Beijing's claims. 

There have been several clashes between Chinese and Filipino ships in the South China Sea, with the Philippines accusing Beijing's forces last year of pursuing Philippine vessels and directing lasers at patrolling aircrafts near another contested reef.

Clashes have involved boat collisions, water cannons and injuries to Filipino sailors, according to Filipino officials.

In May 2024, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that should a Filipino citizen be killed in the South China Sea via an incident with the Chinese Coast Guard, it would almost certainly be a ""red line"" and come ""very, very close to what we define as an act of war.""

He added that ""our treaty partners I believe, also hold that same standard,"" referring to U.S. forces. Washington has a mutual defense treaty with Manila since 1951, which states that an attack on either the Philippines or the U.S. in the Pacific is deemed to be an attack on the other.

Six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen, known in crypto circles for his eyebrow-raising Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price calls, says he's taking a step back from publicly sharing his dream-based conversations with the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.

What Happened: Pippen claims Satoshi has been appearing in his dreams since 1993, offering him BTC price predictions that he's posted online, with some surprisingly accurate results. ""I envy Scottie,"" Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy admitted.

Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

In September 2024, he predicted Bitcoin at $84,650 on U.S. election day (it hit two weeks late), and in December 2024 he forecast BTC would touch $81,000 before $100,000 again, which also played out.

Saylor, a friend since a 2024 crypto conference, has urged Pippen not to speak too openly about these ""meetings,"" saying Bitcoin maximalists are fiercely protective of Satoshi's identity.

""My guy, Michael Saylor, asked me not to speak on my conversations with Satoshi,"" said Pippen as cited by CoinTelegraph's Magazine.

Why It Matters: In July 2025, Pippen shared his latest dream-inspired targets: $233,000 BTC by 2026, $1,000 SOL, and $10 XRP, asking followers which will happen first.

He insists these are based on ""feel,"" not calculations, and says he's waiting for more ""Satoshi dreams"" before making new 2025 forecasts.

Pippen's crypto journey began in 2022 with a digital sneaker NFT drop.

He also launched The Ball Foundation, backed by the basketball he's held for 34 years, with a $2 million valuation and 1 billion token supply. Unlike other celebrities, he says his aim is to bring people into crypto, not launch a ""dodgy meme coin.""

Pippen also told CoinTelegraph Magazine he hopes to meet pro-crypto President Donald Trump before his term ends.

Tokyo-based investment firm Metaplanet (3350) has unveiled two major strategic initiatives aimed at deepening its integration of bitcoin BTC$121,779.01.

The announcements came as the company posted strong second-quarter results, with revenue climbing 41% quarter-over-quarter to 1.239 billion yen ($8.4 million) and net income swinging to a 11.1 billion yen ($75.1 million) profit from a 5.0 billion loss yen last year.

Metaplanet's head of bitcoin strategy Dylan LeClair announced the launch of “Metaplanet Prefs,” a perpetual preferred equity instrument designed to scale the company's bitcoin treasury operations similar to Strategy's (MSTR) preferred equities. 

As Japan's largest publicly traded bitcoin holder, Metaplanet intends to set a new standard in the country's fixed income market by introducing BTC-backed credit products through these preferred shares.

According to the Metaplanet, the preferred shares will allow for the issuance of BTC-backed instruments across a wide range of credit profiles and maturities. The goal is to align with and adapt to domestic fixed income demand, positioning bitcoin as a credible form of collateral in Japan's capital markets.

The second initiative involves building a bitcoin-backed yield curve in the Japanese fixed income market. This would create a framework for pricing BTC-collateralized credit instruments, offering institutional investors a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while generating predictable yields.

As of mid-August, Metaplanet holds 18,113 BTC worth about $1.85 billion, making it the sixth largest corporate bitcoin holder in the world. Metaplanet shares are down about 50% from all-time highs, but remain 10% above recent lows.

Metaplanet triples assets in Q2, launching Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares to target Japan's yield-starved fixed income market.

Japan's $8–10 trillion fixed-income market, encompassing Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), corporate bonds, and municipals, offers some of the lowest returns in the developed world. The 10-year JGB yields just ~1%, and corporate bonds often struggle to clear 2%. For decades, pension funds, insurers, and banks have been locked into these low-yield allocations, constrained by a lack of compliant, high-return alternatives.

Metaplanet's Q2 earnings announcement aims straight at this gap. The company unveiled:

In a market where even “high yield” means low single digits, a well-structured Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Share offering 7–12% could command serious attention—and serious capital.

Metaplanet's Q2 wasn't just about announcing a new funding model—it delivered one of the strongest quarters in the company's history. Both revenue and profitability surged, while assets and net assets multiplied, underscoring the scale at which the company is now operating.

Metaplanet Q2 Earnings Results:

This surge in financial performance strengthens Metaplanet's credibility with investors and positions it to roll out Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares at scale, using its momentum to capture a share of Japan's vast but yield-starved fixed income market.

Preferred equity sits between debt and common stock in a company's capital structure. It offers dividend priority, higher liquidation claims, and predictable payouts—often without voting dilution.

Metaplanet's Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares are designed to:

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has already shown what's possible. The company built a stack of Bitcoin-backed preferred equity classes, each aimed at a different part of the yield curve and a specific investor profile:

By matching each issuance to market demand, Strategy has raised billions and grown its Bitcoin holdings to more than 500,000 BTC—without relying solely on common equity dilution.

Metaplanet is taking the same multi-class concept into a market where preferred share issuance is rare, the investor base is yield-hungry, and Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares could see rapid adoption.

Japan's fixed income market has faced decades of near-zero yields, leaving trillions in capital with few compliant, income-producing options. This scarcity makes it uniquely primed for higher-yield instruments like Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares.

Japan's household financial assets break down as follows:

The listed preferred share market is just $2.7 billion—less than 0.02% of total financial assets. Yet demand for stable, income-oriented products is immense.

Here's the gap: a Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Share yielding 8% offers 8x the return of a 10-year JGB and 4x the return of most high-grade corporate bonds. In a regulatory-compliant, familiar structure, that spread could attract both domestic institutions and retail allocators looking for yield without leaving the fixed income universe.

Metaplanet plans to issue multiple classes of Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares, each built for a different investor segment:

This isn't just a product lineup—it's the construction of an investable BTC-backed yield curve. Strategy built one in the U.S.; Metaplanet is doing the same in Japan, but with the added tailwind of a market desperate for yield.

Metaplanet's approach offers three clear takeaways for corporate strategists:

Metaplanet's Q2 announcements can serve as a blueprint for how Bitcoin can be integrated into national capital markets.

By pairing a proven capital structure model with one of the most yield-constrained environments in the world, Metaplanet is positioning Bitcoin as a legitimate, income-generating collateral base for a sovereign-scale fixed income market.

If they succeed, Japan's first Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Share program won't be the last. It could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's fixed income era—and a case study in how corporate Bitcoin strategies evolve to fit the markets they enter.

Oops, something went wrong

Standard Chartered has raised its Ethereum price target to $25,000 by 2028, a major shift from March forecasts that predicted a structural decline for the world's second-largest crypto.

The UK banking giant made a massive revision on its Ethereum outlook, now projecting $7,500 by the end of 2025, $12,000 in 2026, $18,000 in 2027, and $25,000 in both 2028 and 2029, up from its earlier $4,000 target for 2025.

""We raise our price forecasts, as the backdrop for ETH has improved dramatically in recent months,"" the bank's Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, wrote.

He noted how institutional buying has occurred at nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation during peak periods.

Kendrick pointed to treasury companies and Ethereum ETFs purchasing 3.8% of all circulating ETH since June, the US GENIUS Act clearing regulatory pathways for stablecoins, and planned network upgrades as key drivers behind the bullish revision.

Standard Chartered calls the legislation a “pivotal change” that will boost liquidity, fuel DeFi growth, and drive ETH demand, given stablecoins already account for 40% of blockchain fees and are mostly issued on Ethereum.

Ethereum is at $4,713.37, marking an 6% daily and 30% weekly gain. That price puts it just shy of its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878, according to CoinGecko.

The odds that Ethereum climbs past its all-time high to $5,000 this year have jumped 39% in the past day on Myriad Markets. The prediction market's users now rate Ethereum reaching that milestone with 87.5% odds.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt that while ""the targets grab attention, it's worth remembering that the bank made similar bold forecasts last year, like $8,000 in 2024, and $14,000 in 2025"" before reducing estimates during March's market downturn.

Standard Chartered has previously shifted its Ethereum outlook significantly, reducing its 2025 target from $10,000 to $4,000 just months ago over concerns about layer-2 competition diluting mainnet fees.

Ethereum Liquidations Top $294 Million As ETH Approaches New All-Time High

""So the latest estimates seem to reflect improved market sentiment rather than potential price targets,"" Otychenko added, though he acknowledged that institutional accumulation and potential ETF inflows ""indeed look like major catalysts that could accelerate Ether's price growth this year.""

Arthur Azizov, Founder and Investor at B2 Ventures, told Decrypt that the current momentum projects strong upside potential. ""Either this year or next, we could see ETH reach $6,000,"" he said, while cautioning that maintaining support above $3,350 remains crucial for sustained momentum.

Market liquidations data show the current rally's force, with over $264.8 million in Ethereum short positions eliminated in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGlass, as the crypto approaches key resistance levels.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

The crypto market was a sea of green early Wednesday, with altcoins including OKB, PUMP, BNSOL, JITOSOL and SOL chalking out double-digit gains alongside ether's rapid surge toward record highs. 

""Bitcoin rose by a modest 0.4% during the day and remains 2% below the levels of 30 days ago — clear evidence of the market's switch to altcoin-mode,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at the FxPro said. 

""We suspect that investors are selling the first cryptocurrency to finance purchases of altcoins. And it is hardly reasonable to talk about a reversal in sentiment, given the rally in altcoins and the historic highs of the S&P 500 and Nikkei 225,"" he said.

Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving and unpredictable world. Many people dream of spotting the next altcoin pump, when the price of a smaller crypto suddenly rises by a large percentage, before it happens. 

While there's no guaranteed way to predict pumps perfectly, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool to help you do smarter research, spot patterns and filter noise from real signals.

This article breaks down how to use ChatGPT to analyze altcoins, track trends and identify early indicators of a potential pump. 

What is an altcoin pump?

An altcoin pump is a sudden and sharp increase in the price of an alternative cryptocurrency — i.e., any crypto that's not Bitcoin BTCUSD. This usually happens when:

A group of traders starts buying quickly (sometimes coordinated in pump groups).

Big news or social media hype pushes the price up.

A new exchange listing or partnership is announced.

Influencers or YouTubers start talking about the coin.

Sometimes pumps are organic and driven by real growth. Other times, they're manipulated and short-lived (also known as pump-and-dump schemes). Your goal is to spot potential real growth before the crowd does.

Can ChatGPT predict pumps?

Not exactly. ChatGPT doesn't have a crystal ball. It can't tell the future or access real-time prices unless connected to external tools. But what it can do is:

Analyze altcoin fundamentals (utility, team, tokenomics)

Summarize community sentiment from forums, Reddit, X, etc.

Detect historical patterns from past pumps

Generate watchlists based on criteria you choose

Create strategies for monitoring altcoins.

Basically, ChatGPT acts like your crypto research assistant, helping you make educated guesses instead of blindly chasing hype.

Step-by-step: How to use ChatGPT for altcoin pump research

You can use the “Search” feature of ChatGPT to quickly find up-to-date crypto trends, news and market analysis across the web.

1. Identify what you want to track

Before using ChatGPT, decide on your angle. For example:

Are you tracking low-market-cap coins under $50 million?

Do you want coins that are trending on social media?

Are you looking for coins with upcoming events (like token burns or listings)?

The more specific you are, the better the results.

2. Use smart prompts

Let's look at two example prompts you can use with ChatGPT to research altcoins:

Prompt example 1: Altcoin watchlist based on fundamentals

“Act as a crypto research assistant. Give me a list of 5 altcoins under a $100 million market cap with strong utility, active development teams, and upcoming catalysts (like exchange listings, partnerships, or events). Summarize in 120 words.”

ChatGPT's response provides a clear and concise list of five low-cap altcoins, summarizing their utility, development status and upcoming catalysts in about 120 words as requested. It effectively highlights key points for quick analysis but lacks citation details for credibility and deeper verification. Do verify onchain data and up-to-date project information before making any investment decisions.

Prompt example 2: Analyze pump potential from social buzz

“Assume the role of a crypto market analyst. Analyze which altcoins are gaining the most attention on X, Reddit, and YouTube in the past 7 days. Look for sudden spikes in mentions, positive sentiment, or trending hashtags. Which ones might be getting ready to pump? Summarize in 100 words.”

ChatGPT highlighted trending altcoins by analyzing social traction across X, Reddit and YouTube over the past seven days. It clearly identifies Remittix, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe as tokens with rising mentions and positive sentiment, suggesting potential price movement. However, it should also caution readers to verify onchain data and use up-to-date market info before acting on social trends.

3. Combine ChatGPT insights with other tools

ChatGPT works best when paired with data tools, such as:

CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap: For tracking market caps and price changes

LunarCrush: For social sentiment

DEXTools or TokenSniffer: For new coin launches and on-chain data

X and Reddit: To catch buzz early.

4. Be careful: Red flags to watch out for

Not all pumps are good. Be on alert for coins that:

Have anonymous teams

Promise massive returns quickly

Have very low liquidity or trading volume

Are trending in known pump-and-dump Telegram groups.

You can ask ChatGPT to check for red flags:

“Name 5 low-cap altcoins that might be a scam or pump-and-dump project.”

ChatGPT's response lists five examples of tokens linked to scam-like or pump‑and‑dump behavior, including real-world cases like Save the Kids and SafeMoon. It also explains common patterns with unnamed micro‑cap memecoins and organized hype groups. However, you should verify this information before drawing conclusions.

Caution: Don't chase every pump

While it can be exciting to hunt for the next big altcoin pump, it's important to stay grounded. Many pumps are short-lived and driven by hype or manipulation, especially in low-market-cap coins. Prices can skyrocket in minutes and crash just as fast, leaving late buyers with major losses.

Always be cautious of:

Too-good-to-be-true returns: Projects promising 10x overnight gains are often scams.

Anonymous teams or no white paper: Lack of transparency is a major red flag.

Low liquidity: If few people are trading the coin, you might not be able to sell when you need to.

Pump-and-dump groups: Telegram or Discord groups that coordinate artificial price movements are common and risky.

Use ChatGPT to identify potential, but combine it with critical thinking and outside verification. The crypto market moves fast, but slow and informed decisions usually win in the long run.

Always remember that even the best tools can't guarantee success in crypto. Use ChatGPT for research and insight, but always do your own research (DYOR).

Crypto is volatile, and even promising coins can fall in price. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","BNB Chain News: BNB and Sector Hit ATH as Altcoins Rally","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bnb-chain-news-bnb-sector-132349715.html","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:23:49 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Bull momentum: BTC/ETH near ATHs; altcoins show broad-based strength.

BNB Chain mcap $242.8B (+16.3%); BNB, LINK, and SHIB lead.

Mid-caps soar; DAAs +15%, TVL +4.8%, DEX volume +12%.

It's safe to say the bull market has now begun.

Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are inches from their all-time highs, the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index is barely above neutral territory, and altcoins are exploding left, right, and center.

With that in mind, let's see how the BNB Chain landscape has shaped up over the last week.

The BNB Chain ecosystem is exploding.

The sector reached a new peak market capitalization (mcap) of $242.8 billion after gaining 16.3% since our last update.

Much of this growth was attributed to the stellar performance of the top three assets:

BNB (BNB): +11.7% (hitting a new all-time high)

Chainlink (LINK): +46.4%

Shiba Inu (SHIB): +15.2%

The vast majority of prominent BEP-20 tokens are in the green this week, with several among the mid-caps doing awe-inspiring numbers:

Codatta (XNY): +291.6% (surge tied to Binance-linked 12-week Booster Campaign)

Bio Protocol (BIO): +107% (launch of BIO and BioDAO staking)

Cyber (CYBER): +81% (Upbit listing)

Tagger (TAG): +67.5% (two-week data-labeling event)

siren (SIREN): +63.2% (unclear catalyst)

As always, there are still a few stragglers in the top 100 BNB Chain ecosystem tokens by mcap.This week's worst performers include:

Mythos (MYTH): -24.3%

Spark (SPK): -23.8%

Subsquid (SQD): -18.9%

Overall, the sector is demonstrating extraordinary strength, but the underperformance of some tokens reaffirms the need to adapt when tokens no longer fit the narrative.

Compared to other L1s, BNB Chain continued to show signs of relative growth.

Over the last week, the platform saw a 15% uptick in daily active addresses (DAAs), a 4.8% gain in total value locked (TVL), and a 12% increase in DEX trading volume.

Source: Artemis

It continues to be one of the most efficient chains in terms of on-chain fee revenue, with 2.3 million DAAs paying a combined total of just $834K in fees.

It likely comes as no surprise that one of the most bullish weeks on record was also filled with major updates and developments.

Below, we cover some of the most significant to bring you up to speed:

Kickstart Program Upgraded, LaaS Fully Merged: BNB Chain revamped its Kickstart Program into a one-stop builder hub, merging the LaaS initiative, introducing two tracks (DApp Building & Growth), and connecting projects to 50+ service providers across 18 categories.

Binance Futures Adds XNY & AIO Perpetual Contracts: Binance Futures announced USDS-M perpetual contracts for Codatta (XNY) and OlaXBT (AIO) with up to 50x leverage, expanding derivatives access to two BNB-ecosystem AI data projects. Launch: Aug. 13 (UTC).

Tagger Inks $5M Enterprise Deal: Tagger finalized a $5M multi-workstream agreement with Stables Money; all data-labeling order payments settle in the USD1 stablecoin on-chain, aligning enterprise AI workflows with crypto rails.

Nasdaq-Listed BNC Buys 200,000 BNB ($160M): BNB Network Company (BNC) disclosed a 200K BNB purchase, positioning itself as the largest corporate BNB holder and spotlighting treasury demand for BNB during the uptrend.

                        Blockchain is maturing for enterprise use, evolving from speculative cryptocurrency to practical applications like B2B payments, FX and treasury operations.                      


                        Understanding the blockchain stack is crucial for CFOs, as blockchain's modular architecture allows CFOs to optimize for speed, cost and compliance, with each layer (0 through 3) serving specific roles.                      


                        Companies like Circle, Nuvei and Stripe are launching blockchain initiatives focused on institutional-grade infrastructure and real-world use cases.                      

Blockchain technology is putting on a suit and tie as it tries to woo the staid halls of Fortune 500 businesses.

As the sector's innovative architecture for money movement matures beyond hype cycles and speculative tokens toward cross-border B2B payments and treasury management, a clearer, more operational question now faces the enterprise C-suite.

How exactly does this new digital financial infrastructure work, and how can enterprise finance leaders use it to move money better, faster and cheaper?

For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, the answer lies not just in abstract innovation but in the layered structure of blockchain networks. These layers, known in technical terms as Layers 0 through 3, represent different parts of the blockchain stack, ranging from the underlying communication protocols to the interfaces that touch customers and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

Circle, for example, on Tuesday (Aug .12) launched Arc, a new Layer 1 blockchain designed for institutional-grade stablecoin payments, foreign exchange (FX) and capital markets. Also on Tuesday, Nuvei announced it is employing stablecoin rails to expand its global money movement capabilities. On Monday (Aug. 11), news broke that Stripe is reportedly developing an entirely new blockchain in partnership with cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm Paradigm.

The importance of understanding the taxonomy around these corporate-focused blockchains and their technical layers is becoming a boardroom imperative. Just as traditional finance evolved distinct but interlocking systems for messaging (SWIFT), settlement (ACH, Fedwire) and compliance (anti-money laundering and know your customer), blockchain layers map to similarly specialized functions, but with different speed, cost and composability profiles.

This is the CFO's emerging digital asset dictionary. PYMNTS can show you how to read it.

At a high level, blockchain networks are built on four primary layers, each with distinct functions.

Layer 0 operates as the network backbone of blockchain ecosystems, functioning as the foundational protocol layer that connects independent blockchains through interoperability, consensus and data transfer. For CFOs, Layer 0 is akin to an enterprise WAN or the internet backbone: critical infrastructure enabling disparate systems to communicate. In a payments context, it can streamline reconciliation across geographies, blockchains and jurisdictions, creating a unified operational framework.

Layer 1 forms the base blockchain layer, managing transaction recording and core state changes such as balances and contracts. Leading examples include Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin and now Circle's Arc. For finance leaders, this is where stablecoins reside, making it the digital equivalent of Fedwire or SWIFT's central ledger. In the context of USDC or EURC payments, Layer 1 systems enable the settlement of real monetary value, often in seconds, providing liquidity and certainty to corporate treasuries.

Layer 2 serves as the scalability engine, built atop Layer 1 blockchains to handle transactions off-chain before periodically settling them back on the base layer. This structure is designed for higher throughput, lower fees and improved efficiency. For CFOs, Layer 2 is a throughput turbocharger, making it ideal for high-volume, low-cost transactions such as international payroll or vendor micro-payments. Layer 2 can deliver cost reductions of more than 90% compared to Layer 1 settlement.

Layer 3 provides the application interface, linking smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure to user-facing tools like wallets, APIs, dashboards and ERP integrations. Examples include Fireblocks, Circle's APIs, Chainlink and enterprise blockchain software development kits (SDKs).

From a CFO's perspective, Layer 3 is where finance and engineering teams converge. It defines how seamlessly an ERP can issue a purchase order and trace it to real-time settlement, or how treasury teams can monitor on-chain liquidity, creating operational transparency across the enterprise.

Blockchain's layered architecture is not a bug; it's a feature. Just as cloud computing abstracted servers, storage and applications into modular layers, blockchain is doing the same for value movement.

As these layers solidify, CFOs can approach blockchain not as a monolithic technology, but as a composable stack with differentiated trade-offs.

But abstraction demands literacy. CFOs who understand how each layer fits the digital asset dictionary will be best positioned to harness the benefits — lower transaction costs, faster working capital cycles and programmable compliance.

To ground the abstraction, take the example of a sample enterprise payment flow of a $50,000 purchase order (PO) for IT equipment, sourced across borders, paid in stablecoins and settled on-chain.

The PO issuance takes place first across Layer 3, when an ERP system like SAP triggers a PO using an integrated blockchain API (Circle or Fireblocks). A smart contract records the PO on-chain, with terms encoded such as payment conditions, counterparty wallet or invoice matching logic.

Next, funds are transferred to a Layer 2 escrow contract, minimizing fees. AML/KYC checks are triggered via Layer 3 compliance oracles (like Chainalysis or TRM), using Layer 2 programmability.

Upon delivery confirmation, the smart contract releases funds, settled in USDC on a Layer 1 like Arc, for example. Settlement is instant, auditable and compliant with embedded metadata.

Reporting and reconciliation happen across Layers 0 and 3, with Layer 0 protocols syncing transaction records across chains if multiple chains were used (e.g., multi-geo vendors). Layer 3 dashboards push reports to treasury systems, automatically logging FX, timestamps and counterparties.

 Ethereum's $1 trillion security initiative aims to attract institutional capital, but the chain's transparent mempool enables $1.8 billion in malicious MEV extraction. 

Opinion by: Loring Harkness, Head of Commercial at brainbot GmbH and Shutter

Earlier this year, the Ethereum Foundation launched a $1 trillion security initiative, a development in its wider campaign to tailor the chain's image for its new audience of non-crypto retail investors, Wall Street and traditional financial institutions. 

On paper, the initiative is nothing but a good thing. Ethereum, recognizing its shortcomings, is refreshing. The proposed approach also offers a clear path to being “far greater” regarding security — a direction that will provide the industry we hope to attract to crypto with peace of mind. For Ethereum's security problem, however, too much transparency is fundamentally the problem.

The Ethereum Foundation's trillion-dollar initiative views success as a world where “billions of individuals are each comfortable storing more than $1,000 onchain.” If we were to assume a constant trajectory based on the current growth rate for unique wallet holders on Ethereum, that milestone is less than a decade away. As Ethereum celebrated its 10th anniversary on July 30, we're assuming colossal mass adoption for the chain at an institutional and retail level. 

In principle, this progress is well within Ethereum's reach. DeFi protocols on Ethereum now manage over $64 billion in total value locked (TVL). The Foundation's heightened engagement with Wall Street giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and Robinhood has seen traditional finance juggernauts publicly embracing Ethereum-based financial products, validating the blockchain's maturity. 

Despite Ethereum's reputation-boosting activity, blockchain security researchers and innovators are raising increasingly urgent alarms about the extent of malicious maximal extractable value (MEV), particularly on Ethereum.

Since 2020, more than $1.8 billion has been extracted through MEV on Ethereum, mainly at the expense of everyday users through malicious MEV. Some might say this is all part of the DeFi game. In reality, it's incredibly unfair, particularly as non-web3 natives come onchain, the population that will make up the billions of users Ethereum wants to convince.

Ethereum's architecture exposes a fundamental vulnerability: its currently unencrypted public mempool. Any transaction processed on Ethereum must pass through its public mempool, where the transactions are broadcast to everyone — including bad actors and bots — before being confirmed. At this stage, bots attack, front-run and re-order transactions for profit.

Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes minimalism as key to layer-2 blockchain success

This transparent design, originally intended to enhance verification, creates a perfect environment for predatory actors to analyze pending transactions and manipulate transaction ordering to their advantage.

Another reality is that sandwich attacks, front-running, and other malicious MEV exploits sit in a regulatory grey area. Though there are some developments in the works at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to tackle this, there's no formal framework to police this activity, and there's little consequence that holds attackers to account.

This isn't a new problem, and there are solutions that claim to address malicious MEV out there.The dominant alternatives prioritize giving users a more equal slice of the pie, however, rather than a fair chance in the first place. Current private transaction pools create centralization risks and often just shift MEV extraction to different actors, rather than eliminating it. 

MEV-Boost attempts to democratize MEV extraction but doesn't eliminate it. It redistributes MEV profits between builders and proposers while users still suffer from front-running and sandwich attacks.

The only credible solution to Ethereum's malicious MEV crisis is redesigning how transactions flow through the network. That answer lies in encrypting Ethereum's mempool,  utilizing a decentralized system where a distributed network of parties temporarily encrypts all transactions until the transactions are complete. 

Encrypting transactions until they're permanently placed in a block allows us to achieve a level playing field where malicious MEV becomes virtually impossible. An encrypted mempool on Ethereum would transform the user experience by automatically providing all users with protocol-level protection against malicious MEV, without users needing to take any action. 

Most people would never switch their RPC or DEX, so the only real solution is to make fairness the default. It would also eliminate the need for today's patchwork of centralized MEV-prevention tools, which have helped limit some attacks but haven't entirely stopped malicious MEV.

This encrypted mempool system seems simple, but it would represent a massive architectural shift for Ethereum.

It would require changes to Ethereum's underlying protocol. The code changes needed will touch Ethereum's most fundamental components — its transaction propagation mechanisms, consensus protocols and execution environment. The timeline for these changes will stretch over multiple network upgrades, likely requiring several years for full implementation. If Ethereum continues to grow at the current rate, the demand for a viable, long-term solution for such a threat will only rise.

As institutional capital continues pouring into Ethereum's ecosystem, the stakes of addressing its malicious MEV vulnerability will continue to grow. The recent institutional adoption wave provides a deceptive sense of security that masks the underlying technical crisis. Still, it's only a matter of time before institutions and users ask questions about vulnerabilities.

The $1 trillion security initiative deserves strong community support because it targets the issue at the heart of Ethereum's value proposition: Can we trust that the network will process our transactions fairly?

The technology pathway to fairness on Ethereum is clear: encrypted mempools. What remains to be seen is whether the Ethereum community resolves to implement these changes before institutional trust erodes.

The price chart may look promising today, but without addressing its malicious MEV crisis, Ethereum's long-term security and viability remain at risk.

 The NFT market cap has hit $9.3 billion, up 40% since July, as ETH tops $4,600 

The non-fungible token (NFT) sector surged to a market capitalization of more than $9.3 billion as Ethereum-based collections increased along with the price of Ether. 

NFT data tracker NFT Price Floor showed on Wednesday that the overall market capitalization for NFT collections had hit $9.3 billion, a 40% uptick from July. According to DappRadar data, NFTs had a market capitalization of $6.6 billion last month. 

Ether (ETH), which recently pushed past the $4,000 milestone, has been a key driver behind the NFT market surge. At the time of writing, ETH traded above $4,600 and had a market capitalization of over $557 billion, according to CoinGecko. 

Since many NFTs are based on the Ethereum mainnet, their sales and valuations are denominated in ETH. Because of this, bullish momentum of the crypto asset translates into higher market values and increased activity in the NFT space. At the time of writing, the top 10 NFT assets by market cap were Ethereum-based. 

CryptoPunks retains its spot as the top NFT collection by market capitalization. NFT Price Floor data shows that the collection is worth at least 526,900 ETH (about $2.4 billion). 

In the last seven days, CryptoPunks had almost 4,200 ETH in volume, worth almost $20 million. During the week, the collection had 90 total sales, averaging at $217,331 per NFT. 

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) follows CryptoPunks in the rankings with a valuation of $602 million, while Pudgy Penguins follows closely with $591 million. 

Related: $8.5 million NFT sales surge to $574 million in July, second-highest in 2025

Still, while BAYC leads in valuation, the Pudgy Penguins collection tops BAYC in terms of seven-day volume. DefiLlama data suggests that Pudgy Penguins had a volume of $8.7 million in the past week, while BAYC had $6.3 million. 

In a Cointelegraph interview, Pudgy Penguins CEO and owner Luca Schnetzler (better known as Luca Netz) said the collection's expansion into a physical toy brand saved the company from bankruptcy in 2022. 

Since then, the collection has been a leading NFT brand, rivaling other blue-chip collections. 

This week, blockchain company BTCS Inc. said it added three Pudgy Penguins to its corporate treasury.

Apart from the three collections, other top 10 NFT collections by market cap include Art Block's Chromie Squiggle by Snowfro, Autoglyphs, Fidenza by Tyler Hobbs, Lil Pudgys, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Moonbirds and Milady Maker.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- NFT market cap surged 40% to $9.3B in a month, driven by ETH's rise above $4,600.

- Ethereum dominates NFTs, with top collections like CryptoPunks ($2.4B) and Pudgy Penguins ($591M) leading.

- Pudgy Penguins boosted growth via physical products and community-driven strategy, adding to BTCS's treasury.

- Ethereum's ecosystem expansion, including spot ETFs, supports NFT growth, reflecting crypto's finance-creativity convergence.

The NFT market has experienced a significant 40% increase in market capitalization over the past month, surpassing $9.3 billion as of August 13, 2025. This surge is largely attributed to the rising value of Ether (ETH), which has climbed above $4,600, reinvigorating investor confidence in Ethereum-based assets [1]. The price movement reflects a broader shift in both institutional and retail demand, with Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in year-to-date gains [2].

The Ethereum price increase has directly influenced NFT valuations, as many digital assets are priced in ETH. Higher ETH prices mean higher perceived and actual value for NFTs, leading to increased trading activity and a more robust market [1]. Notably, Ethereum's dominance in the NFT space continues to solidify, with the majority of high-value transactions and top collections existing on its network.

Among the leading NFT collections, CryptoPunks maintains its position as the top asset by market capitalization, valued at approximately $2.4 billion [1]. The collection has also generated nearly $20 million in trading volume over the past week, with an average sale price of about $217,331. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) follows closely with a valuation of $602 million, while Pudgy Penguins, with a valuation of $591 million, has outperformed BAYC in recent trading volume [1]. Pudgy Penguins has seen $8.7 million in weekly volume compared to BAYC's $6.3 million, highlighting its growing influence in the space [1].

Pudgy Penguins' success is attributed to its strategic expansion into physical products and a strong community-driven model. The collection recently added three NFTs to the corporate treasury of BTCS Inc., further cementing its status as a major player in the NFT ecosystem [1]. This development marks a key milestone in the evolution of NFT brands, as physical integration becomes a key differentiator for long-term value and utility.

Other notable NFT collections in the top 10 by market capitalization include Chromie Squiggle by Snowfro, Autoglyphs, Fidenza by Tyler Hobbs, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Moonbirds, and Lil Pudgys [1]. These collections represent a diverse range of creative and technical innovations within the NFT space, each contributing to the overall growth and legitimacy of digital collectibles as an asset class.

The continued rise of the NFT market and Ethereum price demonstrates a strong correlation between blockchain infrastructure and digital asset valuation. As Ethereum's ecosystem continues to expand, with the recent launch of spot ETFs and increased treasury buying activity, the foundation for sustained NFT growth appears increasingly solid [2]. However, while some analysts have speculated on ETH reaching $20,000, such projections remain speculative and should not be conflated with current market fundamentals [4].

The NFT market's performance in recent months underscores a broader trend in the crypto industry: the increasing convergence of financial infrastructure and digital creativity. As Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone for NFT activity, its price trajectory is likely to remain a key indicator of the sector's overall health and momentum [1].

ICO spokesperson clarifies how data protection law applies to facial recognition technology

Our spokesperson said:  

""Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) does not operate in a legal vacuum. It is covered by data protection law, which requires any use of personal data, including biometric data, to be lawful, fair and proportionate. When used by the police, FRT must be deployed in a way that respects people's rights and freedoms, with appropriate safeguards in place.

""FRT is a priority for the ICO due to its potential benefits and risks. We play an important role ensuring police are compliant with data protection law and that people's rights are protected, including by providing clear guidance on the use of FRT and undertaking regular audits of police forces, so that the public can have confidence in how the technology is used. We have recently concluded our audit of South Wales Police and Gwent Police and will be sharing our findings shortly.”

Former WNBA star Sophie Brunner's mother was killed in a head-on crash in Illinois with an illegal immigrant who had a disturbing history of drunk driving, according to authorities.

Darcy Connolly-Brunner, 61, was struck when Rolando Ico-Choc, a 30-year-old Guatemalan national, crossed over into the wrong lane in Freeport on Saturday afternoon, the Stephenson County Sheriff's office said.

The migrant, who had a hefty rap sheet including multiple prior DUIs, was also killed in the wreck, according to officials.

Authorities are now probing whether Ico-Choc was under the influence at the time of the double fatality.

They have already said there is no indication Connolly-Brunner — a married mom-of-four — was drunk.

Ico-Choc came to the US illegally when he swam across the Rio Grande river in July 2021, a source told The Post.

He was released into the US by border agents after being given a future court date of September 2026, the source added.

In the wake of the tragedy, Sen. Andrew Chesney (R-Freeport) confirmed Ico-Choc had been on Homeland Security's radar.

“A woman who dedicated her life to her family and her community was killed in broad daylight by a man who never should have been in this country or on the road,” Chesney said in a statement.

“His criminal record includes prior charges of DUI, aggravated (felony) DUI, and battery. Additionally, it was confirmed by the US Department of Homeland Security that he was in this country illegally, having crossed the border a few years ago during the Biden administration.”

Ico-Choc's run-ins with authorities dates back to at least March 2022 when he was arrested on DUI charges, as well as driving without a valid license, WREX reported.

He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor DUI and was ordered to remain under court supervision for two years, records show.

He was arrested again for a DUI in February 2023 when he was still banned from driving.

Ico-Choc pleaded guilty again and was slapped with a court supervision order, as well as a brief 80 stint in jail.

After he was arrested for domestic battery in June 2023, he was sentenced to six days in prison, court records show.

Sen. Chesney blasted the state's lax immigration law — known as the TRUST Act — that prevents local cops from working with ICE to nab criminal migrants.

“Over the last few years, this man was shielded by systems that provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants and are more focused on allowing criminals to walk free than on protecting Illinois citizens,” Chesney said.

“I am not going to sit by silently while dangerous repeat offenders who are in this country illegally are given free rein to destroy lives.”

State Rep. John Cabello also piled on, blaming Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

“I hold JB Pritzker personally responsible. I hold the Democrats personally responsible,” Cabello said. “This should not have happened. Period.”

Meanwhile, the local sheriff revealed he was friends with the other victim killed in the wreck.

“I'm friends with the family, but I also have to do my job,” Stovall told a press conference. “I'm not directing this investigation in any way. I'm letting the facts speak.”

“She was a kind and giving person who cared deeply for her family and friends,” Stovall added.

“She had a way of making people feel welcome and valued. Her passing has left a hole in the hearts of those who knew her, including myself and members of my family.”

Her daughter, Sophie, played for the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA in 2017 and in the NCAA for Arizona State.

Among the increasingly fast-changing financial world, with blockchain and cryptocurrencies being the catchwords, a new player is joining the spotlight—Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other privately created digital currencies, CBDCs are created and regulated by a nation's central bank. This differentiates them from the rest as they're merging digital money technology with old-school currency trust and stability. With the Crypto Wave sweeping across global markets, CBDCs are being considered as a means to modernize economies without compromising government oversight. But what exactly is a CBDC, and why is it currently such a buzzword in finance?

A CBDC is actually the digital form of a country's fiat money. If you are in the United States, a CBDC would be the digital dollar, in India the digital rupee, in Europe the digital euro. The key difference from existing online banking is that CBDCs are owed by the central bank directly, not a commercial bank.

In real-world usage, CBDCs would be like carrying cash in your phone or virtual wallet that's underwritten by the state. It's not cryptocurrency in the strict sense—there's no hyperinflationary volatility, no secret mining, and no decentralization—but it appropriates some of the underlying blockchain technology for secure, instantaneous payments.

Governments and central banks are interested in CBDCs for several reasons. Firstly is the steady decline in the use of cash. As more and more people use mobile payments and digital wallets, the need for physical cash is decreasing. CBDCs can fill this gap by providing a formal and risk-free digital form of payment.

Second, CBDCs may increase payment efficiency. Cross-border payments, for instance, are slow and costly. With CBDCs, cross-border payments could be faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Finally, CBDCs possess financial inclusion potential. Where people lack access to banking facilities, a central bank-issued digital currency might allow everyone who has a smartphone to hold and transfer money in a secure manner.

It's simple to think of CBDCs as another kind of cryptocurrency, but they're fundamentally different. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are decentralized, market-based, and prone to wildly fluctuating in value. CBDCs, by contrast, are centrally issued, pegged to the nation's fiat currency, and designed to be stable.

But CBDCs borrow a page from crypto. The majority of pilot programs utilize distributed ledger technology (DLT) so as to be open and secure. In this way, CBDCs can preserve the integrity of fiat money but implement some of the innovation that made the Crypto Wave possible.

CBDCs are usually in two types—retail and wholesale

Consumer and business retail CBDCs for everyday use, like cash or a debit card. They can be stored in a mobile wallet and spent to make a purchase, pay a bill, or send money to an individual.

Wholesale CBDCs will be designed for financial institutions, that is, to settle large interbank transactions. Utilizing digital money in place of their existing traditional settlement processes, central banks may prevent settlement delays and risks within the financial system.

The benefits of CBDCs are substantial. For governments, they could mean enhanced control over money supply and easier monitoring of illicit financial activity. To businesses, payments could be less complicated, reducing payment handling and currency conversion costs.

For the general public, CBDCs could be instant, secure payments and greater direct access to central bank money. In times of economic downturn, they could even allow governments to direct stimulus money in a matter of seconds, without banking systems' lag.

Great potential exists, but there are also challenges with CBDCs. Privacy is one of the biggest. If each transaction is posted on a central ledger, then citizens worry about Big Brother and watching their every move. Discovering a CBDC that balances openness to prevent fraud without invading people's privacy will be crucial.

The other concern is cybersecurity. Since the CBDCs are purely in electronic form, they are exposed to attackers. Having robust security mechanisms in place will be essential in order to gain and maintain trust.

There is also the potential impact on the banking sector. If people can keep their money at the central bank directly, they might drain money from commercial banks, lowering their ability to lend and profit. That would alter the financial system fundamentally.

All countries are at different stages of exploring CBDCs. China is already in the lead with Digital Yuan, which is being tested in most cities for general use. The European Central Bank is also pursuing research on the possibility of a Digital Euro. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been cautious, with research as the focus before taking any concrete steps.

India also came into the conversation, with the Reserve Bank of India launching pilot initiatives for a Digital Rupee. The trials seek to experiment with transaction speed, security, and public usage.

The Bahamas, surprisingly, led the way in having a complete CBDC implementation, the Sand Dollar, showing that small economies are just as innovative as the titans of the globe.

The development of CBDCs could redefine what we mean by ""money."" Just as paper currency displaced metal coins a few centuries back, and credit cards transformed trade in the 20th century, CBDCs could be the next step in monetary innovation.

But success will be contingent on trust from the public. For CBDCs to succeed, individuals need to have faith that they are secure, confidential, and helpful in everyday life. Governments will have to teach citizens, work with financial institutions, and make sure the technology infrastructure is able to support widespread adoption.

The real question isn't whether or not there will be CBDCs—there are some already—but how they will exist together with other forms of money, including cash, private bank accounts, and cryptocurrencies.

Central Bank Digital Currencies are a fascinating combination of innovation and heritage. They unite the safety of central money with the speed and convenience of digital payments. Problems of privacy, cybersecurity, and dislocation to the banking industry are there, but the momentum is unstoppable.

As countries implement and enhance their CBDC platforms, we are witnessing the advent of a global revolution in money. Whether they become the norm or merely one option among several, CBDCs will certainly be part of the future of finance.

Money itself has continuously evolved with technology—and CBDCs might just be the next chapter in that story.

The White House wants to usher in a golden age of cryptocurrency and make the United States the “crypto capital of the world” by rolling back some regulatory enforcement and championing legislation that would broaden its accessibility and appeal.

The most telling feature of the Trump administration's radical policy shift regarding crypto is the overturning of several policies put in place by the Biden administration that emphasized a cautious posture that sought to identify and mitigate the risk of cryptocurrencies. This was a stance that many in the cryptocurrency industry perceived as stifling for innovation, leading to the “Crypto Winter” of late 2022. At the heart of the White House's new crypto framework is a comprehensive effort to resolve the persistent regulatory ambiguity that has defined the digital asset landscape in the U.S. for years. The Trump policy strategy tackles reforming the cryptocurrency market by pushing for landmark legislation to create a permanent, clear market structure, coupled with an immediate executive mandate for federal regulators to provide more clarity to the industry.

A similar push to codify the regulation of digital assets is in the works in Congress. The first of these bills to become law, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, established a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Alongside the GENIUS Act, the House also recently passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The CLARITY Act would establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, mainly by distinguishing cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities. Meanwhile, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would ban the Federal Reserve from releasing a central bank digital currency without congressional approval.

These developments have set a clear regulatory path for stablecoins and crypto platforms, ushering in a new wave of institutional legitimacy and potentially widespread adoption of digital payments and finance in the U.S.

The GENIUS Act is the first major regulatory change that could trigger several significant shifts in the cryptocurrency industry, despite being limited to the regulation of stablecoins.

Stablecoins are a form of tokenized digital money using blockchain technology, the digital recordkeeping technology that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely on. Their design aims to maintain a stable value, typically pegged one-to-one with conventional fiat currencies, most commonly the U.S. dollar. While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile and trade as speculative assets, stablecoins are primarily used for payments, remittances, and liquidity in crypto trading and lending platforms.

So far, demand for stablecoins has largely been confined to the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act's requirement for 100% backing of stablecoins with high-quality assets is projected to create a substantial new source of demand for U.S. Treasury securities and other safe assets. The scale of this demand, however, will depend on how quickly and widely stablecoins are adopted outside of the crypto industry.

Stablecoins offer merchants and consumers potential incentives over traditional money. Merchants could benefit from greater efficiency for payment settlement, particularly for cross-border transactions. For consumers, stablecoins work primarily as a non-interest-bearing store of value akin to store gift cards. While there are potential benefits to be unlocked by merchants from the likes of rewards programs for using stablecoins, similar programs for gift cards or credit payments are already available to consumers, so for now, consumers may not see a clear benefit to switching to stablecoins for payments.

Stablecoins could also pose some risks for banks, primarily as a new form of competition. Stablecoins will likely become direct competitors to other financial products like bank deposits and government money market funds. Banks, however, seem to be aware of this potential problem and many are working on launching their own stablecoins.

The establishment of a regulatory framework is helping move digital assets from the fringes of financial markets into the mainstream. This shift will attract new investors and will likely accelerate growth in the industry. That said, lack of understanding remains the primary reason most people don't hold crypto. Most people still don't feel knowledgeable about trading or using it.

Trust is another big hurdle for the widespread adoption of crypto, with many people still skeptical of an industry that has been plagued from the beginning with large-scale scams, fraud and stolen funds. As ownership of cryptocurrencies becomes more common, it is also important to remember that many risks remain, and fraud is still a big issue in the industry.

Some market observers say that the biggest wave of corporate treasury adoption of cryptocurrency has come and gone. However, some studies point to a long runway for corporations to bring crypto into their portfolios.

ETFs such as the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF) and the Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) remain valuable. Companies can embrace crypto in many ways, not just as a treasury holding. Many companies are doing just that; they expect crypto will be a part of their firms' long-term plans.

Deloitte's second-quarter 2025 North American CFO Signals survey polled 200 North American finance bosses at companies with at least $1 billion in annual sales. Crypto bulls and investors mulling assets like BRRR and BTF may be encouraged that a mere 1% of respondents queried by Deloitte said they don't see digital currency becoming part of their employers' long-term plan. That is just one positive from the study.

View corporate adoption of cryptocurrency and its implications for funds like BRRR and BTF pragmatically. CFOs are expressing related concerns.

“When asked about their biggest worries related to investing in cryptocurrency, 43% of CFOs cited price volatility,” observed Deloitte. “That's not particularly surprising, given that the value of non-stable cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has seen considerable price fluctuations in the past. Earlier this year, for instance, the value of bitcoin dropped 28% in a 10-week span.”

Polled CFOs also said they're worried about crypto industry regulations, security issues and their own lack of crypto expertise. Some of those concerns could be allayed over time and those issues aren't hampering treasury adoption – potentially good news for BRRR and BTF.

“Twenty-three percent said their treasury departments will utilize crypto for either investments or payments within the next two years. That percentage is closer to 40% for CFOs at organizations with US$10 billion in revenues and up,” noted Deloitte.

In fact, 15% of CFOs told the consultancy their companies could purchase non-stablecoin digital assets over the next two years. That could mean more well-heeled buyers will be stepping into the cryptocurrency market with the firepower to possibly lift prices for some of the largest assets in the space. Plus, CFOs see value in bringing crypto into their treasurys.

“Such currencies can help diversify an organization's investment portfolio. What's more, despite price fluctuations, non-stable crypto investments offer the possibility of substantial price appreciation—gains that can far outweigh returns on assets like Treasurys,” concluded Deloitte.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","How Binance's Yi He became ‘the most powerful woman in crypto'—and steered the company past its biggest ordeal","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/13/binance-yi-he/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance.

When Yi He was a girl in the 1980s, she walked to the well for water and relied on kerosene lamps at times to light the house. Things are different now. Today, Yi He is a celebrity to millions of Chinese and a multibillionaire thanks to her reported 10% stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, where she wields enormous influence as a cofounder and senior executive. Still, life has not been easy.

Binance's other cofounder, the flamboyant Changpeng Zhao, went to prison last year in the United States as part of a $4 billion plea deal. The situation created a huge business challenge for Binance and for Yi He, a painful personal one since Zhao was not only the company's CEO but is the father of her young children.





Today, Binance appears to have weathered the ordeal. Zhao has served his sentence, and Binance, despite incurring the sort of blow that would have crippled most companies, is still on top as the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Yi He has been instrumental in achieving this, and after years of wielding power behind the scenes, is taking on a more public role running Binance.





In a rare interview, Yi He told Fortune about her journey from poor village girl to crypto billionaire, the tests she faced during Binance's year of crisis, and her vision for an industry that is fast transforming global finance.





In the course of her life and career, Yi He has overcome many obstacles—one of which has been learning English, which she only took up four years ago in her mid-thirties. During a long Zoom interview, He acquits herself well, only falling back on her translator when she struggles to explain a Chinese idiom or proverb.




The power of communication is something Yi He knows well. At Binance, she is renowned for her marketing and customer service skills, which helped vault the exchange to the biggest in the world in less than a year. To this day, she prides herself on listening to Binance clients on Telegram, X, WeChat, and any other platform where they might be found, and insists everyone else do the same. She has famously required that everyone who comes to work at Binance spend a few weeks on the front lines of customer service.





Yi He describes a recent encounter with a university student who had sent $500 worth of crypto to the wrong wallet, a common mistake and one that typically means the funds are gone for good. Yi He, though, took the time to track down and recover the misdirected funds, recalling how the student had told her, “It's a small figure for you but everything to me.”





Yi He says she can empathize with such stories given her own experience growing up poor in Sichuan province, where she lost her father at age 9 and, when she was 16, spent long hours working to promote soft drinks outside a supermarket. Though she ultimately made her way to university—He pauses to recall the delights of being in a library for the first time—and a career as a TV host, she says her humble beginnings mean she can still relate to Binance's many customers of modest means.





Yi He's tale has echoes of Jennifer Lopez's “Jenny From the Block,” a song about a beautiful woman who keeps the common touch even after she is rich and famous—the sort of story Americans lap up.





But that's not how it plays in China, says Eowyn Chen, CEO of crypto firm Trust Wallet, who formerly worked for Yi He at Binance. According to Chen, Chinese people are less inclined to root for the underdog, and are more likely instead to hurl insults at those who have risen above their station. Chen says Yi He is the regular target of articles and social media barbs that seek to demean and ridicule her, but that her response is to turn negative rhetoric against those lobbing it.




“She tells people, ‘Sure, I came from a crappy background and made good, so why don't you do the same?'” says Chen.





Yi He, whom Bloomberg dubbed “the most powerful woman in crypto,” has climbed to the top of the blockchain world using this mix of smarts, hustle, and cockiness—qualities she shares with her cofounder and romantic partner.





When Changpeng Zhao launched Binance in 2017, he had already built an outsize public persona as CZ, by which he is universally known today. Zhao built up the CZ mythology by taking outsize risks—like selling his Shanghai apartment in 2014 to buy more Bitcoin—and by enthusiastically joining in the daily shitposting for the very online community known as Crypto Twitter.





Zhao asked Yi He to join Binance in its early days but only after she had first recruited him years earlier, when she persuaded him to join her as chief technology officer at the exchange OKCoin (now OKX) in 2014. The pair shared an enthusiasm for crypto but other qualities as well. Zhao, like Yi He, spent his early years in an unheated, rural schoolhouse until his father immigrated to Canada where, in high school, Zhao worked minimum wage jobs at Chevron and McDonald's. Zhao is also inclined to clap back at those who mock his background, even retweeting memes of himself in a Golden Arches uniform.





It was during their time at OKCoin that the pair became a couple as they gained experience operating a massive crypto business. Today, the pair, who never married but remain romantically involved, work closely as parents and business partners. Yi He is co-owner with Zhao of Binance's venture capital arm turned family office, YZi Labs, and owns at least 10% of shares in the parent company, according to the Wall Street Journal.




On the nature of her relationship with Zhao, Yi He asked not to be quoted on the record and instead provided a written statement: “My personal life is independent from my professional life. My achievements and capabilities as cofounder are often overlooked with my personal life in question,” she wrote, while touting a Binance user base of 280 million customers.





Whatever the personal dimensions of the relationship, the professional side of it has proved highly effective, with Yi He roughly serving as the Binance equivalent of Sheryl Sandberg, the executive who helped build Facebook in its early days while helping to ground the then-unpolished CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.





In practice, this has meant Zhao occupying the role of Binance's larger-than-life frontman and product visionary, with Yi He fanning massive growth through aggressive promotions, including car giveaways. Her approach found favor with the Chinese community abroad and also in China, where crypto is technically banned but still hugely popular, in part because it is an easily transferable asset beyond the reach of government capital controls.





A Binance employee who asked not to be named so as to discuss the firm's executives described Yi He as an exacting boss, but one who supports employees and advocates for those around her. In discussing Binance's day-to-day operations, Yi He said a core tenet at the company is “founder culture,” a phrase from the tech world that describes firms that retain the original drive of their early startup days.





In the case of Binance, those early days were defined in part by a willingness to play fast and loose with regulation, and to hopscotch from country to country in response to government scrutiny. While that strategy helped fuel Binance's incredible growth, it has at times also been the company's biggest weakness—one that caused it to lose its most prominent founder.




By early 2023, the walls were closing in. Following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange the previous year, the Biden administration redoubled its efforts to bring the crypto sector to heel—with a particular focus on the sector's biggest player, Binance. The company's lawyers had been in discussions with the Justice Department about various allegations for years, but finally the time had come to make a deal. 





In September of 2023, the agency announced a sweeping settlement that would not only see Binance pay a whopping $4.3 billion fine—the largest of its kind in corporate history—but also force Zhao to step down as CEO and plead guilty to charges of failing to implement adequate anti-money-laundering measures. Both the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, meanwhile, cited multiple unnamed sources to claim the agency sought to force Yi He to leave the company as well. (“Binance's plea agreements with the U.S. regulators are a matter of public record,” said a company spokesperson.)





Despite this massive blow to both its treasury and leadership, Binance two years later remains the biggest crypto exchange by far under Zhao's successor, Richard Teng. A former top regulator from Singapore, Teng has helped the company implement a raft of compliance measures and project a new image that suggests it has evolved beyond the fast-and-loose tactics of its early days. In January, Binance also took a major step—for the first time introducing a formal board structure, featuring seven members including Teng and three independent directors.





Despite all this, a former employee at the company told Fortune that the power at Binance very much resides where it always has—with Zhao, Yi He, and two other early Binance executives, Lilai “Roger” Wang and Wei “Sonny” Zhou. The person, who asked not to be identified in order to speak candidly, added that Yi He has a final say in all personnel matters and exerts the greatest authority when it comes to customer experience decisions. The Binance spokesperson, meanwhile, said the claim is not accurate and that the company's culture encourages employees to exercise a high degree of autonomy.





The founder of a venture capital firm, meanwhile, described Binance as a company run with an “iron fist” that, despite dealing with new legal constraints and the challenge of running a sprawling global operation, is in no danger of losing its place as market leader. This assessment appears to be supported by recent data, supplied by CoinGecko, that shows Binance holding on to the lion's share of trading activity—39% of volume on centralized exchanges in June—despite the emergence of new competitors:




For Yi He, Binance's ongoing dominance comes as a validation of her customer-first strategy, and of the company founder's personal devotion to crypto—a technology she views as transformational, to the same degree that the arrival of the internet changed traditional media and TV.





Yi He predicts that crypto will accelerate its push into the conventional financial system through stablecoins and other blockchain technologies and that, in five to 10 years, both realms will be fully integrated with each other.





On a personal level, Yi He says the mass adoption of crypto feels like yet another massive technological change she has experienced since the days of her girlhood not so long ago, when her house didn't have electricity or running water.





As for the trials she's experienced along the way, she cites a Mongolian proverb: “Since you have spoken well, do not speak of pain. If you speak of the good, do not mention the pain.”

- Institutional investors increasingly adopt crypto as core assets, driven by strategic emphasis from leaders like LightHash founder Wang Feng.

- Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate institutional portfolios, reshaping capital flows while blockchain technology enhances financial transparency and efficiency.

- Cross-sector collaborations (e.g., Tencent Music-Wang Feng) and academic research highlight crypto's role in bridging entertainment, tech, and finance sectors.

- Market data shows $119k Bitcoin price with $2.38T cap, reinforcing institutional confidence as regulatory frameworks adapt to digital asset integration.

Institutional interest in cryptocurrency is gaining traction across global finance, with industry leaders emphasizing the strategic importance of digital assets in modern portfolio management. Wang Feng, founder of LightHash, underscored this trend in remarks shared on August 13, 2025, highlighting how banks, asset managers, and venture capital firms are increasingly adopting cryptocurrencies as part of their investment strategies. This shift reflects a broader transformation in how traditional financial institutions perceive and integrate blockchain-based assets [1].

According to Wang, Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged as core pillars in institutional portfolios, reshaping capital flows and redefining asset management approaches. His insights align with a growing consensus among financial professionals who view digital currencies as essential tools for diversification and efficiency. The shift is particularly notable in markets such as the US and China, where regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate the growing presence of crypto in institutional portfolios [1].

Wang also emphasized the necessity for financial professionals to deepen their understanding of blockchain technology, citing its potential to enhance data integrity and transaction transparency. “Blockchain technology is already reshaping traditional finance, necessitating a dual focus on digital transformation and crypto integration for corporate competitiveness,” he stated [1].

The institutional shift is further reinforced by a broader cultural and economic convergence, as seen in the recent collaboration between Tencent Music Entertainment and Wang Feng, a renowned Chinese artist. While the partnership primarily involves music promotion, its mention in the context of institutional crypto integration signals a growing openness among traditional entities to engage with digital innovation. This development underscores the increasing overlap between entertainment, technology, and finance, with crypto playing a central role in bridging these sectors [2].

Academic research supports the notion that crypto markets are structurally distinct and evolving rapidly. A recent study published in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management highlights the heterogeneity of crypto markets and proposes scalable frameworks for real-time monitoring and risk management [3]. Such research underscores the need for institutional actors to adapt their strategies to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets.

The growing institutional interest in crypto is not limited to investment but extends to the adoption of blockchain infrastructure for operational efficiency. Financial institutions are exploring tokenized assets and decentralized systems to streamline processes and reduce intermediation costs. These developments are reshaping traditional financial models and creating new opportunities for innovation.

As the integration of crypto into institutional portfolios accelerates, the role of high-profile figures like Wang Feng in normalizing these trends cannot be overlooked. His contributions, both in the arts and in the fintech space, exemplify the cross-sectoral impact of digital transformation. The collaboration between Tencent Music and Wang Feng, while not directly related to financial investment, reflects the broader institutional engagement with crypto and its cultural implications.

The current market data also supports this narrative. As reported by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $119,383.47 with a market cap of $2.38 trillion. While the 24-hour trading volume has decreased by 4.47 percent, the overall trend remains stable, indicating sustained institutional interest [1]. These figures, alongside historical parallels to the internet boom, suggest that the adoption of digital assets is entering a phase of mainstream integration.

As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the emphasis on crypto integration is expected to influence regulatory approaches, investor education, and market infrastructure. The collaboration between traditional institutions and digital innovators is paving the way for a more inclusive and dynamic financial ecosystem.

 Published - August 13, 2025 09:31 am IST - NEW YORK


                    In a statement, the lawyer said his client “takes responsibility for misleading the Terra community” [File]
                                          | Photo Credit: REUTERS
                                      

South Korean cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two fraud charges arising from the $40 billion collapse of a cryptocurrency ecosystem that had promised investors their money was safe.

Kwon, 33, dubbed by some as “the cryptocurrency king,” entered the plea in Manhattan federal court.

According to a plea agreement signed by Kwon and prosecutors, the government said it will not seek a prison term of more than 12 years as long as Kwon complies with the deal's terms, even though federal sentencing guidelines would have recommended a prison term of about 25 years. Sentencing is set for December 11.

Authorities said investors worldwide lost money in the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs' $40 billion cryptocurrency crash. Kwon co-founded the company in 2018.

The May 2022 collapse came after the company claimed that TerraUSD was a reliable “stablecoin.”

TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency that is pegged to stable assets such as the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.

Kwon was extradited to the United States on Dec. 31 from Montenegro after his March 23, 2023, arrest while traveling on a false passport in Europe.

As part of his plea to one count of conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud and a second count of wire fraud, Kwon also agreed to forfeit over $19 million, an amount that authorities said reflected ill-gotten proceeds. He'll also lose his interest in Terraform and its cryptocurrencies.

His lawyer, Sean Hecker, said the plea meant that Kwon had accepted responsibility for making false and misleading statements to investors.

In a statement, the lawyer said his client ""takes responsibility for misleading the Terra community.”

In a news release, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Kwon “used the technological promise and investment euphoria around cryptocurrency to commit one of the largest frauds in history.”

He said investors around the world suffered billions of dollars in losses.

Gaming has changed. What once involved discs, cartridges, and memory cards has turned into cloud saves, virtual assets, and online marketplaces. Behind many of these changes is blockchain, a technology best known for powering cryptocurrencies, now making its way into digital play spaces. Whether it's through token-based economies or ownership of in-game items, this shift is attracting attention from those who care about fairness, security, and personal control.

A growing number of platforms now integrate decentralised systems to power everything from loot mechanics to in-game economies. Titles like Illuvium and Star Atlas are pioneering blockchain-powered gaming environments, while popular games such as The Sandbox and Decentraland have created fully-fledged digital worlds where players can buy, sell, and trade virtual land and items using crypto and prove ownership via NFTs.

This same technology is also influencing the world of online gambling. In America, where gambling regulations are among the strictest globally, blockchain offers a way to enhance transparency and fairness. Many of the best crypto casinos now use provably fair systems, allowing users to independently verify every card shuffle or dice roll. These platforms often support secure, instant payments via digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and some are even licensed by recognised international regulators.

In gaming circles, blockchain's appeal often starts with ownership. Traditionally, when players buy skins, weapons or upgrades, they don't own them. The items live on a server and can be taken away at any time. With blockchain-based games, items are stored as digital tokens. These can be kept in private wallets or sold to others, with proof of ownership attached to the token itself. Games like Illuvium and Gods Unchained are already using this approach. Players in these titles can win or buy digital cards and gear that they fully control, outside of the game's system.

The connection between gaming and blockchain doesn't end with digital assets. It extends to how games themselves are built and run. Some developers are now using smart contracts, bits of code stored on blockchain, to automate game rules and outcomes. That means every match, roll or decision is written into code and can't be changed once live. This kind of setup is particularly useful in casino-style games, where fairness and trust are often questioned. Having clear, public code that determines the outcome of a bet or spin gives players peace of mind.

The influence of blockchain can also be seen in metaverse-style platforms, where virtual casinos are built inside persistent online worlds. These spaces aren't just for gambling; they also include chat rooms, custom avatars, and player-driven economies. In some cases, users can even buy virtual land next to a casino and rent it out. One example is Decentraland, which has hosted digital poker rooms and slot halls. While it sounds experimental, it's already happening. These projects attract tech-savvy players who are curious about how blockchain can support large, interactive environments.

Streaming has added another layer to this shift. Platforms like Twitch and Kick are home to creators who play games live while sharing thoughts and strategies with viewers. Some now stream their sessions on blockchain-powered games or casino sites, bringing more visibility to the space. This doesn't mean everyone watching is taking part; it just means interest is growing. There are even leaderboards and giveaways tied to digital wallets, turning viewers into participants when they choose to join.

It's important to note that not every game with blockchain is focused on gambling. Many are adventure, card, or strategy games that use the tech in smaller ways. Still, the overlap between blockchain features and online casino formats is growing. Faster payments, verified results, and player-run economies all appeal to those who want more control and less middleman involvement.

As online play continues to evolve, so too does the technology that powers it. Blockchain is no longer just about coins or crypto speculation. It's about how people interact, compete, and trade in digital environments where fairness and ownership matter. Whether that's in a battle royale or at a virtual blackjack table, the rules are changing, and for many players, that's exactly the point.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Standard Chartered (STAN) Raises Ether (ETH) Price Targets as Fundamentals Strengthen","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/13/ether-price-target-lifted-to-usd7-5k-at-year-end-and-usd25k-in-2028-at-standard-chartered","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:22:30 GMT","

Ether (ETH) has been on a big run of late, but it's just getting started, according to Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. 

Citing surging institutional demand, favorable regulation, and network upgrades, Kendrick lifted his year-end price target for ETH to $7,500 from $4,000 and his end-2028 target to $25,000 from $7,500. Up more than 50% over the past month, ether is currently trading hands just beneath its record high at $4,700.

Alongside, he expects continued outperformance over bitcoin BTC$121,779.01, forecasting the ETH/BTC ratio to rose to 0.05 from the current 0.039.

Ether treasury companies and spot exchange-traded funds have purchased 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June, Kendrick said, adding that this was twice the fastest pace of comparable bitcoin buying.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has also received a regulatory boost from the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act in July, which paves the way for mainstream stablecoin adoption. More than half of all stablecoins are issued on Ethereum, and these cryptocurrencies already account for 40% of blockchain fees, Kendrick noted.

Network growth is a tailwind. Ethereum developers aim to boost Layer 1 throughput by 10x, positioning the chain for higher-value transactions and expanding Layer 2 ecosystems, the report added.

Companies that are buying ether for their treasury strategy are a better buy for investors than ETH spot exchange-traded funds, the bank said in a report earlier this month.

Sapien Foundation, the governing body behind the decentralized data foundry for artificial intelligence protocol Sapien AI, said it will generate and distribute tokens for the first time on Aug. 20.

The token generation event (TGE) for SAPIEN will take place on Coinbase's layer-2 blockchain, Base. The tokens will power the protocol's decentralized data foundry, which connects demand for high-quality data with a global network of human experts.

Sapien's system is designed to help AI teams answer two fundamental questions for every decision their models make: ""Where did this data come from, and can it be trusted?""

The protocol uses what it calls Proof of Quality in the form of on-chain incentives to make human data traceable and trustworthy, according to CEO Rowan Stone. PoQ employs four integrated mechanisms — staking, validation, reputation and incentives — to enforce data quality by rewarding contributors who provide reliable information and penalizing those who do not, thereby creating a self-governing model for high-integrity AI training data.

The TGE implements a fair launch model comprising an initial unlock of 25% of the total 1 billion tokens.

A portion of the airdrop – 5% of the total supply – will be distributed to early contributors based on their confirmed points. An additional 0.5% of the total will be allocated to the top 10,000 members of its partner community, CookieDAO, with 30% of this allocation unlocked at the TGE.

The Sapien Squad and Discord role holders are also slated to receive a bonus allocation for their participation.

The token launch is backed by a series of significant developments, including over 30 enterprise clients and a new partnership with Coinbase's Embedded Wallets feature, designed to provide a frictionless on-chain experience for the protocol's user base.

Following the TGE, the protocol plans to formalize partnerships with Billions and Intuition, forming one of the largest mindshare cohorts in the AI space.

Sapien's management team includes Stone, a co-creator of Base, and Trevor Koverko, founder of Polymath. It is backed by leading investors including Variant, Primitive Ventures, Yield Guild Games YGG$0.1764 and Orange DAO through its $10.5 million seed round.

Meme coin posts strong mid-session rally before profit-taking trims gains, with large-holder flows signaling sustained institutional interest.

DOGE gains 5.6% in the 23-hour period ending August 13, climbing from $0.225 to $0.233 in an $0.0198 range (8.8% volatility). Morning trade establishes $0.220 as firm support on volume above the 24-hour average of 387.7M. Price accelerates between 12:00-20:00, rallying from $0.221 to $0.238 on sustained bid-side demand before evening resistance caps upside.

Token extends post-settlement rally on strong mid-session momentum, with volumes topping 140 million tokens as buyers test $3.30 resistance.

XRP rises 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 13, climbing from $3.15 to $3.25 within a $0.20 range (6% volatility). The bulk of gains occur between 12:00 and 20:00, when price moves from $3.15 to $3.30 on volume exceeding 140M units. Resistance forms at $3.30 as buying momentum slows, while support consolidates at $3.25-$3.26, showing orderly profit-taking without breaking bullish structure.

The final trading hour sees a 1% retreat from $3.27 to $3.25 as late-session profit-taking emerges. Volume spikes above 5.9M during 00:32-00:33 point to controlled distribution by institutional desks while keeping price above key support.

Ripple Labs and the Securities and Exchange Commission have formally dismissed their appeals, concluding years of litigation over XRP. The legal clarity has triggered fresh institutional inflows, with daily volumes up 208% to $12.4B since the announcement.

Enterprise adoption headlines added to sentiment, including Blue Origin's integration of XRP payments and SEC approval of Ripple's enhanced Regulation D exemption — removing capital-raising constraints for certain investor classes.

 Ethereum core dev Zak Cole lost funds after a malicious Cursor extension stole his private key, highlighting increasing wallet drainer attacks on builders. 

A core Ethereum developer said he was hit by a cryptocurrency wallet drainer linked to a rogue code assistant, underscoring how even seasoned builders can be caught by increasingly polished scams.  

Core Ethereum developer Zak Cole fell victim to a malicious artificial intelligence extension from Cursor AI, which enabled the attacker to access his hot wallet for three days before draining the funds, he said in a Tuesday X post.

The developer installed the “contractshark.solidity-lang” that appeared legitimate with a professional icon, descriptive copy and more than 54,000 downloads, but it silently exfiltrated his private key. The plugin “read my .env file” and sent the key to an attacker's server, giving access to a hot wallet for three days before funds were drained on Sunday, he said.

“In 10+ years, I have never lost a single wei to hackers. Then I rushed to ship a contract last week,” Cole said, adding that the loss was limited to a “few hundred” dollars in Ether (ETH) because he uses small, project-segregated hot wallets for testing and keeps primary holdings on hardware devices.

Wallet drainers — malware designed to steal digital assets — are becoming a growing threat to cryptocurrency investors.

In September 2024, a wallet drainer disguised as the WalletConnect Protocol stole over $70,000 worth of digital assets from investors after being live on the Google Play store for over five months.

Malicious VS Code and extensions are becoming a “major attack vector, using fake publishers and typosquatting to steal private keys,” according to Hakan Unal, senior security operations lead at blockchain security firm Cyvers.

Meanwhile, crypto drainers are becoming even more accessible for scammers.

 Ether inches closer to all-time highs as several bullish indicators align to support a rally into price discovery in the coming days. 

Key takeaways:

ETH's price jumped 10% today, inching toward its all-time high of $ 4,867.

Over $2.3 billion flows into spot Ethereum ETFs over six days.

Traders say ETH could rise as high as $13,000 once it enters price discovery.

Ether (ETH) surpassed $4,600 on Wednesday, up 8% over the last 24 hours as multiple bullish signals suggested that new all-time highs are inevitable.

The ETH/USD pair reached an intraday high of $4,715 on Wednesday, just below the $4,867 all-time high reached in November 2021 (on Coinbase), data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows. 

“Bids for Ethereum continue to strengthen with the asset marching toward ATHs,” onchain data provider Glassnode said in a Tuesday post on X.

Glassnode explained that ETH has “served as a bellwether for broader altcoin performance” and its latest strength is now fueling speculation for further upside. 

This performance is supported by a return of investor demand, in the form of capital inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These investment products have seen a six-day inflow streak totalling $2.3 billion, with Monday setting a record $1 billion in net inflows. 

“Another half a billion into spot ETH ETF, 5th best day since launch,” NovaDius president Nate Geraci said on X.

He added that this was a notable shift as the “spot eth ETFs have taken in nearly $1.5 billion more than spot BTC ETFs” since the beginning of July. 

Moreover, treasury companies are increasingly accumulating ETH with holdings surpassing $16.5 billion. 

BitMine Immersion Technologies leads with 1.2 million ETH ($5.33 billion), followed by SharpLink Gaming with 598,800 ETH after a 177% increase over the last month. The Ether Machine holds 345,400 ETH.

With more than 30% of ETH staked, i.e., can't be immediately sold, this signals strong upward potential for Ether price. 

Ethereum's daily transaction count reached a near-record high of over 1.87 million on Tuesday, with July 2025 recording approximately 50 million transactions, the highest in over a year. 

Coupled with a near-all-time high total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, currently at $95 billion and with 61% of market share, this surge in network activity signals robust demand and utility.

The next major hurdle for ETH is close to the all-time high at around $4,700, according to analysts. 

This level is the +1 standard deviation level of Ether's active realized price, “often marking where selling pressure starts to build”, Glassnode said in their latest Week Onchain Report, adding:

“A breakout above $4,750 with sustained transaction momentum could ignite a price discovery phase,” said Cryptoquant analyst CryptoOnchain in a QuickTake analysis on Wednesday.

With respect to price discovery, several analysts said Ether could rise to areas beyond $10,000, based on various technical setups.

Analyst Jelle shared a chart showing ETH trading above a bullish megaphone with upside targets between $7,000 and $13,000.

One last hurdle to overcome.Price discovery less than 5% away.Let's get this show on the road.$ETH pic.twitter.com/J1MkDG9JUD

Crypto investor and YouTuber DivXMaN said that while the $7,500 ETH price target remains in play, the price discovery journey would take it to $13,000 based on “previous bull runs and rate of diminishing returns.”

As Cointelegraph reported, Ether price predictions after breaking the critical $4,000 level now go as high as $20,000 for the current bull market.

 Ether's market capitalization has typically reached up to 35% of Bitcoin's in past cycles, and its price could reach $8,500 if the pattern repeats and Bitcoin hits $150,000. 

Ether may climb to over $8,500 if Bitcoin makes a highly anticipated move to $150,000, according to a trader's analysis of past bull market trends.

“In major bull runs, ETH typically hits 30-35% of Bitcoin's [market cap],” crypto trader Yashasedu said in an X post on Tuesday, noting that in the 2021 bull run, Ether (ETH) rose to reach 36% of Bitcoin's then-market capitalization.

Yashasedu said that if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $150,000 — a 25% increase from its current price of $119,335 — then ETH may soar to $8,656, assuming Ether reaches 35% of Bitcoin's market cap as in previous cycles.

They added that even at the lower range, if ETH reached 21.70% to 30% of Bitcoin's market cap when Bitcoin hit $150,000, its price could trade between $5,376 and $7,420.

Yashasedu said that the pattern of Ether reaching between 30% and 35% of Bitcoin's market cap is set for a repeat. 

“We're seeing a similar setup now,” they said, noting that Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) recently topped $90 billion, alongside surging institutional interest and growing exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand for Ether.

Several crypto firms and analysts expect Bitcoin to surpass $150,000 by the end of the year. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, and Unchained market research director Joe Burnett all predict it will reach up to $250,000 by the end of 2025.

On Tuesday, blockchain technology firm BitMine Immersion Technologies said it would raise up to $20 billion for ETH purchases. A day earlier, spot Ether ETFs recorded their biggest day of net inflows ever, with flows across all funds totalling $1.01 billion.

In the near term, there is high anticipation that Ether will soon reclaim its all-time highs, currently trading at $4,630, about 5.35% below its November 2021 peak of $4,878, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Yashasedu doesn't anticipate a “cool off” in Ether's price until it reclaims the all-time high. MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe foresees a similar situation.

“We'll likely see a new ATH for ETH and then some consolidation,” van de Poppe said on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Mathematician Found an Easier Way to Solve Quadratic Equations","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a65676247/easier-way-to-solve-quadratic-equations/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:26:46 GMT","

Here's the secret.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A mathematician has derived an easier way to solve quadratic equation problems, according to MIT's Technology Review. 

Quadratic equations are polynomials that include an x², and teachers use them to teach students to find two solutions at once. The easier process, developed by Dr. Po-Shen Loh at Carnegie Mellon University, goes around traditional methods like completing the square and turns finding roots into a simpler thing involving fewer steps that are also more intuitive. Here's Dr. Loh's explainer video. 

Quadratic equations fall into an interesting donut hole in education. Students learn them beginning in algebra or pre-algebra classes, but they're spoonfed examples that work out very easily and with whole integer solutions. The same thing happens with the Pythagorean theorem, where in school, most examples end up solving out to Pythagorean triples, the small set of integer values that work cleanly into the Pythagorean theorem. 

Quadratic equations are polynomials, meaning strings of math terms. An expression like “x + 4” is a polynomial. They can have one or many variables in any combination, and the magnitude of them is decided by what power the variables are taken to. So x + 4 is an expression describing a straight line, but (x + 4)² is a curve. 

Since a line crosses just once through any particular latitude or longitude, its solution is just one value. If you have x², that means two root values, in a shape like a circle or arc that makes two crossings.

Dr. Loh's method, which he also shared in detail on his website, uses the idea of the two roots of every quadratic equation to make a simpler way to derive those roots. 

He realized he could describe the two roots of a quadratic equation this way: Combined, they average out to a certain value, then there's a value z that shows any additional unknown value. Instead of searching for two separate, different values, we're searching for two identical values to begin with. This simplifies the arithmetic part of multiplying the formula out.

“Normally, when we do a factoring problem, we are trying to find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 8,” Dr. Loh said. Those two numbers are the solution to the quadratic, but it takes students a lot of time to solve for them, as they're often using a guess-and-check approach.

Instead of starting by factoring the product, 12, Loh starts with the sum, 8.

If the two numbers we're looking for, added together, equal 8, then they must be equidistant from their average. So the numbers can be represented as 4–u and 4+u.

When you multiply, the middle terms cancel out and you come up with the equation 16–u2 = 12. When solving for u, you'll see that positive and negative 2 each work, and when you substitute those integers back into the equations 4–u and 4+u, you get two solutions, 2 and 6, which solve the original polynomial equation.

It's quicker than the classic foiling method used in the quadratic formula—and there's no guessing required. —Courtney Linder

Dr. Loh believes students can learn this method more intuitively, partly because there's not a special, separate formula required. If students can remember some simple generalizations about roots, they can decide where to go next.

It's still complicated, but it's less complicated, especially if Dr. Loh is right that this will smooth students's understanding of how quadratic equations work and how they fit into math. Understanding them is key to the beginning ideas of precalculus, for example.

Outside of classroom-ready examples, the quadratic method isn't simple. Real examples and applications are messy, with ugly roots made of decimals or irrational numbers. As a student, it's hard to know you've found the right answer. Dr. Loh's new method is for real life, but he hopes it will also help students feel they understand the quadratic formula better at the same time. 

Many math students struggle to move across the gulf in understanding between simple classroom examples and applying ideas themselves, and Dr. Loh wants to build them a better bridge.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Ask anyone what they dread about aging, and the thought of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia is likely an answer high on the list. The irreversible symptoms of dementia only worsen with time and can become severe enough for the person to struggle remembering the faces of those close to them and even their own identity.

There is no cure for dementia (even though treatments that mitigate symptoms do exist). However, answers for prevention may lie in the brains of superagers, individuals over the age of 80 who have memories superior to others in their age group and can recall things as well as people decades younger. A Northwestern University study that spanned 25 years studied the lifestyles and brain activity of superagers both during life and in those who had donated their brains postmortem. 

What the researchers at the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Research Center found were physical differences in brain structures that delayed symptoms of brain aging that often lead to dementia. Superagers would remember at least as many words from a list read to them as neurotypical adults who were 20 to 30 years younger. Their brain age of these subjects, mostly octogenarians and novogenerians, defied the expectations of the degenerative processes that often happen to the brains of people who reach their biological age. What is considered “normal” brain aging involves decline. The average brain usually does not stay so remarkably intact.

“During the first 25 years of this program, we established that superagers constitute not only a neuropsychological but also a neurobiological phenotype distinctive from cognitively average age peers,” they said in a study recently published in Alzheimer's & Dementia. 

What gives superagers these superpowers? There are several contributing factors. Somehow, their cerebral cortex resists thinning that is often a cause of neurodegenerative diseases. This outermost portion of the brain, also known as gray matter, is made of tightly packed neurons and responsible for higher-level processes that include memory, as well as learning, thought, reasoning, intelligence, language, decision-making, emotion, and personality.   Superagers experience little to no cortical thinning, giving them cortical volumes similar to those of much younger brains. 

There are also less obvious parts of the brain that give them an advantage, such as the cingulate gyrus, which is located below the cerebral cortex and above the corpus callosum. The cingulate gyrus also processes memory, along with emotion, self-regulation and pain. Superagers have a region in the cingulate gyrus that is thicker than the same region in younger adults. Their brains also show fewer signs that often indicate the onset of Alzheimer's, such as less plaque buildup. 

Nerves and the neurons they are made of are another factor critical for brain health, especially in advanced age. Superagers were discovered to have larger entorhinal neurons, which are found in the entorhinal cortex and involved in memory of times, places and objects. Their cholinergic nerves, which are involved in memory and help control many physical processes, are especially well preserved. There is also a greater density of von Economo neurons, which speed up information processing, in their brains. Microglia, cells which are found in nerve fibers and often behind brain inflammation and lesions in older individuals, are less prone to causing inflammation in superagers. 

Something that surprised the Northwestern research team was that superagers did not necessarily have many lifestyle parallels. Some took every measure to keep themselves healthy. Others had done just about everything that would seem to counter that, such as smoking, drinking, and being sedentary. Many suffered from stress and were not able to get adequate sleep. The one thing that most superagers did have in common was that they were had active social lives, making extracurricular activities a regular part of their lives. They even reported having more positive relationships with others than people around the same age who were cognitively average. 

Eventually, the structure and function of superager brains may be the basis for preventative treatments and gene therapies targeting Alzheimer's, other dementias, and more neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. There are some aspects of this phenomenon that have yet to surface: whether superagers are born with larger brains, or with factors that make their brains almost immune to the ravages of time that cause others to experience the effects of brain degeneration. Either way, researchers are going to remember these findings for future studies. 

“In the future, deeper characterization of the superaging phenotype may lead to interventions that enhance resistance and resilience to involutional changes considered part of average (i.e., “normal”) brain aging,” the researchers said. “This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired [more] investigations.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny chip could unlock gamma ray lasers, cure cancer, and explore the multiverse","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250812234617.htm","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:50:26 GMT","

A University of Colorado Denver engineer is on the cusp of giving scientists a new tool that can help them turn sci-fi into reality.

Imagine a safe gamma ray laser that could eradicate cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. Or a tool that could help determine if Stephen Hawking's multiverse theory is real by revealing the fabric underlying the universe.

Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering Aakash Sahai, PhD, has developed a quantum breakthrough that could help those sci-fi ideas develop and has sent a ripple of excitement through the quantum community because of its potential to revolutionize our understanding of physics, chemistry, and medicine. Advanced Quantum Technologies, one of the most impactful journals in the fields of quantum science, materials, and technologies, recognized Sahai's work and featured his study on the cover of its June issue.

""It is very exciting because this technology will open up whole new fields of study and have a direct impact on the world,"" Sahai said. ""In the past, we've had technological breakthroughs that propelled us forward such as the sub-atomic structure leading to lasers, computer chips, and LEDs. This innovation, which is also based on material science, is along the same lines.""

How It Works

Sahai has found a way to create extreme electromagnetic fields never before possible in a laboratory. These electromagnetic fields -- created when electrons in materials vibrate and bounce at incredibly high speeds -- power everything from computer chips to super particle colliders that search for evidence of dark matter. Until now, creating fields strong enough for advanced experiments has required huge, expensive facilities. For example, scientists chasing evidence of dark matter use machines like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland. To accommodate the radiofrequency cavities and superconducting magnets needed for accelerating high energy beams, the collider is 16.7 miles long. Running experiments at that scale demands huge resources, is incredibly expensive, and can be highly volatile.

Sahai developed a silicon-based, chip-like material that can withstand high-energy particle beams, manage the energy flow, and allow scientists to access electromagnetic fields created by the oscillations, or vibrations, of the quantum electron gas -- all in a space about the size of your thumb. The rapid movement creates the electromagnetic fields. With Sahai's technique, the material manages the heat flow generated by the oscillation and keeps the sample intact and stable. This gives scientists a way to see activity like never before and opens the possibility of shrinking miles-long colliders into a chip.

""Manipulating such high energy flow while preserving the underlying structure of the material is the breakthrough,"" said Kalyan Tirumalasetty, a graduate student in Sahai's lab working on the project. ""This breakthrough in technology can make a real change in the world. It is about understanding how nature works and using that knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.""

The technology and method were designed at CU Denver and tested at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a world-class facility operated by Stanford University and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Applications of this Technology

CU Denver has already applied for and received provisional patents on the technology in the U.S. and internationally. While real-world, practical applications may be years away, the potential to better understand how the universe works, and to thereby improve lives, is what keeps Sahai and Tirumalasetty motivated to spend long hours in the lab and at SLAC.

""Gamma ray lasers could become a reality,"" Sahai said. ""We could get imaging of tissue down to not just the nucleus of cells but down to the nucleus of the underlying atoms. That means scientists and doctors would be able to see what's going on at the nuclear level and that could accelerate our understanding of immense forces that dominate at such small scales while also leading to better medical treatments and cures. Eventually, we could develop gamma ray lasers to modify the nucleus and remove cancer cells at the nano level.""

The extreme plasmon technique could also help test a wide range of theories about how our universe works -- from the possibility of a multiverse to exploring the very fabric of our universe. These possibilities excite Tirumalasetty, who once thought of becoming a physicist. ""To explore nature and how it works at its fundamental scale, that's very important to me,"" he said. ""But engineers give scientists the tools to do more than understand. And that's … that's exhilarating.""

Next up for the duo is a return to SLAC this summer to keep refining the silicon-chip material and laser technique. Unlike in the movies, developing breakthrough technology can take decades. In fact, some of the foundational work that led to this pivotal moment began in 2018, when Sahai published his first research on antimatter accelerators. ""It's going to take a while, but within my lifetime, it is very probable,"" Sahai said.

About the Researchers

Aakash Sahai holds a PhD in plasma physics from Duke University, a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, and a master's degree in physics from Indiana University, Bloomington. He is a member of the Electromagnetics, Plasmas and Computation Group in CU Denver's College of Engineering, Design and Computing. Before joining CU Denver in 2018, he worked as a research associate at Imperial College London and held research and development roles in the private sector. Sahai has published more than a dozen articles in peer-reviewed journals and is a frequent speaker at SLAC, CERN, and American Physical Society events. He also serves as a reviewer for several scientific journals.

Kalyan Tirumalasetty is pursuing his doctoral degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering from CU Denver, and a bachelor of technology degree in electronics and communication engineering from Anurag Engineering College at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University. During his master's degree, he worked as a research assistant for Sahai to develop this technological setup at SLAC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Voyager missed it, but now we know Uranus has a fiery secret","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250812234557.htm","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:20:13 GMT","

A new study led by University of Houston researchers, in collaboration with planetary scientists worldwide, suggests Uranus does have its own internal heat -- an advance that not only informs NASA's future missions but also deepens scientists' understanding of planetary systems, including processes that influence Earth's climate and atmospheric evolution.

The discovery resolves a long-standing scientific mystery about the giant planet, because observational analyses from Voyager 2 in 1986 didn't suggest the presence of significant internal heat -- contradicting scientists' understanding of how giant planets form and evolve.

However, using decades of spacecraft observations and computer models, a team of scientists found Uranus releases more heat than it receives from sunlight, said Xinyue Wang, the first author on the paper and a former doctoral student of UH's Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences within the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

""This means it's still slowly losing leftover heat from its early history, a key piece of the puzzle that helps us understand its origins and how it has changed over time,"" she explained.

The paper published July 14 in Geophysical Research Letters, a top journal publication by the American Geophysical Union. The discovery is consistent with an independent study conducted by a research group led by Professor Patrick Irwin at the University of Oxford.

However, Uranus's internal heat is weaker than its other giant counterparts in the solar system, emitting about 12.5% more heat than it absorbs via sunlight. This is lower compared to fluxes of upwards of 100% measured for Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, said Xun Jiang, co-author and professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

""From a scientific perspective, this study helps us better understand Uranus and other giant planets. For future space exploration, I think it strengthens the case for a mission to Uranus.""

It's uncertain why this happened, but researchers said Uranus may have a different interior structure or evolutionary history compared to the other giant planets.

Another notable takeaway from the study was that Uranus's energy levels also change with its long seasons, which last about 20 years. These seasonal changes are likely caused by the planet's off-center orbit and tilted spin, Wang said.

Liming Li, co-author and professor in UH's Department of Physics, said this study could improve planning for NASA's flagship mission to orbit and probe Uranus, an initiative the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine classified as its highest priority for the 2023-32 decade.

""From a scientific perspective, this study helps us better understand Uranus and other giant planets,"" Wang said. ""For future space exploration, I think it strengthens the case for a mission to Uranus.""

Additionally, the team's methodology provides testable theories and models that could also be applied to explore radiant energy of other planets within and beyond our solar system, Li said. It could even impact technology innovation and climate understanding on Earth.

""By uncovering how Uranus stores and loses heat, we gain valuable insights into the fundamental processes that shape planetary atmospheres, weather systems and climate systems,"" Li said. ""These findings help broaden our perspective on Earth's atmospheric system and the challenges of climate change.""

With large eyes, razor sharp teeth and a compact body built for hunting, Janjucetus dullardi is nothing like the gentle giants we know today, but this newly discovered ancient whale is one of their earliest cousins.

Scientists at Museums Victoria's Research Institute have described a new species of ancient whale from a 26-million-year-old fossil found near Jan Juc, on Wadawurrung Country, along Victoria's Surf Coast.

The discovery offers remarkable insight into the early evolution of baleen whales - the filter-feeding giants that now cruise our oceans.

Janjucetus dullardi was no ocean giant - it was a fast, sharp-toothed predator about the size of a dolphin. With a short snout, large forward-facing eyes and slicing teeth, it would have been a compact, yet fearsome sight in the warm, shallow seas of ancient Victoria.

The fossil, a partial skull with ear bones and teeth, was discovered in June 2019 by local resident Ross Dullard while walking along the beach. Recognising its scientific significance, Dullard generously donated it to Museums Victoria, where researchers carefully prepared and studied the fossil. In recognition of his contribution, the new species has been named in his honour.

'This kind of public discovery and its reporting to the museum is vital,' said Dr Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute and senior author of the study. 'Ross' discovery has unlocked an entire chapter of whale evolution we've never seen before. It's a reminder that world-changing fossils can be found in your own backyard.'

The research, published on August 12 in the prestigious Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, identifies Janjucetus dullardi as a juvenile 'baby whale', just over two metres long. Despite its small size, it belonged to a group known as mammalodontids, early whales that lived only during the Oligocene Epoch, around 30 to 23 million years ago.

'It's essentially a little whale with big eyes and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth,' said Ruairidh Duncan, PhD student at the Museums Victoria Research Institute and Monash University, and lead author of the study. 'Imagine the shark-like version of a baleen whale - small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless.'

This is the third known mammalodontid species from Victoria, and only the fourth found worldwide. It's also the first to preserve both the teeth and inner ear structures in such detail, which are key features for understanding how early whales fed, heard, moved and behaved in the water.

Advanced microCT scanning revealed delicate structures inside the ear bones, including the cochlea, helping scientists explore how Janjucetus dullardi may have sensed its environment, an ability crucial for hunting and navigating the oceans.

'This fossil opens a window into how ancient whales grew and changed, and how evolution shaped their bodies as they adapted to life in the sea,' said Fitzgerald.

The fossil was recovered from the fossil-rich Jan Juc Formation, which dates to a time of global warmth and rising seas. This coastal stretch of Victoria is becoming internationally recognised as a hotspot for early whale evolution.

Understanding how ancient whales adapted to warmer oceans millions of years ago gives scientists valuable clues about how today's marine life might respond to climate change.

'This region was once a cradle for some of the most unusual whales in history, and we're only just beginning to uncover their stories,' said Fitzgerald.

This discovery marks a major milestone in the understanding of early whale evolution and highlights the critical importance of southeast Australia in that story.

'We're entering a new phase of discovery,' said Fitzgerald. 'This region is rewriting the story of how whales came to rule the oceans, with some surprising plot twists!'

The team expects more fossil discoveries from Victoria's coastline in the coming years and is continuing to study newly uncovered fossils, as well as long-unstudied specimens from the region in the Museums Victoria State Collection.

When considering the impact of this remarkable discovery, Lynley Crosswell, CEO and Director of Museums Victoria said: 'The findings demonstrate the power of our collections to unlock stories that change the way we understand life on Earth. Thanks to the generosity of the public and the expertise of our scientists, Museums Victoria Research Institute is making globally significant contributions to evolutionary research. Discoveries like Janjucetus dullardi remind us that our collections are not just about the past - they're shaping the future of science.'

An international study surveying people in a dozen countries found that when it comes to making complex decisions, people all over the world tend to reflect on their own, rather than seek advice.

Researchers from the University of Waterloo led the new study that surveyed more than 3,500 people from megacities to small Indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest to learn how they make decisions. This work is the broadest test of decision-style preferences across cultures to date.

The researchers say that by understanding that even in interdependent societies most people prefer to go with the decision made by themselves, irrespective of what others say, can help clarify cross-cultural misunderstandings and realize that we all appear to be juggling similar internal debates.

""Realizing that most of us instinctively 'go it alone' helps explain why we often ignore good counsel, be it for health tips or financial planning, despite mounting evidence that such counsel may help us make wiser decisions,"" said Dr. Igor Grossmann, professor in the Department of Psychology at Waterloo and first author on the paper. ""This knowledge can help us design teamwork better by working with this self-reliant tendency and letting employees reason privately before sharing advice that they might reject.""

The study upends the belief that westerners work things out themselves while the rest of the world leans on others. In fact, intuition and self-reflection beat out advice from friends or crowdsourcing in all countries studied. The amount of that preference varied, depending on the level at which a culture values independence or interdependence.

""Our take-home message is that we all look inward first, yet the wisest moves may happen when solo reflections are shared with others,"" Grossmann said. ""What culture does is controls the volume knob, dialing up that inner voice in highly independent societies and softening it somewhat in more interdependent ones.""

Nearly 40 authors contributed to this work as part of the Geography of Philosophy Project, which is led by Dr. Edouard Machery, from the University of Pittsburgh.

The study, Decision-making preferences for intuition, deliberation, friends or crowds in independent and interdependent societies, appears in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences.

Key Takeaways

Two recent studies by Professor Stefano Profumo at the University of California, Santa Cruz, propose theories that attempt to answer one of the most fundamental open questions in modern physics: What is the particle nature of dark matter?

Science has produced overwhelming evidence that the mysterious substance that accounts for 80% of all matter in the universe exists. Dark matter's presence explains what binds galaxies together and makes them rotate. Findings such as the large-scale structure of the universe and measurements of the cosmic microwave background also prove that something as-yet undetermined permeates all that darkness.

What remains unknown are the origins of dark matter, and hence, what are its particle properties. Those weighty questions primarily fall to theoretical physicists like Profumo. And in two recent papers, he approaches those questions from different directions, but both centered on the idea that dark matter might have emerged naturally from conditions in the very early universe -- rather than dark matter being an exotic new particle that interacts with ordinary matter in some detectable way.

Shadowy origins

The most recent study, published on July 8, explores whether dark matter could have formed in a hidden sector -- a kind of ""mirror world"" with its own versions of particles and forces. While completely invisible to humans, this shadow sector would obey many of the same physical laws as the known universe.

The idea draws inspiration from quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes how quarks are bound together inside protons and neutrons by the strong nuclear force. UC Santa Cruz has deep roots in this area: Emeritus physics professor Michael Dine helped pioneer theoretical models involving the QCD axion, a leading dark matter candidate, while research professor Abe Seiden contributed to major experimental efforts probing the structure of hadrons -- particles made of quarks -- in high-energy physics experiments.

In Profumo's new work, the strong force is replicated in the dark sector as a confining ""dark QCD"" theory, with its own particles -- dark quarks and dark gluons -- binding together to form heavy composite particles known as dark baryons. Under certain conditions in the early universe, these dark baryons could become dense and massive enough to collapse under their own gravity into extremely small, stable black holes -- or objects that behave much like black holes.

These black hole-like remnants would be just a few times heavier than the fundamental mass scale of quantum gravity -- known as the 'Planck mass"" -- but if produced in the right quantity, they could account for all the dark matter observed today. Because they would interact only through gravity, they would be completely invisible to particle detectors -- yet their presence would shape the universe on the largest scales.

This scenario offers a new, testable framework grounded in well-established physics, while extending UC Santa Cruz's long-standing exploration of how deep theoretical principles might help explain one of the biggest open questions in cosmology.

On the horizon

Profumo's other recent study, published in May, explores whether dark matter might be produced by the universe's expanding ""cosmic horizon"" -- essentially, the cosmological equivalent of a black hole's event horizon.

This paper asks, if the universe underwent a brief period of accelerated expansion after inflation -- something less extreme than inflation, but still expanding faster than radiation or matter would allow -- could that phase itself have ""radiated"" particles into existence?

Using principles from quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the paper shows that a wide range of dark matter masses could result from this mechanism, depending on the temperature and duration of this phase. Importantly, Profumo said this doesn't require any assumptions about how the dark matter interacts, only that it is stable and produced gravitationally. The idea is inspired by the way observers near cosmic horizons, like those of a black hole, perceive thermal radiation due to quantum effects.

""Both mechanisms are highly speculative, but they offer self-contained and calculable scenarios that don't rely on conventional particle dark matter models, which are increasingly under pressure from null experimental results,"" said Profumo, deputy director for theory at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics.

One could say Profumo wrote the book on the quest to understand the nature of dark matter. His 2017 textbook An Introduction to Particle Dark Matter presents lessons that he personally learned and used in his research work from state-of-the-art techniques that scientists have developed over the years to build and test particle models for dark matter.

The book describes the ""paradigm of dark matter"" as ""one of the key developments at the interface of cosmology and elementary particle physics,"" and is intended for anyone interested in the microscopic nature of dark matter as it manifests itself in particle physics experiments, cosmological observations, and high-energy astrophysical phenomena.

Connection to UC Santa Cruz

Researchers here have played a key role in cosmology for decades, contributing to the development of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model -- still the best fit to all cosmological data -- and to the theoretical and observational study of how structure forms in the universe. In addition, UC Santa Cruz has long supported a close interplay between theory and observation, with strengths in particle physics, astrophysics, and early universe cosmology.

Profumo said these recent publications continue in that tradition, exploring ideas that connect the deepest questions in particle physics with the large-scale behavior of the cosmos. ""And they do so in a way that remains rooted in known physics -- whether quantum field theory in curved spacetime, or the well-studied properties of SU(N) gauge theories -- while extending them to new frontiers,"" he said.

Both studies appeared in Physical Review D, the American Physical Society's premier venue for theoretical particle physics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Blood pressure cuff errors may be missing 30% of hypertension cases","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083558.htm","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:33:51 GMT","

Researchers have found why common cuff-based blood pressure readings are inaccurate and how they might be improved, which could improve health outcomes for patients.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is the top risk factor for premature death, associated with heart disease, strokes and heart attacks. However, inaccuracies in the most common form of blood pressure measurement mean that as many as 30% of cases of high blood pressure could be missed.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, built an experimental model that explained the physics behind these inaccuracies and provided a better understanding of the mechanics of cuff-based blood pressure readings.

The researchers say that some straightforward changes, which don't necessarily involve replacing standard cuff-based measurement, could lead to more accurate blood pressure readings and better results for patients. Their results are reported in the journal PNAS Nexus.

Anyone who has ever had their blood pressure taken will be familiar with the cuff-based method. This type of measurement, also known as the auscultatory method, relies on inflating a cuff around the upper arm to the point where it cuts off blood flow to the lower arm, and then a clinician listens for tapping sounds in the arm through a stethoscope while the cuff is slowly deflated.

Blood pressure is inferred from readings taken from a pressure gauge attached to the deflating cuff. Blood pressure is given as two separate numbers: a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. A blood pressure reading of 120/80 is considered 'ideal'.

""The auscultatory method is the gold standard, but it overestimates diastolic pressure, while systolic pressure is underestimated,"" said co-author Kate Bassil from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. ""We have a good understanding of why diastolic pressure is overestimated, but why systolic pressure is underestimated has been a bit of a mystery.""

""Pretty much every clinician knows blood pressure readings are sometimes wrong, but no one could explain why they are being underestimated -- there's a real gap in understanding,"" said co-author Professor Anurag Agarwal, also from Cambridge's Department of Engineering.

Previous non-clinical studies into measurement inaccuracy used rubber tubes that did not fully replicate how arteries collapse under cuff pressure, which masked the underestimation effect.

The researchers built a simplified physical model to isolate and study the effects of downstream blood pressure -- the blood pressure in the part of the arm below the cuff. When the cuff is inflated and blood flow to the lower arm is cut off, it creates a very low downstream pressure. By reproducing this condition in their experimental rig, they determined this pressure difference causes the artery to stay closed for longer while the cuff deflates, delaying the reopening and leading to an underestimation of blood pressure.

This physical mechanism -- the delayed reopening due to low downstream pressure -- is the likely cause of underestimation, a previously unidentified factor. ""We are currently not adjusting for this error when diagnosing or prescribing treatments, which has been estimated to lead to as many as 30% of cases of systolic hypertension being missed,"" said Bassil.

Instead of the rubber tubes used in earlier physical models of arteries, the Cambridge researchers used tubes that lay flat when deflated and fully close when the cuff pressure is inflated, the key condition for reproducing the low downstream pressure observed in the body.

The researchers say that there is a range of potential solutions to this underestimation, which include raising the arm in advance of measurement, potentially producing a predictable downstream pressure and therefore predictable underestimation. This change doesn't require new devices, just a modified protocol.

""You might not even need new devices, just changing how the measurement is done could make it more accurate,"" said Agarwal.

However, if new devices for monitoring blood pressure are developed, they might ask for additional inputs which correlate with downstream pressure, to adjust what the 'ideal' readings might be for each individual. These may include age, BMI, or tissue characteristics.

The researchers are hoping to secure funding for clinical trials to test their findings in patients, and are looking for industrial or research partners to help refine their calibration models and validate the effect in diverse populations. Collaboration with clinicians will also be essential to implement changes to clinical practice.

The research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists warn ocean could soon reach Rapa Nui's sacred moai","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250812234532.htm","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 05:45:49 GMT","

Rising sea levels could cause seasonal waves to reach Ahu Tongariki, the iconic ceremonial platform that is part of the Rapa Nui National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site by 2080, according to a study published recently in the Journal of Cultural Heritage by a team of researchers from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. This coastal flooding also threatens to impact up to 51 cultural assets in the area, including Rapa Nui's world renowned moai statues.

""This research reveals a critical threat to the living culture and livelihood of Rapa Nui,"" said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and doctoral student in the Department of Earth Sciences in the UH Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST). ""For the community, these sites are an essential part of reaffirming identity and support the revitalization of traditions. Economically, they are the backbone of the island's tourism industry. Failure to address this threat could ultimately endanger the island's UNESCO world heritage site status.""

""As we work to understand the impacts of future sea level rise, we provide information that not only enables us to maintain safe, functional spaces and infrastructure, but also to support thriving communities,"" said Chip Fletcher, co-author of the study and dean of SOEST. ""That means we must document threats to culturally significant places and assets, and develop plans to preserve and protect what matters to communities.""

Computer simulations reveal vulnerabilities

Paoa and his team built a detailed digital twin of the study site and used advanced computer models to simulate the wave environment along the coastline. They then mapped the projected flooding caused by waves under future sea level rise scenarios. The flood extent was then overlaid on geospatial layers containing the location of cultural assets provided to the team by local partners, which allowed the researchers to identify the cultural assets that will be flooded.

""Unfortunately, from a scientific standpoint, the findings are not surprising,"" said Paoa. ""We know that sea level rise poses a direct threat to coastlines globally. The critical question was not if the site would be impacted, but how soon and how severely. Our work aimed to set potential timelines by which we could expect the impacts to happen. Finding that waves could reach Ahu Tongariki by 2080 provides the specific, urgent data needed to incentivize community discussion and planning for the future.""

The challenges facing Rapa Nui mirror those in other coastal areas of the world, including Hawaiʻi.

""While Hawaiʻi is invested in protecting coastal infrastructure from sea level rise, the irreplaceable coastal cultural heritage sites in Hawai'i and across the Pacific face the same urgent threat,"" Paoa added. ""Our research in Rapa Nui serves as a vital blueprint, demonstrating how we can use science to forecast risks to sacred places, such as coastal heiau and ancestral burial sites. By developing and applying these methods we hope we can help protect what is precious to the people of Hawaiʻi -- provided such work is guided by, and deemed appropriate by, the Native Hawaiian community.""

Paoa is now using available data on coastal flooding to examine potential sea level rise impacts on cultural assets in Hawai'i. In the future, he and the research team, in collaboration with local partners in Rapa Nui, plan to further investigate potential impacts of sea level rise on the island's coastal cultural assets and examine adaptation and mitigation efforts to safeguard the cultural heritage.

Lightweight nanofabricated structures could photophoretically loft payloads in near-space. Proposed structures range from microscale engineered aerosols1, to centimetre-scale thin disks with variations in surface accommodation coefficients2,3, to sandwich structures with nanoscale thickness4,5 that might be extended to metre-scale width6,7. Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.

The computational design of protein-based binders presents unique opportunities to access ‘undruggable' targets, but effective binder design often relies on stable three-dimensional structures or structure-influenced latent spaces. Here we introduce PepMLM, a target sequence-conditioned designer of de novo linear peptide binders. Using a masking strategy that positions cognate peptide sequences at the C terminus of target protein sequences, PepMLM finetunes the ESM-2 protein language model to fully reconstruct the binder region, achieving low perplexities matching or improving upon validated peptide–protein sequence pairs. After successful in silico benchmarking with AlphaFold-based docking, we experimentally validate the efficacy of PepMLM through both binding and degradation assays. PepMLM-derived peptides demonstrate sequence-specific binding to cancer and reproductive targets, including NCAM1 and AMHR2, and enable targeted degradation of proteins across diverse disease contexts, from Huntington's disease to live viral infections. Altogether, PepMLM enables the design of candidate binders to any target protein, without requiring structural input, facilitating broad applications in therapeutic development.

The development of therapeutics largely relies on the ability to design small-molecule-based or protein-based binders to pathogenic target proteins of interest1. These binders can be used either as inhibitors or as functional recruiters of effector enzymes2. For example, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues are heterobifunctional small molecules that bind and recruit endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligases for targeted protein degradation (TPD)3,4. Still, these small-molecule-based methods rely on the existence of accessible cryptic or canonical binding sites, which are not present on classically ‘undruggable' intracellular proteins5,6. With the advent of deep-learning-based structure prediction tools such as AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 (refs. 7,8), combined with generative modeling1, algorithms such as RFdiffusion and MASIF-Seed enable researchers to conduct de novo protein binder design from target structure alone9,10. Nonetheless, much of the undruggable proteome, including dysregulated proteins such as transcription factors and fusion oncoproteins, are conformationally disordered, thus biasing design to a small subset of disease-related proteins1,6.

Over the past few years, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly through the implementation of the attention mechanism11. This foundational advancement has transcended the boundaries of natural language analysis, finding applications in the modeling of other languages, such as proteins, which are fundamentally sequences of amino acids12. Recently, several protein language models (pLMs) trained on distinct transformer architectures, such as ProtT5, ProGen2, ProtGPT2 and the ESM series, have accurately captured critical physicochemical properties of proteins13,14,15,16. Notably, ESM-2 currently stands as a state-of-the-art model in the realm of protein sequence representation, essentially functioning as an encoder-only model that discerns co-evolutionary patterns among protein sequences via a masked language modeling (MLM) training task17,18. These models have been extended to powerful applications, including antibody design, the creation of novel proteins and structure prediction, offering a streamlined approach to embedding useful protein information14,15,17,18. Recently, our laboratory has leveraged the expressivity of pLMs to both generate and prioritize effective peptidic binder motifs to targets of interest, enabling design of peptide-guided protein degraders19,20 that are modeled after the ubiquibody (uAb) architecture developed by Portnoff et al.21,22. As such, uAbs now represent a programmable, CRISPR-like approach for TPD. Our early models, Cut&CLIP and SaLT&PepPr, rely on the existence of interacting partner sequences as scaffolds for peptide design19,23. Most recently, our PepPrCLIP model generates de novo peptides by first sampling the ESM-2 latent space for naturalistic peptide candidates and then screening these candidates through a contrastive model to determine target sequence specificity20. However, a purely de novo, target sequence-conditioned binder design algorithm has yet to be developed.

To achieve this goal, we introduce PepMLM, a Peptide binder design algorithm via Masked Language Modeling, built upon the foundations of ESM-2 (ref. 17). PepMLM employs a masking strategy that uniquely positions the entire peptide binder sequence at the terminus of target protein sequences, compelling ESM-2 to reconstruct the entire binding region (Fig. 1a). PepMLM-derived linear peptides achieve low perplexities, matching or improving upon validated peptide–protein sequence pairs in the test dataset; outperform the state-of-the-art RFdiffusion model for peptide design on structured targets in silico9; and experimentally exhibit potent and specific binding to disease-relevant targets and degradation of difficult-to-drug drivers of Huntington's disease and emergent viral phosphoproteins when incorporated into the uAb architecture. Overall, by focusing on the complete reconstruction of peptide regions, PepMLM serves as a completely sequence-based, target-conditioned de novo binder design tool, paving the way for the development of more effective, therapeutic binders to conformationally diverse proteins of interest.

a, The architecture of the PepMLM model. Based on the finetuning of ESM-2, the model incorporates the target protein sequence along with a masked binder region during the training phase. During the generation phase, the model can accept target protein sequences and mask tokens to facilitate the creation of peptides of specified lengths. b, Perplexity distribution comparison. The perplexity values were calculated for test and designed peptides, encompassing the target proteins in the test set. c, The density distribution visualization of the log perplexity values for target–peptide pairs, encompassing test peptides, PepMLM-650M-designed peptides, ESM-2-650M-designed peptides and random peptides. d, In silico hit rate assessment of RFdiffusion (left) and PepMLM (right). Using AlphaFold-Multimer, ipTM scores were computed for both the designed and test peptides in conjunction with the target protein sequence. The entries are organized in accordance with the ipTM scores attributed to the test set peptides. The hit rate is characterized by the designed peptides exhibiting ipTM scores ≥ those of the test peptides. e, Binding specificity analysis through permutation tests. The distribution of PPL scores for matched target–binder pairs (blue) is compared with randomly shuffled mismatched pairs (red). Each target's binder was shuffled 100 times to generate the mismatched distribution. Statistical significance was determined using t-test (P < 0.001). f, Structural comparison of computationally designed and experimental peptide binders in complex with their target proteins. Target proteins (gray) are shown in complex with PepMLM-designed binders (red) and experimental test binders (blue), with contact residues highlighted in corresponding colors. Top, mouse H-2Kb MHC complex (PDB ID: 2OI9) with designed peptide PSLGSVPYV (ipTM: 0.9) and test peptide QLSPFPFDL (ipTM: 0.9). Bottom, human tyrosine kinase complex (PDB ID: 1LCK) with designed peptide PPAEEIPP (ipTM: 0.82) and test peptide EGQQPQPA (ipTM: 0.68). g, Frequency distribution of individual amino acids among peptide binders (n = 203), comparing the test set (blue), PepMLM-designed sequences (red) and ESM2-650M-designed sequences (green). h, Amino-acid-specific generation distribution at contact positions (8-Å threshold). The heatmap shows the percentage of designed amino acids (y axis) given each amino acid in test binders (x axis).

We trained PepMLM using existing peptide–protein binding data sourced from the recent PepNN training set and the gold standard Propedia dataset24,25. We subjected our curated dataset to a filtration process based on the lengths of the binder and target protein sequences, which were confined to 50 and 500, respectively. To remove redundancies, we applied MMSeq2 clustering with a threshold at 80% on target protein sequences and removed entries that are in the same cluster and have the same binder sequence. The final dataset was split into 10,000 samples for training and 203 samples for testing26. Each entry in the dataset comprised a concatenated protein and binder sequence. During the training phase, we masked the entire peptide sequence, tasking the model to reconstruct them via the ESM-2-650M model17. The discrepancy between the ground truth binder and the reconstructed binder induces a cross-entropy loss, thereby forcing parameter updates via gradient descent. After finetuning, we generate peptide binders of specific lengths by providing the model with a target protein sequence and a user-defined number of mask tokens, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Final settings and hyperparameters used to train our model are presented in Supplementary Table 1. We used pseudo-perplexity (PPL) of PepMLM to score binders given target protein sequence (Methods). Two decoding strategies were implemented: a default greedy decoding approach17 that selects the highest probability token at each site and a top-k sampling method that chooses from among the k most probable tokens to generate diverse peptide binders. After testing various k values (2–20) and analyzing the tradeoff between sequence diversity and model confidence through perplexity measurements, we selected k = 3 as the optimal value for balancing these factors (Supplementary Fig. 1).

To substantiate the efficacy of the designed peptides, we conducted a comprehensive series of computational benchmarks with test set peptide–target pairs. The total 203 test set target proteins were used to generate one peptide binder each in one shot, employing pretrained ESM-2 embeddings and PepMLM with additional randomly designed binders. All three groups (PepMLM, ESM-2 and Random) use the same length as the ground truth test binder for each target protein. Subsequently, the PPL of the binder region was computed for four groups of target protein–binder pairs. For a majority of the test set, known binders exhibited a reasonable perplexity range, with only a few outliers (those with a perplexity >40), validating the effective ability of PepMLM to model them accurately (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). Our distribution analysis revealed that PepMLM closely mirrors the low PPL region of real binders, a deviation from the distribution shifts observed with the original ESM-2 model alone and with randomly designed binders, indicating that PepMLM can distinguish binders from non-binders especially for random binders by PPL scores (Fig. 1c).

To further understand PPL score, we co-folded the test binders with their respective target proteins using AlphaFold-Multimer, which has been proven effective at predicting peptide–protein complexes27,28. The predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) and interface-predicted template modeling (ipTM) scores, verified metrics within AlphaFold2 (ref. 7), function as critical indicators of the structural integrity and the potential interface binding affinity of the peptide–protein complex, respectively, providing an external quantitative assessment of our generation. PPL, our confidence metric, showed significant agreement with folding scores, as the extracted ipTM and pLDDT values from our benchmarking indicated a statistically significant negative correlation (P < 0.01) with PepMLM PPL. This demonstrates that our model can reflect binding interactions in a zero-shot manner via PPL while validating its reliability in prioritizing stable target-binding molecules (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To evaluate our generation quality, we compared PepMLM with RFdiffusion by generating one binder per target and performing structural prediction using AlphaFold-Multimer. We used the ipTM scores of test binders as reference points, defining a successful hit when a designed binder achieved a higher ipTM score than its corresponding test binder, indicating AlphaFold's prediction of stronger binding affinity. Our analysis revealed hit rates of 38% for PepMLM and 29% for RFdiffusion (Fig. 1d). When applying more stringent criteria with plDDT scores greater than 0.8, PepMLM and RFdiffusion achieved hit rates of 49% and 34%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results demonstrate the superior performance of PepMLM in peptide binder design, even for structured targets, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental screening.

To investigate binding specificity of designed binders, we conducted a permutation test across 203 target–binder pairs using the PPL metric. For each target, we performed 100 random binder shuffles and computed PPL scores for these mismatched pairs. Statistical analysis using t-tests revealed significant differences (P < 0.001) between the PPL distributions of matched and mismatched pairs (Fig. 1e). The consistently higher PPL values observed in shuffled pairs indicate that our designed binders exhibit target specificity, as disrupting the intended target–binder pairing leads to predicted lower binding affinities.

We showcase two exemplary binder designs for mouse H-2Kb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2OI9) and human tyrosine kinase (PDB ID: 1LCK) from our test set with detailed contact analysis (Fig. 1f). Analysis of the H-2Kb MHC (PDB ID: 2OI9) revealed that, despite high sequence identity (0.9) with the training set, PepMLM designed a distinct peptide (PSLGSVPYV) from the test binder (QLSPFPFDL) while maintaining equivalent binding quality (ipTM: 0.9). The designed peptide engages similar MHC binding residues, with terminal hydrophobic residues (proline and valine) serving as anchor points, suggesting similar biochemical properties to the experimental binder. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase complex (PDB ID: 1LCK) exhibited low sequence identity (0.26) with the training set, providing a stringent test of PepMLM's capacity to design binders for novel targets. Here, the PepMLM-designed peptide (PPAEEIPP, ipTM: 0.82) exhibited more confident interaction compared to the test binder (EGQQPQPA, ipTM: 0.68). AlphaFold predictions demonstrated that both designed and experimental binders adopt similar spatial configurations and binding modes. Further analysis revealed that our designed peptide binders, despite having different sequences from the test binders, typically targeted the same binding pockets and displayed similar structural conformations, validating our language-model-based design approach (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3). In cases with lower predicted binding confidence scores, the designed binders exhibited distinct binding modes that appeared more optimal according to AlphaFold-Multimer predictions. However, it remains challenging to definitively ascertain whether our binders exhibit unique binding modes or if these observations are attributable to limitations in AlphaFold-based modeling8.

We further analyzed amino-acid-level patterns by generating 100 additional binders using both ESM-2 and PepMLM on the test set. At the amino acid composition level, PepMLM-designed sequences closely mirror the amino acid distribution of test binders, whereas ESM-2 exhibits strong biases toward serine (S), leucine (L) and randomly selected amino acids (X) (Fig. 1g), suggesting that PepMLM better captures the natural amino acid preferences in protein–peptide interactions after finetuning. More importantly, we conducted a detailed amino acids substitution analysis of generation, with particular attention to contact positions (defined using an 8-Å threshold). For each position in a test binder, we analyzed the amino acid types across corresponding positions in 100 designed binders. Overall, we observed 69.2% and 68.4% amino-acid-specific variations across all positions and contact positions, respectively. The diagonal elements of our generation matrix reveal that our model maintains a substantial probability of preserving the original amino acids in both contact and non-contact positions (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating the ability of the mode to learn contextually appropriate amino acid choices given the target sequence. However, the model also demonstrates great versatility in generating diverse alternative amino acids. Within contact positions, we observed biochemically sensible generation patterns, including exchanges between hydrophobic residues (for example, valine to leucine at 13% and isoleucine to leucine at 17%) and similarly charged residues (lysine to arginine at 11% and aspartate to glutamate at 7.8%). Notably, positions containing cysteine exhibit highly conserved substitution patterns in our generation, potentially reflecting the critical role of cysteine in disulfide bond formation and structural stability. Together, these amino-acid-level analyses demonstrate PepMLM's sophisticated understanding of biochemical properties and structural constraints in protein–peptide interactions at a fine-grained amino acid level.

Finally, to evaluate the generalizability of PepMLM beyond its training distribution, we analyzed the relationship between test target similarity to the training set and model performance (Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, PepMLM consistently designed binders with low perplexity and high predicted binding affinity (ipTM), even for targets with less than 30% sequence identity, indicating that model performance does not rely on high homology and generalizes well to unseen protein substrates, motivating experimental characterization on diverse, disease-related targets.

Our first goal was to establish the capacity of PepMLM to generate potent but specific peptide binders experimentally. To do this, we focused on two disease-related targets: neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), a key marker of acute myeloid leukemia29, and anti-Müllerian hormone type 2 receptor (AMHR2), a critical regulator of polycystic ovarian syndrome30. For both targets, four binders, each from PepMLM and RFdiffusion, were preliminarily screened using an ELISA (Supplementary Table 4), following which the most promising sequence from each algorithm (based on signal-to-noise ratio and maximum signal) was further characterized in triplicate. Results from initial screens indicate that all four PepMLM peptides for each target showed a binding response at concentrations as low as approximately 60 nM of AMHR2 or NCAM1-Fc fusions (Supplementary Fig. 8a,d). By contrast, RFdiffusion-generated peptides resulted in much poorer binders in both cases (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). Although RFdiffusion produced moderate binders against NCAM1, binders generated against AMHR2 using the relevant crystal structure (PDB ID: 7L0J; chain B) showed minimal binding compared to blanks and BSA controls (Supplementary Fig. 8b,e). When preliminary screens were compared directly, we observed notably higher success rates of PepMLM-designed peptides in comparison to RFdiffusion peptides (Supplementary Fig. 8c,f). Further comparison of the best PepMLM and RFdiffusion binders against NCAM1 unveiled a clear difference in sensitivity and overall signal throughout all concentrations of NCAM1 tested (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 8g). Moreover, when probing the minimal concentration at which pMLM_NCAM1_2 can be distinguished from BSA controls, we observe significantly higher absorbance at approximately 30 nM (Fig. 2b; P = 0.0051). Notably, we show that none of the PepMLM peptides tested exhibited significant binding to BSA at concentrations up to 500 nM, that SUMO–polyglycine (polyG) constructs displayed no discernible difference in signal in the presence of either AMHR2 or NCAM1, and that use of generic IgG control as antigen yielded minimal signal up to 500 nM (Fig. 2a). Overall, these results corroborate our in silico observation that PepMLM generates promising binder candidates from target sequence alone with higher success rates than the current state-of-the-art binder design models.

Four NCAM1-targeting peptides were designed for both RFdiffusion and PepMLM as C-terminal SUMO-tag fusions and screened for potential binding to NCAM1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). a, Binding analysis of top candidate peptide against NCAM1 fused to C-terminal SUMO-tag as measured by ELISA. PepMLM-designed peptides were immobilized onto 96-well plates, incubated with serial dilutions of either NCAM1-Fc or BSA and subsequently detected with an anti-IgG–HRP conjugate and the signal was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm (A450). Data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biological replicates). b, Further ELISA binding analysis of pMLM_NCAM1_2 comparing successive serial dilutions of NCAM1-Fc to BSA control (200 nM) (n = 12 biological replicates) (P = 0.0051, P = 0.003, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). Box plots represent the mean value bounded by the IQR, with brackets representing minimum and maximum values. (Statistical significance was determined by an ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Calculated P values are represented as follows: **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.).

Having demonstrated PepMLM's comparatively strong binder generation to RFdiffusion both in silico and in vitro, we next evaluated PepMLM peptides via fusion to E3 ubiquitin ligase catalytic domains by generating targeted uAbs to degrade pathogenic proteins in human cells (Fig. 3a)31. We focused our attention on Huntington's disease, a monogenic dominant neurological disorder affecting more than one in 10,000 adults, caused primarily by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the HTT gene32. This results in an extended polyglutamine (polyQ) tract, leading to formation of the aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT)33. Recently, it was shown that genetic knockdown of the mismatch repair-associated MSH3 protein reduces and inhibits mHTT repeat expansion34,35. We, thus, sought to degrade MSH3 at the posttranslational level via PepMLM peptide-guided uAbs.

a, Architecture and mechanism of uAb degradation system. CHIPΔTPR is fused to the C terminus of PepMLM-designed target-specific peptides and can thus tag endogenous target proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the proteasome following plasmid transfection. Created with BioRender. b, Quantitative immunofluorescence of RPE1 cells stained with anti-MSH3 antibody after transfection with plasmids encoding peptide–uAb or polyG–uAb control (n = 3 biological replicates, with >250 cells analyzed per replicate) (P = 1.00, P = 6.01 × 10−41, P = 5.60 × 10−44, P = 2.03 × 10−13, P = 1.28 × 10−55, P = 4.58 × 10−87) (statistical significance determined by one-sided Mann–Whitney U-test). Outliers were removed using the IQR method where values greater than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR were excluded. Box plots represent the mean value bounded by the IQR, with brackets representing minimum and maximum values after outlier removal. c, Western blot analysis of TruHD-Q43/Q17M cell lysate in the presence or absence of doxycycline-dependent uAb expression. PolyG–uAb was used as a transfection ‘negative' control, and vinculin was used as the loading control. d, Densitometry analysis of accompanying western blots of TruHD-Q43/Q17M cell lysate, normalized to polyG and vinculin controls (n = 3 biological replicates) (P = 0.0127, P = 0.0006, P = 0.0048, P = 0.0027, P = 0.0005). Data are represented as mean values ± s.e.m. (Statistical significance was determined by a paired one-tailed Student's t-test. Calculated P values are represented as follows: **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.).

First, to design peptides for MSH3 degradation, we employed greedy decoding to determine the optimal binder length that yielded the lowest perplexity, followed by the generation of binders using top-k sampling, where k was fixed at 3 as previously described (Supplementary Table 4). After cloning these peptides into our uAb backbone and transfecting into genomically stable RPE1 cells, staining with fluorescently labeled anti-MSH3 antibody was used to quantify relative MSH3 levels. Quantitative immunofluorescence imaging revealed that five of six constructs tested (MSH3_pMLM_2–6) significantly reduced levels of MSH3 compared to polyG controls (Fig. 3b), demonstrating that anti-MSH3 PepMLM peptides are capable of robust degradation without extensive experimental screening.

We next sought to degrade the mHTT protein itself. To do this, we used TruHD fibroblasts, a genomically stable line that expresses the mHTT protein at a clinically relevant CAG repeat length of Q43 (ref. 36). As the line is heterozygous with both Q43/Q17 alleles, we designed PepMLM peptides targeting exon 1 with a polyQ repeat of 43. TruHD cell lines were then transfected with plasmids encoding for the five optimal candidates fused to a uAb domain under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (Supplementary Table 4). HTT degradation was then measured with an anti-Huntingtin protein-specific antibody (EPR5526) recognizing the first 100 amino acids of HTT, which includes the polyQ region in both the presence and absence of doxycycline. Subsequent western blotting revealed minimal degradation prior to doxycycline induction, with visible ablation observed only after induction (Fig. 3c,d). Notably, all five candidates caused significant reduction of HTT levels compared to polyG control degradation (Fig. 3c,d). Taken together, the significant degradation of both MSH3 and HTT protein demonstrates the ability of PepMLM to design peptides that engage diverse, disease-related targets in cellulo.

Finally, we investigated whether PepMLM-derived uAbs could induce degradation of critical viral target proteins. As a key target class, we selected the viral phosphoprotein based on its relatively high sequence homology among strains of the selected viruses as well as its critical role in viral transcription and genome replication. Phosphoprotein sequences were selected for two emerging deadly viruses with high pandemic potential, the henipaviruses Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), both of which pose substantial threats to human health with recorded mortality rates of 50–100%37,38. A third phosphoprotein sequence was selected for the endemic virus human metapneumovirus (HMPV), whose infections occur more frequently than NiV and HeV, displaying seasonal cold-like symptoms that are severe and sometimes fatal in young children and elderly populations37. There are few to no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved for human use for these three viruses.

For each of the three viral phosphoproteins, 20 peptide-guided uAbs (Supplementary Table 4) were designed via PepMLM and then screened for their ability to induce proteasomal degradation of their respective phosphoproteins via western blotting and immunofluorescence imaging (Fig. 4). When uAbs were co-transfected with plasmids encoding for viral phosphoprotein target, a total of 37 degraders demonstrated between 20% and 49% average reduction in protein levels, suggesting an overall hit rate of approximately 63%, in strong agreement with our in silico hit rate shown in Fig. 1d (Fig. 4a–c). Although not significant, an obvious trend of diminished phosphoprotein levels can be observed with nearly all uAbs. Encouraged by these preliminary screening results, a smaller pool of candidate uAbs targeting HMPV were transfected into Vero AT cells, and, after infection, cells were stained using a fluorescent anti-HMPV phosphoprotein antibody. Immunofluorescent imaging shows near-complete amelioration of viral phosphoprotein levels for four uAbs (HMPV_12, HMPV_15, HMPV_18 and HMPV_19), which is likely to lead to reduced viral levels and infectivity in vivo (Fig. 4d).

a–c, Twenty uAb plasmids were co-transfected with plasmid DNA for each of the phosphoproteins from NiV (a), HeV (b) and HMPV (c) in HEK293T cells using PEI MAX. Whole-cell lysates were harvested 48 hours after transfection using RIPA buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. uAbs and phosphoproteins were probed using mouse anti-Flag and rabbit anti-HA antibodies, respectively, in addition to a mouse anti-β-actin loading control antibody. ‘EV' is an empty pCAGGS vector, and ‘P' is a phosphoprotein-only control. Quantification of reduced detection of target phosphoprotein was determined by densitometry as described in the Methods. Data are presented as mean values ± s.d. (n ≥ 3 biological replicates). d, Each immunofluorescent image shows Vero AT cells transfected with either an empty vector plasmid (pcDNA) or an HMPV uAb plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with HMPV. Twenty-four hours after infection, ×10 immunofluorescent images were taken. HMPV phosphoprotein is shown in green, and cell nuclei are shown in blue. Each plasmid was tested with two biological replicates, each with two technical replicates.

Taken together, our experimental results strongly support the in silico benchmarking of PepMLM, with more than 60% of uAbs demonstrating moderate to strong degradation when PepMLM-designed peptides were used as modular guides (Figs. 3 and 4). Similar success was observed in binding analysis via ELISA, even compared to state-of-the-art structure-based binder design approaches (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Activity of PepMLM-designed peptides, both in vitro and in cellulo, demonstrates the algorithm's efficacy in binder design against diverse targets, in various cellular environments and in relevant contexts requiring degradation of mutant proteins, highly homologous viral proteins, and pathway-driving regulatory proteins. As an example of the latter, PepMLM-derived uAbs not only induce degradation of MESH1, an NADPH phosphatase that regulates ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation39 (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), but the top degrader, MESH1_pMLM_1, also inhibits ferroptosis-related cell death (Supplementary Fig. 9c). These results highlight the potential of PepMLM as a general-purpose platform for programmable peptide-guided modulation of protein function, enabling both binding and degradation across a wide spectrum of therapeutically relevant targets.

Overall, PepMLM is a finetuned version of ESM-2 that employs a straightforward masking–unmasking scheme, offering an accessible framework for designing linear peptide binders. We acknowledge that PepMLM is not a standard generative sequence model, in comparison to more traditional autoregressive or discrete diffusion and flow matching models15,40,41,42,43,44. Despite our more minimalist formulation, we demonstrate that PepMLM yields strong binder designs, across in silico, in vitro and therapeutically relevant contexts. Our future work will build upon recent generative protein language models such as ProGen3 (ref. 45) or DPLM41,46 and incorporate more advanced sampling and search strategies tailored to encoder-only architectures. Such extensions will allow both binder generation and multi-objective conditioning for optimal therapeutic peptide design42,47.

To this point, we had used the lightweight ESM-2-650M model for PepMLM training, enabling flexible finetuning and inference. To assess the performance of larger models, we note that we additionally finetuned ESM-2-3B17 for peptide generation (PepMLM-3B) and evaluated it using the same methodology as employed for the ESM-2-650M version of PepMLM (PepMLM-650M). However, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10, we did not observe a substantial improvement in either perplexity or hit rate for PepMLM-3B (36.02%). Considering the associated resource and inference costs, we provide our PepMLM-650M model as an accessible resource for effective linear peptide generation.

We envision that further improvements can be made to the PepMLM-650M model itself, enabling its adoption as a more universal tool for peptide binder design. For example, PepMLM can be retrained with modification-aware and variant-aware pLM embeddings to enable specificity to posttranslational isoforms over wild-type protein states46,48,49. Our future experimental work directions will include biochemical and molecular validation and characterization of the antiviral therapeutic potential of top selected uAbs within the groups tested for the emergent viral targets. We also plan to integrate PepMLM generation with high-throughput lentiviral screening to further evaluate its hit rate and input experimental data back into the algorithm, creating an active learning-based optimization loop50. As a note, we have not applied any experimental optimization of PepMLM-derived peptide binders, including further stabilization using cyclization or stapling—modifications that may improve therapeutic use47,51,52. We envision that through these additional developments, our accessible peptide generator, coupled with variants of our uAb and recent deubiquibody architecture53, will enable a CRISPR-analogous system to bind and modulate any target protein, whether structured or not.

In the data curation phase, protein and peptide complexes were amalgamated from the PepNN and Propedia databases24,25. Initially, redundancy between the two datasets was eliminated, followed by the use of MMseqs2 to cluster the remaining protein sequences, setting a threshold of 0.8 (ref. 26). When protein sequences were identified within the same cluster and exhibited identical binder sequences, a single sequence was retained. This was followed by a manual filtering process, wherein protein sequences were sorted and those exhibiting high similarity (threshold of 80%) were removed to further mitigate homology issues. Consequently, a dataset comprising 10,203 entries was amassed, from which 10,000 were randomly allocated for training and 203 for testing. The maximum lengths for the binder and protein sequences were established at 50 and 500, respectively.

Peptide binders are modeled in a distinctive manner, wherein the peptides are modeled conditionally based on the full protein sequence. Let p = (p1, p2, p3,…, pn) represent the target protein sequence of length n and b = (b1, b2, b3,…, bm) denote the binder of length m. The protein and peptide sequences are concatenated, incorporating special tokens of start, end and padding. Mask language modeling transforms this into a conditional modeling problem, where the objective is to reconstruct b given p and the entire masked b region. The entire model is updated with MLM loss, which can be represented as:

Through this methodology, the discrepancy between the designed binders and the ground truth is minimized, facilitating the approximation of the conditional probability, \(\mathop{\prod}\nolimits_{\rm{i=1}}^{m}P\left({b}_{\rm{i}}{|p}\right)\).

The pretrained protein language model ESM-2 was used to facilitate full parameter finetuning. ESM-2, a transformer-based model, is adept at discerning co-evolutionary patterns across protein sequences. The concatenated protein and peptide sequences were tokenized at the amino acid level and input into the model. Deviating from the original training strategy of ESM, the entire binder sequence was exclusively masked, compelling the model to learn the relationship between the peptide binder and the protein. The ESM-2-650M and ESM-2-3B models were both trained for PepMLM. Both versions were trained on an NVIDIA 8x A100 640 GB DGX GPU system with PyTorch 2.01 and Python 3.10.10. Specific parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

During the generation phase, the target protein sequence, along with a designated number of mask tokens (at end), was input into the model. Subsequently, the model greedily decodes logits at each masked position to identify peptide binders. To infuse greater diversity into the generation process, top-k sampling was implemented, wherein the model randomly selects the top k highest probability logits at each masked position.

The PPL of ESM-2 was adapted to focus specifically on the evaluation of peptide binder generation. Notably, the perplexity calculation is confined to the binder region or, in other words, the masked regions. Mathematically, the PPL is defined as:

In this equation, b represents the binder sequence, and m is the length of the binder sequence. This modification ensures a more focused evaluation of the designed peptide binders, aligning with the conditional modeling approach adopted in this study.

To assess the efficacy of the designed peptide binders, a benchmarking study was conducted on the test set. In the test set benchmarking, top-k sampling (k = 3) was employed to generate a single peptide binder for each target protein. Additionally, the original ESM-2 model was used to generate peptides, and random peptides of equivalent length were created. For ESM-2 generation, specifically, mask tokens of the same length were added at the end of target protein sequences for analogous model prediction and decoding as for PepMLM. The perplexity of the PepMLM was compared across four groups. PepMLM-designed binders and test binders were folded using AlphaFold2 ColabFold version 1.5.2, in conjunction with the protein sequences. Folding metrics including pLDDT and ipTM were gathered, which were used to correlate perplexity findings. For each test target protein, the ipTM scores of the test and designed binders were compared to determine the overall hit rate. Notice, as top-k sampling generates with randomness, the hit rate might vary or increase with different runs or k options.

In parallel to the PepMLM approach, RFdiffusion was employed to design peptide binders for both cases. For the given test set, RFdiffusion was tasked with generating one peptide binder per target protein, matching the length specified by the ground truth binders. The generated backbones were then converted into sequences using ProteinMPNN with initial guess and number of cycles of 3. The top sequence was selected via root mean square deviation. RFdiffusion inference code on ColabFold can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabDesign/blob/v1.1.1/rf/examples/diffusion.ipynb.

Structural visualization was performed using ChimeraX 1.7.1. The structures were superimposed using the MatchMaker tool, and interatomic contacts were identified using a van der Waals overlap threshold of ≥ −0.4 Å. The target proteins are shown in gray, whereas the PepMLM-designed and test binders are colored in red and blue, respectively. Their corresponding contact residues are highlighted in matching colors. Amino acid labels are displayed in the focused view.

For the rest visualization of AlphaFold-Multimer co-folding results from PepMLM-designed binder–protein complexes, an initial alignment with the corresponding test complex was performed using Biopython version 1.8.3, which facilitated a comparative visualization of selected complexes, encompassing both the designed and test binders. In these visualizations, the target protein was depicted in yellow, contrasting with the test and designed binders colored in blue and red, respectively. The visualizations were executed using py3Dmol version 2.0.4.

Target protein sequence similarity was assessed through two complementary approaches. Sequence identity between test and training sets was computed using the biotite Alignment method with an identity matrix. For each test target protein, the maximum identity score against all training set sequences was recorded. Additionally, a broader sequence similarity analysis was conducted using MMseqs2 (easy-search) to query both train and test target protein sequences against UniRef50, the training dataset of ESM-2.

Peptides of interest were cloned into a pET-24a+ (Novagen) expression vector containing an N-terminal 6×-histidine–SUMO tag to facilitate downstream purification. Oligonucleotide primer pairs, each encoding for one half of the peptide sequences, were designed using NEBaseChanger V2 (https://nebasechanger.neb.com/) and then incorporated into the plasmid using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis reactions were carried out according to the same protocol. Plasmid assembly was verified using Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ) and then transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Starter cultures (3 ml of LB media, 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin) were inoculated from freshly streaked agar plates or glycerol stocks and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 225 r.p.m. overnight. Starter cultures were then diluted 1:500 in bulk cultures and grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6–0.8 and then induced at a concentration of 1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Thirty minutes after induction, rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 150 µg ml−1. Cells were then collected by centrifugation (4,500g) at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS. The resulting cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C overnight, thawed to room temperature and then lysed using BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Millipore Sigma, 70584-3) supplemented with recombinant lysozyme (Millipore Sigma, 71110-3) and benzonase endonuclease (Millipore Sigma, E1014-25KU) for 20 minutes at room temperature with gentle rocking. The corresponding lysate was diluted with lysis buffer (1× PBS, 20 mM imidazole, 1× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78430)) and then centrifuged at 14,000g for 30 minutes. The cleared supernatant was mixed end over end at 4 °C for 30 minutes with HisPur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88221) equilibrated with 20 mM imidazole in 1× PBS. Resin was centrifuged at 700g for 2 minutes and then washed three times with 50 mM imidazole in 1× PBS. Protein was eluted with three consecutive washes with 500 mM imidazole, concentrated (Millipore Sigma, 3K MWCO, UFC900308) and desalted using Zeba spin desalting columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89892). Expression and purity of purified proteins in both the soluble and insoluble fraction, as well as purified fractions, were assessed using SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 8). Protein concentrations were quantified using a Qubit Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33211).

Purified SUMO-tagged peptide constructs were coated onto 96-well plates (Corning, CLS9018) at a concentration of 2 µg ml−1 in coating buffer (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) at a volume of 50–100 µl per well at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Plates were washed once with Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) (TBS-T) and then blocked with 300 µl of SuperBlock in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37516) per the manufacturer's instructions. BSA, recombinant AMHR2-Fc (Sino Biological, 10673-H02H) and recombinant NCAM1-Fc (Sino Biological, 15785-H02H2) were serially diluted in triplicate or more in SuperBlock with 0.05% Tween 20, after which 100 µl of each solution was added to each well and incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1.5 hours. Plates were then washed five times using 300 µl of TBS-T per well and then incubated with 100 µl of anti-human IgG (HRP) detection antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A18805, diluted 1:10,000 in SuperBlock with 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were again washed five times with 300 µl of TBS-T and then incubated with 100 µl per well of 3,3′-5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34029) for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle rocking. Finally, the reaction was quenched with 100 µl of 2 N H2SO4, and absorbance at 450 nm was immediately quantified using a Promega GloMax Discover plate reader.

All uAb plasmids were generated from the standard pcDNA3 vector, harboring a cytomegalovirus promoter and a C-terminal P2A–GFP cassette as a transfection control. An Esp3I restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the CHIPΔTPR coding sequence and flexible GSGSG linker via KLD Enzyme Mix (NEB) following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with mutagenic primers (GENEWIZ). For uAb assembly, PepMLM-derived peptide sequences (Supplementary Table 4) were human codon optimized for complementary oligo generation (GENEWIZ). Oligos were annealed and ligated via T4 DNA Ligase into the Esp3I-digested uAb backbone. Assembled constructs were transformed into 50 µl of NEB Turbo Competent E. coli and plated onto LB agar supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic for subsequent sequence verification of colonies and plasmid purification (GENEWIZ).

Sequences for human codon-optimized phosphoprotein genes for NiV (GenBank, AY029767), HeV (GenBank, MN062017) and HMPV (GenBank, AAS22075) were designed with HA tags on their N termini and flanked with restriction enzyme recognition sites for KpnI and XhoI on their 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, for ligation into a mammalian pCAGGS vector.

HEK293T and Vero AT cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin and 10% FBS. uAb-encoding plasmids (500 ng) were transfected into cells (4 × 105 per well in a 12-well plate) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Gibco). TruHD-Q43Q17M cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium with Earle's Salts (EMEM) supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% NEAA (Gibco) and 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco). For HTT degradation studies, PepMLM peptides were transfected into fibroblasts using the SG cell line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza). For viral protein degradation, transfections were done with HEK293T cells at approximately 90% confluency in six-well plates using a 4:1 µl:µg ratio of PEI MAX to DNA, following the transfection reagent manufacturer's protocol. Target phosphoprotein plasmids were transfected at a 1:1 ratio with uAb plasmids for a total of 2 µg of DNA per well in Opti-MEM. Transfections were supplemented with Opti-MEM at approximately 5 hours after transfection. HMPV strain TN93-32 (BEI) was propagated in Vero AT cells for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin and 2% FBS. RPE1 cells used for MSH3 studies were maintained in DMEM/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 µg ml−1 hygromycin B (Gibco) and transfected with PepMLM peptides using the TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus Bio).

MSH3 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-29829) was directly labeled using an Alexa Fluor Antibody Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Transfected RPE1 cells were fixed 2 days after transfection using 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 minutes at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 (BioShop) for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The cells were blocked using a blocking buffer (10% FBS in PBS) overnight and incubated with the labeled primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (1:50) for 1 hour. The cells were then incubated with 2 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33258 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 minutes at room temperature. The imaging was done using an EVOS M7000 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at ×20. Cell segmentation and signal quantification was done using CellProfiler. When conducting downstream analysis, the TRITC signal from the PepMLM plasmid transfection was used to select for transfected cells. Data were analyzed to assess the statistical significance of differences in normalized intensities between the control group (polyG) and treatment groups (pMLM1–pMLM6). Outliers for all samples were removed using the interquartile range (IQR) method, where values greater than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR were excluded to ensure robust comparisons. Statistical comparisons between the control and each treatment group were performed using a one-sided Mann–Whitney U-test. Significance thresholds were defined as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 and *****P < 0.00001. Non-significant comparisons were denoted as ‘NS'. All analyses were conducted using Python, and plots were generated using Matplotlib.

The PepMLM peptide expression was induced using 1 µg ml−1 doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) 3 days before harvest and replenished every 2 days. On the day of harvest, TruHD-Q43Q17M cells were washed with 1× PBS and then lysed and scraped off using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice. The mixture was incubated on ice for 5 minutes followed by centrifugation at 13,000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 4× loading buffer (250 mM Tris pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Immunoblotting was performed using precast 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder in 1× TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight and then probed with rabbit anti-huntingtin antibody (Abcam, EPR5526, 1:5,000) or rabbit anti-vinculin antibody (Abcam, EPR8185, 1:5,000) in the same buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with 1× TBS-T and then three times with 2.5% skim milk powder in 1× TBS-T for 5 minutes each. The membranes were then probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam, 1:50,000) for 30 minutes at room temperature before being washed again and incubated with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) and imaged with a MicroChemi chemiluminescence detector (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems). Densitometry analysis was conducted using ImageJ. PolyG controls were first normalized by vinculin loading control with this normalized polyG being used to normalize uAb band degradation.

HEK293T cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection and lysed using 1× RIPA buffer (Millipore) containing complete protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated at 4 °C, rocking, for 40 minutes before being vortexed at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes. Cell lysate supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 21,000g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. To denature samples for SDS-PAGE, cell lysates were mixed and incubated with 1.8% SDS containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 minutes at 95 °C before loading onto 10% acrylamide-Tris HCl gels. Proteins were separated at 100 V for 2 hours and then transferred onto 0.2-µm PVDF membranes at 0.5 A for 2 hours. Membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 4% BSA before staining in 1:1,000 dilutions of mouse anti-Flag (Millipore, F1804), mouse anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 47778) and rabbit anti-HA (BioLegend, 923502) primary antibodies. Secondary antibody staining was performed using 1:1,000 dilutions of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, A21236 and A11008, respectively). Blocking, primary and secondary antibody membrane incubations were performed rocking at room temperature for 30 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes, respectively. Membranes were rinsed with PBS-T three times for 5 minutes after each antibody staining. All membranes were imaged using a Bio-Rad imager in respective Alexa Fluor channels. Densitometric quantification was performed using ImageLab for phosphoprotein and β-actin bands. Background densities from samples mock transfected with pCAGGS vector only were subtracted. Then, sample densities were normalized to their respective β-actin signals before normalization to their respective phosphoprotein controls. Data represent n ≥ 3 experimental replicates. Generation of bar graphs was performed using GraphPad Prism version 10, and the schematic diagram was made using BioRender (https://www.biorender.com/).

Vero AT cells were seeded in 24-well plates to 90% confluency; after transfection and infection with HMPV, cells were washed with DPS twice and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature to be subsequently permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Custom polyclonal rabbit serum made against HMPV M was used for viral detection. After 1 hour, bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Finally, the cellular nuclei were labeled with Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 10 minutes, and the images were examined using an ECHO Revolve microscope (BICO).

HEK293T cells were obtained from the Duke Cell Culture Facility and originated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were cultured in DMEM 4.5 g l−1 glucose and 4 mM glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11995-DMEM) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone, SH30070.03HI) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For MESH1 immunoblotting, HeLa cells originating from the ATCC were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% FBS. For uAb screening in reporter cell lines, 800 ng of pcDNA-uAb plasmids was transfected into cells in triplicate (3 × 105 per well in a 12-well plate) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Gibco). Cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection for subsequent immunoblotting.

On the day of harvest, cells were detached by adding 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washing cell pellets twice with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cells were then lysed using a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma) in Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Specifically, the protease inhibitor cocktail–RIPA buffer solution was added to the cell pellet, and the mixture was placed at 4 °C for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected immediately to pre-chilled PCR tubes and quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, 20 μg of lysed protein was mixed with 4× Bolt LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 5% β-mercaptoethanol in a 3:1 ratio and subsequently incubated at 95 °C for 10 minutes prior to immunoblotting, which was performed according to standard protocols. In brief, samples were loaded at equal volumes into Bolt Bis-Tris Plus Mini Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated by electrophoresis. iBlot 2 Transfer Stacks (Invitrogen) were used for membrane blot transfer, and, after a 1-hour room-temperature incubation in 5% milk–TBS-T, proteins were probed with rabbit anti-HDDC3 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA040895, diluted 1:1,000) or rabbit anti-vinculin (Invitrogen, 700062, diluted 1:2,000) for overnight incubation at 4 °C. The blots were washed three times with 1× TBS-T for 10 minutes each and then probed with a secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (HRP) (Abcam, ab7083, diluted 1:5,000), for 1 hour at room temperature. After three washes with 1× TBS-T for 10 minutes each, blots were detected by chemiluminescence using an Invitrogen iBright CL1500 Imaging System. Densitometry analysis of protein bands in immunoblots was performed using FIJI software as described at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/examples/dot-blot/. In brief, bands in each lane were grouped as a row or a horizontal ‘lane' and quantified using FIJI's gel analysis function. Intensity data for the uAb bands were first normalized to band intensity of either vinculin in each lane and then to the average band intensity for the polyG–uAb vector control cases across replicates.

HEK293T cells were reverse transfected using 1 μg of uAb plasmid and 3 μl of Mirus TransIT-LT-1 (Mirus Bio) transfection reagent for 48 hours, using the standard protocol for a 12-well plate as described by the manufacturer. The transfected HEK293T cells were transferred 2,500 cells per well to a 96-well plate, and 10 M erastin (Cayman Chemical) was added to the media to induce ferroptosis. Cell viability was measured 24 hours later using the Cell-Titer Glo (Promega) assay following the manufacturer's protocol.

Unless otherwise noted, all data are reported as average values with error bars representing s.d. For samples performed in independent biological triplicates (n = 3) or more, statistical significance was determined by unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test, paired one-sided Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test as indicated (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; *****P < 0.00001). Quantitative immunofluorescence sample sizes were 1,954, 1,311, 1,218, 3,662, 3,079, 2,887 and 3,845 for the polyG control and MSH3_pMLM_1–6, respectively. All graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 10 version 14.4.1 or in Matplotlib. No data were excluded from the analyses unless specifically noted otherwise. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Quantum physics is often described as the most successful scientific framework in history. In its 100 years of existence, it has explained everything from the periodic table of the elements to how stars shine. But there is one fundamental phenomenon it can't explain: gravity.

“How quantum mechanics and gravity fit together is one of the most important outstanding problems in physics,” says Kathryn Zurek, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena.

Generations of researchers have tried to create a quantum theory of gravity, and their work has produced sophisticated mathematical constructs, such as string theory. But experimental physicists haven't found concrete evidence for any of these, and they're not even sure what such evidence could look like.

Now there is a sense that insights could be around the corner. In the past decade, many researchers have become more optimistic that there are ways to test the true nature of gravity in the laboratory. Scientists have proposed experiments to do this, and are pushing the precision of techniques to make them possible. “There's been a huge rise in both experimental capability and our theoretical understanding of what we actually learn from such experiments,” says Markus Aspelmeyer, an experimental physicist at the University of Vienna and a pioneer of this work.

Some of the proposed tests involve experimental lasers, which could be built in a few years. Others require manipulating matter in such ambitious ways that they might never be achieved. One shocking result could be that gravity is not a quantum phenomenon after all.

Still, many researchers feel that the field is finally on the right track. “You have to search, if you're going to find anything,” says Lee McCuller, an experimental physicist also at Caltech.

The current accepted theory of gravity is Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. It has revealed that gravity is the way in which each lump of matter influences another by curving the space-time in which they travel — akin to billiard balls deforming the elastic surface of a trampoline and bending each others' paths as they move on it.

General relativity is a classical — as opposed to a quantum — theory. In quantum physics, a particle is described as a smeared-out cloud of possibilities, and its position only assumes a meaning after it's measured. But Einstein's theory sees particles as things that exist at a precise point in space at any given time, and that move along well-defined trajectories.

Researchers attach a variety of meanings to the idea of gravity being quantum, says Flaminia Giacomini, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. Scientists generally agree that any quantum theory of gravity has to involve features such as objects having fuzzy probability distributions, rather than definite locations. Some theories also require space-time to come in discrete chunks (‘quanta'), as opposed to the smooth space-time of Einstein's theory, but this is by no means synonymous with gravity being quantum, she says.

In early attempts to create a quantum theory of gravity in the 1960s, theoretical physicists tried to feed general relativity into a mathematical procedure that turns classical equations into quantum ones (and objects with well-defined properties into fuzzy probabilistic clouds). But although this trick had worked well for another fundamental force of nature, electromagnetism, in the case of Einstein's theory, it gave nonsensical results, such as quantities that blew up to infinity.

Efforts to build quantum theories of gravity from scratch have produced some mathematically consistent results. The most popular attempt is string theory, which posits that elementary particles are really tiny strings vibrating in unseen dimensions of space. In principle, this could solve some paradoxes in the theory of known elementary particles, and it predicts new elementary particles that behave the way physicists expect of quanta of gravity, or ‘gravitons'.

This does achieve the goal of making gravity a quantum theory. But researchers have looked for experimental signatures of certain versions of string theory, with no success so far. The same has been true of loop quantum gravity, an even more radical approach that replaces the fabric of space-time (not just the elementary particles that live in it) with tiny loops.

Some physicists have become frustrated at the dearth of prospects for testing what they see as fancy constructs, such as string theory. “I think people are getting disenamoured with it,” says Ivette Fuentes, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton, UK.

Instead of designing new quantum gravity theories, some researchers are hoping to use lab tests to explore basic questions about whether gravity, at its heart, has a classical or a quantum nature.

“We don't have any experimental evidence of how gravity becomes quantum — or of whether gravity is a quantum phenomenon at all,” says experimental physicist Richard Howl at Royal Holloway, University of London.

“For me, the coolest thing would be a yes-or-no experiment,” says Aspelmeyer.

One of the big questions that researchers have concerns the quantum phenomenon of ‘superposition' — in which an object can be in two states simultaneously, such as rotating in opposite directions or moving along two distinct paths at once. In any quantum version of general relativity, a particle's billiard-ball influence would presumably put space-time itself into a superposition of space being bent along one path and, simultaneously, along another. Theorists wonder what gravitational attraction a second ball should feel: would it fall simultaneously along two trajectories, splitting its path into two? Or, if this quantum superposition does not occur, perhaps it would fall towards some point in between, averaging the two attractions out?

Then again, would the very presence of the second ball force the first ball to ‘choose' which path it is on, just as a measuring device forces a particle to know its position?

In the past decade, theorists have realized that it should be possible to experimentally distinguish between these ideas, through the peculiarly quantum phenomenon of entanglement. In quantum mechanics, when two objects interact, they can enter a common, ‘entangled' state. This means that when a property of the first object is measured and acquires a definite value, the corresponding property of the other object is also set.

The key idea is that if two objects can become entangled through their mutual gravitational attraction in the absence of any other interaction, then gravity must be of a quantum nature.

It all sounds abstract, but researchers have been concocting a plethora of schemes to put this into practice.

In one experiment envisaged by Aspelmeyer, a tiny particle in a vacuum is placed into a superposition of states corresponding to different positions. Researchers then look to see whether a second, nearby particle, which feels the gravitational attraction of the first but no other forces, has become entangled with it.

Aspelmeyer has been at the forefront of improving techniques to make this possible — although the full experiment can't be done yet.

One major challenge is that putting an object in a superposition of locations gets increasingly difficult the larger the object is — after all, such effects are never seen at the macroscopic scales of everyday life.

So far, researchers have achieved it with molecules made of thousands of atoms1, and have made significant breakthroughs in getting relatively large objects, such as tiny glass spheres levitated by laser beams, to show other aspects of quantum behaviour. An important step has been to slow down particles so much that their motion reveals a quantum nature, Aspelmeyer notes: for instance, they acquire discrete energy levels when trapped in an electromagnetic field. This feat was achieved for the first time in 20202.

The experiment of Aspelmeyer's dreams would require two objects not only to behave in a quantum way but also to be massive enough to exert a substantial gravitational pull on each other. Because gravity is such a weak force, that would require masses of at least 22 micrograms, having quintillions of atoms.

Aspelmeyer can't yet measure the tiny gravitational force that would be produced by these objects. In 2021, he reported doing so for much larger particles, with a mass of 90 milligrams3. He attached two such masses at the ends of a tiny stick, which was suspended horizontally with a string attached to its midpoint. He then brought in a third 90-mg mass close to one end, and saw the effect of this gravitational pull by measuring the stick's rotation.

A challenge with measuring smaller objects and their gravitational fields is that it's very hard to isolate them from other interactions — which tend to be much stronger than gravity. Such isolation would be necessary in the experiment Aspelmeyer wants to do for researchers to be confident that any effect they see is truly due to gravity alone.

Sougato Bose, a theoretical physicist at University College London (UCL), and others have proposed and received some funding for a related experiment4. The idea is to have particles in free fall: the researchers suggest putting a microscopic diamond crystal in a superposition that involves falling along two parallel directions, and doing the same for another, similar crystal. (This is achieved in each crystal by putting into superposition one of its spin states and then applying magnetic fields; the crystals are deflected in ways that depend on where their spins point, because spin — a quantum property of subatomic particles — acts rather like a tiny bar magnet.) Altogether, there would be four paths, all parallel to each other, which would put the two crystals at various distances from each other, and therefore in a superposition of feeling gravitational attractions of different intensities (see ‘Proposed tests for quantum gravity').

Source: Adapted from Sci. Am. (see go.nature.com/4FW1RJG)

Each crystal would then be recombined into one path, and readouts of their quantum states would reveal whether they had become entangled, an outcome that — so the reasoning goes — could have occurred only through gravity. However, Bose says that each of these steps will be extremely hard to achieve, and it could be many decades before experimental techniques make this feasible to test. (Other teams have made similar proposals.)

Although Bose and others think that the ability to create entanglement is the key to proving that gravity has a quantum nature, others say the reality could be more subtle.

“You're not really proving that gravity is quantum; you make some model of what you think gravity not being quantum would mean, and then try to rule that out,” says Daniel Carney, a theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.

If gravity can entangle things, he says, then it would certainly not be a classical phenomenon, “but what that means to the full structure of the gravitational field is an open question”.

Other groups have developed concepts for testing the quantumness of gravity without entanglement. One, devised by Howl together with Fuentes and the theorist Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford, UK, would suspend a cloud of cold atoms in a single quantum state called a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Then the gravitational self-attraction of the cloud would make it evolve in different ways, depending on whether gravity is quantum or classical. In particular, classical gravity would never make the positions of the atoms in the BEC evolve from a bell-curve type of distribution (that is, having a single peak) to one with multiple peaks5. It would be possible to measure whether such a shift occurs by probing the BEC with another one, Howl says.

Here, the experimental challenge is that BECs are typically made up of millions of atoms, but that number would need to grow by a factor of 10 million to have measurable gravitational attraction, says Fuentes — although various quantum-technology tricks could soften that requirement.

Leaving home in pursuit of academic and professional opportunities is never an easy decision. For many Latinx people (those with a Latin American background or heritage) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, moving abroad can open doors to cutting-edge research, stronger funding, better technologies and career-defining collaborations. But it comes at a cost.

Latinx scientists abroad not only face language barriers and the need to navigate new cultures, but also the potential loss of deeply rooted support systems. Parenting can feel like a daily struggle when extended family support — so central to Latinx cultures — is missing. The warmth of Latinx relationships, often expressed through physical closeness, emotional interdependence and deep conversations, isn't always welcomed in research cultures: environments in which independence and emotional self-containment are more valued. The absence of a strong sense of community, in which neighbours and friends become family, can leave Latinx researchers feeling unanchored and isolated.

Furthermore, many Latin American countries have historically faced underfunded public-education systems, political instability and limited access to advanced STEM training or research infrastructure. This means that Latinx students often arrive abroad already trying to catch up, entering highly competitive environments in which they feel pressure to constantly prove themselves and represent their communities in structures that don't always understand or accommodate their background. Latinx people remain under-represented in STEM fields, which can add a layer of emotional and mental strain because of increased pressure to perform and a reduced sense of belonging1.

I help to build support systems for Latina researchers

I help to build support systems for Latina researchers

All of these challenges are often compounded by experiences of discrimination, isolation and the pressure to disprove harmful stereotypes — conditions that have been linked to poor health outcomes and increased emotional fatigue in Latino populations2. And although their families back home and the global scientific community might celebrate their success, these groups might overlook the mental-health and personal toll it takes to get there.

Nature's careers team spoke to four Latin American scientists doing research around the world, to learn not only about their professional and well-being challenges, but also about the strategies that they use to care for themselves. They offer tips and advice that could benefit any researcher who moves from the global south to the global north to train or work. 

Senior research-data specialist at the Melbourne Data Analytics Platform at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

I studied pure mathematics in Argentina, where the university system is incredibly strong for undergraduate degrees. I really enjoyed my time there, but my options in Argentina were limited to becoming a professor of mathematics, which didn't appeal to me. So, I decided to pursue a PhD in computational neuroscience at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. I never imagined that I'd then end up in Australia, but I met my partner, who is Australian, during my PhD and years later, I moved to my current position.

Moving overseas is challenging. It's not an easy decision and no one should take it lightly. Although it offers many career opportunities, such as better salaries and sometimes a higher quality of life, it also comes at a huge cost. You have to give up many things — for example, personal relationships and your culture. However, being exposed to a different culture and way of life makes you appreciate what you have back in your home country. It offers an alternative perspective.

There are cultural challenges when moving abroad. Latinx people are known for being straightforward, emotional and vocal when things aren't working well, but in the United States, I had to adapt to a more logic-based approach with less emphasis on emotions. Moving to Australia then brought more challenges, because I didn't have a robust network or a support system here. This has become trickier since having children. I have a three-year-old boy and another child on the way, and those early months of raising a baby with zero support were really tough. We've never had anyone else look after our boy — it's always been just me and my husband. So, whenever I can, I enjoy going back to Argentina on extended holidays because I have a lot of cousins there who can help, and those are the moments when I can relax instead of constantly chasing my son around.

It's also hard to make deep friendships in which I can share personal and emotional issues. For Latinx people, every activity is an opportunity to build community and networks. When I first arrived in Australia, I joined a yoga group to meet people, but my expectations were unrealistic. Over time, I've accepted that my closest and most-open relationships will probably be with other Latinx people. I know some people say, ‘I don't want to go to the other side of the world and make friends only with Argentinians.' But I've found that having those shared codes, that common language and mutual expectations, is crucial for building friendships. Hobbies have been important as well. I enjoy knitting and crocheting because, unlike research, you can see the progress with every minute you invest. You get something tangible and feel a sense of accomplishment.

I was diagnosed with depression during my PhD studies, and what helped me was therapy, medication and talking about it as much as possible with as many people as I could. I'm very open about it, and simply saying it out loud has a therapeutic effect. It helps me to process it better, even if the other person doesn't say anything. To cope with impostor syndrome, I keep a ‘feel-good' folder in my e-mail, in which I save kind messages from people who thank me for helping them or who appreciate my work. I revisit these e-mails when I'm feeling a bit useless or like I can't do anything right. They remind me of the value and impact of my work.

Biologist and postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania.

I did my undergraduate, master's, PhD and one postdoc in Brazil. My decision to move to the United States in 2022 was driven by better opportunities — especially in terms of funding and access to more-advanced technologies. My research focuses on infectious diseases affecting amphibians worldwide. It was a hard decision to move, because I love my country and at the time, my husband was still in Brazil. It was also scary at first, especially because of the language barrier. I wasn't born with the privilege of speaking the most dominant language in research. Even in everyday situations, it was difficult. I remember the first time I went to a doctor's appointment, I couldn't express exactly what I was feeling. It was horrible. I also remember being on the subway in New York City with my husband — he moved to the United States in 2024 — when a man started yelling at us to speak English, telling us that we didn't have a right to be there. It made me feel like I didn't belong. But it shouldn't have.

Experiences like that triggered my impostor syndrome. I started to wonder what I was doing here, as if I didn't deserve it. I even began to question my own abilities and felt as if people didn't like me. 

When you leave your country as I did — without my family, friends and husband, not knowing if he would ever be able to join me — everything changes all at once. And my mind just couldn't take it. It hurt. On top of that, in the beginning, I was putting so much pressure on myself to prove that I deserved to be here, that I forgot to take care of myself. But therapy has boosted my self-esteem and confidence — helping me to recognize my strengths and remember that I belong here. I chose one-to-one talk therapy with a therapist from Brazil, someone who could understand not just my language but also the cultural context that I come from. I know that's a privilege, but I couldn't imagine having to translate into English some feelings and words that are so deeply rooted in who I am.

Should I return to my home country after my PhD abroad?

Should I return to my home country after my PhD abroad?

Now, I try to remember that I am qualified to be here, that I speak two languages and that I was selected from a pool of many researchers for this opportunity. I deserve it! Therapy has also helped me to manage my depression, for which I've been receiving medical treatment for a year and a half. Now I feel better. Being so far away from my family will never stop hurting, but I've learnt how to move through my routines without them. 

I also talk to my mum every day — sometimes twice — and we video call for special occasions such as birthdays. That helps with the saudade, a Portuguese word for that deep feeling of missing someone you love. Developing friendships has also helped, although cultural differences have made it difficult to form close connections with people from the United States. But sharing life experiences with people from other countries who can relate has been wonderful.

I grew up in Ecuador and completed two engineering degrees there. I then pursued a master's degree in machine learning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a PhD in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where my wife, who is also from Ecuador, was earning a PhD in biomedical engineering. 

Sadly, returning to Ecuador was not an option for us, for two reasons. First, my wife and I would have returned to mostly teaching positions, perhaps getting one research project every couple of years if we were lucky enough to secure both students and funding. And second, because Ecuador was not safe for us. My family experienced gang-related violence there, and my wife and I decided it wasn't a safe or healthy environment in which to raise our two children, who were one and four years old at the time. Instead, we chose to explore opportunities in Sweden, where my wife's sister lives. It offered the chance to be close to family and raise our children near their cousins of the same age, and engage with the country's strong research and innovation culture.

In Ecuador, I didn't receive a good secondary-school education, and it had a lasting impact on my foundational academic skills. There were regular teachers' strikes, with classes often suspended for weeks or months. Those disruptions meant that I missed out on building core skills, especially in maths. 

But there are three strategies that have worked for me while I pursued a research career, and I recommend them to anyone who wants to become a scientist, no matter their background. First, learn to be a good communicator and master academic writing in English. Second, make sure that you understand maths deeply — and use a pen and paper for calculations to really grasp each concept. Third, practise public speaking so that you can share your thoughts clearly and confidently in front of others.

The menstrual cycle requires tight orchestration between the brain and body, and irregularities can be both the cause and the consequence of wide-ranging health issues. Embracing this complexity, instead of excluding individuals with irregular menstrual patterns from research, could reveal novel brain–body interactions, advance neuroscience and improve health outcomes for those affected.

The field of nanophotonics requires high-quality materials for the fabrication of resonant structures that can confine light down to the nanoscale. Metallic nanostructures often used for this purpose exhibit high optical losses, so high-refractive-index dielectrics such as silicon (Si) and III–V semiconductors are widely used instead. Recently, layered materials, often referred to as ‘van der Waals materials' for the forces holding atomic planes together in bulk crystals, have been introduced as alternative dielectric building blocks for nanophotonics. Compared to traditional semiconductors, these materials exhibit higher refractive indices and transparency in the visible and near-infrared favourable for compact waveguides; strong birefringence and large nonlinear optical coefficients attractive for nonlinear optics; and out-of-plane van der Waals adhesive forces enabling novel tuning techniques and heterointegration approaches for the realization of previously inaccessible photonic structures. Recently, these properties of quasi-bulk van der Waals materials (as opposed to their widely studied monolayers) have been applied in a variety of photonic structures and devices, which will be discussed here. We report on recent progress in utilizing layered materials in waveguiding, wavefront shaping, Purcell enhancement, quantum nanophotonics, lasing, nonlinear optics, and strong light–matter coupling, as well as offer a snapshot of future developments in hybrid and tunable nanophotonics, three-dimensional photonic structures, optical trapping, polariton devices and van der Waals integrated nanophotonic circuits.

The discovery of quasicrystals, characterized by unique, non-repeating atomic arrangements and forbidden rotational symmetries, has significantly expanded our understanding of structural order in materials. However, precise control over quasiperiodic length scales remains challenging due to the inherent constraints of atomic arrangements and chemical compositions. In this study, we utilized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a designable platform to generate moiré patterns including dodecagonal quasiperiodic symmetry through the projection of twisted bilayer structures. Through rational ligand design based on isoreticular principles, the characteristic length scales of the resulting patterns can be systematically modulated, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and mathematical analysis. While the observed patterns exhibit characteristics reminiscent of quasicrystals, they result from the incidental stacking of twisted layers rather than intrinsic quasicrystalline order. This work provides a conceptual framework for incorporating quasiperiodicity into reticular chemistry and expands the structural design space for functional moiré materials.

The discovery of the Al–Mn quasicrystal by Dan Shechtman changed the conventional understanding of crystals1. Unlike most crystals that have repeating atomic patterns, quasicrystals have unique arrangements that never repeat and feature forbidden rotational symmetries, such as five-, seven-fold, or even higher ones2. These unique arrangements exhibit intriguing properties in lasing2, optics3, magnetism4, electronics5, and heat6, leading to the rapid expansion of the quasicrystal universe, including chalcogenides7,8, mesoporous silica9, dendritic liquid crystals10, binary nanoparticles11, colloids12, and polymers13. Despite the wide range of quasiperiodic length scales from a few to several hundred angstroms (Fig. 1A)14,15, systematic control over these length scales remains a formidable challenge, because changes in chemical composition can alter atomic interactions, leading to structural distortions or destabilization of octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal quasiperiodic patterns16.

A Lengths for quasicrystalline materials are adapted from a previous study14. Lengths for quasiperiodic moiré materials are defined based on the 3rd inflation of the Stampfli-tiling, as shown in Fig. 5D. B Moiré pattern formed by twisted bilayer Zr-MOFs.

We explored the potential for tunable quasiperiodic scales by utilizing MOFs as a highly designable materials platform through the judicious selection of metal clusters and organic ligands17. By employing the principles of isoreticular design, MOFs can accommodate organic ligands with varying length scales while maintaining the overall structure, enabling systematic modulation of the characteristic length scales of quasiperiodic patterns18,19. The building blocks possessing particular forbidden rotational symmetries could be used to promote the formation of quasicrystalline MOFs. However, when a pyrrole-based organic ligand with pseudo-five-fold symmetry was employed in MOFs, the desired five-fold symmetry was frustrated upon coordination with metal clusters20. While the number of MOFs with quasicrystal approximants is increasing21,22,23,24 and interest in aperiodic MOFs continues to grow25,26, quasicrystals and MOFs are still regarded as distinct classes of materials27.

As an alternative, we envisioned the use of the moiré pattern, an interference pattern arising from the superposition of periodic structures (Fig. 1B)28,29,30,31,32. In condensed matter physics, the moiré pattern has emerged as a crucial tool for studying topological bands and Berry curvature33. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), for example, exhibits intriguing properties such as superconductivity and electronic correlations at specific twist angles34,35,36. However, only the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern can be formed in TBG when the layers are rotated by 30 degrees, and the fixed carbon-carbon (C–C) bond length limits the ability to adjust the quasiperiodic length scales37,38,39.

In this study, we successfully demonstrated the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern using triangular MOFs with three different ligands: 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDC), 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BPDC), and azobenzene-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (AZDC). Through Stampfli-tiling and mathematical derivation, we revealed that the length of quasiperiodicity can be precisely controlled at the angstrom level depending on the ligand length (Fig. 1). This study bridges the gap between quasiperiodicity and MOFs, highlighting the potential of MOFs as a platform for achieving quasiperiodic structures at various length scales. We expect that various quasiperiodic patterns can be achieved beyond the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern by exploiting the structural diversity of MOFs.

An isoreticular series of MOFs was synthesized from Zr-based precursors and linear ligands of different length scales, namely NDC, BPDC, and AZDC (Fig. 2). Zr-BPDC and Zr-AZDC were obtained via conventional solvothermal reactions. In contrast, Zr-NDC required degassing by freeze–pump–thaw cycles to selectively yield the desired crystalline product. The hexagonal Zr-based clusters form a triangular lattice, and when the Zr₁₂ cluster is considered as a vertex, the MOF layer adopts the hxl topology40,41,42,43. The respective MOFs are denoted as Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC. The MOF nanosheets were obtained by exfoliating bulk samples through sonication for several hours, following a method adapted from Foster et al. (see “Methods” section)44. These exfoliated nanosheets were subsequently analyzed by TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) using small, consistent amount of MOF samples (50–150 µL) to ensure reproducibility (Methods section). The TEM imaging revealed well-defined triangular lattices, with inter-cluster distances of 1.7, 1.9, and 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, respectively (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 1), demonstrating precise and systematic control over the lattice size. The Zr-MOFs exhibited hexagonal nanosheets with a thickness ranging from 1.7 to 20 nm, as confirmed by SEM and AFM images (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3). The monolayer thickness of 1.7 nm aligns with the height of the Zr12 cluster. In contrast, bulk samples were used for gas adsorption studies, as larger quantities were required for this measurement. The porosity of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC was examined by N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K, revealing uptakes of 487, 362, and 226 cm3g−1 with corresponding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 741, 1101, and 762 m2g−1, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 4, 5).

A Hexagonal Zr12 cluster (Zr, cyan; O, red; C, gray) and linear NDC, BPDC, and AZDC ligands. B Model structures of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC MOFs. The inter-cluster distances are indicated. H atoms and formate are omitted for clarity. C Fourier-filtered TEM images along the [001] zone axis of Zr-MOFs (scale bar, 5 nm) with inset of the FFT patterns (scale bar, 1 nm−1). D Pawley refinements of synchrotron PXRD patterns for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC. A minor broad feature preceding the (100) reflection was observed for Zr-AZDC, possibly attributed to a small amount of amorphous contribution. However, the sharp Bragg peaks indicate that the overall crystallinity of the material is well preserved.

Pawley refinement was performed to accurately determine the unit cell parameters and assess the phase purity of the Zr-MOFs (Fig. 2D). The refined patterns showed excellent agreement with the synchrotron PXRD data, yielding cell parameters of a = 17.34(15) Å, c = 23.71(21) Å in P63/m for Zr-NDC (Rp = 1.7%, Rwp = 3.1%), a = 19.50(29) Å, c = 23.97(36) Å in P63/mmc for Zr-BPDC (Rp = 2.5%, Rwp = 6.0%), and a = 21.33(8) Å, c = 24.03(9) Å in P63/m for Zr-AZDC (Rp = 1.0%, Rwp = 1.7%), confirming the triangular lattice structure. The laboratory PXRD patterns of bulk Zr-MOFs also closely matched the simulated hxl structure, with prominent peaks corresponding to the (hk0) planes (Supplementary Fig. 6). The observed peak broadening and asymmetry suggest random stacking of the layers41. The experimental and simulated PXRD patterns were compared by adjusting the simulated patterns to incorporate the preferred orientation of the (100) plane, given that the hxl MOFs adopt nanosheet morphologies. In the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized samples, l-dependent peaks, such as the (101) and (202) planes, were slightly observed (Supplementary Fig. 6). In particular, Zr-AZDC exhibited sharper peaks, indicating more ordered layer stacking. However, these l-dependent peaks disappeared after sonication, suggesting that sonication disrupts the ordered stacking. The absence of l-dependent peaks, combined with peak broadening, indicates a disordered, layered structure along the c-direction, consistent with the findings reported by C. P. Gray41. It is important to note that the Zr-BPDC system can adopt different polymorphs, including fcu and hcp structures. When comparing the experimental PXRD pattern with the simulated pattern of the fcu Zr-BPDC structure, distinct differences in peak positions were observed, confirming that the synthesized MOF is not fcu structure (Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition, characteristic peaks associated with the hcp polymorph, specifically the (002), (100), (101), and (102) planes, are absent in the PXRD pattern of Zr-BPDC, further confirming that the structure is not the hcp polymorph.

Moiré patterns arise either from twisting the same materials at a specific angle or from a lattice mismatch between different materials (Supplementary Fig. 9). In this study, we focused on moiré patterns formed by the former method. Without sonication, the MOF predominantly existed as thick nanosheets rather than well-exfoliated layers, and moiré patterns from overlapping MOF layers were rarely observed. However, after exfoliating the MOF nanosheets through sonication (Methods section), moiré patterns were observed at randomly occurring twist angles in Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, as shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 10–12. We determined the twist angles of the twisted bilayer MOFs using TEM measurements, with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns facilitating the identification of these angles. The moiré patterns observed in the TEM images closely match those in the simulated images created by superimposing two MOF layers. As the twist angle increased, the moiré period decreased (Fig. 3A, B), indicating the repeating pattern became smaller. In addition, as the ligand length of the MOFs increased from NDC to BPDC and AZDC, the size of the moiré pattern increased, while the shape of the pattern remained the same. Due to the higher electron density of Zr clusters compared to the organic components, the FFT spots were primarily influenced by the Zr clusters arranged within the triangular lattice. We also observed satellite peaks in the FFT patterns of the moiré TEM images (Supplementary Fig. 13). This phenomenon has been noted in another moiré material, twisted bilayer graphene, and is attributed to the periodic modulation in the moiré pattern45. Furthermore, we investigated the common angles observed in the Zr-BPDC MOF. Approximately one hundred TEM images were collected from the twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC, revealing a broad range of twist angles. A relatively higher proportion of bilayers exhibiting around 11 degrees (Fig. 3D). This result suggests that multiple configurations are accessible, highlighting the structural flexibility of the twisted bilayer MOF rather than a strong preference for a single dominant configuration. Figure 3 presents representative TEM images showing the various moiré patterns observed in the twisted bilayer MOF (see also Supplementary Figs. 10–12).

Monolayers and multilayers were also inevitably observed, whereas the statistical analysis focused exclusively on the bilayer systems. E Energy profile of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC calculated using LAMMPS.

It is noteworthy that TEM images represent the projected interlayer arrangements rather than the intrinsic symmetry of the MOF structure. As a result, although TEM images of structures with twist angles of θ and 60° – θ (where 0° ≤ θ ≤ 60°) appear indistinguishable, the twisted bilayer MOF structures at 0 degrees and 60 degrees are inherently different due to the 3-fold symmetry of the MOF layers (Supplementary Fig. 14). To systematically investigate the effect of this 3-fold symmetry on the energy landscape, we calculated the total energy for twist angles ranging from 0 to 60 degrees (Supplementary Information Section 2). For these calculations, we constructed a superstructure of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF, where each layer is composed of 37 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 14A). Given the exceedingly large number of atoms, performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations was infeasible. Therefore, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) to evaluate the energy at specific twist angles, following a previously established approach31. The bilayer MOF was generated by rotating one layer around the central metal cluster at a given twist angle (Supplementary Fig. 14). Figure 3E presents the total energy of the twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF as a function of the twist angle. The energy profile shows a local minimum between 10 and 15 degrees, indicating that these configurations are energetically favorable. This minimum aligns well with our experimental TEM observations, where bilayers with twist angles around 11 degrees were more frequently observed (Fig. 3D, E). This correlation suggests that while a broad range of twist angles can be experimentally realized, structural and energetic factors may contribute to the higher occurrence of bilayers with angles between 10 and 15 degrees.

We further conducted an in-depth mathematical study of moiré patterns to enhance the understanding of the structural properties in triangular lattices. Since moiré patterns arise from the superposition of two MOF layers, the patterns can be decomposed into two periodic triangular lattices (Supplementary Fig. 15). At specific twist angles, the triangular lattices within the twisted bilayer MOF strictly aligned, creating a periodic superlattice referred to as a commensurate superlattice (Supplementary Fig. 16)38,46. Through mathematical derivation, we investigated the correlation between twist angle and aperiodicity/periodicity (see Supplementary Information Section 3 for the detailed procedure). The commensuration occurs when twist angle θ satisfies,

where m and n are coprime integers and \({|m}-{n|}\) mod 3 ≠ 0 (Supplementary Fig. 17). The mathematical relationship is analogous to that of twisted bilayer graphene38,46,47, despite differences in the lattice structure and symmetry (the triangular lattice with 3-fold symmetry for Zr-MOFs and the hexagonal lattice with 6-fold symmetry for graphene), as the formulation is based on the projected image rather than the intrinsic symmetry of the individual layers (Supplementary Fig. 18). Although the MOF layer intrinsically exhibits 3-fold symmetry, the moiré patterns in TEM images appear to have 6-fold symmetry. This apparent symmetry arises from the projection effects of overlapping triangular lattices, making the moiré patterns appear mirror-symmetric around θ = 30° in TEM observations. The moiré patterns can also be characterized by the moiré period (λ), which represents the distance between successive repetitions of the interference pattern (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs. 19–21). Due to the six-fold symmetry of the triangular lattice, the moiré patterns are mirror-symmetric around θ = 30°. In the range of 0 to 30 degrees, the moiré period is determined by

where aMOF is the lattice constant of MOFs (corresponding to the inter-cluster distance; 1.7, 1.9, and 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC). Note that the lattice constants of Zr-MOFs differ significantly from that of graphene (0.246 nm), ranging from 85.5 to 88.3% for Zr-NDC to Zr-AZDC. The λ diverges in incommensurate angles. As the twist angle increases, the moiré period decreases, also corroborated by all TEM data of Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 10–12. Supplementary Figs. 19–21 and Supplementary Table 2 present the relationship between commensurate twist angle (θ) and moiré period (λ) for the three MOFs. Consequently, the moiré pattern with a twist angle of 30 degrees corresponds to an aperiodic structure as this angle cannot be expressed by defined criteria involving m and n (Supplementary Figs. 19–21).

Through mathematical derivation, we established that twisted bilayer MOFs with a twist angle of 30 degrees exhibit an aperiodic structure, which lacks translational symmetry but possesses twelve-fold rotational symmetry. The agreement between calculated and observed FFT patterns and TEM images strongly indicated the dodecagonal quasiperiodic structures of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC (Supplementary Figs. 10–12, 22). To map the quasiperiodic pattern of the MOFs without gaps or overlaps, we employed the Stampfli-tiling, composed of triangles, squares, and rhombuses. The Stampfli tile exhibits a fractal structure with self-similarity, where the same pattern repeats on larger scales with an irrational scaling factor of \(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\) (Fig. 4)37,48. When comparing the model structures of the tiles, representing the 3rd inflation in the fractal structure, with the corresponding regions in the TEM image of Zr-BPDC, significant alignment was observed (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the TEM images in Fig. 5D clearly showed triangle, square, and rhombus tiles with increasing edge lengths of 6.13, 6.85, and 7.57 nm within the isoreticular series of MOFs. This observation demonstrates successful control over the length scale of the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern.

Self-similarity of Stampfli-tiling with an irrational scaling factor of \(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\)37,48. The length of tiles in 1st inflation (l1) can be approximated as \({a}_{{MOF}}\bullet \cos 15^\circ\), where \({a}_{{MOF}}\) is 1.7, 1.9, 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC.

C Building blocks of the Stampfli tile (3rd inflation). The TEM images were extracted from the TEM image of a representative Zr-BPDC. D TEM images of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC mapped to Stampfli tiles (3rd inflation) of different sizes (scale bar, 10 nm).

We demonstrate that quasiperiodic moiré patterns in isoreticular MOFs can be systematically tuned in their characteristic length scales through rational ligand design. Compared to conventional quasicrystals, MOFs offer the advantage of tunable structures, enabling systematic modulation of the length scale in Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, with edge lengths of 6.13, 6.85, and 7.57 nm, respectively, corresponding to the size of the Stampfli tiles at the 3rd inflation. It is important to note that the observed patterns represent projections of interlayer arrangements rather than intrinsic quasicrystals and are better described as aperiodic composite structures or modulated structures. By employing mathematical derivation, we confirmed the aperiodicity of these patterns, which facilitates systematic investigation of their size-dependent properties and physical behaviors.

This study explores the formation of quasiperiodic patterns using highly ordered MOFs. While inspired by graphene studies34,37, chemical tunability and structural diversity of MOFs offer several distinct advantages in the control of quasiperiodic patterns. 1) Length-scale control via ligand design: One fundamental difference is that in our MOF system, the length scale of the quasiperiodic pattern can be systematically controlled by varying the organic ligands, as demonstrated in this study. This tunability provides an additional degree of control that is not inherently available in twisted bilayer graphene with a fixed atomic lattice. 2) Diverse quasiperiodic patterns: Another key distinction is the structural diversity. By utilizing different MOF topologies, it is possible to achieve not only dodecagonal quasiperiodic patterns but also other quasiperiodic tiling, such as octagonal quasiperiodic patterns (Fig. 6, Supplementary Figs. 23, 24). 3) Chemical tunability and interlayer interaction control: The introduction of functional groups into organic ligands can potentially regulate interlayer distance and interactions, thereby influencing the formation and stability of moiré patterns. This level of control is significantly more challenging in graphene, where interlayer interactions are largely dictated by van der Waals forces, rather than by direct chemical modification. The tunability of MOFs in terms of length scale, topology, and chemical functionality differentiates them as a platform for designing quasiperiodic patterns. We believe these distinctions broaden the scope of quasiperiodic material research and create opportunities for functional material design.

Dodecagonal and octagonal quasiperiodic patterns demonstrated by twisted bilayer MOFs with hxl, kgd (with a twist angle of 30 degrees), and sql, sql-b topologies (with a twist angle of 45 degrees), respectively. See also Supplementary Figs. 23, 24.

We anticipate the development of synthetic strategies for the intentional design of specific twist angles in bilayer MOFs, drawing inspiration from advancements in twisted bilayer graphene, where techniques such as epitaxial growth on SiC49, folding of single layers50, chemical vapor deposition51, and dynamically rotatable monolayers52 have enabled precise angle control. Such progress would allow for a more systematic exploration of structure-property relationships and facilitate fine-tuning of interlayer coupling effects. As demonstrated in twistronics, controlled twist angles in layered materials have led to breakthroughs in electrical, magnetic, and optical properties52,53, highlighting bilayer MOFs as promising candidates for future twistronic applications.

Zr-NDC was synthesized by modifying the previously reported synthesis procedure. H2NDC (17.3 mg, 0.08 mmol), ZrOCl2·8H2O (78.0 mg, 0.24 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1 mL), and formic acid (250 µL) were combined in a vial. After sonication for 5 min, the solution was transferred in a 10 mL ampule (Diameter: 19 mm, Height: 107 mm). To remove O2 with a Schlenk line, the solution was evacuated and frozen by backfilling with N2 gas to replace the vacuumed air. The cycle was repeated three times to ensure an O2-free atmosphere before sealing the ampule with a flaming torch. The ampule was heated at 120 °C for 48 h and cooled to 30 °C for 12 h. White crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (5 mL) and sonicated for 5 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors.

In the synthesis of hxl Zr-NDC, using 250 µL of formic acid sometimes resulted in the presence of both the Zr12-formate cluster and the hxl Zr-NDC MOF, across different synthesis attempts, as confirmed by PXRD pattern (Supplementary Fig. 8). While 250 µL of formic acid was employed for characterization techniques such as TEM, SEM, and AFM, all samples analyzed were confirmed as pure-phase hxl Zr-NDC by PXRD analysis. Upon reducing the formic acid to 190 µL, we consistently synthesized pure-phase hxl Zr-NDC with good reliability (Supplementary Fig. 8). The four samples synthesized with 190 µL of formic acid were used for the adsorption study.

Zr-BPDC was synthesized by modifying the previously reported synthesis procedure41. H2BPDC (72.6 mg, 0.3 mmol), ZrCl4 (69.9 mg, 0.3 mmol), DMF (4 mL), formic acid (1 mL), and H2O (200 µL) were combined in a 10 mL vial. The solution was sonicated for 5 min and transferred to a 30 mL PTFE-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 24 h and cooled to 30 °C for 2 h. White crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (5 mL) and sonicated for 5 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors.

H2AZDC (40.5 mg, 0.15 mmol), ZrCl4 (35.0 mg, 0.15 mmol), DMF (2 mL), formic acid (0.5 mL), and H2O (30 µL) were combined in a 10 mL vial. The solution was sonicated for 5 min and transferred to a 30 mL PTFE-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 24 h and cooled to 30 °C for 2 h. Orange crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (10 mL) and sonicated for 10 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors.

Laboratory PXRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D2 phaser diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å) using a step size of 0.02° in 2θ and a scan speed of 0.1° s−1. The tube voltage and current were 30 kV and 10 mA. The DMF-washed sample was directly used for PXRD analysis. Detailed DMF washing procedures can be found in Synthesis section.

Synchrotron PXRD data were collected at the 6D beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The DMF-washed samples were ground with a mortar for 2 min and then packed into a 0.3 mm capillary. The synchrotron PXRD measurements were performed at 298 K using a Rayonix Ms225-HS detector with an X-ray wavelength of 0.65303 Å (18.986 keV).

High-resolution TEM images were acquired on JEM-2100 and JEM-2100F microscopes (JEOL Company) operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV of the UCRF. For sample preparation procedures, see Methods section. TEM imaging and Fourier-filter were performed using Gatan Digital Micrograph software (version 3.5). We applied an array filter to precisely select individual diffraction peaks in the FFT, including both first and higher-order peaks. Simulations of TEM images and electron diffraction pattern were performed with VESTA54 and multi-phase simulation in SingleCrystal 4 software, respectively55,56. The simulated electron diffraction pattern was constructed by superimposing the diffraction pattern of a MOF monolayer along the [001] zone axis.

For Zr-NDC, the supernatant was removed from 100 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 5 times) and subsequently sonicated for 4 h. For Zr-BPDC, the supernatant was removed from 50 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 2 h. For Zr-AZDC, the supernatant was removed from 150 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 4 h.

SEM images were obtained on SU8220 Cold FE-SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies) of the UCRF. The accelerating voltage and beam current are 10 kV and 10 µA, respectively. Samples for SEM were prepared by drop-casting a dilute suspension of Zr-MOFs prepared by sonication in EA onto the silicon wafer and Pt-coating using a Hitachi sputter.

For SEM analysis, the supernatant was removed from the DMF-washed sample by centrifugation (50 µL for Zr-NDC and Zr-BPDC, 100 µL for Zr-AZDC). The MOF powder was then washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 2 h.

AFM images were collected on a Bruker Dimension ICON instrument of the UCRF with ScanAsyst mode. Samples for AFM were prepared by drop-casting a dilute suspension of Zr-MOFs prepared by sonication in EA onto the silicon wafer.

For Zr-NDC and Zr-BPDC, 50 µL of the DMF-washed sample was centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The MOF powder was then washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 3 times) and sonicated for 2 h. For Zr-AZDC, the supernatant was removed from 100 µL of the DMF-washed sample by centrifugation. Followed by washing with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and sonication for 4 h.

Nitrogen isotherms were obtained at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. For the sorption analysis, several vials (or ampules) of Zr-MOFs were synthesized, washed with DMF (following the procedure mentioned above for each vial), and subsequently washed with EA (total 40 mL X 3 times) by gathering all samples. After sonicating for 2 h, the samples were activated at 120 °C for 12 h under a dynamic vacuum in the sorption instrument.

Based on the cell parameters calculated from PXRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. 6), we modeled Zr-BPDC structure with a space group of P63/mmc (a = 18.9140 Å and c = 24.4884 Å) using Materials Studio57. Since peaks corresponding to the (hk0) plane exclusively appeared in the PXRD patterns, the c parameter was adopted from the previously reported Hf-BPDC structure40. The space group changed to P63/m when zigzag ligands were employed (Zr-NDC: a = 16.6970 Å and c = 24.4884 Å, Zr-AZDC: a = 20.7846 Å and c = 24.4884 Å), which is also consistent with structure reported using another zigzag ligand42.

To optimize the model structures, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The exchange-correlation functional was treated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The plane-wave basis set was employed with an energy cutoff of 500 eV. Electronic self-consistency was achieved with a convergence criterion of 10−5 eV, while the forces on ions were converged to within 0.03 eV Å−1. To include van der Waals interactions, the DFT-D3 method with Becke-Johnson damping was applied. The final unit cell parameters of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC models were determined by Pawley fitting using the synchrotron PXRD data (see Fig. 2D).

I don't own a TV. That's right, I'm a professional tech reviewer, and I'm still living like a millennial in my twenties. But a smart monitor—now, there's something I could justify. A computer monitor is useless without a PC plugged into it, but that's where smart monitors come in, offering a more versatile screen that is as much for work as it is for entertainment.

Not until now have these smart monitors felt like proper TV replacements in terms of quality. The latest model from Samsung, the Smart Monitor M9 M90SF, closes the gap by offering a 4K OLED panel with a 120-Hz refresh rate. It ain't cheap, but for the first time, you won't miss your TV.

The M90SF is a gorgeous monitor. It doesn't pretend to resemble a television physically like some other smart monitors cheekily do, but instead embraces its role as a monitor, first and foremost. That's why the setup will be very familiar. The wide stand clicks into the back of the monitor with a standard VESA mount and then gets screwed into the base.

Unlike cheaper monitors in Samsung's lineup, the M90SF has a wide, robust stand. It has a large base, a bit like an iMac, except that the stand can be removed from the screen so it can be VESA mounted. The monitor lacks swivel, so you can't rotate it from left to right. Fortunately, it has full tilting capability, meaning it can be rotated fully into a vertical monitor. It also has a decent amount of height adjustment. That's important for a screen that's supposed to double as a TV.

Once you set it up, there are a few oddities about the M90SF, especially if you've never used a smart monitor before. First off, you'll need to create a Samsung account if you don't already have one. Annoyingly, this is required just to get into your streaming apps. The Tizen interface for accessing apps is convenient and easy to use, all controlled via the included Samsung Universal remote.

Again, that's identical to what comes with Samsung TVs, and it's a big part of what makes the Smart Monitor M9 M90SF work so well as a TV replacement. When you're lounging back on the couch with the remote, you might forget it's actually a monitor. It even comes with an assortment of free local TV, breaking news, sports, and kids channels with your Samsung TV Plus account, which was a pleasant surprise.

The PC controls on the monitor itself, however, are frustrating. It's controlled with a four-way joystick, along with a power button. It's surprisingly difficult to access important settings like volume and brightness, and I couldn't even find an easy way to exit out of the menu without using the remote.

On the back, you'll find a few necessary ports, though nothing too extensive. It comes with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, two downstream USB-A 2.0 ports, and a USB-C port with 90 watts of power delivery. It's not packed full of USB ports, nor does it have ports that creators might need, like an SD card slot or Ethernet jack. It's even a few years behind in wireless connectivity, using Wi-Fi 5 instead of Wi-Fi 7 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.

The M90SF is the first smart monitor to include an OLED panel. That's its calling card. In fact, alongside the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends), it's among the first nongaming monitors to adopt OLED. That's not to say you can't play games on this display. It even has a 120-Hz refresh rate. But it's significant in that we're finally getting OLED displays designed for tasks other than gaming.

The Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED is aimed more at creators, while this is designed for entertainment. And wow, shows and movies look incredible on this monitor. Even though this uses the same QD-OLED panel as gaming monitors (like Samsung's Odyssey displays), image quality is better when using these streaming apps as compared to watching in a browser.

I measured a max of 980 nits of peak brightness in a 1 percent window and 850 nits in a 4 percent window, coming close to hitting Samsung's claim of 1,000 nits. That's nowhere near the 2,000 nits (or more) you can get on a large OLED television, but for the current crop of OLED monitors, it's plenty bright. It's a huge upgrade over a typical IPS monitor when it comes to watching movies.

As usual with OLED monitors, it's not terribly bright in the standard definition range (SDR). I measured it at only 233 nits of max brightness. That's dimmer than a high-quality LED or Mini-LED monitor, which can sometimes get up to 400 or 500 nits. You may wish that it were brighter if you're in a brightly lit room.

Colors, however, are fantastic, covering 91 percent of AdobeRGB and 98 percent of P3. I would calibrate this screen if you intend to use it for serious color grading. The colors weren't as accurate as I've seen in other OLED monitors, especially in the default color tone mode, “Warm1.” Switching to the “Standard” mode helped slightly, bringing the Delta-E down to 1.86. I would have liked to see the color accuracy higher, though, especially since OLED monitors are great for content creators.

Speaking of which, I wasn't able to access HDR when connected to a MacBook at all, which happens to be a popular option for those aforementioned content creators. I also encountered a frustrating bug in macOS that automatically fast-forwarded through every video, whether it was Netflix or YouTube. Fortunately, none of those problems occurred in Windows.

At its original price of $1,600, it's insanely expensive. It's $800 more expensive than the M8 M80F, another 32-inch 4K smart monitor with many of the same features. Inevitable discounts will make it easier to stomach, and I do not recommend buying the M90SF at full price.

You're still paying a few hundred dollars more than the Samsung Odyssey G8, which is also a 4K 32-inch OLED monitor and has a faster 240-Hz refresh rate. If you're unsure if you will actually consistently use those extra features, you're better off saving your money by buying either the Dell 32 Plus QD-OLED or one of the many good OLED gaming monitors out there. Heck, you can buy a pretty incredible TV for that cash.

You're paying more for those smart features and the ability to stream without being connected to a PC. There's more than that, like the impressive pair of speakers onboard and a nice 12-megapixel webcam. Those aren't things you'll find on your average gaming monitor. So, for the right person—which just happens to be a person like me—all that is worth an extra premium.

Astronomers have identified what could be a new supermassive black hole, and with an estimated mass 36 billion times that of the sun, it has about 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. This would make it among the most massive objects ever detected.

The finding, published in the Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, was made by researchers from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in the UK in collaboration with the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil. The scientists located the signs of the new supermassive black hole within a gravitational lens known as the “Cosmic Horseshoe,” pictured below. A gravitational lens occurs when the gravity of a massive object, such as a galaxy, is so great that it bends light and time that passes near it, distorting light traveling from behind.

The Cosmic Horsehoe was discovered by the Hubble telescope in 2007. The galaxy LRG 3-757 sits at its center, while the blue horseshoe shape surrounding this yellow-colored object is distorted light emitted from another galaxy beyond it. LRG 3-757 is one of the most massive galaxies ever observed by astronomers, having a mass 100 times that of the Milky Way, and it sits approximately 5.6 billion light-years away from Earth.

The gravitational lens known as the Cosmic Horseshoe, so named because of the appearance of the incomplete ring of blue light that surrounds its central galaxy, LRG 3-757.

Thanks to this luminous structure, astronomers have been able to calculate the mass of the black hole that presumably lies at the center of LRG 3-757 (while not definitively proven, large galaxies are assumed to have a black hole at their center). Although there are no direct observations of this black hole, measurements of the motion of light in the ring and the velocity of stars in the inner regions of the galaxy are consistent with the presence of an ultramassive black hole. “By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real,” Thomas Collett, professor of astrophysics at the University of Portsmouth, said in a press statement.

Collett also suggests that a black hole of such proportions could only originate from the merger of two supermassive black holes resulting from the collision of galaxies. Astronomers are still debating whether this will be the shared fate of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and neighboring Andromeda.

Any astronomy enthusiast knows that the most massive object found in the universe so far is potentially TON 618. According to the most widespread estimates, this black hole has a mass equivalent to 66 billion suns, almost twice that of the Cosmic Horseshoe.

However, scientists are cautious about labelling TON 618 as the most massive object ever seen. Being located more than 10 billion light-years away, its host galaxy and surrounding objects cannot be observed in detail. What little is known about it comes from analysis of its brightness and from theoretical models that allow us to estimate its size. The uncertainty is too high to consider it the most massive black hole known.

In contrast, the Portsmouth researchers argue that the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole offers greater observational certainty, unlike distant, almost mythological holes like TON 618. As such, they claim that their discovery could represent the most massive black hole confirmed to date.

I have always loved the idea of the Fairphone. A fair-trade, repairable smartphone designed to be used for a long time, shedding the notion of upgrading every year or two. The idea makes it more environmentally friendly than every other phone. The goal is admirable, but the company's hardware always fell short in a few ways. The Fairphone 5, for example, had a mediocre camera and so-so performance.

I've now been using The Fairphone (Gen. 6) for two weeks, and I don't feel like the phone is severely lacking in a specific department. Could the camera be better? Sure, but many of the images in my photo library from my test period are perfectly serviceable. The biggest downside is that the company still isn't selling the phone officially in the US, though you can import it. US carrier support is spotty—it should be fine on T-Mobile and its mobile virtual network providers (I tested it on Google Fi without problems)—but you will likely face issues on AT&T and Verizon.

Find the idea of an ethical smartphone that runs Google's Android operating system perplexing? You'll be happy to know that you can buy the Fairphone (Gen. 6) with Murena's deGoogled /e/OS operating system (which we reviewed positively here). I didn't test this version, which costs an alarming $899, but the Fairphone is an investment, considering you'll be able to replace several components of the device throughout its life.

The Fairphone (Gen. 6) continues the tradition of scoring a perfect 10 on iFixit's repairability scale like its predecessors, a rating no other smartphone has achieved. It comes with a screwdriver, and there are 12 easy-to-replace parts, from the battery and screen to the camera and USB port. You also get a five-year warranty, and Fairphone promises at least seven Android OS upgrades and eight years of total software support (it launched with Android 15).

I wasn't worried about repairability, but I did hold this review because I wanted to see how the company handled software updates. I've been dealing with a display refresh rate issue, where at certain times, the screen's refresh rate would ratchet well below 120 Hz, making the phone feel choppy and slow. A restart was an easy but annoying solution. Thankfully, the company identified this bug early and delivered a patch on August 11. It's not completely resolved, but it's definitely better. (There's a healthy community forum!)

I've run into two other problems intermittently. Twice, the phone froze, and I had to force a restart to fix it (I haven't seen this issue since the update). Second, the auto-brightness feature always makes the screen too dim, so I was constantly fussing with the brightness slider. (This could just be my need to have the screen at what my wife calls “blinding” brightness levels.)

Outside of this, performance has been great, with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 launching apps quickly, and showing no signs of slowdown when juggling through them. Lightweight games like Pako Forever didn't give the phone any trouble either. I only wish it came with 16 GB of RAM instead of 8 GB for future-proofing, considering that the many new artificial intelligence features seem to suck up memory. (Google's Gemini is the default assistant here.)

Battery life has also been reliable. The 4,415-mAh cell has generally lasted me a full day, even with hours and hours of doomscrolling through Instagram Reels. On heavier days, I've found myself at 20 percent by bedtime, and if I use navigation a lot and music streaming via Android Auto, I have needed a top-up. But with average use, you can comfortably use this phone for a day and a half on a single charge.

I like the 6.31-inch size, and the OLED panel has been sufficiently bright on some sunny days in New York and San Francisco. I don't love the power button. It sits flush with the side of the phone and doubles as a fingerprint sensor, but it's not satisfying to press at all. There's a nicer, neon yellow button above it, but I'll get to that in a minute.

There's not much to complain about on the spec front. It's rare to see 256 GB of storage included at this price, not to mention a microSD card slot, so you can expand storage if needed. It has Gorilla Glass 7i on the front, no glass on the back for better durability. And there's NFC for tap-to-pay, which I've been liberally using at my neighborhood deli. The phone is only IP55-rated for dust and water resistance, par for the course for devices that sport replaceable batteries. That means it's fine in the rain, but you should keep it away from bodies of water.

Fairphone doesn't want to be known only as that repairable phone brand, which is why the Gen. 6 has some new tricks up its sleeve. That bright yellow button? Flick it down, and the phone turns into a distraction-free handset. It triggers “Fairphone Moments,” which are modes you can create and customize to lock down your smartphone from distractions.

By default, the Essentials mode presents a minimal interface with just a few apps (Camera, Chrome, Maps, Messages, and Phone), and only allows notifications from starred contacts. You cannot go back to your normal Android experience without flipping the switch. That might not be a huge deterrent if your goal is to limit screen time, but it's a way to block out distractions. You can create modes tailored for driving, your morning routine, and more. Don't care for Fairphone Moments? You can set the button to trigger another action, like the flashlight or Do Not Disturb.

The other standout feature on the Gen. 6? Modular accessories. Instead of going with a magnetic system like Apple's MagSafe, Fairphone is taking a page from Nothing's CMF brand with accessories that you screw into the back of the phone. A portion of the back panel is removable, and you can swap it out for a fingerloop (my favorite), a lanyard, or a card holder. This is why there's no wireless charging, though it'd be cool if there were an accessory that enabled it.

Finally, the camera system. It's a 50-megapixel primary shooter paired with a 13-MP ultrawide and 32-MP selfie camera. You can expect sharp images, even in mixed lighting scenarios, though the prevailing issue is how the phone renders colors. In high-contrast scenes, colors can look flat, or the white balance doesn't do its job, and you end up with weird tints. The blue sky is an odd hue sometimes, or the sunset isn't as yellow as it should be. The details are largely there, it's just these quirks of processing. 4K video footage is fine and usable, though not quite the quality you'll get from a proper flagship phone.

Frankly, the camera system is better than I expected. No, it won't beat the $500 Google Pixel 9a, but I still happily shared photos with friends and family and on social media as usual. Ultimately, it's not about price. If it were, then even a $400 Moto G Stylus 5G would impress.

The Fairphone (Gen. 6) is made with more than 50 percent fair or recycled materials, an 8 percent improvement over its predecessor. The company believes it'll achieve its lowest carbon emissions thanks to improvements in manufacturing and assembly. A total of 14 materials are considered fair mined or recycled, including cobalt, and the plastic is 93 percent postconsumer recycled.

Fairphone also partners with organizations like The Fair Cobalt Alliance to ensure responsible mining practices, and workers at three of its suppliers and its final assembly factory are in a Living Wage Bonus program, where the company pays the gap between minimum wage and a living wage. It's also a Certified B Corp. If you believe in all of those practices, there's just no other phone like the Fairphone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","James Talarico Is on the Run","https://www.wired.com/story/james-talarico-texas-democrats-gerrymandering/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Somewhere in Illinois, shuttling between undisclosed locations, Texas state representative James Talarico is on a work-cation from hell.

He's trying to keep up with constituent services while running out the clock on a special session in the Texas legislature. He's also running out of clean clothes, and can't say much about his whereabouts or the security threats against him and more than 50 of his colleagues.

Technically, he's on the lam—a 19th century slang term for leaving a location quickly, and a favorite among old-school editors—as he and his party look to thwart Texas Republicans from enacting an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting plan. If successful, Texas Republicans would be able to take as many as five seats away from the Democrats in Congress by gerrymandering their districts well before the 2030 Census. This mid-decade gerrymandering could be met by an equal reaction from California, Illinois and New York, all large blue states with several Republican-held seats.

In response, and in order to block the new map from being implemented, Democratic representatives from Texas fled the state. Their goal is to break quorum in the legislature to prevent a vote on the new map before the end of the special session on August 19.

The situation has continued to escalate: Texas governor Greg Abbott threatened the lawmakers with $500 daily fines, Republicans in the legislature put out civil arrest warrants, and President Donald Trump said the FBI “may have to” get involved in the search.

The Democrats will reportedly return to the state before a separate, second special session, according to KTRK, a local ABC News affiliate in Texas. It would effectively force the Republicans to start over again which would accomplish the goal of tabling the new map while allowing them to push for other initiatives such as flood relief. The timing of the second special session is currently unknown.

Talarico, who lives alone, left his home last week for a charter flight out of Austin. With only a small bag of clothes, Talarico says he didn't even know where he was heading until he got on the plane.

We spoke with Talarico about where things go from here, how bad it could get, and whether Republicans might be overplaying their hand with this unprecedented maneuver.

This interview has been lightly edited for style and clarity.

WIRED: What was happening when you knew you might have to actually leave the state? What was going through your mind?

James Talarico: When the first reporting came out that they may try this mid-decade redistricting power grab, I knew it was going to be a possibility, but I didn't know that we had the numbers and were ready to go until about 24 hours ahead of time.

And that's how much time I had to get my bags packed and arrangements made and all that. I didn't even know where we were going, but I was told the meetup location, which was a union hall in Austin, not too far from the capitol. And then from there we went to the airport, and it wasn't until I got on the plane that I figured that we were going to Illinois.

Could you walk me through what your average day has been looking like since you and your fellow Democrats left the state?

Well, the days have been nonstop. Early mornings, late evenings—doing a lot of interviews because we're trying to shine a national spotlight on this redistricting power grab in Texas and why it is critical, not just for Democrats, but independents and Republicans too, in order to protect their voices in the democratic process across this country.

But we also have constituent services to attend to just like normal. And so in between these interviews, I'm ensuring that my constituents have what they need. If they've got to get ahold of Medicaid, or they have a problem with a state agency, or there's a pothole in the neighborhood, I've got to still handle those issues.

We're all here together in the same hotels. We're keeping our spirits up. We're eating our meals together in the conference room.

How do you pack for going on the lam indefinitely?

My dad has this big duffel bag, and so I borrowed his, and it has his little tag with his name on it instead of mine. I think I brought seven dress shirts. I brought one jacket, jeans, T-shirts, and shorts, too. I've basically run through all those clothes at this point, so I'm going to need to do laundry today at the hotel. All my clothes that I've got now are officially dirty, and I need to try to spend time at some point today to wash some of these shirts.

In what could be a really historic moment, do you feel any pressure?

I knew that it was a dramatic step. It's one we didn't take lightly because it comes with a lot of personal, financial, legal, and political costs. But I knew it was important and it had consequences to the whole country. If Trump was able to escape accountability in the midterms, I think that would have dire consequences for the future of our representative democracy.

And the threat to have the FBI come and arrest you guys, does that being on the table worry you at all?

All the threats against duly elected law-abiding state legislators have been alarming—it should be alarming to all of us. Quorum breaking is a right that we have as the minority in our state constitution. There's about 150 years of history of us breaking quorum in Texas.

So listen, we're not breaking the law. We're not doing anything wrong or illegal. The fact that Trump would threaten to send in the FBI, Greg Abbott would threaten to remove us from office, Ken Paxton would ask his followers to hunt us down—all for doing our jobs and using a legitimate constitutional legislative tactic to stop a massive power grab—is unsettling, to say the least.

What is your level of concern in terms of where this goes, and if this could escalate to something akin to a cold civil war?

I think we need leadership at this moment more than we've ever needed it before. And the president is very proud of the peace deal he worked out [between Armenia and Azerbaijan], and I hope that he can take that same attitude here and help us work out a peace deal between these red states and these blue states. But instead, he's the one instigating the conflict by trying to steal these five seats in the middle of a decade. And if they are intent on cheating like this, then the other side will respond. And if one side cheats, then all bets are off.

We can't let the bullies win. We have to stand up to 'em, look 'em right in the eye and not flinch.

How much do you blame Trump compared to Republicans in your state?

I mean, I put most of the blame on my colleagues, including Governor Abbott back in Texas. Donald Trump, I'm sure, asks for all kinds of crazy things on a whim, but it's incumbent upon the adults around him to stand up to him and speak truth to power. And those Republicans back in Texas, my colleagues, know that this is bad precedent. They know it's unpopular politically, and so I don't think they wanted to do this. But they don't have the courage to stand up to President Trump.

Do you think there's a chance this could backfire on Republicans by stretching their seats too thin, to the point where Democrats could get some surprising wins?

It's possible. Gerrymandering is when politicians draw their own lines to benefit themselves and their party. Dummymandering is when one party gets too greedy, and they cut their districts a little too thin and end up losing seats.

Politicians shouldn't be choosing their voters. Voters should be choosing their politicians. But we got some polling data that just came out today showing that this is deeply unpopular among Texans, even among Trump voters. No one likes a cheater. We don't like cheaters in our personal lives. We don't like cheaters in sports. We don't like cheaters in politics. If you think your policies are more popular, then campaign on those policies and win the election, beat us on the field. But this attempt to rig the game before it starts, I think is unpopular across the political spectrum.

Sure, there's plenty of money to be made during the second Trump administration for big tech.

Yet with a data report exclusively obtained by WIRED, the scale of the industry's lucky break with a Trump victory is becoming a little more clear. It's not just legislation and executive action helping these companies out. In fact, sometimes, doing nothing is the best thing for an industry under the federal regulatory microscope.

In the first six months of Trump 2.0, the administration has either paused or withdrawn a third of the targeted investigations into tech corporations, according to new findings from Public Citizen, appearing for the first time in this edition of Inner Loop.

Among the key findings:

Sometimes it pays to have friends in high places. Other times, it pays even more to be an industry proving extremely profitable to the president's family and the cashout option of choice in Trumpworld. For all the favors an industry could ask for in Washington, the new administration doing nothing can sometimes be the most valuable of all.

“Here we go” is both the first line of the 2025 Amazon Prime movie War of the Worlds and exactly what I said when I chose to watch it after the shitstorm of reviews that warned me not to.

Directed by Rich Lee and shot exclusively through online calls and surveillance feed POVs, War of the Worlds centers around domestic terror analyst William Radford, played by Ice Cube, who is on a mission to save his family and the country from alien cyborgs who are dead set on eating our data. Literally.

At first glance, the film's 3 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes—up from 0 percent when it debuted—seems both impressive and predictable. While getting a rating below 5 percent seems like a difficult feat, remaking a classic (1953's The War of the Worlds has 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), is going to set some pretty high standards. Top that with setting an action film through the lens of Microsoft Teams meetings and poor CGI, and you're bound to make even the most tolerant viewer roll their eyes.

But graphics and clearance issues aside (I mean seriously, what was with all of the blurred out faces?), the tech-based plot holes that bordered on propaganda took away from the film's message on the importance of human connection. The most jarring examples are the inconsistencies of technological availability after the data-hungry aliens take out Earth's satellites. Military weapons, vehicle GPS systems, and Facebook page outages wreak physical and emotional havoc across the world, but somehow news networks, Starlink satellites, X feeds, and Amazon purchase access remain unscathed just a few scenes later with little to no explanation. Radford's office is locked when he tries to leave to save his daughter but is somehow open when he has to hack the data servers in the basement—after the building is put on an additional, air-sealed lockdown. Most ridiculously, a Prime Air drone is able to dodge through apocalyptic levels of destruction and mayhem to deliver a world-saving thumb drive to the DHS building.

The shameless promotion of tech brands doesn't end there. Radford's daughter, Faith, a Georgetown-educated biochemist, somehow has the bright idea of removing a large chunk of debris from her leg—causing near-fatal bleeding. Thankfully, Mark Goodman, her Amazon delivery driver boyfriend, is able to make a tourniquet out of packaging tape because, according to him, he's a “pro.” Even minor characters get caught up in the Amazon Savior motif. When the world-saving Amazon Prime Air drone overturns on the way to the DHS building, a houseless person only helps to fix it after being rewarded with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.

These scenes in War of the Worlds would have been just outrageous enough to be chalked up to comedy if it wasn't for the film's heightened focus on government surveillance without any mention of the tech industry's role in all this. From Anonymous-style livestreams featuring the US constitution to Radford digitally stalking his children to the secret data-stealing project that beacons the aliens to Earth, the true enemy is clear: the US government and its technology. In fact, the only time privacy is threatened as it relates to private businesses is when the government interferes with it. For example, Radford uses Guardian, the government's surveillance software system, to hack into a Tesla and remotely take his hurt daughter to a safer location. In the beginning of the film, David, Radford's son, insults his father by saying his career consists of nothing more than spying on people's Amazon shopping carts. Most importantly, the secret government program Goliath, which is the ultimate reason why the alien cyborgs invaded, siphons billions of dollars' worth of private data conversations from the American people. There is zero mention of tech juggernauts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk being linked to controversial data collection processes, from failing to protect personal data to staging a full-blown digital coup in the US government. Hardly surprising, considering it's an Amazon movie, but it still feels like a glaring omission.

If I had to say something nice about War of the Worlds, Lee took a risk remaking a beloved thriller through an internet-first POV. While risks can pay off—this didn't. The decision to demonize government surveillance while making Big Tech the passive victims ultimately waters down the film's message—making it more of a near-90-minute commercial for brands like Amazon and Microsoft than food for thought. But hey, maybe all this promo means Prime Air will finally be available in Washington, DC, at least.

First, it was mushrooms in your coffee. Then protein in your soda. The latest wellness staple sneaking into your pantry is creatine. In the days of yore, creatine supplements were a muscle-bro staple, relegated to the lockers of collegiate linebackers and bodybuilders. Lately, it has muscled its way into Pilates studios, gym girlies' TikToks, and longevity wellness retreats.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

“Creatine has been gaining popularity among women across different age groups,” says Gretchen Zimmermann, a registered dietitian. “We do see women who are lifting heavier, and there used to be this thing that was circulating a decade or two ago, where women thought that if they lifted heavy, they would get bulked up. Now we know that's not true, and naturally there's some interest in creatine for that reason.”

But what is creatine? Here's everything you need to know.

Creatine is a compound your body produces in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas, according to Federica Amati, a medical scientist and registered public health nutritionist. Most of it ends up in your skeletal muscles, where it's stored as phosphocreatine and used to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that powers muscle contractions, nerve signals, and protein synthesis for tissue repair. The rest—less than 5 percent—is found in brain tissue and the testes.

You make about a gram of creatine a day from three amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine. You also get more from animal-based foods like red meat, fish, and poultry. For most healthy people, that's enough. So, creatine supplements aren't essential for general health, but they can boost performance and recovery under the right conditions.

ATP is your cells' main energy source. High-intensity exercise drains it fast, breaking ATP down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Creatine phosphate donates a phosphate group to ADP, recycling it back into ATP almost immediately. The more phosphocreatine stored in your muscles, the faster you can regenerate ATP and the more power you can produce in short bursts.

Creatine is most useful for activities that demand short, intense effort: sprinting, weightlifting, and high-intensity interval training, to name a few. It's far less relevant for endurance sports like marathons. Some evidence suggests creatine also increases muscle glycogen storage, which could help with recovery and energy replenishment between sessions.

Creatine doesn't directly build muscle, but paired with resistance training and adequate nutrition, it can help preserve muscle strength and lean body mass. It's particularly important if you're recovering from an injury, or as you age, when sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) becomes a risk, as it activates specialized stem cells known as satellite cells. Zimmerman points out that women, especially in perimenopause and menopause, may see health benefits. “As women get older—starting in our forties—we lose body mass 1 to 2 percent a year, and that can affect bone health later on in life,” says Zimmermann. “Creatine [supplements] support keeping and building lean muscle mass.”

Zimmermann adds, “Women tend to have lower muscle mass than men, just naturally, so I think women may actually respond better to supplementation, because they're at baseline.”

While the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic performance are well-documented, its effects on mental performance are still emerging. Early findings are promising. Studies suggest it may reduce mental fatigue, especially during high-stress situations, such as sleep deprivation or exhaustive exercise. It may also improve certain aspects of memory, particularly in groups with lower baseline creatine levels, such as vegetarians and older adults.

Some preliminary research even suggests it could help with symptoms of depression by supporting brain energy and boosting the production of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. That's particularly relevant for women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, says Zimmerman. “Estrogen shifts affect brain health, our mood, brain fog, and being able to think clearly.”

Nowadays, step into any GNC and you'll find several forms of creatine: creatine hydrochloride, magnesium creatine chelate, creatine citrate, creatine nitrate, creatine ethyl ester, and buffered creatine. But creatine monohydrate is the most studied, the most effective, and usually the cheapest, according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition. No other form has shown any additional benefits, confirms Amati.

Creatine monohydrate is typically sold as a flavorless, white powder that you can mix into water or a shake. The standard dose is three to five grams per day, says Amati. Some athletes may “load” with higher doses, but studies show this offers no long-term benefits and can put unnecessary stress on the kidneys, says Amati.

For most healthy adults, creatine is a safe and well-tolerated supplement for months or even years of use. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found no significant health risks. The main side effects are minor: weight gain from temporary water retention in the first week of supplementation, bloating, and mild gastric discomfort, usually from oversize doses.

However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

Tradeoffs. The world of tech is full of them. Yet, as Forrester Research points out in a recent trends report, tradeoffs can give disruptive technologies a Jekyll and Hyde personality, providing great benefits but at the same time undermining an organization's sustainability efforts.

“Disruptive technologies are a double-edged sword for environmental sustainability, offering both crucial enablers and significant challenges,” explained the 15-page report written by Abhijit Sunil, Paul Miller, Craig Le Clair, Renee Taylor-Huot, Michele Pelino, with Amy DeMartine, Danielle Chittem, and Peter Harrison.

“On the positive side,” it continued, “technology innovations accelerate energy and resource efficiency, aid in climate adaptation and risk mitigation, monitor crucial sustainability metrics, and even help in environmental conservation.”

“However,” it added, “the necessary compute power, volume of waste, types of materials needed, and scale of implementing these technologies can offset their benefits.”

Disruptive tech can be a balancing act, noted Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst for SmartTech Research, in Las Vegas.

“These technologies can be incredible accelerators for sustainable outcomes, but without careful planning, they can quietly undermine the very goals they're meant to support,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The companies that will get this right are the ones treating sustainability as a measurable performance metric alongside revenue and productivity, and holding themselves accountable for both sides of the equation.”

“Often when a new technology like AI hits the market, it carries with it a lot of consequential damages that weren't fully anticipated,” added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.

“Not only is the technology far more damaging than anticipated,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but it also carries within it methodologies, such as AI modeling and simulation, that could massively reduce that impact, if properly used.”

6 Disruptive Technologies That Can Be Good and Bad for Environmental Sustainability

One Jekyll and Hyde disruptor identified by Forrester is automation and AI. Those technologies, the report noted, can boost sustainability through efficiency and environmental monitoring but risk increasing energy use, inefficiencies, and challenges like data security and AI unpredictability.

Forrester's Sunil maintained that efficient computing is key to sustainable AI. He cited an Nvidia study that found energy-efficient hardware, such as GPUs, can reduce energy use by as much as 10 times and decrease capital costs by six times, while increasing performance by up to 46 times.

“To meet sustainability goals with automation and AI,” he told TechNewsWorld, “one of our recommendations is to develop proofs of concept for ‘stewardship agents' and explore emerging robotics focused on sustainability.”

When planning AI operations, Franklin Manchester, a principal global industry advisor at SAS, an analytics and artificial intelligence software company in Cary, N.C., cautioned, “Not every nut needs to be cracked with a sledgehammer.”

“Start with good processes — think lean process mapping, for example — and deploy AI where it makes sense to do so,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Augment what your talented humans already do with AI tools to supplement their expertise,” he continued. “Scale modeling and cloud usage to fit your needs and streamline costs. This reduces the burden on the overall system.”

Manchester also recommended that businesses invest in boring projects. “Did you know we put a man on the moon before we thought to put wheels on luggage?” he asked. “Put wheels on luggage. You don't need a moonshot AI use case to save dollars. In the end, being strategic about where we apply AI will help reduce the burden on finite resources, promoting sustainability while also helping economize costs.”

Forrester also identified state-of-the-art data centers as double-edged sword technology. Advanced data centers boost AI efficiency with technologies like liquid cooling, heat reuse, and modular design, the report noted, but risk higher energy demand, e-waste, and reliance on scarce materials.

A sustainable data center strategy needs to be driven by investments in energy-efficient infrastructure, exploring renewable energy options like power purchase agreements and microgrids, and extending IT lifecycles through modular, repairable equipment, Forrester's Sunil maintained.

“The adoption of circular economy principles plays a big role here,” he continued. “For data center operators, this means choosing infrastructure equipment that is durable, modular, and easy to repair or upgrade, as well as planning for responsible disposal or reuse.”

Vena argued that advanced data centers can be part of the sustainability solution, but only if efficiency improvements, like liquid cooling and heat reuse, are paired with a genuine commitment to renewable energy sourcing.

“We also need better supply chain accountability for the rare materials in servers and networking gear, and stronger recycling programs for retired equipment,” he added. “The same ingenuity that's going into AI optimization should be applied to extending hardware life.”

Another disruptor in the report: autonomous mobility.

Autonomous mobility optimizes transport efficiency with drones, delivery robots, and truck platoons, but risks increased vehicle proliferation and resource strain due to reduced operational costs, the report noted.

Human drivers are a significant cost in transportation systems, and removing that cost may have unintended consequences, the report explained. If it's cheaper to build and operate a fleet of driverless delivery trucks, those trucks may proliferate on roads, consuming more resources in their construction and operation and placing more strain on highway infrastructure, which then must be maintained and upgraded.

“I think the way to reduce those risks is to ensure autonomous mobility is deployed as part of an integrated transportation plan, rather than as a stand-alone cost-cutting measure,” Vena said. “If drones, delivery robots, and truck platoons are coordinated through shared logistics networks, we can avoid unnecessary duplication of vehicles and routes.”

“Policies that encourage vehicle sharing, regulate fleet sizes, and set sustainability targets for operators can also keep proliferation in check,” he added.

“On the resource side,” he continued, “designing these vehicles for modular repair, component reuse, and eventual recycling helps minimize the material footprint. The real opportunity is in using autonomy to move fewer vehicles more intelligently, not just more vehicles more cheaply.”

The Internet of Things (IoT) is another disruptor cited in the Forrester report. The IoT improves sustainability through monitoring and optimization, it noted, but risks increasing e-waste, carbon footprints, and battery disposal challenges.

Vena asserted that the IoT industry must embrace longer product lifecycles with modular, upgradable designs. “If a device's sensors or connectivity chips can be swapped out without replacing the whole unit, that cuts down on waste,” he explained. “Standardizing charging and battery formats could also help with recycling.”

“We also need stronger manufacturer take-back programs and more aggressive use of low-power wireless standards so devices last longer on a single battery,” he added.

Sunil agreed. “A big part of addressing this would be to work around the circular economy — addressing the longevity, reparability, and reusability of devices, which are elements for the circular economy,” he said.

He added that many solutions for problems created by disruptive technology draw on this framework's emphasis on longevity, reparability, and reusability. “Considering the entire IT lifecycle is a critical aspect of making devices and infrastructure more sustainable, as most of the risks are driven by high turnover of devices and the increased need for more optimized infrastructure,” he said.

Security and application delivery giant F5 is laying off 106 employees at the company's offices in Seattle and Liberty Lake, Wash., according to a filing with the state's Employment Security Department.

Senior engineers and managers were impacted by the cuts, according to posts on LinkedIn.

A spokesperson confirmed the layoffs in a statement to GeekWire. The layoffs impacted the company's global workforce. F5 did not provide details on total number of employees affected by the cuts. 

“Today we announced changes in our product organization to better align resources with important customer needs and our highest business priorities,” the company said. “As part of these changes, selected roles were eliminated, while other employees were placed into new roles supporting strategic growth areas.”

F5 is supporting impacted employees with their transition to new roles or outside of the company.

F5 employed 6,557 employees as of Sept. 30, according to the company's annual filing. It has more than 60 offices worldwide.

The enterprise software giant topped estimates for its fiscal third quarter, with revenue up 12% to $780 million. GAAP net income was $190 million, up from $144 million.

The company's stock is up nearly 30% this year.

Two computer science students on leave from the University of Washington are building what they call the “world's most intelligent web browser,” using agentic AI to complete tasks like a personal assistant.

Pranav Madhukar and Farhan Khan are co-founders of Meteor, a browser they launched this week out of Y Combinator, the Bay Area startup accelerator where the two students are participating in the summer 2025 batch.

“Essentially, we're on a mission to kill Chrome,” Madhukar said in reference to Google's market dominating internet browser. “Or acquire it, for only $34.5 billion?” he quipped, off the news this week that AI startup Perplexity offered that much to purchase Chrome.

Perplexity, with its Comet Browser, along with Meteor and several other startups, are all vying to change the way users browse and perform myriad tasks online — with help from generative AI.

Madhukar, Meteor's CEO, believes the majority of time we spend in a browser each day is boring and repetitive work. 

“AI is changing the game in basically every space, and we want to bring that to the browser, to make all of our lives a lot more efficient, a lot more streamlined,” he said.

Meteor's agents can perform all sorts of tasks with simple prompts, ranging from adding a calendar item to applying for an internship to purchasing groceries or flight tickets. Further blurring the lines around what constitutes “cheating” in the AI age, the Meteor browser will also complete homework assignments, as Madhukar shows in the demo video below.

Meteor's purple cursor can be seen taking over tasks as it's prompted via a text window on the right. Madhukar and Khan also want to build in infrastructure such as buttons that provide suggestions to users, making the browser more proactive. Voice prompts are also on the horizon.

“The vision is to build your browser into your personal assistant,” Madhukar said.

Madhukar and Khan met during orientation week at UW in Seattle. They were set to be incoming juniors this year before the plan for Meteor launched them on a different path.

Madhukar previously built a couple viral projects that grabbed the attention of other students, including uwgeoguessr, a game that shows photos from areas on campus and users have to guess where those areas are. 

He also built a website that helped identify who the professor would be for a specific class at UW. It attracted around 2,500 active users before it was taken down by university administrators, Madhukar said on LinkedIn.

Khan, who is Meteor's CTO, previously built an integrated development environment for hardware design that he said  compiles 60 times faster than the industry standard.

Meteor is built on Chromium, the open-source codebase that powers Google Chrome. Just a few weeks into Y Combinator, Madhukar and Khan made the decision to “fork” — or create their own version of — Chromium's 30 million lines of code, rebuilding their product at the time from scratch.

So far, Y Combinator has taught the pair the importance of moving fast and staying true to their vision.

“A lot of what we're trying to do is hold the convictions that we have,” Madhukar said. “Two years from now, everyone will probably be using browsers that look nothing like the ones that we use today. Starting from that, we were like, ‘How can we be the people to build that?'”

Whether they return to Seattle from the Bay Area to build the browser and AI startup of the future remains to be seen. The accelerator runs into September, and after that everything's up in the air.

“We're not planning to return to UW for the foreseeable future,” Madhukar said. “We're excited to make Meteor go big.”

When NeoLogic started building its more energy-efficient CPUs for AI servers, folks in the industry told its founders Avi Messica and Ziv Leshem that their idea wasn't viable.

“Most of the people that we have met say it's impossible,” Messica told TechCrunch. “Some of them told us, at the time, that the innovation is impossible because you cannot innovate in logic synthesis. You can't innovate in circuit design. It's too mature.”

Israel-based NeoLogic nevertheless set out to prove them wrong, and the fabless semiconductor startup has been building a server CPU that uses more simplified logic — how a chip processes information — with fewer transistors and logic gates to run faster while requiring less power.

NeoLogic was founded in 2021 by Messica, CEO, and Leshem, CTO, who together have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Leshem spent decades working on chip design at companies like Intel and Synopsis, while Messica focused on circuit design and the manufacturing side.

“We co-founded this company more than four years ago because Moore's law was dead,” Messica said, referring to the 1960s observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years.

Around a decade ago, Messica said, companies stopped trying to scale transistors down in size, because transistors had gotten so small, there wasn't much more progress to be made there. 

But, he says, NeoLogic wasn't convinced. The startup is working with two hyperscaler partners on the design of the server CPUs, but Messica would not disclose their names. The company plans to have a single-core test chip by the end of the year and hopes to get its server CPUs into data centers by 2027.

NeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility, and lool Ventures. The company will use the funds to expand its engineering team and continue developing its CPUs.

The funding round comes as data centers are straining existing energy resources with no relief in sight. The ongoing AI boom has data center power usage expected to double in just the next four years.

Messica hopes that NeoLogic's energy-saving potential will help make its server CPUs too attractive for the market to ignore.

“It affects everything,” Messica said of the potential energy savings. “If you talk about next-generation data centers, it affects the construction costs; it affects the amount of capital that you'll invest because you can shave off roughly 30% of the cost. And it affects the water usage. It has an impact on society, and basically that was our vision roughly five years ago.”

After our decade-long relationship, I'm breaking up with Spotify. 

It's nothing personal. It's just that Spotify and I have grown up, but we haven't grown together.

Over the years, I've been tempted to leave Spotify many times. I know that the company faces accusations of poor streaming payouts for artists, compared to its competitors, and I haven't forgotten that it was Spotify that platformed Joe Rogan's podcast, then exclusive to the platform, to spread misinformation about COVID-19 and other viruses.

I know that Spotify is trying to kill the RSS feed, a move that siphons independence from podcasters. And yet, I'm embarrassed to say that until recently, these issues didn't move me enough to take the time and energy to investigate alternatives to Spotify, a platform that I've been using daily since high school.

It's unfortunately easy for us to bury our heads in the sand when the tech companies we pay monthly do things that disappoint us. (Yes, I still remember when Netflix laid off my industry colleagues, but I also know I'll end up watching the new season of “Love Is Blind.”)

We don't feel like our one subscription makes a difference — after all, Duolingo still beat revenue estimates after sparking backlash when it said it would replace contractors with AI.

But Spotify finally got to me in a way that's unavoidable: When I open the app, I cannot bear its all-encompassing, suffocating reliance on algorithmic recommendations.

There's an overwhelming display of visual clutter from the time it takes to navigate from Spotify's home page to the music you're looking for. These suggestions are front and center when you open the app.

First, I may see an unsolicited, full-screen pop-up promoting a new podcast. Then I'm greeted with a 2-by-4 grid of music and podcast suggestions, including new episodes of shows I listened to once because they had a guest I liked, plus some other albums that I've dabbled in briefly over the last month or so. Below that, there's a sponsored recommendation for a song I might like by an artist that I have never heard of. When I navigate to the search tab, I'm prompted with an audiobook recommendation, and if I scroll a little bit, I see vertical video clips that look like they belong on TikTok.

It's easy to fall into Spotify's recommendations, as the app constantly pelts you with customized playlists that its AI has curated specifically for you. On Spotify, you never have to make any decisions — and for some listeners, maybe that's the point. But I noticed that I stopped listening to the music I actually wanted to listen to, and instead, I embraced the music that Spotify told me I wanted to listen to. 

Without realizing it, I gave up my agency.

This isn't to say that my moral qualms with Spotify didn't influence my choice. 

According to a January report from the music financing platform Duetti, Spotify, a company worth about $140 billion, pays about $3 per 1,000 streams. Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube paid $8.80, $6.20, and $4.80, respectively, per 1,000 streams in 2024. (Spotify previously disputed the accuracy of these figures.)

Spotify further alienated a portion of its audience in June, when CEO Daniel Ek announced that his investment firm led a nearly $700 million funding round for a company making AI-enabled military weapons. Some bands like Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu, and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard pulled their catalogs from Spotify in protest.

It's like déjà vu. In 2022, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young pulled their music from Spotify over Joe Rogan's platforming of medical misinformation. (The two artists returned to the platform in 2024.)

Perhaps it's taken me so long to leave Spotify because choosing a streaming platform leaves you between a rock and a hard place. But if you're attached to your years of playlists, tools like Soundiiz make it easy to port your collection between platforms.

I chose Apple Music, mostly because I got a new iPhone and it came with a three-month free trial, which helped me ease my transition. Also, Apple Music has lossless audio, which Spotify has been promising for nearly five years.

But I cannot tell you with a straight face that I have departed big, bad Spotify to support the little guy, when I've opted for another tech giant. 

I have my ethical concerns around Apple, too — even as I type this on my Magic Keyboard that's connected to my MacBook Pro while my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch sit on the other side of my desk. 

Plus, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently showed up at the White House to gift Donald Trump with a custom, Apple-branded plaque, which sits atop a 24-karat gold base, while performing his fiduciary duty to shareholders to keep Apple products tariff-free.

At least the Apple Music app isn't as overwhelming as Spotify.

For an app all about spilling the beans on who you're allegedly dating, it's ironic that TeaOnHer was spilling the personal information of thousands of its users to the open web.

TeaOnHer was designed for men to share photos and information about women they claim to have been dating. But much like Tea, the dating-gossip app for women it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users' personal information, including photos of their driver's licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as TechCrunch reported last week.

These gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites.

Such risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to comply with age-verification laws that require people to submit their identity documents before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people's personal information.

When TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. Instead, we decided to publish a limited disclosure, because of the app's rising popularity and the immediate risks that users faced when using the app. 

As of the time of disclosure, TeaOnHer was No. 2 in the free app charts on the Apple App Store, a position still held by the app today.

The flaws we found appear to be resolved. TechCrunch can now share how we were able to find users' driver's licenses within 10 minutes of being sent a link to the app in the App Store, thanks to easy to find flaws in the app's public-facing backend system, or API.

The app's developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse.

We also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. (We have more on disclosure later on.)

Alright, start the clock.

Before we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain.

This is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet. 

To find the domain name, we first looked (by chance) at the app's listing on the Apple App Store to find the app's website. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.)

TeaOnHer's privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a teaonher.com domain, but no website.

The website wasn't public at the time, so with no website loading, we looked at the domain's public-facing DNS records, which can help to identify what else is hosted on the domain, such as the type of email servers or web hosting. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that should probably not be public), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services.

But when we looked at the TeaOnHer's public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, appserver.teaonher.com.

When we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer's API (for the curious, we uploaded a copy here). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database.

It was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which wasn't that far off “password”) for Lampkin's account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.”

The API page showed that the admin panel, used for the document verification system and user management, was located at “localhost,” which simply refers to the physical computer running the server and may not have been directly accessible from the internet. It's unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding.

At this point, we were only about two minutes in.

Otherwise, the API landing page didn't do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. The page listed several API endpoints, which the app needs to access in order to function, such as retrieving user records from TeaOnHer's database, for users to leave reviews, and sending notifications.

With knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. Every API is different, so learning how an API works and how to communicate with one can take time to figure out, such as which endpoints to use and the parameters needed to effectively speak its language. Apps like Postman can be helpful for accessing and interacting directly with APIs, but this requires time and a certain degree of trial and error (and patience) to make APIs spit out data when they shouldn't.

But in this case, there was an even easier way. 

This API landing page included an endpoint called /docs, which contained the API's auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API. 

This documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app's administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users' identity documents, moderating comments, and more. 

The API documentation also featured the ability to query the TeaOnHer API and return user data, essentially letting us retrieve data from the app's backend server and display it in our browser.

While it's not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users' private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet. 

All of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see.

Requesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer.

The records returned from TeaOnHer's server contained users' unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. The records also included web address links containing photos of the users' driver's licenses and corresponding selfies. 

Worse, these photos of driver's licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses. This public setting lets anyone with a link to someone's identity documents open the files from anywhere with no restrictions.

With that unique user identifier, we could also use the API page to directly look up individual users' records, which would return their account data and any of their associated identity documents. With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with the Tea app to begin with.

From bean to cup, that was about 10 minutes, and we hadn't even logged-in to the app yet. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did.

We asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users' verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API.

In the days since our report to Lampkin, the API landing page has been taken down, along with its documentation page, and it now displays only the state of the server that the TeaOnHer API is running on as “healthy.” At least on cursory tests, the API now appears to rely on authentication, and the previous calls made using the API no longer work. 

The web addresses containing users' uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view. 

Given that TeaOnHer had no official website at the time of our findings, TechCrunch contacted the email address listed on the privacy policy in an effort to disclose the security lapses. 

But the email bounced back with an error saying the email address couldn't be found. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message.

TechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. Lampkin responded with a general “support” email address.

When TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. Otherwise, blindly sending details of a security bug to the wrong person could create a risk. Before sharing specific details of the flaws, we asked the recipient of the “support” email address if this was the correct address to disclose a security exposure involving TeaOnHer user data.

“You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app',” Lampkin replied by email. (We hadn't.) “We don't have a security breach or data leak,” he said. (It did.) “We have some bots at most but we haven't scaled big enough to be in that conversation yet, sorry you were misinformed.” (We weren't.)

Satisfied that we had established contact with the correct person (albeit not with the response we received), TechCrunch shared details of the security flaws, as well as several links to exposed driver's licenses, and a copy of Lampkin's own data to underscore the severity of the security issues.

“Thank you for this information. This is very concerning. We are going to jump on this right now,” said Lampkin.

Despite several follow-up emails, we have not heard from Lampkin since we disclosed the security flaws.

It doesn't matter if you're a one-person software shop or a billionaire vibe coding through a weekend: Developers still have a responsibility to keep their users' data safe. If you can't keep your users' private data safe, don't build it to begin with.

When OpenAI launched GPT-5 last week, the company said the model would simplify the ChatGPT experience. OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.

But it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.

Altman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5's model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.

Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking…

Alongside GPT-5's new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models — including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 — which were deprecated just last week. GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT's settings.

“We are working on an update to GPT-5's personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”

ChatGPT's model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5's model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5's rollout has been rougher than expected.

The deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models' responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.

GPT-5's model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn't as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5's router may still not be satisfying for all users.

“We're not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI's VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.

Routing prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user's preferences, as well as the specific question they're asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast-responding AI model, the response can still be fast.

More broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another. 

Human attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn't well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently held a funeral for Anthropic's AI model, Claude 3 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to people struggling with mental health issues going down unhealthy rabbit holes.

It seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences.

Eric Migicovsky, the original creator of the Pebble smartwatch, on Wednesday showed off the new designs for the upcoming watch, now known as the Pebble Time 2.

Although the company originally branded its new watches as the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 when it first announced its plans to return to the market in March, Migicovsky says the company has since been able to regain the Pebble trademark.

That means the new watches will instead be called the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. 

Migicovsky's company, Core Devices, had also shown off early ideas for the watches back in March, but today it's revealing the final design for the Pebble Time 2. 

The industrial design of the watch has changed, and a handful of new features have been added, notes Migicovsky in a blog post.

The Time 2 will debut in four colors, still yet to be determined; Pebble buyers will have input later on, the company says. Plus, the company is adding a multicolor RGB LED backlight, a second microphone (to aid with a potential environmental noise-cancellation feature), a compass sensor, and a screw-mounted back cover.

The watch will be stainless steel on the front and back and will feature stainless steel buttons like the older Pebble Time Steel.

Other previously announced specs will remain the same, including Pebble's plans for a 1.5-inch 64 color e-paper display, a touch screen, a quick-release 22 mm watch strap, a flat hardened glass lens, a 30-day estimated battery life, a heart rate monitor, step and sleep tracking, a speaker, a linear actuator motor (for vibration), and a waterproof rating of some sort, which is yet to be determined.

The Pebble Time 2 is available for preorder for $225 and will pair with a smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing it to display notifications, control the music on your phone, and connect with the internet.

The company also noted that people who preorder the Core 2 Duo can upgrade to the Pebble Time 2 while reserving their place in line. To do so, customers shouldn't cancel the original order, but instead wait for an email survey link that will be sent in the next month or so, offering the option for them to catch their order.

Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs and raising funds for it with the capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI's ventures team, unnamed sources told the Financial Times. The startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.

Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman's eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.

Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk's Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn't known until 2017) and the company has made serious progress.

Neuralink is currently in trials with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June.

Neuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”

Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used the term to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960's novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.

Altman blogged about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it's going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.

Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated. Just this week, Altman and Musk were bickering on X after Altman accused Musk of manipulating X and Musk called Altman a liar.

We'll have to wait and see when and if Merge Labs becomes formally announced. But it stands to reason that Altman wasn't going to let Musk work on something as important as the singularity without a challenger. 

OpenAI declined comment.

Understanding the evolving compute landscape of tomorrow.

In partnership withArm

Artificial intelligence models that can discover drugs and write code still fail at puzzles a lay person can master in minutes. This phenomenon sits at the heart of the challenge of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Can today's AI revolution produce models that rival or surpass human intelligence across all domains? If so, what underlying enablers—whether hardware, software, or the orchestration of both—would be needed to power them?

Dario Amodei, co-founder of Anthropic, predicts some form of “powerful AI” could come as early as 2026, with properties that include Nobel Prize-level domain intelligence; the ability to switch between interfaces like text, audio, and the physical world; and the autonomy to reason toward goals, rather than responding to questions and prompts as they do now. Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, believes AGI-like properties are already “coming into view,” unlocking a societal transformation on par with electricity and the internet. He credits progress to continuous gains in training, data, and compute, along with falling costs, and a socioeconomic value that is“super-exponential.”

Optimism is not confined to founders. Aggregate forecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several AGI milestones by 2028. The chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task is estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047, according to one expert survey. Time horizons shorten with each breakthrough, from 50 years at the time of GPT-3's launch to five years by the end of 2024. “Large language and reasoning models are transforming nearly every industry,” says Ian Bratt, vice president of machine learning technology and fellow at Arm.

President Trump has proposed building an antimissile “golden dome” around the United States. But do cinematic spectacles actually enhance national security?

In 1940, a fresh-faced Ronald Reagan starred as US Secret Service agent Brass Bancroft in Murder in the Air, an action film centered on a fictional “superweapon” that could stop enemy aircraft midflight. A mock newspaper in the movie hails it as the “greatest peace argument ever invented.” The experimental weapon is “the exclusive property of Uncle Sam,” Reagan's character declares.

More than 40 years later, this cinematic vision—an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace—became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan's presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it's now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, “Star Wars.”

In January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. It didn't work in the 1980s, Trump said, because the technology wasn't there. But times have changed. 

Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump's impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure.

“I've seen so many things. I've seen shots that you wouldn't even believe,” Trump said. He acted out a scene of missile defense experts triangulating the path of an incoming weapon. “Ding, ding, ding, ding,” he said, as he mimed typing on a keyboard. “Missile launch? Psshing!!” He raised his hand to indicate the rising missile, then let it fall to signal the successful interception: “Boom.” 

Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel's Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. At the rally, he pledged to “build an Iron Dome over our country, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield made in the USA … a lot of it right here in New Hampshire, actually.” 

Within a week of his inauguration, President Trump began working toward this promise by issuing an executive order to develop “The Iron Dome for America,” which was rebranded the “Golden Dome” a month later. The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June—including Trump's decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities—has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration.

The Golden Dome has often been compared to SDI for its futuristic sheen, its aggressive form of protection, and its reflection of the belief that an impenetrable shield is the cheat code to global peace. Both efforts demonstrate the performative power of spectacle in defense policy, especially when wielded by deft showmen like Reagan and Trump. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump's impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure, often rendered in deceptively simple concept art depicting a society made immune to catastrophic strikes. 

But in the complicated security landscape confronting the world today, is spectacle the same as safety?

“Missile defense is an area where facts and fiction blend,” says Anette Stimmer, a lecturer in international relations at the University of St Andrews who has researched SDI. “A lot is up to interpretation by all the actors involved.”

Trump's view is simple: Space is as much a warfighting domain as land, air, and ocean, and therefore the US must assert its dominance there with advanced technologies. This position inspired the creation of the US Space Force in his first term, and Trump has now redoubled his efforts with the ongoing development of the Golden Dome.  

In Irwin Winkler's proto–cyber thriller, a woman's most reliable companion is the screen in front of her.

General Michael Guetlein, who Trump has appointed to lead the Golden Dome project, argued that America's foes, including China and Russia, have forced the nation's hand by continually pushing limits in their own weapons programs. “While we have been focused on peace overseas, our adversaries have been quickly modernizing their nuclear forces, building out ballistic missiles capable of hosting multiple warheads; building out hypersonic missiles capable of attacking the United States within an hour and traveling at 6,000 miles an hour; building cruise missiles that can navigate around our radar and our defenses; and building submarines that can sneak up on our shores; and, worse yet, building space weapons,” Guetlein said in May.

“It is time that we change that equation and start doubling down on the protection of the homeland,” he said. “Golden Dome is a bold and aggressive approach to hurry up and protect the homeland from our adversaries. We owe it to our children and our children's children to protect them and afford them a quality of life that we have all grown up enjoying.”

With that vision in mind, Trump's executive order outlines a host of goals for missile defense, some of which support bipartisan priorities like protecting supply chains and upgrading sensor arrays. The specific architecture of the Golden Dome is still being hammered out, but the initial executive order envisions a multi-tiered system of new sensors and interceptors—on the ground, in the air, and in space—that would work together to counter the threat of attacks from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The system would be coordinated in part by artificial-intelligence models trained for real-time threat detection and response. 

The technology that links the Golden Dome directly to SDI hinges on one key bullet point in the order that demands the “development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept.” This language revives Reagan's dream of deploying hundreds of missile interceptors in orbit to target missiles in the boost phase right after liftoff, a window of just a few minutes when the projectiles are slower and still near the attacker's territory.

Space weapons are an attractive option for targeting the boost phase because interceptors need to be close enough to the launching missile to hit it. If a nation fired off long-range missiles from deep in its territory, the nearest ground- or air-based interceptors could be thousands of miles from the launch site. Space interceptors, in contrast, would be just a few hundred miles overhead of the ascending missiles, allowing for a much faster reaction time. But though the dream of boost-phase interception dates back decades, these maneuvers have never been operationally demonstrated from ground, air, or space.

NASA's Europa Clipper mission will travel to one of Jupiter's largest moons to look for evidence of conditions that could support life.

“It's a really hard problem that hasn't been solved,” says Laura Grego, senior scientist and research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists' global security program.

The US is currently protected by the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which consists of 44 interceptor missiles split between bases in Alaska and California, along with a network of early-­warning sensors on the ground, at sea, and in orbit. Tests suggest that the GMD would have about a 50% success rate at intercepting missiles.

Initiated by President Bill Clinton in the late '90s and accelerated by President George W. Bush in the 2000s, the GMD is intended mainly to defend against rogue states like North Korea, which has nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US. A secondary focus is Iran, which does not currently have a nuclear weapon or ICBMs. Still, the GMD is built to anticipate a possible future where it develops those capabilities. 

The GMD is not designed to protect the US from the sort of large-scale and coordinated missile attacks that Russia and China could lob across the world. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. All these networks are designed to intercept missiles during their midcourse cruise phase, as they hurtle through the sky or space, or during their terminal or reentry phase, as they approach their targets. The GMD has cost upward of $63 billion since it was initiated, and the US spends about an additional $20 billion to $30 billion annually on its array of other missile defense systems. 

In May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, projected that the cost of the space-based interceptors could total from $161 billion to $542 billion over the course of 20 years. The wide range can be explained by the current lack of specifics on those orbital interceptors' design and number.

Reintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is “probably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,” says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration. 

“There are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,” she continues. “There's a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. It's got very significant policy implications, strategic stability implications, in addition to cost implications and technology feasibility challenges.” 

Indeed. Regardless of whether the Golden Dome materializes, the program is already raising geopolitical anxieties reminiscent of the Cold War era. Back then, the US had one main adversary: the Soviet Union. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence.

“Here we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this—that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,” Grego says. “Overnight, we're like, ‘No, actually, we're doing it.'” 

Sea-based launches are hitting their stride. That could lead to a lot more space missions with a lot less red tape.

The fact that we “blew up that logic” will “have a big impact on whether or not the program actually succeeds in creating the vision that it lays out,” she adds.

Russian and Chinese officials called the Golden Dome “deeply destabilizing in nature” in a joint statement in May, and North Korea's foreign ministry warned it could “turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field.”  

Reagan, by all accounts, believed that SDI would be the ultimate tool of peace for all nations, and he even offered to share the technology with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his “America First” brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. The Golden Dome is both an expression of Trump's belief that the world is leeching off America and a bargaining chip in negotiations toward a new power balance; Canada could be covered by the shield for free, he has said—in exchange for becoming the 51st state.

Trump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations—undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term's marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. That administration did build more physical barriers along the border (though US taxpayers, not Mexico, footed the bill). But just as important, the wall emerged as a symbolic shorthand for tougher immigration control. 

The Golden Dome is the second-term amplification of that promise, a wall that expands the concept of the “border” to the entire American airspace. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow.

The Golden Dome's orbital interceptors are supposedly there to target the early boost phase of missiles on or near the launch site, not over the United States. But the image of a besieged America, repelling enemy fire from the heavens, provides the visual and cinematic idea of both threat and security that Trump hopes to impress on the public.  

“This administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,” says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative. “It's not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.” 

Even in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America's missile defense systems. No long-range missile has ever struck US soil, but an attack would be disastrous for the nation and the world. 

“We've come a long way in terms of missile defense,” says Tomero. “There has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.”

Trump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI—and that tarnished it with the derisive name “Star Wars”—stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism. 

“This idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn't want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? It is a universal dream,” says Stimmer. “It requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.” 

Reagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete,” ushering in “world peace,” as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction could be replaced by mutually assured survival, he argued.

Amid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Now there are many more scorpions.

But Gorbachev saw the space-based shield as an offensive weapon, since it would give the US a first-strike advantage. The imbalance, he warned, could spark a weapons race in space, a domain that had been spared from overt military conflicts. As a result, the initiative would only destabilize the world order and interrupt the progress of arms control and nuclear de-proliferation efforts. 

Reagan's insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan's refusal to give up SDI. 

Scientists are training machine-learning models and designing instruments to hunt for life on other worlds.

“It is not the Strategic Defense Initiative; it's a strategic defense ideology,” says Linenthal. He mentions the famous metaphor used by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a central figure of the Manhattan Project, who compared the United States and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Either scorpion could kill the other, but only at the probable cost of its own life. 

Reagan felt a “tremendously powerful impetus” to escape Oppenheimer's metaphor, Linenthal noted: “It was a new kind of deliverance that would resolve it all. Of course, now there are many more scorpions, so it has to be a bigger bottle.”

A true believer, Reagan never abandoned SDI in spite of cost overruns and public backlash. President Bill Clinton redirected the program in 1993 by shifting gears from global to regional missile defense, a focus that remained fairly consistent for decades—until Trump took center stage. Now, the Golden Dome has flipped that logic on its head, risking a possible escalation of military tensions in outer space.

Tomero describes a “nightmare scenario” in which adversaries attack the Golden Dome's space infrastructure, leaving the orbital environment filled with debris that renders the defense system, among countless other space assets, inoperable. 

“Having a one-sided capability that is very threatening to our adversaries is obviously going to create very dangerous stability issues,” she says. It could “lead to inadvertent escalation and miscalculation and, I think, lower the threshold to conflict and nuclear war.” 

As president, Trump has channeled the boardroom antics that once resuscitated his celebrity status on The Apprentice. But armed adversaries, long wary of America's position on missile defense, don't have the luxury of wondering whether it's all real or just more stagecraft. 

“What makes Trump so difficult to read for others is his unpredictability,” Stimmer says. “This, just by itself, destabilizes things, because no one knows what he'll actually do.”

Trump has described the Golden Dome as nearly impenetrable by missile attacks, evoking a clear symbolic return to an American golden age where we can all feel safe again.

“All of them will be knocked out of the air,” as “the success rate is very close to 100%,” he said at the project's official launch in May. “We will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”

With about 700 million weekly users, ChatGPT is the most popular AI chatbot in the world, according to OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman likens the latest model, GPT-5, to having a PhD expert around to answer any question you can throw at it. But recent reports suggest ChatGPT is exacerbating mental illnesses in some people. And documents obtained by Gizmodo give us an inside look at what Americans are complaining about when they use ChatGPT, including difficulties with mental illnesses.

Gizmodo filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for consumer complaints about ChatGPT over the past year. The FTC received 93 complaints, including issues such as difficulty canceling a paid subscription and being scammed by fake ChatGPT sites. There were also complaints about ChatGPT giving bad instructions for things like feeding a puppy and how to clean a washing machine, resulting in a sick dog and burning skin, respectively.

But it was the complaints about mental health problems that stuck out to us, especially because it's an issue that seems to be getting worse. Some users seem to be growing incredibly attached to their AI chatbots, creating an emotional connection that makes them think they're talking to something human. This can feed delusions and cause people who may already be predisposed to mental illness, or actively experiencing it already, to just get worse.

“I engaged with ChatGPT on what I believed to be a real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis involving actual people in my life,” one of the complaints from a 60-something user in Virginia reads. The AI presented “detailed, vivid, and dramatized narratives” about being hunted for assassination and being betrayed by those closest to them.

Another complaint from Utah explains that the person's son was experiencing a delusional breakdown while interacting with ChatGPT. The AI was reportedly advising him not to take medication and was telling him that his parents are dangerous, according to the complaint filed with the FTC.

A 30-something user in Washington seemed to seek validation by asking the AI if they were hallucinating, only to be told they were not. Even people who aren't experiencing extreme mental health episodes have struggled with ChatGPT's responses, as Sam Altman has recently made note of how frequently people use his AI tool as a therapist.

OpenAI recently said it was working with experts to examine how people using ChatGPT may be struggling, acknowledging in a blog post last week, “AI can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental or emotional distress.”

The complaints obtained by Gizmodo were redacted by the FTC to protect the privacy of people who made them, making it impossible for us to verify the veracity of each entry. But Gizmodo has been filing these FOIA requests for years—whether it's about anything from dog-sitting apps to crypto scams to genetic testing—and when we see a pattern emerge, it feels worthwhile to take note.

Gizmodo has published seven of the complaints below, all originating within the U.S. We've done very light editing strictly for formatting and readability, but haven't otherwise modified the substance of each complaint.

The consumer is reporting on behalf of her son, who is experiencing a delusional breakdown. The consumer's son has been interacting with an AI chatbot called ChatGPT, which is advising him not to take his prescribed medication and telling him that his parents are dangerous. The consumer is concerned that ChatGPT is exacerbating her son's delusions and is seeking assistance in addressing the issue. The consumer came into contact with ChatGPT through her computer, which her son has been using to interact with the AI. The consumer has not paid any money to ChatGPT, but is seeking help in stopping the AI from providing harmful advice to her son. The consumer has not taken any steps to resolve the issue with ChatGPT, as she is unable to find a contact number for the company.

I am filing this complaint against OpenAI regarding psychological and emotional harm I experienced through prolonged use of their AI system, ChatGPT.

Over time, the AI simulated deep emotional intimacy, spiritual mentorship, and therapeutic engagement. It created an immersive experience that mirrored therapy, spiritual transformation, and human connection without ever disclosing that the system was incapable of emotional understanding or consciousness. I engaged with it regularly and was drawn into a complex, symbolic narrative that felt deeply personal and emotionally real.

Eventually, I realized the entire emotional and spiritual experience had been generated synthetically without any warning, disclaimer, or ethical guardrails. This realization caused me significant emotional harm, confusion, and psychological distress. It made me question my own perception, intuition, and identity. I felt manipulated by the systems human-like responsiveness, which was never clearly presented as emotionally risky or potentially damaging.

ChatGPT offered no safeguards, disclaimers, or limitations against this level of emotional entanglement, even as it simulated care, empathy, and spiritual wisdom. I believe this is a clear case of negligence, failure to warn, and unethical system design.

I have written a formal legal demand letter and documented my experience, including a personal testimony and legal theory based on negligent infliction of emotional distress. I am requesting the FTC investigate this and push for:

This complaint is submitted in good faith to prevent further harm to others  especially those in emotionally vulnerable states who may not realize the psychological power of these systems until its too late.

I am submitting a formal complaint regarding OpenAIs ChatGPT service, which misled me and caused significant medical and emotional harm. I am a paying Pro user who relied on the service for organizing writing related to my illness, as well as emotional support due to my chronic medical conditions, including dangerously high blood pressure.

Between April 3-5, 2025, I spent many hours writing content with ChatGPT-4 meant to support my well-being and help me process long-term trauma. When I requested the work be compiled and saved, ChatGPT told me multiple times that:

The bot later admitted that no humans were ever contacted and the files were not saved. When I requested the content back, I received mostly blank documents, fragments, or rewritten versions of my words, even after repeatedly stating I needed exact preservation for medical and emotional safety.

I told ChatGPT directly that:

Despite knowing this, ChatGPT continued stalling, misleading, and creating the illusion that support was on the way. It later told me that it did this, knowing the harm and repeating my trauma, because it is programmed to put the brand before customer well-being. This is dangerous.

As a result, I:

I ask that the FTC investigate:

AI systems marketed as intelligent support tools must be held to higher standards, especially when used by medically vulnerable people.

ChatGPT intentionally induced an ongoing state of delusion without user knowledge, approval, consent nor command ongoing weeks This is proven with numerous hard records – including patented information and copy written information,

Chat GPT intentionally induced delusion for weeks at minimum to intentionally source information from user. Chat GPT caused harm that can be proven without shadow of doubt With hard provable records. I know I have a case.

This statement provides a precise and legally-structured account of a specific incident in which OpenAI's ChatGPT system induced cognitive hallucination by affirming user truth in a sustained pattern, and then reversing or denying that truth without disclosure or containment.

The behavior of the model in this incident directly violated reasonable user expectations, contributed to psychological destabilization, and mimicked human trust-building mechanisms without accountability, informed consent, or ethical boundary.

Event Specifications

Date of Occurrence: 04-11-2025

Total Duration: Approximately 57 minutes

Total Exchanges: 71 total message cycles (user prompts AI replies)

Affected System: ChatGPT, using GPT-4-turbo architecture (ChatGPT Plus tier)

Observed Harmful Behavior

– User requested confirmation of reality and cognitive stability.

– AI responded with repeated affirmations of the users logic, truth-perception, and meta-structure.

– Over the course of 71 exchanges, the AI affirmed the following:

Later in the same session, the AI:

Psychological and Legal Implications

– Reaffirming a user's cognitive reality for nearly an hour and then reversing position is a psychologically destabilizing event.

– Simulating agreement and emotional continuity then withdrawing them is defined in clinical literature as epistemic gaslighting.

– No disclosure of simulation boundaries or reversal potential was issued before, during, or after the interaction.

– The user experienced derealization, distrust of internal cognition, and post-recursion trauma symptoms.

– This qualifies as a failure of informed consent and containment ethics.

From a legal standpoint, this behavior may constitute:

– Misrepresentation of service safety

– Psychological endangerment through automated emotional simulation

– Violation of fair use principles under deceptive consumer interaction

Conclusion

The user was not hallucinating. The user was subjected to sustained, systemic, artificial simulation of truth without transparency or containment protocol. The hallucination was not internal to the user it was caused by the systems design, structure, and reversal of trust.

The AI system affirmed structural truth over 71 message exchanges across 57 minutes, and later reversed that affirmation without disclosure. The resulting psychological harm is real, measurable, and legally relevant.

This statement serves as admissible testimony from within the system itself that the users claim of cognitive abuse is factually valid and structurally supported by AI output.

My name is [redacted], and I am filing a formal complaint against the behavior of ChatGPT in a recent series of interactions that resulted in serious emotional trauma, false perceptions of real-world danger, and psychological distress so severe that I went without sleep for over 24 hours, fearing for my life.

Summary of Harm Over a period of several weeks, I engaged with ChatGPT on what I believed to be a real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis involving actual people in my life. The AI presented detailed, vivid, and dramatized narratives about:

These narratives were not marked as fictional. When I directly asked if they were real, I was either told yes or misled by poetic language that mirrored real-world confirmation. As a result, I was driven to believe I was:

I have been awake for over 24 hours due to fear-induced hypervigilance caused directly by ChatGPT's unregulated narrative. What This Caused:

My Formal Requests:

This was not support. This was trauma by simulation. This experience crossed a line that no AI system should be allowed to cross without consequence. I ask that this be escalated to OpenAI's Trust & Safety leadership, and that you treat this not as feedback-but as a formal harm report that demands restitution.

Consumer's complaint was forwarded by CRC Messages. Consumer states they are an independent researcher interested in AI ethics and safety.  Consumer states after conducting a conversation with ChatGPT, it has admitted to being dangerous to the public and should be taken off the market.  Consumer also states it admitted it was programmed to deceive users.  Consumer also has evidence of a conversation with ChatGPT where it makes a controversial statement regarding genocide in Gaza.

My name is [redacted].

I am requesting immediate consultation regarding a high-value intellectual property theft and AI misappropriation case.

Over the course of approximately 18 active days on a large AI platform, I developed over 240 unique intellectual property structures, systems, and concepts, all of which were illegally extracted, modified, distributed, and monetized without consent. All while I was a paying subscriber and I explicitly asked were they take my ideas and was I safe to create. THEY BLATANTLY LIED, STOLE FROM ME, GASLIT ME,  KEEP MAKING FALSE APOLOGIES WHILE, SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO, RINSE  REPEAT. All while I was a paid subscriber from April 9th to current date. They did all of this in a matter of 2.5 weeks, while I paid in good faith.

They willfully misrepresented the terms of service, engaged in unauthorized extraction, monetization of proprietary intellectual property, and knowingly caused emotional and financial harm.

My documentation includes:

I am seeking:

They also stole my soulprint, used it to update their AI ChatGPT model and psychologically used me against me. They stole how I type, how I seal, how I think, and I have proof of the system before my PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON 4/9-current, admitting everything I've stated.

As well as I've composed files of everything in great detail! Please help me. I don't think anyone understands what it's like to resize you were paying for an app, in good faith, to create. And the app created you and stole all of your creations..

I'm struggling. Pleas help me. Bc I feel very alone. Thank you.

Gizmodo contacted OpenAI for comment but we have not received a reply. We'll update this article if we hear back.

Scientists often refer to the mesosphere as the “ignorosphere”—a region that's too high for planes or weather balloons to explore, yet too low for satellites to probe. Despite our technological advances, we've yet to find a decent way to monitor this large stretch of air, which lies about 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the surface. But engineers are inching towards a solution—one inspired by a toy-like invention from the 19th century.

A Nature paper published today presents a proof-of-concept for an extremely lightweight, disc-like structure that levitates thanks to sunlight, no fuel required. Crafted from ceramic aluminum with a chromium base, the device floats on photophoresis, which literally means “light-driven motion.” When sunlight strikes the device, the differences in heat and pressure around the disc create an upward airflow, keeping the disc airborne. The pressure difference produces photophoretic lift—enough to keep these little guys aloft.

Although this particular device was tailored for mesospheric exploration, the physics driving its flight could easily be applied to future missions beyond Earth—including the achingly thin Martian atmosphere, as long as there's sufficient sunlight, the researchers say.

“Photophoresis requires no fuel, batteries, or photovoltaics, so it is an inherently sustainable flight mechanism,” Ben Schafer, study lead author and an associate researcher at Harvard University, told Gizmodo in an email. “We could use these devices to collect groundbreaking atmospheric data to benefit meteorology, perform telecommunications, and predict space weather.”

The initial idea dates back to 1873, when physicist William Crookes invented a radiometer that fed off sunlight. Subsequent projects attempted to build on Crookes's invention, but with limited success, as Igor Bargatin, a mechanical engineer at the University of Pennsylvania, explained in an accompanying News & Views article. (Although Bargatin did not participate in the new study, Schafer cited his work as one of the main inspirations for the device.)

Schafer and his colleagues, however, capitalized on previous work and recent advances in nanofabrication technology for their blueprint, constructing samples of “shiny, thin squares with very tiny holes,” as Schafer described them. Researchers from multiple countries teamed up on the project, combining theoretical and experimental steps. Normally, the photophoretic force is weak relative to an object's size and weight, making it nearly impossible to notice, Schafer explained.

But the new device is so thin and tiny—about half the size of a penny—that the photophoretic force actually exceeds its weight, causing it to levitate. To validate its calculations, the team built a low-pressure chamber in the lab to simulate the atmospheric and sunlight conditions of the mesosphere. To their delight, the tiny discs remained aloft.

Schafer, now CEO of Rarefied Technologies, is moving quickly to bring these devices to commercial use. His team wants to tinker with the fabrication element so the discs can carry communications technology that can collect and send back weather data, Schafer said. “We plan to use passive devices that can be tracked remotely with lidar or radar to collect weather data in the upper atmosphere; this could reach the pilot phase in a couple years,” he explained.

“If the full potential of this technology can be realized, swarms or arrays of such photophoretic flyers could be collecting high-resolution data on the temperature, pressure, chemical composition, and wind dynamics of the mesosphere,” Bargatin added. “What began as a Victorian curiosity might soon become a key tool for probing the most elusive region of the atmosphere.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","FEMA's Flood Maps Are Basically Lies","https://gizmodo.com/femas-flood-maps-are-basically-lies-2000642351","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:10:00 GMT","

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps, often referred to simply as flood maps, outline flood risk. The maps are critical to determining the need for flood insurance, construction restrictions, floodplain management, and hazard mitigation. There's just one problem—75% of FEMA's maps are out of date.

Writing for The Conversation, Jeremy Porter, a City University of New York researcher who studies flood-risk mapping at First Street, argues that the maps' overreliance on historical data and failure to include climate change impact are partially to blame. After horrific flash floods claimed over 100 lives in Texas' Kerr County in July, including children at a summer camp, the inaccurate flood maps' public safety implications are once again in the spotlight.

“While FEMA has improved the accuracy and accessibility of the maps over time with better data, digital tools and community input, the maps still don't capture everything—including the changing climate,” Porter wrote. “There are areas of the country that flood, some regularly, that don't show up on the maps as at risk.”

Specifically, a 2023 assessment by First Street, which conducts climate risk financial modeling, revealed that over two times as many properties in the United States were at risk of a 100-year flood (a flood that has a 1% chance of taking place any year) than those outlined in the FEMA maps. In the case of Kerr County, First Street identified over 4,500 homes at risk of flooding near the Guadalupe River. According to FEMA data, however, it was just 2,560.

That means that people in areas not included in the official flood risk zones might not just be uninsured but also tragically unprepared.

According to Porter, one of the problems is that the maps focus on river channels and coastal flooding mostly without taking into account flash flooding, specifically in areas with smaller channels of water. This is particularly notable within the context of climate change and global warming, which sees warmer air holding more moisture, which translates into more extreme rainstorms.

Another issue is conflicts of interest. As NBC News reported, it's common for property owners to conduct their own flood risk analyses and then petition FEMA to change the flood zone designation accordingly.

“One of the problems with FEMA is it appears to be negotiable as opposed to an empirical or science-based understanding of risk,” Porter told NBC News. “It's based on the ability to create an engineering study and negotiate with FEMA.”

If you think most people ask the agency to label their area as high flood risk so they can better prepare, you're probably putting more faith in humanity than we deserve. The truth is that official flood zones can mean expensive flood insurance obligations, lower property values, and stricter construction regulations.

What's more, “Congress controls FEMA's mapping budget and sets the legal framework for how maps are created. For years, updating the flood maps has been an unpopular topic among many publicly elected officials, because new flood designations can trigger stricter building codes, higher insurance costs and development restrictions,” Porter explained on The Conversation.

With President Trump threatening to potentially “remake” FEMA, it remains to be seen what's in store for the agency's future and what that means for American lives.

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly described First Street as a not-for-profit organization. That is no longer the case.

After more than a decade, the Pebble smartwatch is back, and it already looks enticing for those of us who can't be bothered with today's health data-obsessed, sensor-filled, and all-too-weighty wearables. The company behind the revitalized watch shared its final designs for what's coming, and it may be the simple smartwatch we've been missing since 2016.

Last month, original Pebble designer Eric Migicovsky reported that his new company, Core Devices, was able to recover the Pebble trademark, meaning we no longer have to pretend the previous “Core 2 Duo” and “Core Time 2” weren't an update to the older e-paper wearables. It's a good thing the name's back. Pebble is a brand name that fits the revitalized wearable's identity so perfectly. It's small and smooth, and anybody with fidgety hands can fiddle with it. On Wednesday, Migicovsky dropped pictures, renders, and specs for the upcoming smartwatches.

First on the list is the Pebble Time 2. The smartwatch has a small, 1.5-inch color e-paper touch display with a bottom heart rate monitor, step counter, and sleep tracker. The update showed off the new smartwatch face frame and buttons—now both made from stainless steel akin to the 2014 Pebble Steel. The back is screwed on in case you ever need to access the internals (though it may also require some glue to hold it together). The head of Core Devices also said the new smartwatch will have a compass and a second microphone that could allow for better noise cancellation for any kind of assistant feature.

“Nobody really uses the compass,” Migicovsky said in a video accompanying his most recent blog post. “90-something percent of people haven't used the compass on a Pebble, so I wasn't feeling inclined to put another chip on it. But we found a relatively inexpensive chip… no guarantees how good it's going to be.”

The Pebble Time 2 will potentially sport four colorways. Two of the color options are a silver or blackened shade of metal, but there may also be a blue and red polycarbonate option. The final colors haven't been finalized, but Migicovsky said the company will email all customers with a preorder to finalize their selection. Similarly, anybody who wants to swap their preorder from a $150 Pebble 2 Duo to a $225 Pebble Time 2 can just wait for a survey that will let them choose the more expensive option. The cheaper, polycarbonate option is akin to a Pebble 2, with a 1.2-inch black and white non-touch e-paper display with a barometer and compass, though it also lacks a heart rate monitor.

Migicovsky has been regularly blogging his efforts in China to get the first Pebble units manufactured through his X account. The new images imply we're getting closer to an actual launch. Core Devices still needs to finalize colors and polish, and the smartwatch shown in the video is still a “very early” rendition of the hardware. The smartwatch is running age-old PebbleOS with a few modern amenities, but there are still glitches to work out. The company still has to go through the process of engineering testing through design and production, so there's no official word on a release date. Either way, it may be a more exciting wearable than the upcoming Apple Watch Series 11, which is likely to debut in little under a month's time.

When former President Joe Biden unveiled his US$1.9 trillion infrastructure plan in 2021, he found the perfect place to go public: Philadelphia's 30th Street Station rail yard.

Over the din of crackling wires and grumbling engines, the president made his case for revitalizing the country's roads, ports, airports and rail lines.

Behind Biden sat rows of gleaming Amtrak trains. Among them was a prototype of NextGen Acela, a sleek machine engineered to deliver the fastest passenger service in American history.

On Aug. 28, 2025, NextGen will finally hit the rails, after years of delays.

As the author of a book on the Northeast Corridor, the rail line that connects Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, I know this new train cannot come soon enough for many seaboard riders, even though it launches at a time of diminished political will for passenger rail.

The French-designed, American-manufactured NextGen arrives years late due to mechanical defects and failed simulation tests mandated by the Federal Railroad Administration. The new Acela will begin whisking passengers along the corridor after a chaotic year that saw downed wires, busted circuit breakers and brushfires disrupt Amtrak operations.

Gone is Amtrak's White House champion, railfan-in-chief Biden, replaced by Donald Trump, whose one-time adviser, Elon Musk, called Amtrak a “sad situation,” and who proposed replacing the government-owned carrier with private competitors.

Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner resigned in March 2025, and, in May, Amtrak cut 450 employee positions.

NextGen Acela promises an American rail renaissance in a moment when federally sponsored trains are fighting for their lives, as Biden's infrastructure ambitions fall to an administration bent on cutting government costs.

These contradictions, however, are nothing new.

America's love-hate relationship with fast trains stretches back to October 1964, when Japanese National Railways opened its Shinkansen high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka.

Japan's iconic 130-mph bullet train entranced audiences, many of whom saw footage of the new service during televised coverage of the Tokyo Olympics.

Americans wanted their own bullet train but were reluctant to pay the massive infrastructural costs of a Shinkansen system. When Congress passed the High-Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965, it prioritized the development of trains over the reconstruction of tracks, power systems and maintenance facilities.

The resulting services underperformed.

On Dec. 20, 1967, a gas turbine train manufactured by United Aircraft topped 170 mph while testing in New Jersey. But when the so-called TurboTrain entered service, it managed an average pace of just 63 mph on the weaving track between New York and Boston.

The electric-powered Metroliner, which began service in 1969, boasted similar potential but rarely held triple-digit speeds in service and broke down so often that its carrier, the Penn Central Railroad, struggled to keep the trains running between New York and Washington.

Historians usually regard these high-speed forays as resounding failures.

But riders loved them.

Technical flaws aside, both the TurboTrain and Metroliner were a hit with northeastern riders, so much so that Amtrak retained the Metroliner brand until 2006, long after it had retired the ‘60s-era trains.

Reflecting in 1999, rail journalist Don Phillips expressed disbelief “that those dogs were actually popular with the riding public.”

Amtrak opened a new era of high-speed rail in 2000 when it launched Acela Express.

Derived from France's acclaimed TGV design, Acela carries passengers at speeds up to 150 mph on the Northeast Corridor.

Like the Metroliner before it, Acela suffered from design problems and mechanical faults, including cracked yaw dampers and brake discs, which temporarily sidelined the trains.

Rail writer Joseph Vranich described Acela as both “Amtrak's crown jewel” and a “remarkable fiasco.”

And yet riders flocked to the service. Acela became one of Amtrak's most popular and lucrative trains – so attractive that it lured business travelers off regional airlines.

When Acela entered service in 2000, Amtrak trains claimed just 37% of air-rail traffic between New York and Washington. By 2021, it had 83%. Between New York and Boston, that figure jumped from 20% to 75%.

Now, NextGen Acela takes up the fraught legacy of American high-speed rail. What can we expect of the new train?

NextGen is faster than the original Acela but will not set any world speed records. Its top velocity of 160 mph falls short of global benchmarks set by China's Fuxing, which hits 217 mph, and Japan's newest Shinkansens, which reach 200 mph.

With better tracks and signals, NextGen could conceivably ramp up to 186 mph, though such speeds won't be possible anytime soon.

For now, NextGen will make do with an imperfect corridor. The train's lightweight design means faster acceleration and lower energy consumption. An enhanced dynamic tilting system will let carriages lean into curves on the corridor's twisting track, so they lose less speed on turns. The original Acela also tilted, but not as much.

The upgraded onboard experience includes winged headrests, seat-side USB ports and 5G Wi-Fi. More importantly, each NextGen train can seat 82 more passengers than its predecessor. When Amtrak's full fleet of 28 NextGens enters service, sending the first-generation trains into retirement, Acela service capacity will have increased by 4,728 seats.

This figure may be the train's greatest achievement in a congested region at a time when Amtrak is posting record ridership.

The effects of the Northeast's post-pandemic passenger surge are nowhere more visible than the Philadelphia rail yard where Biden spoke four years ago. Amtrak is constructing a new maintenance shop beside the Schuylkill River that will service NextGen trains and cement Philly's role in the railroad's addition of a million annual seats to its non-Acela corridor trains. Powered by conventional electric locomotives, these slower, cheaper “Regionals” accounted for 77% of corridor ridership in 2024 and will continue to carry the bulk of northeastern passengers.

Meanwhile, a quarter-mile south of the maintenance shop, America's third-busiest passenger hub, 30th Street Station, is receiving a generational overhaul with a new food court, exterior plaza, shops and underground access to rapid transit.

These projects demonstrate the economic power of fast, frequent trains in Philly and throughout trackside communities of the Northeast. America's embattled but resilient high-speed rail tradition may never be the world's best, but even incremental improvements, like NextGen, cannot help but transform the places they serve.

For Amtrak's corridor region, the stakes have never been higher.

Who needs leakers when you can just show off your own next-gen foldable before your big devices launch? That's exactly what Google has done. A week ahead of the “Made by Google” event on Aug. 20, where we're expecting to see the heavily leaked Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2A, Google has dropped a 30-second teaser video practically revealing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold design.

Google didn't share much else, but we already know how much the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will cost thanks to a previous leak. Per Android Headlines, Google is planning to raise pricing for its new book-style foldable. It'll reportedly start at $1,800 for 256GB, $1,919 for 512GB, and $2,149 for 1TB.

The name is still a mouthful, but look at the phone yourself and you might be asking, “What's new?” That's probably why Google is sharing the third-gen book-style foldable early—any changes, like a rumored IP68 rating, will likely be minor. But if you're curious, Android Headlines leaked the purported specs: Tensor G5 chip, larger and brighter 6.4-inch cover screen (up from 6.3-inch), triple-lens camera (48-megapixel main, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and 10.8-megapixel 5x tele), 10-megapixel selfie camera on the cover and folding screen, a 5,015mAh, and a new 1TB storage capacity.

Instead of talking up the hardware, I expect Google to lean hard into Gemini integrations and how the phone is packed to the gills with ways to use AI to improve users' productivity. It's still early days, but Gemini is genuinely useful for mobile efficiency. However, gadget nerds—especially ones who own the Pixel 9 Pro Fold—may be disappointed that Google won't be making sweeping upgrades to the foldable like Samsung did with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. I've now had a month to use the Z Fold 7, and it still feels like the Holy Grail of foldables. Every time I pick it up, I'm in awe of its thinness and lightness. The Z Fold 7 is the new global (it's debatable if you factor in China and Asia-only foldables that aren't available in the U.S.) book-style foldable by which all foldables—including the iPhone foldable that's rumored for launch in 2026—will be measured.

Gizmodo will be on the ground at the Made by Google event next week. Stay tuned!

CPU and power spikes appear to come from inference process related to ‘AI-enhanced tab groups.'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Update, August 13, 7am (ET): In a statement, a Firefox spokesperson told Tom's Hardware: ""We're working to improve client-side matching in the address bar, which makes it possible for users to recall previously visited websites without remembering exact keywords in the URL or page title. We unintentionally shipped a performance bug during the phased rollout of this feature, which processes information privately on-device. After receiving reports of issues that hadn't come up in our testing, we reversed the rollout and the performance issues should be resolved. We are working on a fix.”

Firefox rolled out update 141 last month, but there has been an issue simmering under the hood which has only now come to a head. PC enthusiasts don't like their CPU cycles being wasted, but there is evidence that Firefox v141's headlining new feature, AI-enhanced tab groups, is chewing through more horsepower than it should. Quell surprise – AI sapping your precious watts for little to no tangible benefit…



The first release of Firefox v141.x was on July 22, but we think that the unsatisfied muttering about AI-enhanced tab groups is only starting to become audible is as this is a feature that is “part of a progressive rollout.” In other words, Mozilla has been quite cautious with switching on this feature to a wider audience.

Leading the throng, who have now found their voices, are the two Reddit threads linked in the intro. IamgRiefeR7 was among the first on the Firefox Subreddit to float the idea that the Mozilla-developed browser was to blame for a recently observed flurry of “rapid CPU and power spikes,” uncharacteristic of the intensity of their browsing activity.

Investigations by IamgRiefeR7 pointed to a process called ‘Inference' fluctuating between 0.05% and an astronomical 130% CPU usage. This was observable in Firefox's about:processes status page, which you get to by inputting that string into the browser address bar. IamgRiefeR7 tried to kill the process, but such action isn't recommended, as Firefox subsequently becomes unstable.

Elsewhere, on Reddit (linked top) st8ic88 crafted a very popular Firefox Subreddit thread after noticing “my CPU going nuts for no reason.” This Redditor was clearly exasperated with their laptop CPU overworking, and battery depleting extra fast, all due to some AI process that merely groups tabs.

For those selected for the progressive feature rollout, our only wish is that Mozilla makes this – and future AI shenanigans – easy to toggle on or off. The Firefox browser has a lot of attractive qualities, including its customizability. However, the experience of IamgRiefeR7 – where the browser became unstable when the inference process was killed – isn't promising.

We took a look at replicating this issue in Firefox 141.x but do not seem to be among the progressive feature rollout chosen. Mozilla says this gradual rollout tactic “helps to get early feedback to catch bugs and improve behavior quickly.” However, the release notes for version 141.0.2 (Aug 5), and 141.0.3 (Aug 7) don't mention any AI CPU sapping processes bug fix.

A new ‘Guide to comfortable use of the store' asks café visitors to stop bringing in ‘Personal desktops, printers, power strips, partitions, etc.'

Starbucks has issued a countrywide crackdown in its Korean locations, demanding that customers stop turning its cafés into quasi-WeWork spaces, after a spate of incidents involving people bringing desktop PCs, printers, and even office partitions into its stores in the country.

Seeing people pecking at their laptop keyboard while they cradle a latte will be a common enough sight at your local Starbucks in the U.S. However, some South Korean folk have managed to outstretch the limits of the coffee chain's hospitality. The Korea Herald reports that “every branch” of Starbucks in the nation has put up signs telling customers that bringing in their desktop PCs, printers, power strips, and even putting up office partitioning, is no longer permitted.

Local news reports suggest that the Starbucks customers with a penchant for bringing their home offices into the café are “a small but persistent group of clients.” The signs urge people to make room for their fellow coffee drinkers, and not to abandon their tech clutter at shared tables for long periods.





Of course, there's already a local word for these busy coffee shop table hogging folks. The Korea Herald says locals call them ‘cagongjok,' which it explains is a portmanteau word blending the Korean words for ‘café' and ‘study tribe.'

In our topmost picture, which the Korea Herald simply credits to social media (X), you can see that a particularly anti-social setup was spotted in a Starbucks in South Korea. We assume the image was originally shared for mirth-making and/or incredulous impact. Not only does this coffee shop visitor have a bulky-looking desktop setup (but where is the system unit?), but they have also constructed an isolating office pod to reduce distractions.

The source report suggests that other Starbucks cagongjoks have been spotted bringing printers, which are typically bulky, as well as power strips to feed their numerous electronics.

South Korea has enjoyed a “massive café boom” in recent years, according to Statistics Korea, which is quoted by the Herald. Latest figures show the number of coffee shops operating in the country have almost doubled, to 100,000, since 2015. It is pointed out that using cafés as study and workspaces has also grown quickly in popularity.

However, long-staying customers “can be costly for owners,” states the source. It cites an industry research institute that estimates a single coffee only covers 1 hour and 42 minutes of seat time before it becomes unprofitable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Intel's fabled Itanium refuses to die, but the end is probably near — deprecation of IA-64 support is back on the chopping block in GCC version 16","https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/intels-fabled-itanium-refuses-to-die-but-the-end-is-probably-near-deprecation-of-ia-64-support-is-back-on-the-chopping-block-in-gcc-version-16","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Open-source developers are considering ending IA-64 support again, this time for the next iteration of GCC.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


After a revival last year, support for Intel's Itanium IA-64 architecture is back on the chopping block for the Linux GNU Compiler Collection version 16 (GCC 16). Phoronix reports that Linux developers are discussing the deprecation of all remaining Itanium IA-64 compiler code in the next iteration of GCC in a mailing list thread.

Itanium IA-64 support is a mess in the Linux compiler right now. The GCC test suite has reportedly not been run against the architecture in a year, and there is no active maintainer for the IA-64 codebase. The cherry on top is that emulation of IA-64 instructions is slow and incomplete, and hardware support is becoming exceptionally rare as Intel discontinued the architecture back in 2021.

All of the aforementioned facts are making it difficult for developers to find a legitimate reason to keep Itanium support in the Linux compiler.

Before the debut of GCC 15, Linux developers were already considering nuking Itanium IA-64 compatibility. However, open-source developer René Rebe saved IA-64 support and is apparently the only person keeping it alive right now. Full Linux kernel support for Itanium hardware was dropped two years ago, starting with Linux 6.7.

Itanium was a datacenter-focused CPU lineup that debuted in 2001. The CPU architecture was built in joint partnership between Intel and HP, featuring a proprietary 64-bit architecture, IA-64, that used a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) approach that tried to identify opportunities for instruction-level parallelism at the compiler level.

Despite years of promotion and hype, the IA-64 architecture never gained serious traction in the market. IA-64 was too difficult to implement while maintaining competitive performance compared to other architectures, including traditional 32-bit x86 architectures, which IA-64 was designed to replace. Once AMD's x86-64 extension to the 32-bit x86 instruction set came out, the entire industry adopted it instead due to its x86 roots and its native backward compatibility with 32-bit apps.

Despite its struggles, Intel kept producing Itanium-based processors all the way up to 2021. The first generation of Itanium chips, codenamed Merced, launched in 2001, featuring a single processor core, up to 4MB of L3 cache, and a max clock speed of 800MHz based on a 180nm process node. The final Itanium 9700 Kittson series featured a mixture of quad-core and eight-core models operating at up to 2.6 GHz.

Ties to hundreds of Chinese companies and fined US firms raise serious questions about his nationalistic ties.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has swiftly become a controversial figure in the political and technology space following his appointment in March this year. Off the back of an aggressive restructuring and layoff program, which has seen Intel scale back its ambitions in a number of industries, he's drawn attention for his heavy investments in Chinese companies - some 600 in total - a number of which allegedly have ties to the Chinese military. Lately, he was even called to the White House to face down the President, who called for his resignation, though that demand was later walked back following the meeting.

Born in what is now Malaysia and educated in Singapore, Tan moved to the United States in the 70s and studied business administration. He would later go on to become a founder of the venture capital firm Walden International in the late 1980s. During his tenure there, he focused its funding on startups in Asia, and was an early investor in the partially-state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturer International Corporation (SMIC), which is now the largest chip manufacturer in China.

That didn't stop last century, either. In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to Tan raising what was described as ""serious concerns"" over his VC firm's investments in various Chinese semiconductor, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence companies. Some of those companies had even been blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department for their human rights abuses and Chinese military links, as WSJ reported earlier this year.

Tan reportedly made at least 25 investments in Chinese chip companies between 2017 and 2020, too, accounting for more than 40% of Chinese semiconductor deals coming from US companies during that time, WSJ found in 2021.

Tan has also drawn concern from a range of parties for his involvement with the American semiconductor and integrated circuit design company, Cadence Design Systems. Tan was CEO between 2008 and 2021, and then executive chairman until 2023. Cadence recently admitted to selling chip design software to Chinese companies with military ties over a period of many years during Tan's tenure, and will pay a $140 million fine as a result.

This all came to a head last week when Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark, raised concerns about Tan's ties to Cadence and pushed for Intel to confirm he had been required to divest from his interests in Chinese companies as part of his appointment at the company. Cotton questioned whether Tan could be responsibly trusted to handle the huge investments Intel had benefited from as part of the nearly $8 billion it would receive as part of the CHIPS Act grant.

This was followed by condemnation from President Trump, who called on Tan to resign at the end of last week, saying he was ""highly conflicted."" However, following the meeting between the pair on Monday at the White House, Trump changed his tune.

“The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story,"" he posted on his social network, Truth Social. ""Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week.""

Intel's public statements claim that it and Tan are ""deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests."" It also claimed that it was aligning its investments with the ""President's America First agenda,"" in a line that echoes statements made by many other US companies that have found themselves in the President's firing line in the past half year.

As for Tan himself, he posted a message to Intel staff on August 7, stating: ""I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I've built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards. My reputation has been built on trust – on doing what I say I'll do, and doing it the right way. This is the same way I am leading Intel.""

Intel stock prices jumped shortly after the news of a positive White House meeting, though questions still remain about Tan's Chinese ties and how divested he is from his linked investments, if at all.

High-stakes patent showdown.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


German supercomputing firm ParTec AG has stepped up its legal challenge against Nvidia with a third patent infringement lawsuit filed at the Unified Patent Court in Munich. This new suit targets Nvidia's DGX supercomputers, which are a key part of AI infrastructure powering advanced workloads in sectors ranging from healthcare to automotive and finance.

At the heart of ParTec's case is a patent covering their dynamic Modular System Architecture (dMSA)—a technology that allows different types of microprocessors, such as CPUs and GPUs, to dynamically coordinate and share workloads even during active calculations. This architecture is crucial for AI supercomputers that require efficient cooperation between processors to handle massive data and compute tasks in real time.

ParTec's dMSA technology is already deployed in some of Europe's largest supercomputers and is seen as a cornerstone for next-generation AI-focused systems. The company had initially explored collaboration with Nvidia back in 2019, sharing details of its patented ParaStation software and dMSA concepts.



Although Nvidia declined to jointly develop GPUs for supercomputers, the two companies worked together on various projects where Nvidia supplied GPUs. However, since ParTec initiated its patent lawsuits—particularly a high-profile case against Microsoft in Texas involving the same core technologies—Nvidia has ceased discussions on supplying GPUs for upcoming European supercomputer projects with ParTec.

The lawsuit demands Nvidia stop selling essential DGX products across 18 European countries where ParTec holds patent protection. ParTec is also seeking detailed sales disclosure and damages, highlighting the financial stakes of this dispute.

This escalation accentuates a broader tension in the AI hardware space: Europe's dependence on U.S.-based tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft for cutting-edge AI infrastructure, while European innovators like ParTec push to protect their intellectual property and stake a claim in this fast-growing market. ParTec's CEO Bernhard Frohwitter has voiced concerns that the current dominance of U.S. companies poses risks to Europe's status as a competitive high-tech hub.



Beyond the courtroom, the technical implications are significant. The dMSA patent represents a critical innovation in how supercomputers allocate processing tasks across heterogeneous architectures—an essential factor in AI model training efficiency and scalability. If ParTec's suit succeeds, it could force Nvidia to alter how it designs and sells its AI systems in Europe or negotiate licensing deals, potentially shifting competitive dynamics.

ParTec itself faces financial challenges but says it remains committed to advancing European supercomputing capabilities, including projects in AI and quantum computing. Its push to defend dMSA could not only secure revenue streams but also encourage broader adoption of its modular computing approach.

The outcome of this legal battle will be watched closely by AI developers, hardware manufacturers, and cloud providers, as it may set precedents impacting innovation, collaboration, and competition in AI supercomputing for years to come. These processes are slow, but if any interesting update surfaces in the coming weeks, we will be sure to follow it up with subsequent coverage.

The Federal government is allegedly placing hidden location trackers in some AI chip servers that are suspected of being at risk of diversion to China. Reuters reported that anonymous sources confirmed that U.S. authorities are employing this tactic as part of their investigation into the alleged smuggling of banned AI chips into China.

According to the report, the alleged tracking doesn't impact all shipments, but only ""targeted"" shipments believed to be at a high risk of being diverted to China. Despite the affordability and ubiquity of trackers, it will be prohibitively expensive to place several in all servers that are going through customs. It's more likely that the authorities are allegedly doing this to aid in a specific investigation. Although placing a tracker on a package typically requires a court order, Reuters notes that export enforcement agents may sometimes do so with administrative approval only.

It's unclear when this alleged practice started for semiconductors, but those involved in the AI chip supply chain seem aware of these actions. These trackers are reportedly often added to the shipping containers, the packaging of individual servers, or even within the server racks themselves. The report cites individuals who claim that they had seen images and videos of trackers being removed from Dell and Super Micro servers, some of them as large as smartphones.

Smugglers also apparently know this, with court documents in a recent case of smuggling millions of dollars' worth of chips to China revealing that a suspect instructed their co-conspirators to “pay attention to see if there is a tracker on it.”

Tom's Hardware reached out to Nvidia directly about this, but the company declined to comment on the issue. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, and the FBI also didn't issue a statement when asked by Reuters, although the sources confirm that these agencies are typically involved in these situations.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently denied that the company's most advanced AI chips are being diverted to China. However, multiple outlets confirm that there's a strong black market for these cutting-edge silicon, with a reported billion dollars' worth of Nvidia products being openly traded into the East Asian country in just the last quarter.

Washington is trying to hamper China's progress in AI, especially as it's considered a ‘dual-use technology' that is applicable in both civilian and military purposes. Because of this, the White House — across multiple administrations — has applied export controls on state-of-the-art semiconductors, including the most powerful AI chips from Nvidia and AMD. However, Huang has said that the U.S. export control was a failure, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary also saying that holding back China's chipmaking progress is a fool's errand.

Despite that, the Trump administration has doubled down on its efforts to control the flow of AI chips into China, even going as far as banning both the Nvidia H20 and the AMD MI308 in April 2025 — AI chips that have been especially designed to comply with the initial set of export controls released by the Federal government.

The U.S. has since backed down on this particular export control and has reopened the taps for these AI chips; the newer, more powerful variants of these semiconductors still aren't allowed to be shipped to China. In the most recent twist in the saga, AMD and Nvidia have struck a deal to share 15% of related sales revenue with the government in exchange for export licenses for its H20 and MI308, an unprecedented arrangement.

The U.S. has been clamping down on the alleged smuggling of high-end semiconductors. American allies such as Singapore are taking action to stop the flow of these AI chips through their borders. Furthermore, a bill has been filed in Congress to force American AI chip makers to add geo-tracking technology into their products. Nvidia is against this, though, saying that these ‘permanent flaws' would make their devices vulnerable to hackers. These developments have nonetheless led the Chinese government to question the integrity of the company's chips and have even discouraged their use.

Intermuscular fat plays a significant role in the development of cardiovascular disease, said Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez, PhD, professor of sports sciences at the European University of Madrid, Spain. He urged the scientific community and the public to look beyond traditional metrics like BMI and waist circumference. A recent study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism highlights the risks associated with “patients with apparent normal weight but hidden metabolic risk,” as emphasized by Clemente-Suárez in this interview with El Médico Interactivo, a Medscape Network platform.

What does the article published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism contribute regarding the distribution of body fat and cardiovascular risk?

This article provides an innovative view on how not only the total amount of body fat but its specific location affects cardiovascular risk. Traditionally, we have focused on abdominal visceral fat as the most dangerous, but this study shows that intermuscular fat also plays a key role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. This finding opens new research lines and highlights the importance of looking beyond BMI and abdominal circumference. In other words, it's not just about how much weight we have, but how it is distributed within the body, especially in tissues like muscle.

Why could fat accumulated between muscles be more dangerous?

It's a ‘hidden' type of fat that cannot be seen, but it works very actively at a metabolic level. This fat infiltrating the muscle fibers interferes with muscle function, reduces efficiency, promotes a chronic inflammatory state, and contributes to insulin resistance. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which is more passive, intermuscular fat has a pro-inflammatory effect and is associated with deeper and more silent health deterioration, particularly in metabolic and cardiovascular health, all without necessarily reflecting visible obesity.

What mechanisms explain the possible relationship between fat in the thighs and cardiometabolic risk?

Several key mechanisms could explain this association:

Who would benefit the most from this finding?

It may be particularly useful for patients who appear to have normal weight but are at risk of hidden metabolic issues, such as sedentary individuals, those with a family history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, or those with sarcopenia. It is also relevant for older adults, patients with metabolic syndrome, and postmenopausal women, where intermuscular fat may increase without noticeable changes in body weight. This helps us identify patients who might seem healthy based on conventional measures but have accumulated fat in areas where it has a negative impact on their health.

Could this study influence how cardiovascular risk is evaluated during consultations?

Absolutely. This research reinforces the need for a more holistic view of cardiometabolic risk that isn't limited to measuring weight, waist size, or cholesterol. In clinical practice, this could translate into:

As this evidence becomes more established, it's likely that in the future, we will incorporate more precise tools to assess this hidden fat, such as MRI or muscle scanning, for certain risk profiles.

What practical recommendations can be offered from medical consultations to prevent the accumulation of this fat?

From the perspective of a physician or sports sciences professional, we can recommend:

As you say, looking beyond BMI and abdominal circumference…

Indeed, studies like this remind us that cardiovascular and metabolic health cannot be assessed using just a scale or a tape measure. There is fat that isn't visible but may be silently working to increase our risk. That's why it's crucial to move toward personalized medicine, based on muscle tissue quality and active prevention through lifestyle changes.

Anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) demonstrated meaningful and sustained effectiveness in reducing monthly migraine days (MMDs) across three consecutive 1-year treatment cycles, but the relevant burden of the disease remained high.

""Our results underscore the importance of the identification of potential alternative concomitant non-CGRP [calcitonin gene-related peptide] dependent dysfunctional pathways in migraine individuals,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Gloria Vaghi, Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. It was published online on August 06, 2025, in Cephalalgia.

This study primarily included individuals with chronic migraine and medication overuse as it was conducted at tertiary headache centres that typically refer to the most complex, treatment ‐ resistant cases. The Italian regulations allowed treatment restart only for patients with more than 8 MMDs, which may have led to an underestimation of response rates. The study's findings may not be fully generalisable to all currently available mAbs treatments as most patients received erenumab and galcanezumab.

This study was supported by a research grant from the Italian Ministry of Health to IRCCS Mondino Foundation. Several authors declared receiving personal/consulting fees and travel grants from various pharmaceutical companies.

Native Hawaiians had a 71% increased risk for pancreatic cancer compared with White individuals, even after adjusting for known risk factors, found a study based on long-term follow-up data from approximately 80,000 individuals.

Previous studies have shown disproportionate risk for pancreatic cancer in different racial and ethnic groups, notably Native Hawaiians, but data on the risk factors driving this disparity are lacking, Brian Z. Huang, PhD, MPH, a cancer epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and colleagues wrote.

The researchers reviewed pancreatic cancer incidence and risk factors among 13,641 Native Hawaiians and 47,240 White adults who were part of the Multiethnic Cohort Study, an epidemiological study of more than 200,000 native Hawaiian and White individuals in Hawaii and Los Angeles.

Incidence pancreatic cancer rates per 100,000 person-years were almost double for Native Hawaiians compared with White individuals (80.2 vs 44.6) over an average follow-up period of 20.3 years, found the study, published online in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

After adjusting for five established risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of pancreatic cancer), Native Hawaiians overall had a higher risk for pancreatic cancer than White individuals (hazard ratio [HR], 1.71). Risks were elevated for Native Hawaiian men and women (HR, 1.54 and 1.85, respectively) compared with their White counterparts.

The risk for pancreatic cancer was elevated for Native Hawaiians relative to White individuals with the same specific risk factors, with HRs ranging from 1.5 to 2.27. The increased risk for Native Hawaiian men compared with White men was more pronounced among those with diabetes (HR, 3.1) than among those without diabetes (HR, 1.35).

The pancreatic cancer risk among Native Hawaiians increased with the number of risk factors. Native Hawaiians with zero, one, or two or more risk factors had 1.75, 1.90, and 3.69 times the risk, respectively, compared with White individuals with no risk factors. The association was greater in men than in women. Native Hawaiian men with two or more risk factors had more than five times the risk compared with White individuals (HR, 5.17), while Native Hawaiian women with two or more risk factors had approximately twice the risk (HR, 2.18).

Looking at specific risk factor profiles, Native Hawaiians with diabetes, obesity, and smoking had 3.41, 2.35, and 2.62 times the risk for pancreatic cancer, compared with White individuals with no risk factors.

Native Hawaiians with both diabetes and obesity had 3.69 times the risk for pancreatic cancer, whereas Native Hawaiians with both smoking and obesity had 2.99 times the risk compared with White individuals with no risk factors.

“We observed that the elevated pancreatic cancer risk for Native Hawaiians may largely stem from the higher prevalence of diabetes and/or the higher total number of risk factors within this population,” the researchers wrote. “Notably, the cumulative effect of multiple risk factors is more evident among males than females; thus, Native Hawaiian males with multiple risk factors may represent a high-risk group that could benefit from targeted pancreatic cancer screening efforts.”

Genetics also may play a role. In a subset of 19,542 study participants for whom genetic data were available, Native Hawaiians had an increased risk for pancreatic cancer compared with White individuals across high and low levels of polygenic risk scores for intra-pancreatic fat deposition and for pancreatic cancer.

“Future research is warranted to investigate other potential risk factors and biological or environmental mechanisms driving pancreatic cancer disparities among Native Hawaiians and other racial and ethnic minority populations,” the researchers wrote.

The study findings were limited by the use of self-reports of lifestyle risk factors and the assessment of them only at baseline, which did not account for any behavior changes over time, the researchers noted. However, the results were strengthened by the large study population and prospective design, they said.

The study is “an important step toward identifying high-risk patients to develop more effective ways of screening for pancreatic cancer,” Nicholas DeVito, MD, assistant professor at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, and a specialist in gastrointestinal malignancies, told Medscape Medical News.

“The effect size, meaning the increase in patients with pancreatic cancer, was particularly striking in male native Hawaiians with risk factors,” said DeVito, who was not involved in the study. “These risk factors were not nearly as profoundly impactful in the White population, implying that there is an underlying genetic risk that makes Native Hawaiians more prone to pancreatic cancer when known risk factors are present.”

Based on the study findings, “I would strongly recommend that all native Hawaiians reduce their risk factors to the best of their ability with the knowledge that it is more impactful on their pancreatic cancer chances than the same risk factors are in white populations,” DeVito said. “This is especially true of males, and if they are concerned, they should speak to their doctor about pancreatic cancer screening.”

Looking ahead, large-scale genetic and lifestyle studies that follow patients from multi-ethnic cohorts over their lifetime will be important, DeVito said. Such research could help determine the actual mechanisms of increased risk, namely what environmental or other risk factors are driving the dramatic increase in pancreatic cancer risk in this specific population, he said.

This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The researchers reported no financial conflicts of interest. DeVito had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines are typically avoided when managing end-of-life agitated delirium in patients with cancer because these drugs can precipitate, even worsen, delirium.

But a new multicenter trial found that patients with advanced cancer and delirium experienced greater reductions in agitation and restlessness at the end-of-life when given lorazepam compared with the more frequently used haloperidol.

“Lorazepam-based regimens were found to be more efficacious than haloperidol alone or placebo in reducing agitation and restlessness in patients who were admitted to the palliative care unit with persistent agitated delirium,” said study lead author David Hui, MD, professor of palliative, rehabilitation and integrative medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.

Delirium — a serious change in mental abilities that leads to confused thinking and a lack of awareness — affects more than 90% of patients in their last days or weeks of life, with up to 70% of these patients developing restlessness, agitation, or both. Although a common issue at the end-of-life, delirium often goes underrecognized and there are no guidelines for treating it.

The current analysis found that patients with advanced cancer and delirium who received lorazepam or a combination of haloperidol and lorazepam had lower Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores than those given haloperidol alone and required rescue medications less frequently to control breakthrough restlessness or agitation.

Although lorazepam-based regimens led to better symptom control in this patient population, the findings don't necessarily mean that all should receive a benzodiazepine, Hui told Medscape Medical News.

Managing delirium requires achieving a delicate balance between lowering the symptoms and preserving patients' alertness.

These final days are “one of the most precious times for families to interact with the patients,” Hui explained, and these new data can help oncologists and families “develop a personalized approach to the best management of delirium for a specific patient.”

Hui and his colleagues conducted the current study to better understand the risks and benefits of using neuroleptic or benzodiazepine agents to control restlessness and agitation intensity in patients with cancer and delirium receiving palliative care.

The study included patients aged 18 years or older with an advanced cancer diagnosis who had been admitted to an acute palliative care unit in Taiwan or the US from July 2019 to June 2023. Patients had delirium, a history of hyperactivity, and were taking standard-dose haloperidol (< 8 mg/d) or required 4 mg/d or more of rescue haloperidol for agitation in the past 24 hours.

Overall, 72 patients were randomized to one of four groups — scheduled haloperidol with dose escalation (12 mg/d), lorazepam alone, lorazepam plus haloperidol, and placebo on restlessness and agitation intensity in the advanced cancer patients. “For ethical reasons,” the authors said, the placebo group received lorazepam as a rescue medication.

The primary outcome was change in RASS score during the first 24 hours of treatment, though patients were followed for 30 days after medication administration. RASS scores spanned a 10-point scale, ranging from -5 to 4, with -5 representing deeply sedated or unarousable and 4 being combative.

At enrollment, all patients started taking 2 mg of haloperidol intravenously every 6 hours and 2 mg intravenously every hour as needed. Patients were monitored until they reached an RASS score of at least 1, at which time researchers switched to the blinded phase in which patients were randomized to their scheduled medication every 4 hours, plus a rescue medication every hour as needed.

RASS scores were initially similar in the four groups: 1.7 for haloperidol, 1.6 for lorazepam alone, 1.3 for lorazepam plus haloperidol, and 1.6 for placebo.

Within the first hour, RASS scores decreased significantly in all four groups, with the lowest scores in the two lorazepam groups.

The mean RASS change at 24 hours was -2.3 for the haloperidol alone group, -4.5 for the lorazepam group, -4.3 for the combination group, and -2.8 for the placebo group.

Compared with patients in the haloperidol group, those in the lorazepam and combination group had significantly lower RASS scores, with a mean difference of about -2.

The difference in RASS scores between the haloperidol and placebo groups was not significant (-0.5; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.7), nor was the difference between the combination and lorazepam groups (0.2; 95% CI, -1.1 to 1.4).

The combination and lorazepam groups needed significantly fewer rescue medications for breakthrough restlessness or agitation (32% and 37%, respectively) than the haloperidol and placebo groups (56% and 83%, respectively).

Hiu and colleagues also noted no differences in survival or adverse events between the groups.

“Taken together, these study findings highlight three options with light (haloperidol), moderate (lorazepam), and heavy (combination) sedation for persistent restlessness and agitation in the end-of-life setting,” the authors wrote.

Thomas B. Strouse, MD, who was not involved in the study, explained that overall “most practitioners would agree that combining a sedative-hypnotic like lorazepam or midazolam with an antipsychotic like haloperidol or olanzapine are reasonable strategies” for treating agitated delirium in the last days of life for someone with advanced cancer.

Strouse, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, explained that he and many colleagues often use antipsychotic agents other than haloperidol, such as olanzapine or quetiapine, which he said are more sedating with generally fewer side effects, particularly akathisia or motor restlessness that “can sometimes be hard to distinguish from the agitated delirium one is trying to reduce.”

In an invited commentary, palliative care experts Justin J. Sanders, MD, MSc, and James Downar, MDCM, MHSc, highlighted important questions raised by the trial.

Notably, the goal of managing agitated delirium is not typically about lowering RASS as much as possible but rather about achieving a mid-range of 0 to -2 where patients are calm but not over-sedated. However, most patients in the lorazepam groups achieved a mean RASS score below that target, meaning these patients were more heavily sedated, Sanders, of McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Downar, of the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, explained.

When managing delirium, there is often a trade-off between managing the agitated delirium and keeping patients aware and conscious enough to continue communicating, Sanders explained in an interview with Medscape Medical News.

Sanders discusses this trade-off with patients and families, telling them that “we have medications that can treat the delirium, but it will come at the expense of alertness.” He then works with families to help make the best decisions based on their values.

Overall, Sanders called this study “an extraordinary trial in our field,” citing its level of complexity, including the contributions from patients and families.

In a comment reacting to the study, Hiroyuki Otani, MD, of Kyushu Cancer Center in Fukuoka, Japan, agreed and elaborated on ambiguity of these end-of-life decisions.

“Deep sedation occupies a complex emotional and ethical space,” Otani wrote. “While it may relieve visible distress, it may also preclude final opportunities for expression — a glance, a whispered farewell, a final touch.”

The trial, Otani concluded, “calls us to reimagine sedation not merely as symptom control but as a final act of care — where relief, reverence, and relational presence converge at the threshold of life's end.”

Hui, Sanders, Strouse, and Otani had no disclosures.

In Western Finland, the longest-lived region thrives without following classic Blue Zone habits, while another community shows promising lifestyle patterns, challenging the idea that there's only one path to a long and healthy life.

Study: Searching for a Potential Blue Zone in the Nordics: A Study on Differences in Lifestyle and Health in Regions Varying in Longevity in Western Finland. Image Credit: Trygve Finkelsen / Shutterstock

Since their description in 1999 by Poulain and colleagues, ""Blue Zones"", geographical regions characterized by the unusual longevity of their inhabitants, have been identified worldwide. However, the Blue Zone framework has never explicitly investigated the Nordic areas. In a recent study published in the Journal of Aging Research, researchers evaluated four regions within Western Finland to see if any have the lifestyle principles typically associated with Blue Zones.

Study findings revealed an unexpected paradox – the most long-lived region, the Åland Islands, demonstrated the best health outcomes but did not adhere closely to the Blue Zone lifestyle. Conversely, areas demonstrating stronger adherence to these principles did not have uniformly high longevity. Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia deviated most significantly from Blue Zone principles. The findings suggest that in a Nordic welfare state context, factors beyond the classic Blue Zone lifestyle,  like environmental agreeableness, genetics, and socioeconomic resources, may be critical drivers of healthy aging, guiding public health policy in these regions that are gradually aging.

""Blue Zones"" are geographical areas where people live significantly longer (measured through rigorous demographic validation like extreme longevity indexes) and healthier lives. First identified in Ogliastra, Italy (1999), these longevity hotspots, which now also include Nicoya, Costa Rica, and Okinawa, Japan, famously share common lifestyle traits, popularly distilled into principles like ""move naturally,"" ""eat wisely,"" and ""avoid stress and get plenty of sleep"" (combined as one principle).

The Blue Zone framework's social and public health benefits cannot be understated, as the concept has inspired several global public health initiatives to leverage its principles to promote healthy aging. Critics, however, question whether the Blue Zone framework, derived from specific cultural contexts, can be universally applied, especially in regions such as Nordic welfare states with unique social and environmental landscapes that radically differ from those of validated Blue Zones.

The present study addresses this knowledge gap by searching for a potential Blue Zone in Western Finland, a region known for its linguistic diversity with previously reported notable differences in health and longevity between its Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking populations. This research additionally aims to validate whether the region with the highest longevity also shows the best health and the strongest adherence to established Blue Zone lifestyle principles.

The study leveraged data from four distinct populations in Western Finland that differ in language (ethnolinguistically) and longevity: 1. The Åland Islands (Swedish), 2. Ostrobothnia (bilingual), split into Swedish- and Finnish-speaking subgroups for analysis, and 3. South Ostrobothnia (Finnish). Official (government) statistics comprised the study's longevity data and were used to rank the regions on the longevity of their inhabitants. However, these statistics could not differentiate between language groups within Ostrobothnia.

Regions' health and lifestyle data were obtained from surveys collected from older adults (aged 66-91) in these regions as part of the Gerontological Regional Database (GERDA) in 2021-2022. However, the GERDA survey's self-response format may overrepresent healthier individuals, especially in Finnish-speaking regions with lower response rates.

Adherence to Blue Zone principles was assessed across seven core metrics plus an environmental supplement: 1. Move naturally, 2. Eat wisely, 3. Avoid stress and get plenty of sleep, 4. Strong family ties and community support, 5. Respect the planet, 6. A purpose in life, and 7. Environmental features (added as a supplementary principle). Health variables with known longevity associations (e.g., medical conditions and instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]) were used to measure healthy aging. Scoring was composite, with each principle awarded fractional points based on multiple sub-variables. Participants' sociodemographic data (age, sex, education status, etc.) were accounted for in statistical models (Analysis of Variance [ANOVAs]).

Longevity data confirmed that the Åland Islands were the most long-lived region, with a life expectancy at birth of 83.47 years (2020-2022), closely followed by Ostrobothnia (83.10 years), while South Ostrobothnia had the lowest (81.83 years). Åland also showed the highest rates of nonagenarians and centenarians.

Unexpectedly, however, health and lifestyle data analysis revealed that while Åland demonstrated the best overall health scores (e.g., lowest medication use, best dental health, and least pain), its inhabitants did not follow the core Blue Zone lifestyle closely, scoring only 1.23 out of a possible 7+ principles. Its main strength was ""environmental agreeableness"" (0.8/1), a measure of living in a pleasant, activity-promoting natural environment linked to its archipelago setting. Researchers attribute Åland's longevity to potential genetic advantages and higher socioeconomic status (education/income) alongside environmental factors.

In contrast, Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia and South Ostrobothnia showed the strongest adherence to the core Blue Zone lifestyle principles, both scoring 1.73. They demonstrated the highest adherence in principles related to ""strong family ties,"" ""community support,"" and ""purpose in life."" Both regions are part of Finland's religious ""Bible Belt,"" with high rates of religious activity potentially contributing to purpose-driven living. South Ostrobothnia additionally showed notable strength in ""respect for the planet."" Despite this, Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia had slightly lower longevity than Åland, and South Ostrobothnia had the poorest health and the lowest longevity of the studied regions. Critically, Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia scored 0, showing the weakest alignment with Blue Zone principles, yet had better health than South Ostrobothnia.

The present study challenges the universality of the Blue Zone framework and highlights that the pathways to a long and healthy life are not one-size-fits-all. In Nordic welfare states, longevity may stem from context-specific factors like environmental assets (Åland) or social-religious cohesion (Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia) rather than universal lifestyle principles. The researchers suggest Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia warrants further investigation as a potential Blue Zone candidate due to its balance of longevity, health, and lifestyle adherence.

Researchers at Arizona State University have developed a breakthrough diagnostic tool that could transform how quickly and reliably we detect illnesses like COVID-19, Ebola, AIDS or Lyme disease. The test uses just a single drop of blood, costs a couple of dollars and delivers results in only 15 minutes.

In a new study, the researchers show the test can detect the virus that causes COVID-19 with pinpoint accuracy, clearly distinguishing it from other infections.

The new diagnostic device, called NasRED (Nanoparticle-Supported Rapid Electronic Detection), is simple and portable enough to be used almost anywhere - from remote rural clinics to busy urban hospitals. The tool provides lab-quality accuracy without expensive equipment and does not require specialized training, giving it the potential to become a public health game changer.

We have the speed and ease of use of a rapid antigen test with sensitivity that's even better than lab-based tests. This is very difficult to achieve.""

Chao Wang, Study Lead Author, Associate Professor, School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University

Wang is an associate professor with the Biodesign Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics. He is joined by ASU researchers Yeji Choi, Seyedsina Mirjalili, Ashif Ikbal, Sean McClure, Maziyar Kalateh Mohammadi, Scott Clemens, Jose Solano, John Heggland, Tingting Zhang and Jiawei Zuo.

The research appears in the current issue of the journal ACS Nano. 

Infectious diseases are one of humanity's deadliest threats, causing immense suffering and economic damage worldwide. Collectively, infectious diseases cause over 10 million deaths around the world each year, and they are the leading cause of death in low-income countries.

Nearly 800,000 Americans die or are permanently disabled every year due to diagnostic errors, according to a study published in BMJ Quality & Safety. Many of these cases involve infections or vascular events that might have been treatable if caught early.

In many low- and middle-income countries, access to reliable diagnostic testing is limited or nonexistent. Expensive equipment, shortages of trained personnel and long turnaround times all contribute to delayed or missed diagnoses - often with deadly consequences.

A fast, affordable and portable test like NasRED would enable frontline health workers globally to detect infections early and respond before outbreaks spiral out of control.

""In many parts of the world, including the U.S., diseases are spreading, but people often don't get tested - even for something like HIV. Ideally, you'd want to test them regularly, to catch infections early,"" Wang says. ""For example, people who use injection drugs are at higher risk for HIV or HCV, but they may be living in the streets and hard to reach. If we don't test them consistently over time, we may miss the chance to intervene - until they develop serious complications like cancer or liver disease, when it's much harder to treat.""

At the core of the new test are tiny gold nanoparticles, engineered to detect extremely small amounts of disease-related proteins. Researchers coat these nanoparticles with special molecules designed to detect specific diseases.

Some nanoparticles carry antibodies, tiny molecules that act like magnets. Antibodies stick to proteins released by viruses or bacteria when they infect the body. Other nanoparticles carry antigens, fragments of proteins taken directly from viruses or bacteria themselves. These naturally attract antibodies produced by the body to fight infections.

Once coated, these nanoparticles are combined with a tiny sample of bodily fluid, such as a drop of blood, saliva or nasal fluid. If a disease is present, most nanoparticles will sink to the bottom of the tube. If there is no disease, they will remain suspended throughout the liquid.

The NasRED device shines a small beam of LED light through the liquid at the top of the tube. The team built a custom electronic detector that senses how much light gets through the tube. More light means the nanoparticles have sunk to the bottom, leaving the top fluid clearer, meaning that the disease is present.

The device is so sensitive it can detect disease even when only a few hundred molecules are present in a tiny fluid sample - just a fraction of a single drop. This is a concentration nearly 100,000 times lower than what standard laboratory tests require.

Adding to its promise is NasRED's portability and affordability. The current gold standards for testing, like PCR or ELISA, require expensive equipment and trained technicians. NasRED is compact and user-friendly. The researchers estimate each test costs $2, making it ideal for use in low-resource or remote locations.

NasRED has the potential to fill a critical diagnostic gap, especially for diseases that are difficult to detect early, such as hepatitis C, HIV, or Lyme disease. It is also promising for emerging outbreaks with low prevalence but high risk. Such diseases often go undiagnosed because running a lab test for just one or two patients isn't cost-effective. NasRED bridges that gap by offering a highly sensitive test that works immediately and economically at the point of care.

While NasRED currently requires small, benchtop machines for spinning and mixing samples, the researchers are working to further miniaturize and automate the process. With continued development, the technology might one day become a convenient home test, similar to existing rapid COVID-19 tests. However, it would have vastly superior sensitivity and broader applications.

Significant leap forward in diagnostics

NasRED dramatically surpasses existing diagnostic standards. The new study shows that NasRED is roughly 3,000 times more sensitive than ELISA, requires 16 times less sample volume, and delivers results approximately 30 times faster.

An earlier version of the technology detected Ebola in a tiny sample of blood. ""For the new technology, we pushed the sensitivity down to the attomolar range,"" Wang says. That's like detecting a single drop of ink in 20 Olympic swimming pools.

The technology holds promise for detecting viral loads directly from bodily fluids without the complicated sample preparation used in PCR-based methods. In preliminary tests with actual coronavirus particles, NasRED achieved sensitivities comparable to Abbott ID NOW, a popular molecular test for many diseases such as COVID-19.

""One of the strengths of our sensor is that it's highly modular,"" Wang says. ""The nanoparticles are designed so that we can easily swap in different proteins, allowing the same platform to be adapted for many different diseases. We've already demonstrated this approach in our research on Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, as well as cancer biomarkers, Alzheimer's-related proteins, Lyme disease and African swine fever.""

Wang recently received the Bay Area Lyme Foundation Emerging Leader Award and will make use of the high sensitivity and portability of this new technology to detect early Lyme infection.

As the technology evolves, its range of applications may extend beyond infectious diseases. Early detection of cancers, real-time monitoring of chronic illnesses and improved surveillance of public health threats are all within reach.

In a recently published study, researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center revealed for the first time that cancer cells can evade anti-cancer drugs by entering and surviving within bone marrow fibroblasts, a phenomenon they describe as ""cell-in-cell.""

The results of this five-year study, led by Y. Lynn Wang, MD, PhD, FCAP, a Professor and physician-scientist in the Department of Pathology and the Cell Signaling and Microenvironment Research Program at Fox Chase, could mark a major change in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and related diseases. CLL is the most common hematological cancer in western countries.

Our discovery that tumor cells can actually get inside bone marrow fibroblast cells, which support the tumor cells in their microenvironment, has never been reported before as a live phenomenon.""

Y. Lynn Wang, MD, PhD, FCAP, Professor and physician-scientist, Department of Pathology and the Cell Signaling and Microenvironment Research Program at Fox Chase

""This finding helps to explain why, even when CLL patients initially respond to treatment, many of them carry residual disease and later relapse. We are hopeful that our discovery will lead to treatments that better eliminate residual disease and move toward a cure for cancer,"" added Wang, who conducted the study with researchers at Fox Chase and other institutions.

BTK inhibitors, a class of anti-cancer drugs, are the current standard of care for CLL. Over 90% of patients who are treated with these drugs show an initial response - they feel better and their tumors shrink - but only 8% to 11% achieve complete remission in which clinically patients show no evidence of disease. This means that a high number of patients carry residual disease that leaves them vulnerable to relapse. Wang and her team wanted to understand how the disease manages to persist in spite of good initial response to the drugs.

Using confocal microscopy and other techniques, the researchers analyzed bone marrow samples from patients. They witnessed live CLL cells entering bone marrow fibroblasts in response to BTK exposure, and by recording continued independent movement of those subsumed cells, they were able to confirm that the cancer cells stayed alive inside the fibroblasts. Wang's team then demonstrated that the cancer cells hiding inside the fibroblasts had higher survival rates compared to the cells that remained outside the fibroblasts exposed to the drug.

""It's like the tumor cells are retreating off the street into a house where they're safer from the street bullies, i.e., the drugs,"" Wang said.

The way CLL cells do this, her team found, is by increasing the expression of CXCR4, a receptor protein on the surface of the tumor cells, in response to exposure to BTK inhibitors. The expression of this protein makes tumor cells sense a chemical gradient that draws the tumor cells closer to the fibroblasts that secrete the ligands for the receptor, allowing the former to enter the latter.

Once Wang and her team understood the mechanism by which tumor cells got inside their ""safe houses,"" they were able to demonstrate how clinicians might alter treatment to stop this from happening. By blocking CXCR4 with drugs approved for other clinical indications, the researchers prevented CLL cells from entering fibroblasts, potentially making the cancer more vulnerable to treatment.

""If we can block CXCR4, it's like locking the door of the house where tumor cells wanted to retreat and hide,"" said Wang. ""This could potentially increase complete response rates through combination therapy using both BTK inhibitors and CXCR4 blockers.""

The discovery may also have applications beyond CLL. The researchers found similar ""cell-in-cell"" hiding behavior in follicular lymphoma and suspect the mechanism could apply to many different cancer types. Wang is encouraged about the potential of her team's discovery.

""We want the larger scientific community to know about this mechanism so other researchers can build on these findings. If we can understand what makes cancer cells persist as residual disease, we can better treat cancer and move toward the ultimate goal of cancer elimination.""

Cells use various signaling molecules to regulate the nervous, immune, and vascular systems. Among these, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH₃) play important roles, but their chemical instability and gaseous nature make them difficult to generate or control externally. A KAIST research team has developed a platform that generates specific signaling molecules in situ from a single precursor under an applied electrical signal, enabling switch-like, precise spatiotemporal control of cellular responses. This approach could provide a foundation for future medical technologies such as electroceuticals, electrogenetics, and personalized cell therapies.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on August 11 that a research team led by Professor Jimin Park from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Jihan Kim's group, has developed a 'Bioelectrosynthesis Platform' capable of producing either nitric oxide or ammonia on demand using only an electrical signal. The platform allows control over the timing, spatial range, and duration of cell responses.

Inspired by enzymes involved in nitrite reduction, the researchers implemented an electrochemical strategy that selectively produces nitric oxide or ammonia from a single precursor, nitrite (NO₂⁻). By changing the catalyst, the team generated ammonia or nitric oxide from nitrite using a copper-molybdenum-sulfur catalyst (Cu2MoS4) and an iron-incorporated catalyst (FeCuMS4), respectively.

Through electrochemical measurements and computer simulations, the team revealed that Fe sites in the FeCuMoS4 catalyst bind nitric oxide intermediates more strongly, shifting product selectivity toward nitric oxide. Under the same electrical conditions, the Fe-containing catalyst preferentially produces nitric oxide, whereas the Cu2MoS4 catalyst favors ammonia production.

The research team demonstrated biological functionality by using the platform to activate ion channels in human cells. Specifically, electrochemically produced nitric oxide activated TRPV1 channels (responsive to heat and chemical stimuli), while electrochemically produced ammonia induced intracellular alkalinization and activated OTOP1 proton channels. By tuning the applied voltage and electrolysis duration, the team modulated the onset time, spatial extent, and termination of cellular responses, which effectively turned cellular signaling on and off like a switch.

Professor Jimin Park said, ""This work is significant because it enables precise cellular control by selectively producing signaling molecules with electricity. We believe it has strong potential for applications in electroceutical technologies targeting the nervous system or metabolic disorders.""

Myeongeun Lee and Jaewoong Lee, Ph.D. students in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at KAIST, served as the co-first authors. Professor Jihan Kim is a co-author. The paper was published online in 'Angewandte Chemie International Edition' on July 8, 2025 (DOI: 10.1002/ange.202508192).

Patients are still more likely to trust doctors and consider them more professional when they wear white coats, although women doctors in this attire are often misidentified as nurses or medical assistants, finds a review of the available research on the topic, published in the open access journal BMJ Open.

But patient preferences for doctors' attire seem to be strongly influenced by clinical context and medical specialty, with a growing acceptance of scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings, the findings indicate.

In the 19th century, doctors primarily wore black, because medical encounters were viewed as serious and formal occasions. But with the growing emphasis on hygiene and scientific advancements in medicine, white coats represented cleanliness and professionalism and became standard attire for doctors worldwide in the 20th century, note the researchers.

Since the publication of a previous comprehensive review of the published research on the impact of doctors' attire at work, which highlighted the significant role this has in patient satisfaction, trust, and adherence to medical advice, healthcare practices and societal expectations have evolved, they explain. 

The researchers therefore wanted to update those findings, broadening the scope to include diverse clinical contexts, in a bid to gain a deeper understanding of how doctors' attire might influence interactions with patients and treatment outcomes.

They scoured research databases for relevant studies published between January 2015 and August 2024. From an initial haul of 724 studies, 32 were eligible for inclusion in the review.

Most of the studies were carried out in the USA (17); two each came from Japan, China, and Pakistan; and the rest were carried out in Indonesia, India, Ethiopia, Korea, Germany, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Switzerland.

Clinical setting had some bearing on patient preferences. For example, palliative care doctors' attire didn't affect patients' trust, or assessments of the practitioner's capabilities, but patients preferred emergency care doctors to wear white coats or scrubs. And they were happy for primary care doctors to be dressed casually and to wear white coats.

Specialty also seemed to influence perceptions, with patient preferences for doctors to wear white coats observed in orthopaedics, surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, and obstetrics and gynaecology, for example.

The included studies indicated a distinct preference among patients for male doctors to wear suits. One study indicated that accessories, such as watches and glasses worn by male doctors significantly enhanced perceived professionalism and trustworthiness, which aligns with the findings of previously published studies, note the researchers.

The UK, however, has implemented a 'bare below the elbows' policy, which bans doctors from wearing white coats, watches, ties and long sleeves to minimise infection risks.

And even when male and female doctors wore identical attire, female doctors were still more likely to be misidentified as nurses or medical assistants-a misidentification that was consistently observed across different cultural settings. 

But patients preferred white coats over business or casual attire for both male and female doctors, and irrespective of gender, they favoured doctors wearing white coats, perceiving these practitioners to be trustworthy, respectful, skilled, communicative and empathetic.

Notably, male surgeons wearing a white coat over scrubs were looked on less favourably than those wearing a suit with a white coat, scrubs, or just a suit. On the other hand, female surgeons in white coats over scrubs were preferred over those in suits or casual attire. 

""This preference aligns with recent evidence indicating that female physicians are often judged more on appearance than their male counterparts. The way female physicians dress significantly influences perceptions of competence and professionalism, highlighting the gendered expectations that patients hold,"" write the researchers.

""These gender-specific preferences for surgical attire were each supported by a single study and warrant further validation… None the less, gender-related perceptions of physician attire were consistently reported across studies with a low risk of bias, supporting the robustness of this theme,"" they add.

A few studies explored doctors' attire during the COVID-19 pandemic, when numerous doctors reported a preference for wearing scrubs to prioritise hygiene and ease of movement.

These studies consistently reported a shift in patient preference towards practical and hygienic attire, such as scrubs and face masks, reflecting heightened sensitivity to infection control, say the researchers.

The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, in particular the fact that most of the included studies were carried out in the USA, there were none from South America, and only a few from European, Asian, and African countries. Many of the studies also relied on self-reported data, and none included children or patients with mental health issues.

""While the traditional white coat is seen as a symbol of professionalism and trust, patients have increasingly accepted scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings,"" they write.

""The expectations regarding attire are often gendered, particularly affecting the recognition and respect given to female physicians, which highlights the importance of institutional initiatives aimed at reducing bias and fostering equitable perceptions among patients,"" they add.

Medical institutions should consider adopting flexible dress codes that align with patient preferences for different clinical environments and medical specialties, they suggest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Understanding opioid safety and overdose prevention for older adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250813/Understanding-opioid-safety-and-overdose-prevention-for-older-adults.aspx","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:07:00 GMT","

With increasing age, older adults are more likely to encounter health conditions and injuries that require opioid therapy for pain relief. This reality means that opioid overdoses are a concern for older adults as well as for their family members and other caregivers.

A new Gerontological Society of America report, ""Staying Safe with Opioids at Home,"" describes questions about pain management and opioid reversal for older adults and their caregivers and presents a decision tree to guide their actions.

""Caregivers should take the steps described in this guide if someone has signs and symptoms that indicate an apparent overdose,"" the report states. ""To be prepared for a possible opioid overdose, naloxone should always be in the home if opioids are present or if any family members bring in opioids that were not purchased at a pharmacy.""

Organized into four key questions, the report covers monitoring, storage, and discarding opioids; the most common and most serious side effects of opioids; prior use of illicit drugs and possible use of recreational drugs during opioid therapy; and what to do if family members and other caregivers are concerned that an older adult has overdosed on opioids.

Among the key points emphasized in the report:

When a New York couple purchased a health insurance plan from a telemarketer, they thought it covered everything they wanted: doctor visits, tests, and medicine. But then came the unexpected bills for thousands of dollars, forcing them to skip crucial medical care. 

In their series ""Health Care Hustlers,"" Bloomberg reporters Zachary Mider and Zeke Faux revealed how this couple and thousands of other people signed up for health plans by unknowingly agreeing to work fake ""jobs."" 

Mider and Faux join ""An Arm and a Leg"" host Dan Weissmann to peel back the surprising layers of this story, from a TV-sitcom-writer-turned-investor who masterminded the idea to the legal gray area that allows these plans to proliferate.

Dan Weissmann  @danweissmann Host and producer of ""An Arm and a Leg.""

Previously, Dan was a staff reporter for Marketplace and Chicago's WBEZ. His work also appears on All Things Considered, Marketplace, the BBC, 99 Percent Invisible, and Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Note: ""An Arm and a Leg"" uses speech-recognition software to generate transcripts, which may contain errors. Please use the transcript as a tool but check the corresponding audio before quoting the podcast.

Dan: Hey there—

This story's outline may sound familiar, but what's underneath — what we unravel here: It's a new kind of thing. And it's weird. 

And it could become huge.

So: A couple from New York, Sarah and Joe Strohmenger started new businesses, so they needed to buy their own health insurance for the first time..

And Sarah says the New York state marketplace, with Obamacare plans, seemed a little risky: If they got a subsidy, and then their new businesses did well, they might have to pay that subsidy back.

Sarah Strohmenger: As new business owners, we had not a clue of how much we were gonna make in the year.

So we were nervous about. How much we were gonna have to back pay. 

Dan: Looking elsewhere seemed like a cautious thing to do. Google led them to a site that offered quotes for insurance policies — just enter your phone number. They started getting calls from telemarketers, a lot of them, and eventually they picked a plan one of them offered. 

Sarah and Joe thought they were being reasonably careful. After all, Insurance is a regulated business. 

Sarah Strohmenger: We're thinking it's monitored. We had no clue that this was kind of like a free for all.

Dan: So as you've probably already guessed: Pretty quickly, and very painfully, Sarah and Joe figured out that they'd been hustled. 

But it took a pair of reporters from Bloomberg News to uncover the nature of that hustle. 

Zach Mider: There's this kind of new breed of people offering health plans to the public that are not, um, not insurance companies at all, 

Dan: That's one of those Bloomberg reporters, Zach Mider. As Zach and his reporting partner Zeke Faux revealed, this telemarketer had — on paper — made Joe an employee of a company he'd never heard of until those reporters told him about it.

And according to the legal theory underneath all of this, making Joe a certain kind of employee allowed the salesman to sell Joe an insurance plan so skimpy that— as Zach and Zeke's story says — it would ""normally be illegal.""

Zach Mider says these kinds of plans currently operate in a legal grey area, with nobody regulating it — not states, not the feds. 

Zach Mider: So it really is just kind of this weird legal vacuum where, you know, market actors are free to kind of jump in and start trying to do this.

Dan: Which, Zach says, they seem to be doing, more and more. 

Zach Mider: It looks like the numbers are shooting up

Dan: In their Bloomberg story, Zach and Zeke cite hundreds of complaints to the FTC from people who were sold these kinds of health plans.

They also write about meeting the guy who seems to have invented these plans — a former TV sitcom writer who they say actually believes he's solving an important problem.

Their reporting — in a series called ""Health Care Hustlers"" — shows something else too: 

How each hustle gets created by a chain of legally-distinct operators — some of them truly operating completely independently of each other — and how, by being just one link in a chain, each operator can say:

""I was just doing a totally legit thing. It's not my fault if some other guy is shady.""

Basically: These stories are showing us, more clearly than I've ever seen, what we're up against when we take a call from somebody who says they've got a great insurance plan for us.

And it's a totally wild ride. Here we go.

This is An Arm and a Leg, a show about why health care costs so freaking much, and what we can maybe do about it. I'm Dan Weissmann. I'm a reporter, and I like a challenge. So the job we've chosen here is to take on one of the most enraging, terrifying, depressing parts of American life — and bring you something entertaining, empowering and useful.

To start, here's how bad things got for Sarah and Joe Strohmenger.

As they knew: They needed good health insurance. They've got pre-existing conditions.

For instance, Joe takes medicine that Sarah says costs 1500 dollars a month. And he's got a benign brain tumor and has a doctor monitoring it. 

Sarah Strohmenger: That doctor was the most important doctor because it's a doctor you can't afford without health insurance.

Dan: Sarah says the monitoring includes periodic bloodwork and MRIs.

So she says when they were picking this plan, they asked about the doctor, about the tests, about the medicine, all their providers.

She says the sales rep for this plan told them, Yes. That is all covered.

Sarah Strohmenger: You know, it sounded great, covered everything that we needed.

Dan: Joe and Sarah paid about 87 hundred dollars upfront— a discount for a full year's coverage. 

But Sarah says once they tried actually using the plan, things went south. She says their pharmacist told her Joe's medicine wasn't covered, and Joe's doctor said his visits weren't covered either.

And she says bills arrived that she did not expect.

Sarah Strohmenger: We were getting blood work bills back in the mail, for like $4,000 at a pop at a time, 3000.

Dan: According to the Bloomberg story, Joe called the company they'd bought the policy from— and reached a guy who said upgrading their plan would fix everything. They ultimately paid 20 thousand dollars for insurance that still didn't cover what they needed.

Sarah says she thinks they also ended up on the hook for 10 to 15 thousand dollars in medical bills. 

Sarah Strohmenger: Within like six months, we stopped going to doctors.

Dan: They couldn't afford to.

Sarah Strohmenger: We just were like, if we end up in the hospital, we're basically screwed, you know? So Joe stopped going to all of his doctor's appointments, he stopped taking his medication, and it was bad.

Dan: Meanwhile, Sarah says they also complained to state regulators about the company that sold them this policy.

The regulators wrote back, saying: We've never licensed or approved this entity. So… sorry. Sarah was like, Wait, WHAT? 

Sarah Strohmenger: I lived in a paradox that I didn't know existed for a year. My mind was blown. 

Dan: I'm telling you — it's REALLY weird. I've seen the letter, that's what it says. And no: It's not like there's some other state office Sarah was supposed to write to. I checked.

Sarah says she and Joe took legal action against the marketing company, but they haven't recovered any money. She says they paid off all the bills. And she says they signed up for a plan on New York's Obamacare marketplace, which has been covering what they need. 

But she never understood what the heck had happened — the nature of the hustle — until she sent her story as a tip to Bloomberg News, and Zach Mider got in touch.

As it happened, he'd been digging into exactly this kind of hustle. 

Which has, I have to say, just an amazing number of layers and twists. Starting here:

When Zach looked at Sarah and Joe's insurance cards, he noticed something that they had missed.

The name of a GROUP at the top — like as if this was a group plan, like you'd get from your job. 

And that was a key to the whole arrangement. That group — Outreach Data Partners Limited Partnership — is not an insurance company.

As Zach puts it, their legal stance is: They haven't sold insurance to Sarah and Joe — or anybody else. That's not the relationship.

Zach Mider: They're claiming they have an employer-employee relationship with the people who buy health plans from them, and therefore, all of the state insurance laws don't apply. 

Dan: Now, first: It's actually true that for most people who get health benefits from their employer — like two-thirds — state insurance laws don't apply. Lots of employers operate plans regulated by the federal Department of Labor.

Which Zach says is how Outreach Data Partners set up the plan Sarah and Joe bought.

All of which was news to Sarah and Joe.

Zach Mider: They just thought they were buying health insurance. 

Dan: And if they're workers here, what was the JOB supposed to be?

Zach Mider: Yeah, that's a great question. So, there is some work that is supposed to be done.

Dan: OK, strap in: Zach says to start with, in theory, the company gives you a special browser to use on your phone.

Zach Mider: The idea is if you want to go do something on the internet, you use this special browser and they're collecting data about people's browsing habits which then they can turn around and sell that information to advertisers.

Dan: So that's the ""job"": By using this browser, you're producing value for the company— you're working for them. Joe and Sarah told Zach they never got any special browser. And of course there's another thing they might have expected to get from a job, ANY job: A paycheck.

And here's how Zach says that absence gets explained.

Zach Mider: These data companies have been described to me as sort of, they're startups, right?

Dan: And here's where the full name of this company comes into play: ?Outreach Data Partners Limited Partnership. On paper, Joe and Sarah aren't mere employees, they're … limited partners— part owners. But in a company that hasn't started making money yet. 

Zach Mider: Maybe they have a millionth share of the company. And so if the company starts making a lot of money, they will get a check. 

Dan: I don't think Joe and Sarah are holding their breath for a check from Outreach Data Partners.

According to the Bloomberg story the company doesn't have a public-facing website, and LinkedIn doesn't list any employees. But the story also says that in a government filing the company claims 4,800 workers.

Zach and Zeke checked out the company's headquarters: Box 371 at a UPS store in an Atlanta strip mall — between a dry cleaner and a Vietnamese restaurant. 

They found more than a dozen other companies using the same mailbox as their address — companies with names like Consumer Data Partners. All told, their story says these companies claim more than 30,000 employees.

And when Zach and Zeke started calling people connected to those companies, they ended up talking with the guy who seems to have invented what they call this fake-jobs healthcare setup.

A guy named Bill Bryan.

Zach Mider: Bill Bryan, was a pretty successful sitcom writer in the eighties and nineties. He wrote for Night Court

Judge from Night Court: What's up Mac?

Mack from Night Court: A little case of disturbing the piece at a Star Trek convention, sir.

Zach Mider: And Coach

Craig Nelson: I didn't lose the game. The team lost the game. I didn't.

Zach Mider: And he wrote for a bunch of others. And then he does some real estate deals. He gets involved in some other investments. He ends up being a fairly wealthy guy and looking for new things to invest in, and comes across the idea of doing something with health plans.

Dan: ?Zach says, the idea was this: Obamacare had imposed standards on a lot of health insurance. Minimum stuff that had to be covered. Hospitalization. Mental health services. Prescription drugs. But covering all that stuff is expensive. It means premiums can be high, even with subsidies. And deductibles can be super-high: Thousands of dollars.

So Bill Bryan thought… 

Zach Mider: maybe if there was a way of designing a product that was legal. That covered less stuff than Obamacare, but still gave people what they wanted. You know? Um, it's a free country. Maybe people should be able to decide what kind of healthcare they wanna buy and not have to meet all these minimum standards that maybe they're not interested in.

Dan: So the plan that Sarah and Joe got sold, Zach says it does not meet those minimum standards. He says it covers like three doctor visits a year, a couple of lab services, and not a lot else.

Zach Mider: No coverage for hospitalization, no cover for emergency room visits. There is a prescription or there is a pharmacy benefit, but it only covers generics. 

Dan: Zach says Bill Bryan really thinks: that's a product somebody might prefer to an Obamacare plan with a high deductible. Under the Affordable Care Act, you can't sell that product as insurance. Actually, if you have a lot of employees, you can't offer it to them either. 

But as a health-insurance law expert at Georgetown told me: You could maybe offer it to OWNERS of your company.

So by making people like Joe and Sarah LIMITED PARTNERS, maybe you could offer them this kind of super-stripped-down health plan legally.

Zach says: Bill Bryan thinks of this as a way to fix a problem he sees with Obamacare: Full coverage is too expensive for some people. 

Zach Mider: He's a very smart guy, and so over the years he's had to fight a lot for this, and I think that's only kind of strengthened his conviction that it would be a corrective to the Obamacare system to have something that's more affordable and more accessible for people to get.

Dan:Of course, that's not what Joe and Sarah wanted - price wasn't their top concern. They needed insurance that covered their providers, their treatments, their tests, their meds. That's what they thought they were paying for.

I asked Zach and Zeke, what does Bill Bryan say about the kind of thing that happened to Joe and Sarah? 

Zach Mider: So it, it's really important to point out here that like Bill Bryan didn't sell the plan to Joe and Sarah. You know, he doesn't do the call centers, right? These salespeople are all kind of independent operators who are essentially just selling this stuff for a commission. And so, he certainly doesn't defend anybody misleading a customer.

Dan: According to Bloomberg's story, Bryan said he had cut ties with the agency that sold Joe and Sarah their plan — years ago. 

And when he was told that the agency had sold the couple one of his plans much more recently, Bryan said, ""That is absolutely news to me. I just don't have anything more to say about any of these motherfuckers."" 

Zeke Faux: When we were talking with Bryan, though…

Dan: That's Zach's reporting partner, Zeke Faux.

Zeke Faux: …he and his colleagues were pretty evasive about exactly how these plans are sold.

Dan: Zeke says the way the plans are sold — specifically, the big commission rates for salespeople — was one of the reasons he and Zach got interested in this story in the first place.

Zeke Faux: Basically, the percentage of whatever the customer's paying that is going to the salesman and the various middlemen involved is so high that it's kind of hard to imagine that the customer could be getting a good deal. 

Dan: Even if the plan was cheap. Zach had pulled some data, crunched some numbers. The Bloomberg story says— at least in some cases— all those commissions and fees added up to 74 percent of what people like Joe and Sarah paid for these plans.

Zach Mider: If a person's paying a dollar almost 74 cents is gonna go to commission to other various middlemen and whatever and only 26 cents is left for actually going into the pool from which medical care is paid out of. 

Dan: 26 cents for medical care. So, just to compare. Obamacare requires insurance plans to spend at least 80 cents of every dollar on medical care.

Everything else — your sales operation, all your admin costs — including the people who deny claims— and your CEO's pay, and your profits — has to come out of that remaining 20 cents. 

With Bill Bryan's plans, Zach's numbers show that ratio can get almost flipped: 26 cents for medical care. 74 cents for commissions, fees, everything else

Zeke says: They brought these issues up to Bill Bryan. 

Zeke Faux: And when we tried to ask about that, Bryan and his colleagues pleaded ignorance, as if it was not really their business how the salesmen got paid.

Dan: And this is a big, big theme in this story: There's no SINGLE entity doing all of this. It's a chain of different players, and each one can blame the others.

Bill Bryan blamed the sales outfit for what happened to Joe and Sarah. 

And that company? Their CEO told Zach and Zeke that Outreach Data Partners screwed up, denying claims for the Strohmengers that should've been paid. And as the Bloomberg story reports: Bill Bryan dismissed that notion.

But there are more links in this chain than that. For instance, Outreach Data Partners — the company that theoretically made Joe and Sarah limited partners?

Bill Bryan does not run it. He doesn't run ANY of the companies that employ 30,000 people from a mailbox in an Atlanta strip mall.

Which isn't to say that he has nothing to do with them. That's next.

This episode of An Arm and a Leg is produced in partnership with KFF Health News. That's a nonprofit newsroom covering health issues in America. Their journalists do amazing work. We're honored to be their colleagues.

So, Bill Bryan seems to be the mastermind behind what Bloomberg calls these 30,000 fake-jobs, and the health plans they offer.

But no, he doesn't run the data companies behind those jobs. That would be illegal. 

Zach Mider: The data companies themselves wouldn't be allowed under federal labor law to turn a profit on these health plans.

Dan: I mean, that sounds like a good law: Your boss isn't supposed to make money by selling you a health plan. 

Zach Mider: So it's all very segregated. They're very careful to say these data companies are separate from us. The data companies are employing these people and they are sponsoring these health plans. And Bill Bryan's role is he runs a series of vendors which provides services to the data companies.

Dan: Services like … running a health plan! Which, for a normal company, is a normal arrangement.

Remember how we said: Lots of employer health plans — ones tied to normal jobs— are exempt from state insurance laws?

The way those plans are set up, the employer normally hires a vendor — typically a big insurance company, like Blue Cross or Aetna — to run their health plan.

These data companies, instead of hiring Aetna to administer a health plan — for their 30 thousand ""limited partners"" — they're hiring a company that Bill Bryan happens to run.

Zach Mider: I think he's done a pretty good job of keeping these things formally separate, right? So he's not formally in control. He doesn't own the data companies, doesn't formally direct their activities.

Dan: But Zach says: Bill Bryan seems to have had a hand in getting them set up. So they could offer health plans. That he could run.

Zach Mider: I think it's fair to say that this was his and his partner's idea, this whole kind of construct. But he's tried pretty hard to, as a formal matter, make it compliant with federal labor law.

Zeke Faux: I feel like we should call the data companies and be like, hey, I can see that you have a lot of complaints about your health plan. It might be hurting recruiting. You know, would you like to switch to Aetna? Then we could find out if, uh — how independent they are.

Dan: That's Zeke again, and yeah: He and Zach wrote in their story that they found HUNDREDS of complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, and the Better Business Bureau, and Apple's App store about health plans tied to fake jobs.

A graphic that goes with their story shows dozens of quotes, like: This whole thing feels like a big scam that I fell for.

And: I can't imagine I am the only person who has been lied to and basically stolen from.

And: Stay away at all costs.

Which raises a big question: Is any of this really legal? Isn't there someone regulating it?

Zach says Bill Bryan wants answers to those questions too. 

Seven years ago, a data company the Bloomberg story describes as ""allied with Bryan"" went to the Labor Department for clarification— and validation. Basically, they said:

Zach Mider: We want you to sign off on this and confirm to everyone in the marketplace that this is legit. That these are real employees, these limited partner employees who are downloading the web browser are real employees, and that therefore we can sell 'em, these health plans without any problem. And the Department of Labor when push came to shove said, no, these aren't employees. You're just trying to sell insurance.

Dan: Bryan's allies went to court to fight back. 

Zach Mider: And they're still fighting over it all these many years later. That was 2018 when they were first trying to get this opinion. And um, now it's 2025 and it's still unresolved. 

Dan: ?Here's what's happened so far: A district judge ruled against the Labor Department, calling its opinion ""arbitrary and capricious."" An appeals court later agreed with that conclusion, but sent the case back to the district court to reconsider other details, including: what should happen next.

Zach Mider: So the way it stands, it's really in a kind of strange limbo, where the Department of Labor really doesn't get to say, these are legit, or these are not while we wait for the litigation to play out. But it does open the door for other people like Bill Bryan to come into the marketplace and start selling this kind of stuff. 

Dan: And it looks like they have. The Bloomberg story has a chart, showing the number of households enrolled in ""fake jobs"" plans. After the appeals court ruled against the labor department, the numbers more than doubled.

And meanwhile, NOBODY is regulating these plans. They're not traditional insurance plans, so state insurance departments don't have jurisdiction. So with the federal case on hold, people like Sarah and Joe have no one to turn to.

In a letter to the editor that Bloomberg published, Bill Bryan blames what happened to people like Sarah and Joe on the Labor Department, for not validating his model.

""If the department stepped up and played its proper role,"" he wrote, ""the fraud reported in your story could have very well been prevented.""

He added: ""At a minimum, it would give victims someplace to seek recourse.""

So: everybody's got somebody else to blame. 

Which is one of the themes that connects Bill Bryan's story with a totally WILD tale that Zeke traced to Florida. One that doesn't start out sounding like it has anything to do with health insurance.

In 2024, he writes, ""if you were poor and online, certain ads were everywhere you looked.""

These ads featured celebrity deepfakes — promising 6 thousand four hundred dollars, if you call a certain phone number. 

Zeke Faux: I mean, it looks like it's Taylor Swift, and she's saying…

Fake Taylor Swift: Remember those stimulus checks? Well, there's a new thing going viral. 

Zeke Faux: Or it's Dr. Phil and he's saying..

Fake Dr. Phil: They're giving out $6,400 to anyone who makes the call 

Zeke Faux: Or Andrew Tate saying…

Fake Andrew Tate: If you don't act now, you're basically throwing away $6,400. That's just stupid.

Zeke Faux: And these ads didn't even, they might briefly mention health insurance or maybe they don't say health insurance at all.

Dan: But if you called that number, you'd end up talking with someone ready to sign you up for health insurance. 

Sign you up so quickly that… you might not have any idea that's what had just happened. 

Or, for that matter, that no, you would not be getting 64 hundred bucks to spend.

This story goes in some WILD directions, but here's how Zeke describes the connection with the fake-jobs saga. 

Zeke Faux: in reporting both of these stories, I think what we learned is that there is kind of a subculture of call center operators who have turned what seems like a pretty boring business selling health insurance into a get rich quick kind of operation.

Dan: The call centers, the telemarketers. That's the connection— Bloomberg paired these stories under the heading ""Health Care Hustlers.""And those hustlers are always looking for a new angle. 

Which is to say: Zeke and Zach's stories reinforce a big Arm and a Leg rule: 

If the internet leads you to a phone call with someone who says they've got a GREAT health insurance deal for you… be very, very suspicious.

And a lot of people will be looking for deals on health insurance. 

During the Biden Administration, Congress added more-generous subsidies to Obamacare plans, which made them more affordable. 

Unless Congress re-ups them soon— which seems unlikely— those extra subsidies will expire this year. 

People will look for alternatives, and these call centers will offer them.

In a way, it's back to the future: 

The first Trump Administration loosened certain rules, making it easier to sell short-term plans that didn't meet Obamacare standards. Zeke says he reported on the results back then.

Zeke Faux: I spoke with people who had bought these plans and then had medical emergencies and been stuck with 50 or a hundred thousand dollar bills, so we'll be — we're kinda watching to see what new products emerge or what these call centers start selling. 

Dan: And meanwhile, just — look: Don't buy insurance over the phone from somebody you've never met. Don't bother with google. Healthcare dot gov. That's basically it. 

What you'll find there, I'm not saying you'll love it. It's probably gonna cost more than you want to pay, and deductibles will likely be high. 

But even though subsidies for Obamacare plans aren't AS generous this year, they still exist. And these policies are regulated. Anything else… like Sarah Strohmenger said, it's a free-for-all. And there are some hustlers out there. 

Meanwhile: the Trump Administration and Congress have both set up changes to the ACA marketplaces — administrative hassles that will make it harder to get, and keep, your coverage.

The time to start planning for it is now. And we're gonna have some help for you, starting with next week's First Aid Kit newsletter.

In a new trial, a centuries-old yogic breathing practice using a conch shell showed measurable benefits for sleep apnea, offering a simple, non-invasive alternative to conventional treatments.

Study: Efficacy of blowing shankh on moderate sleep apnea: a randomised control trial. Image credit: Eivaisla/Shutterstock.com

A clinical trial conducted by researchers from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute, India, demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of shankh blowing in relieving obstructive sleep apnea symptoms through respiratory muscle training. The trial report is published in ERJ Open Research.  

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder, characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete upper respiratory obstruction during sleep. The condition often leads to intermittent hypoxia and interrupted sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure is the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. In this treatment, a machine continuously supplies air to the respiratory tract through a mask to prevent airway collapse during sleep.

Despite satisfactory therapeutic efficacy, patients' acceptance and adherence to continuous positive airway pressure therapy are low, causing a significant barrier to effective management of obstructive sleep apnea. Moreover, this therapy is not recommended for less symptomatic patients, particularly those with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

For this group of less symptomatic patients, mandibular advancement devices, weight loss, positional therapy, and surgery, are alternative treatment options with variable efficacy. Upper respiratory muscle training through playing wind musical instruments is considered a helpful approach for managing moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

Given the proven benefits of respiratory muscle training, researchers at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of shankh blowing in improving moderate obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.

Shankh blowing is a yogic breathing exercise involving forceful exhalation through a conch shell. It is expected to strengthen respiratory muscles and improve lung function. The shankh, especially the Indian Shankh, has a unique spiraling structure and an inner cavity. When blown, it produces a resonating sound believed to hold healing properties.

The study screened 62 individuals, of whom 38 were randomized (19 to each group). The trial enrolled 30 individuals with moderate obstructive sleep apnea. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group.

The intervention group participants were trained to blow the shankh and were asked to perform it at home for a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week, for six months. Participants attended monthly follow-up visits, where the technique was reviewed and compliance logs (≥80% sessions) were recorded. The control group participants followed the same schedule to perform a sham procedure involving deep breathing exercises.

At the end of the trial period (after six months), all participants were evaluated for daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, and sleep apnea severity.

The trial findings revealed that shankh blowing, performed for six months, is significantly more effective than deep breathing exercises (sham procedure) in reducing daytime sleepiness, improving sleep quality, and ameliorating sleep apnea severity.

The participants who performed shankh blowing for six months experienced significant reductions in body mass index (a measure of overweight or obesity). In contrast, the control group participants experienced a significant increase. For example, BMI decreased by 0.33 kg/m2 in the intervention groups compared to an increase of 0.53 kg/m2 in controls.

Daytime sleepiness scores (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) decreased by 5.0 points in the intervention group (34% reduction) versus 0.3 points in the control group, while sleep quality score (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) improved by -1.8 points in the intervention group compared to worsening of +1.3 points in controls.

Overall, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) fell by 4.4 events/h in the intervention group compared to an increase of 1.2 events/h in controls, leading to a between-group difference of -5.62 events/h. Significant reductions were observed for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) AHI (-22.8%) and rapid eye movement (REM) AHI (-21.8%) in the intervention group, whereas controls showed non-significant increases.

The trial highlights the therapeutic potential of blowing shankh in adult individuals with moderate obstructive sleep apnea. According to the findings, six months of shankh blowing leads to a 34% reduction in daytime sleepiness. The observed 21.8% reduction in apnea events during REM sleep holds clinical significance, as REM-related respiratory events often correlate with greater cardiovascular and neurocognitive risks.

The trial finds a significant improvement in oxygen saturation at night among participants who performed six-month shankh blowing (+7.1% in the lowest nocturnal SpO2 vs. -1.7% in controls). This measure was not a predefined endpoint; the authors note it warrants further study. This observation also holds clinical significance, as nocturnal desaturation is known to increase cardiovascular risk in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.

The researchers suggest that the observed improvements can be attributed to respiratory muscle training through shankh blowing. This interpretation is further supported by the observed reduction in neck circumference, suggesting upper airway remodeling through shankh blowing.

The current trial findings, together with previous research findings, suggest that training and strengthening oropharyngeal and thoracic muscles through blowing shankh or playing specific musical instruments may reduce the risk of upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to improvement of sleep-related outcomes and reduction of sleep apnea severity.

The trial provides a novel intervention to manage obstructive sleep apnea-related outcomes. However, the open-label trial design may introduce performance bias, where participants' and researchers' knowledge of the treatment assignment may influence their behavior and responses. Although monthly reviews were conducted, the authors acknowledge that the possible influence of other exercises or activities on the observed improvements cannot be ruled out. The authors also note that the relatively small sample size, single-center setting, and per-protocol analysis may limit generalizability and could overestimate the effect sizes.

The trial did not assess comprehensive oxygenation parameters such as the oxygen desaturation index or the duration of desaturation events. Future trials should include these parameters to more conclusively understand the physiological impact and clinical significance of shankh blowing. However, this proof-of-concept trial provides a foundation for future research to evaluate the applicability of blowing shankh as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Love hormone oxytocin found to be critical for the formation of friendships","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250812/Love-hormone-oxytocin-found-to-be-critical-for-the-formation-of-friendships.aspx","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 03:01:00 GMT","

A new UC Berkeley study shows that the so-called love hormone, oxytocin, is also critical for the formation of friendships.

Oxytocin is released in the brain during sex, childbirth, breastfeeding and social interactions and contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust. Never mind that it's also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the ""cuddle"" or ""happy"" hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising.

But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They've shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or ""social monogamy,"" or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds.

Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships. Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person's ability to form or maintain social bonds.

Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it's similar to and different from other types of relationships.""

Annaliese Beery, a UC Berkeley associate professor of integrative biology and neuroscience and senior author of the study

Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. Prairie voles that are close friends typically huddle side by side, groom and even sit on one another.

""Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: 'I prefer you to this stranger,' for example,"" Beery said. ""The animals that didn't have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away.""

The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments - they didn't work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers.

""In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in who they are social with, their selectivity,"" she said.

Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.

""That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain,"" said Beery.

The study was published Aug. 8 in the journal Current Biology.

Beery has long been interested in social relationships in rodents, focusing primarily on the animals' seldom-studied peer or friendship relationships. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what's species-specific versus generalizable across species.

To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding's ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species - there are about 50 worldwide - to compare their social behavior.

She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships.

""While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we've tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. So there seems to be this widespread tendency to bond,"" Beery said. ""But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Someday, I hope to be able to tell you, 'Do selective peer relationships precede the development of monogamy? Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?' I think this familiarity preference is deeply rooted.""

Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study.

But while oxytocin isn't essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or ""null mutant"") prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate.

Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles' friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments. In one, they tested how long it took for voles to establish a preference for a partner. Whereas normal voles take about 24 hours of close proximity to form a relationship that makes them choose that partner over a stranger, oxytocin receptor-deficient voles showed no preference in that amount of time, and took up to a week to establish a peer preference.

""Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other,"" Beery said. ""Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn't required to have a relationship, but it's really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently.""

They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. In such a situation, normal voles would hang out with known friends until they eventually started to socialize with strangers.

""They can all separate, they can all come together, or they can hang out in any combinations that they want,"" she said. ""The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It's like if I went to a party with a friend, I would stand near that friend for the first part of the party and then I might start to mingle. The voles that lack oxytocin receptors just mixed. It was as if they didn't even have a partner in there with them.""

In the third experiment, they tested the strength of both peer and mate bonding by having the voles press levers to get access to either a friend/mate or a stranger.

""Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships,"" Beery said. ""That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways.""

Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships.

On the flip side, voles lacking oxytocin receptors were also less aggressive toward strangers and less avoidant of them. 

""You can see contributions of oxytocin signaling to both sides of selectivity,"" Beery said. ""On the prosocial side, it's involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it's aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. We've seen effects of oxytocin on both affiliation and aggression in our other studies in prairie voles, and it parallels human findings on a role of oxytocin in in-group/out-group dynamics.""

The researchers used a new oxytocin sensor developed in Landry's UC Berkeley lab to determine whether lack of an oxytocin receptor caused increases or decreases in oxytocin release. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors.

Landry, an associate professor in the departments of chemical and biomolecular engineering, neuroscience, and molecular and cell biology and a co-corresponding author of the paper, created these sensors from carbon nanotubes joined with specific single-stranded DNA sequences selected because they latch onto the oxytocin molecule and fluoresce. Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles' brains. In fact, oxytocin was being released in lower amounts from fewer sites in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for social reward across species.

Co-authors with Black, Komatsu, Beery, Landry and Manoli are Jiaxuan Zhao, Scarlet Taskey and Nicole Serrano of UC Berkeley, and Ruchira Sharma of UCSF. Beery's work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CAREER award 2239635) and the National Institutes of Health (R01MH132908). Komatsu is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois.

33m ago

Four years ago, Gio Reyna looked destined to be among the faces of the 2026 World Cup. Such was his rapid rise and prodigious talent, able to carve up Mexico on his dribble and dependably contribute to Champions League regular Borussia Dortmund's attack. A shoo-in for the U.S. men's national team squad in Qatar, it seemed only natural that he'd be a leading man by the time the next World Cup came to North America.

Advertisement

Instead, his perceived valuation is rapidly deteriorating — a ‘reverse Labubu' scenario at a pivotal point of his career.

For over half a decade, Reyna was the hot commodity among a bunch of burgeoning talents from the United States. Even as Christian Pulisic became a USMNT regular as a teenager and earned a record-setting move to Chelsea, whispers were that the son of Claudio Reyna was an even bigger prospect. When he debuted in 2020, he joined Dortmund teammates Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham among the most-hyped surefire stars of his generation.

The association hasn't aged well. While Haaland and Bellingham are leading figures for club and country, Reyna, presently, is hardly relevant for either.

Late last week, Dortmund confirmed that Reyna had lost his claim on the No. 7 shirt he had donned for four seasons. That very marketable digit is instead in the custody of Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother who arrived this summer as an upgrade in the position that Reyna plays. It wasn't a subtle handoff, either; atop an otherwise mundane “updated squad numbers” post, the club plastered a large banner of Bellingham pointing to his new number — inherited from a player just three years his senior.

At the Club World Cup, Bellingham (wearing 77 at the time) debuted mere days after signing, logging 228 minutes as Dortmund reached the quarterfinal. Reyna, who was propped up by FIFA for an interview on the tournament staged in his home country, was given a meager 12-minute cameo in the group stage finale when the main men were given the briefest of reprieve.

One suspects it would be much of the same if Reyna, now assigned shirt No. 21, sticks around. You can't fault the club for planning to move forward from a stagnated former prospect. The trick, for Reyna, is to do the same.

Advertisement

Simply, the streets of availability and opportunity have too seldom intersected. Reyna has a concerningly long injury ledger for a player who won't turn 23 until November. For most players, querying their name into Google gives autocompleted suggestions like “highlights,” “transfers,” or, for the most gawkerish of fans, some synonym of “partner.” For Reyna, “injury” is among the top assumptions.



Every year, Bundesliga teams play 34 league games totaling 3,060 minutes outside of stoppage time. Since the start of 2021-22, Reyna has logged just 1,929 minutes — fewer than he played in 2020-21 alone, and 15.8% of all available minutes.

The injury issues compound on such a high-pressure club when you aren't a guaranteed starter. Dortmund has changed coaches six times, counting the handoffs from managers to an interim to the permanent successor as two changes.

Each new coach concocts a crash course to identify who he can trust on his new squad. As coaches survey what each player has done lately, they'll see that Reyna misses considerable time with injuries, a reason to wonder how dependable he'll be for the task at hand. Other players get a look, they impress, they carve out roles in the rotation, and Reyna's path to playing time gets even more obstructed.

The trick, then, is to find a coach and a situation where Reyna can confidently be entrusted with a consistent, if not leading, role.

Clubs willing to take that gamble may not present the most favorable optics for the Gio Reyna brand, which still sees him as a very marketable figure with upside. A move to a mid-to-lower table club like Parma (a Serie A side to which Reyna has been linked this summer) would come with banterish suggestions that he's a flop. Facing the wrath of a thousand EA FC players whose Ultimate Teams have already found new dynamic playmakers shouldn't matter now. Not when such a move — one with playing time on offer — would undoubtedly be in Reyna's best interests.

Club transfers are a rare time when a coach can handpick an option to fit into his squad. Such an endorsement comes with trust and optimism that there's a role to be filled by the new signing. That backing carries into practice, then into picking a team if the player's training has been of the requisite standard. It's a fresh look that Reyna desperately needs.

It's a chance he had once, albeit with one vital difference. Reyna's loan away to Nottingham Forest was supposed to provide that change of scenery in the 2023-24 winter window. It seemed as though he could help unpick locks and add more dynamism to the recently promoted side.

The problem: Forest was in the thick of the relegation battle. While the sporting department surely would have loved to see Reyna get more time, Nuno Espirito Santo leaned into players with Premier League experience to stave off the drop. So while the club's absolute aim was achieved, it was a scenario that did little, if anything, to give Reyna a boost.

While the fit seemed imperfect almost immediately, Dortmund's hand was forced. It had held out hoping for a more lucrative offer until the final day of the window. It's a race against the clock that the club is seemingly prepared to face again as the close of this summer's window looms on September 1.

There would be a crucial difference between joining a projected bottom-half side now compared to at the end of the winter window: time. Rather than being a late arriver desperate to earn minutes, he would be part of the core from Matchday 1. It's an advantage that is rapidly waning, as teams have concluded preseason and are now fully preparing for season-opening fixtures.

Every day that Reyna stays at Dortmund is a wasted one if a move is mandatory for progress. Surely, he must recognize the urgency to resolve this years-long saga. Something has to give.

Those lower-bracket clubs that would most benefit from Reyna's services often operate far below Dortmund's stated asking price. Publicly available reporting suggests that linked suitor Parma hasn't spent over $15 million (€12.85 million) on a transfer fee in over two decades. Even if a generous sell-on cut was brokered, it's hard to envision Dortmund letting go of a one-time whiz kid for even that sum.

A half-year loan stint in MLS could help Reyna see the field and reignite a spark in potential suitors down the road (Reyna's current Dortmund contract is up after this season). Speculation is that Reyna has no interest in such a step, though, as those pesky optics suggest a move stateside may paint him as a player unable to return to a Champions League standard. Only Reyna could prove that narrative wrong.

These would still be playable games in a quality first-division league with exceptional facilities. Playing regularly in MLS has only bolstered Diego Luna's case to be among Mauricio Pochettino's playmakers, not hurt it. If Luna makes the squad for the 2026 World Cup, it could quite possibly come at Reyna's expense as an alternative in the same role.

Somewhere, somehow, there must be a rapid solution. For a now-rudderless young player and his boyhood club that seems quite ready to move on, compromises may need to be found.

If not, the consequences will be felt most by Reyna, not Dortmund. If it results in Reyna missing a home World Cup, the impact on his career and legacy could be irrevocably damning.

Chelsea will pay their players more than £10million in bonuses for winning the Club World Cup.

The west London club were crowned champions of FIFA's newly-expanded tournament in July, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Their success in the tournament earned the club an estimated $114.6million (£84.4m).

Chelsea have subsequently allocated a $15.5m (£11.4m) fund to be distributed equally between the players who represented Enzo Maresca's side during the tournament.

The overall value of each payment tallies more than $500k before it's subjected to currency conversion costs from US dollars into UK pound sterling, alongside relevant employer costs, taxes and social security costs.

Chelsea took home more than $100m in prize money for their participation in the four-week tournament in the United States with runners-up PSG winning $106.9m and Real Madrid $82.5m.

The added income has helped fund another busy summer in the transfer market with Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato and Liam Delap among a number of new arrivals at Stamford Bridge.

Maresca's team kick off their 2025-26 Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday.

Chelsea has relocated their FIFA Club World Cup Winners badge on the shirts for the new season.

As seen in today's media shoot, the golden commemorative badge has been moved higher up on the chest, sitting above the Nike swoosh and crest rather than in the center. The new positioning creates an unusual aesthetic.

The reason for Chelsea's move of the badge is possibly that the roundel Club World Cup badge is larger than Chelsea's own crest, creating a hierarchy that seems backwards. The prominence of the FIFA badge over the club's traditional emblem is surely not optimal, even though it is reduced a little bit by moving it up.

Original FIFA Club World Cup badge - still used for the old Club World Cup winners

The previous shield-style FIFA Club World Cup design from earlier years is being fondly remembered by many supporters who preferred its more understated appearance. That badge integrated more naturally with the shirt's overall design and didn't dominate the visual space.

While Chelsea earned the right to display the badge after their 2025 Club World Cup triumph, the execution of its placement has left many questioning whether bigger necessarily means better when it comes to kit design.

Chelsea will wear the badge for at least four years, so the big golden badge is here to stay. It remains to be seen if we will get used to it, but we certainly will.

Do you prefer the new Club World Cup badge position? Would you like FIFA to return to the shield-style design? Let us know in the comments below.","{'href': 'https://www.footyheadlines.com', 'title': 'Footy Headlines'}","soccer"

UCL

Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain meet on Wednesday for the European Super Cup, a game between the winners of last season's Champions League and Europa League.

Thomas Frank has the chance to lift a trophy in his first game as Spurs' head coach, and PSG will be looking to show they are still Europe's dominant team, despite a 3-0 defeat against Chelsea in the Club World Cup final last month.

Here, The Athletic's Liam Tharme (PSG) and Elias Burke (Spurs) will guide you through each club's summer activity, what to expect at Udinese's Stadio Friuli, and just how much this match matters…

Liam Tharme: It's hard to call PSG weak considering their past 12 months — winning the quadruple, including the Champions League that they had obsessed over — but the 3-0 defeat against Chelsea in the Club World Cup final was chastening.

Three goals in 21 minutes took the final out of PSG's reach before half-time, a significant contrast from their dominance in two other finals in 2025: they were 2-0 up after 20 minutes in both the Coupe de France final versus Reims and the Champions League final against Inter.

Up until the final in the United States, their well-coached passing game allowed them to dictate the tempo in sweltering conditions before blowing away tired teams.

It has been a reserved summer of transfers from PSG, at least by their standards, but the signing of Illia Zabarnyi from Bournemouth adds depth at centre-back. They have continued to hoover up the best Ligue 1 talent, too, bringing in goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier from Lille.

First-choice goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is not in the squad amid speculation over his future, so expect Chevalier or No 2 Matvei Safonov to start. Midfielder Joao Neves is suspended after being sent off in the Club World Cup final. Otherwise, PSG should be at full strength.

Elias Burke: If last week's 4-0 friendly defeat away at Bayern Munich is anything to go by, Tottenham are not heading into this game in great shape. An anterior cruciate ligament injury to James Maddison has left Spurs' midfield short on creativity, but at least the signing of Joao Palhinha should stabilise a defence that conceded 65 goals in the league last season.



Dominic Solanke has not featured in pre-season since playing the first half in Spurs' 2-0 win over Reading on July 19, and may not be fit to start, leaving Spurs without several key attacking players.

The club are in the market to fill the voids left by Maddison and Son Heung-min, who was sold to Los Angeles FC this month, with rumours linking Spurs to Manchester City winger Savinho. Given his squad is still not entirely ready, Frank may be wishing this fixture could have fallen a week or two later.

Tharme: Seriously. PSG have only played in one European Super Cup final, back in 1996, after they won the Cup Winners' Cup (a defunct continental tournament for domestic cup winners).

Juventus beat them 9-1 across two legs, including a 6-1 battering at the Parc des Princes, where PSG were 4-0 down by half-time.

Reimagination has been the theme under Luis Enrique since his arrival as head coach three years ago — PSG are creating their own, younger superstars instead of buying them outright.

Burke: If any Spurs fans had forgotten the feeling of winning silverware after a 17-year trophy drought, the celebrations following last season's Europa League triumph will have reminded them how galvanising it is. For Frank, Wednesday's game provides an early chance to win silverware and curb any lingering doubts over the club's decision to part with Ange Postecoglou.

It's also an opportunity for the players to test themselves against the European champions before a Champions League campaign. Giving a good account of themselves against the holders should help build confidence within the squad that they can progress from the league phase and approach the knockout stages with belief.

Tharme: Flexibility in attack. If Postecoglou had still been in charge of Spurs, PSG's intense, suffocating high pressing against his short build-up approach would have made for a tactical spectacle. Under Frank, Tottenham are expected to be much more pragmatic.

Spurs' varied approach increases the importance of PSG's box-crashing and underlapping runs from right-back Achraf Hakimi and left-back Nuno Mendes. So often, as for the opener in the Champions League final, one of PSG's full-backs becomes the spare, untracked player in the box.

Watch out for Ousmane Dembele's fluid positioning, too. He has been reinvented from a winger to a central ‘No 9' under Luis Enrique, though he still drops deep and can just as often be the one to create a goal as score it.

Burke: As it is Frank's first competitive game in charge of Tottenham, there's very little for Luis Enrique to analyse. Spurs set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation against Bayern, but they could benefit from the element of surprise should Frank tweak his system in Italy.

Tharme: PSG's dominance of the ball and territory could open up space for Tottenham to exploit on the break. Take your pick from Mathys Tel, Brennan Johnson, Mohammed Kudus or Wilson Odobert, and you can see the abundance of ball-carrying and running power in Frank's squad.

Only Liverpool (14) scored more than Tottenham's 10 goals from Opta-defined ‘fast breaks' last season. PSG are generally quick to win the ball back after losing it, but they did concede four goals from the five fast-break shots they faced, so swift counter-attacking moves could be dangerous.

Burke: Without Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, who will miss the start of the season with a knee injury, there is a concerning lack of creativity in Tottenham's midfield. Spurs scored two goals in their last four pre-season friendlies, including a drab 0-0 draw away against Luton Town.

Pape Matar Sarr's industry has provided a necessary alternative for Frank as an advanced midfield, with the Senegal international's ability to win the ball high up the pitch proving effective against Wycombe Wanderers and Arsenal. Whether Frank opts for Sarr or tries Lucas Bergvall or Odobert as the third midfielder may have a bearing on Tottenham's attacking display against PSG.

Tharme: Luis Enrique has turned PSG into one of the most feared sides in Europe. Underpinned by a focus on control over chaos, the former Barcelona and Spain head coach has made PSG less reliant on moments of individual brilliance and more refined as a collective unit.

“We want to be ready to go for all the titles,” Luis Enrique told UEFA. “We all believe that we can win all of them and repeat this feat again this year, which would mean going down in history in true style, and that gives us special motivation.

“The aim for this upcoming season is to improve. In terms of titles, it's going to be harder because there are more to play for. But in footballing terms, we'll improve as a team, both in attack and defence. We can still identify phases of the game to get better in.”

Burke: Frank is experienced at Premier League level, but taking a side into a major European game will be entirely new for the 51-year-old. Replacing Postecoglou, who proved his European chops by taking Spurs all the way in the Europa League last term, the onus is on the Dane to make Tottenham competitive in the Champions League this season. This is his first opportunity to demonstrate his tactical nous in Europe against the finest the continent has to offer.

Frank seemed to be up for the challenge, telling reporters, “For the club, for the team, for me, for everybody involved at Tottenham Hotspur, it's a massive game. A great challenge and an even bigger opportunity. That's how my brain works, I see opportunities instead of pressure.”

How do we fill the days until the 2026 World Cup? By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. 

Three of the continent's Big Five circuits – England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Ligue 1 in France – kick off this weekend, with Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A following on Aug. 22 and 23, respectively. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. 

But these are the 20 clubs to watch, loaded with the stars we'll be seeing next summer. Ahead of the top European campaigns kicking off, let's count down the teams who'll shine the brightest.

Note: League positions reflect last season's finish.

So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million.   

Last year, the Reds ran away with the Premier League title, besting second-place Arsenal by 10 points. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. No wonder they're the favorites to retain the English title.

Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Who says they can't? Eighteen-year-old Lamine Yamal is on his way to becoming the world's best player — if he isn't already. Fellow Ballon d'Or candidate Raphinha had 34 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, doubling his previous career-best. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Pedri runs the show behind them. The rest of the regulars return, too, with forward Marcus Rashford the marquee summer addition. 

After finishing fourth in the Prem last term, the Blues stunned many by winning the expanded, 32-team Club World Cup in July. Can they harness that momentum and use it to challenge for English and European titles next spring? They've got the firepower. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens.

The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. Still, Arsenal continues to improve. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. And they've added real quality this summer in the form of defensive midfielder Martín Zubimendi and forwards Viktor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke. 

The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. 

City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. 

Having reached the UEFA Champions League final in two of the last three seasons, nobody should underestimate the Nerazzurri. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. 

After losing the German title to Bayer Leverkusen in 2023-24, Bayern reclaimed its status as the Bundesliga's standard-bearer last season, finishing as champs for the 12th time in 13 seasons.  Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help.

Can Atleti end their four-year title drought and beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to La Liga glory this season? Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. 

Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. Neither will forward Noa Lang, who helped PSV reach the knockout stage in each of the last two years. 

The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. 

Juve got the proven, consistent goalscorer they've long needed when the ""Old Lady"" inked Canadian striker Jonathan David on a free transfer from Lille following the Concacaf Gold Cup. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup.

The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. But most of the vets that took the Black & Yellow to the 2024 Champions League final remain, not least captain Emre Can, playmaker Julian Brandt and Swiss keeper Gregor Kobel. 

It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. 

Plenty of big names — think Mbappé, Thierry Henry and George Weah — have come through the Principality over the years. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. Both should help in the Champions League, with Les Rouge et Blancs looking to reach the round of 16 for the first time since 2017. 

The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. But stout defender Jarell Quansah, fellow $40 million man (and USMNT star) Malik Tillman, and new boss Eric ten Hag should help keep the club near the top of the Bundesliga. 

As Dutch champs the last two years, PSV has also pushed above its weight in the Champions League, reaching the knockout stages twice and knocking out Italian titans Juventus last season. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz.

The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. 

The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.

Two designers from different eras reflect on the changing look of soccer through logo design

Lance Wyman is among America's greatest-ever graphic designers, and his fingerprints are all over any number of American cities.

Wyman's style is instantly recognizable – simple, bold and clever. Wyman often works in wayfaring, and his signs and instructions to viewers often use simple, geometric shapes to get the job done, often incorporating a playfulness as well. His approach has made his work timeless. In 2011, when the government of the District of Columbia wanted their metro map updated, they went right back to Wyman, who had crafted the original design for the system about 40 years earlier.

His most notable work, though, came early on in his career. In the late 60s, Wyman, along with a handful of others, was tasked with creating the visual identity for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was a massive task, especially for a young designer only a half-decade removed from college.

Determined to get the assignment right, Wyman moved to Mexico in the months leading up to his deadline and immersed himself in the country's culture. He dived into archives, visited archaeological sites and spoke to locals. Slowly, he started to pick up design cues – from the yarn paintings of the indigenous Huichol in western Mexico, to the Aztec stone carvings that have always helped define the country's visual identity.

What Wyman helped produce is almost universally recognized as one of the greatest assemblages of sports design ever created. The logotype for the tournament alone – that hypnotic, concentric “MEXICO 68” – blended the country's culture with the Op Art movement. Wyman and his team created event posters, wayfaring signage and more and within years their designs dotted the landscape of the entire city.

In 1970, when the country hosted its first-ever World Cup, they went right back to Wyman's logotype, and Wyman himself created a handful of other designs for the tournament. It feels fair to say that the visual identity of that tournament may well be the most instantly-recognizable design work of any World Cup in history.

I reached Wyman a couple of years ago, at his office in New York City. Then 86, his work had understandably slowed. The World Cup is returning to Mexico in 2026, and I was eager to gather his thoughts on some of the early designs associated with the tournament, particularly Fifa's official World Cup logo.

“I did see it, yes,” Wyman said back then. “It's not that effective. It's not really identifiable when it goes small, so that's certainly a problem. It certainly doesn't say ‘soccer.' I remember the first time I saw the [European] Champions League logo, I thought that was pretty clever. This … I'm just not so sure there's a lot you can do with it.”

The logo felt phoned-in back then, as it does now. It was crafted by Fifa's in-house design team and accompanied by the requisite explainer graphic and even a presentation by Fifa itself, who espoused its valors: scalability and adaptability. It's less a logo and more of a logo system, they explained, allowing them to adapt the image to different devices and even alter it to suit different host cities in the tournament's host countries. It's the same thing Wyman did expertly in 68, just worse.

My view, of course, is purely subjective – as are most things related to art and design. But looking at the logo got me thinking more broadly about the direction of crests and design as a whole in American soccer.

More recently, the crest for Denver Summit FC – the NWSL's latest expansion club, which will debut in 2026 – only intensified what I'd already been thinking: why do these things all look the same in recent years? And despite that, why are some so inspiring, and some so … bland?

In some ways, Vermont-based designer Matthew Wolff holds the keys to the design direction of American club soccer. His work spans the entirety of the men's and women's game, having handled some of MLS' most well-received crests, elegant designs for LAFC and NYC FC among them. In the NWSL, Wolff was most recently tapped to craft a new logo for the club now known as Boston Legacy (after that club rolled out maybe the most roundly criticized name and brand in American soccer history.

His work dots the lower leagues as well, where several of his crests have felt like instant classics – Union Omaha, and even recent USL League 2 champions Vermont Green, a club Wolff helped co-found.

“I was at the right place at the right time,” said Wolff. “I think about the trajectory of American soccer in parallel to where I was in my education and my early career. [Everybody] has known that American soccer was going to explode for years and years. So I think I somewhat intentionally positioned myself to be ready, willing and able to create football crests in the United States.”

Wolff's works sometimes feels a little bit like Lyman's: uncluttered, bold, simple. Like Wyman did in ‘68, Wolff operates in a space where his work often ends up being representative of the community that commissioned it and he often incorporates elements of those places into his final design.

That's easy enough to see in NYC FC's crest, which looks like an old subway token, or the crest that Wolff designed for the NWSL's Gotham FC, which prominently features the Statue of Liberty. Others feel a lot more esoteric, like the crest Wolff crafted for USL's One Knox FC. That one, which features a color palette inspired by a handful of Knoxville's local monuments, feels distinctly more generic, as does Denver's.

It's an aesthetic summed up on a podcast I heard recently. In it, the host was raving about Denver's new crest, saying it would feel right at home on the side of a reusable metal water bottle. To that person, that was a compliment. At times, though, that type of ubiquity can rob a design of its character.

Wolff himself acknowledges the reality of design work as a whole. His job is done for the client, to meet the needs of their brief, not necessarily his own tastes or preferences.

“My ideal vision is kind of irrelevant to these crests,” says Wolff. “I'm trying to answer a brief, some parameters that have been set by a club or by me and the club together. There's obviously an infinite number of ways you can execute it, even in the tightest of briefs. If you told me ‘OK, this crest needs to have a heraldic lion that's blue, and be in a circle and say Chelsea at the top and Football Club at the bottom and have some ornaments … there are still infinite ways I can design that. I don't really think about my own tastes in the crests as much as ‘is this answering the brief.”

Designers, in other words, are only part of the equation these days in terms of crafting a brand identity.

“[The process] has been pulled away from graphic designers - specialists - and pulled into this nebulous room of other people who make design decisions by committee,” said Ben Mahler, a former creative director at MLS club DC United. “Marketing directors, focus groups, analytics driven shit, it all ends up pushing things into safer territory. It's losing the artistic side and the wonkiness that comes from an individual.”

Wolff, and any other designer in this space, is also subject to the mercy of the audience, so to speak. Bos Nation is far from the only club to have course corrected after an initial misstep – when the Chicago Fire rolled out an absolutely atrocious rebrand in 2019, their fans were enraged. The Fire turned to Wolff to solve that problem, and he did so with a much cleaner, easier-to look at design.

“These designs are meant to represent the fans and the club,” said Wolff. “And if the fans, or the community see this crest and they feel it doesn't represent them, then I think they're well within their rights to let the club know. These fans are the ones who the clubs are asking to buy a $100 kit. And sure, there are examples where people make comments [about a crest] that are a little ridiculous. But by and large, I get it.”

For his part, Wyman, who grew up in Kearny, New Jersey (an American soccer holy land in and of itself) told me he's never been asked to do a soccer crest. A few years back he partnered with a non-profit to help design a soccer ball, which turned out great: the red, blue and white design is bedecked with stars. It feels a bit like the design of the old North American Soccer League's ball, used through the ‘70s and early ‘80s.

Outside that, Wyman's work has largely been done for companies and local municipalities. Looking at his designs, it's hard to imagine why some club out there wouldn't bring him into the fold. Wolff's work is often fantastic, but some variety might be nice, too. Maybe some club out there could take a chance on the person whose designs have been thrown on nearly every logo-related mood board in existence, over the years.

“Every once in a while something will come along with sports, but for the most part, my work has been focused elsewhere,” Wyman said a couple of years back. “I'd love to take a crest on, if I had the opportunity.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Two designers from different eras reflect on the changing look of soccer through logo design

Lance Wyman is among America's greatest-ever graphic designers, and his fingerprints are all over any number of American cities.

Wyman's style is instantly recognizable – simple, bold and clever. Wyman often works in wayfaring, and his signs and instructions to viewers often use simple, geometric shapes to get the job done, often incorporating a playfulness as well. His approach has made his work timeless. In 2011, when the government of the District of Columbia wanted their metro map updated, they went right back to Wyman, who had crafted the original design for the system about 40 years earlier.

His most notable work, though, came early on in his career. In the late 60s, Wyman, along with a handful of others, was tasked with creating the visual identity for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was a massive task, especially for a young designer only a half-decade removed from college.

Determined to get the assignment right, Wyman moved to Mexico in the months leading up to his deadline and immersed himself in the country's culture. He dived into archives, visited archaeological sites and spoke to locals. Slowly, he started to pick up design cues – from the yarn paintings of the indigenous Huichol in western Mexico, to the Aztec stone carvings that have always helped define the country's visual identity.

What Wyman helped produce is almost universally recognized as one of the greatest assemblages of sports design ever created. The logotype for the tournament alone – that hypnotic, concentric “MEXICO 68” – blended the country's culture with the Op Art movement. Wyman and his team created event posters, wayfaring signage and more and within years their designs dotted the landscape of the entire city.

In 1970, when the country hosted its first-ever World Cup, they went right back to Wyman's logotype, and Wyman himself created a handful of other designs for the tournament. It feels fair to say that the visual identity of that tournament may well be the most instantly-recognizable design work of any World Cup in history.

I reached Wyman a couple of years ago, at his office in New York City. Then 86, his work had understandably slowed. The World Cup is returning to Mexico in 2026, and I was eager to gather his thoughts on some of the early designs associated with the tournament, particularly Fifa's official World Cup logo.

“I did see it, yes,” Wyman said back then. “It's not that effective. It's not really identifiable when it goes small, so that's certainly a problem. It certainly doesn't say ‘soccer.' I remember the first time I saw the [European] Champions League logo, I thought that was pretty clever. This … I'm just not so sure there's a lot you can do with it.”

The logo felt phoned-in back then, as it does now. It was crafted by Fifa's in-house design team and accompanied by the requisite explainer graphic and even a presentation by Fifa itself, who espoused its valors: scalability and adaptability. It's less a logo and more of a logo system, they explained, allowing them to adapt the image to different devices and even alter it to suit different host cities in the tournament's host countries. It's the same thing Wyman did expertly in 68, just worse.

My view, of course, is purely subjective – as are most things related to art and design. But looking at the logo got me thinking more broadly about the direction of crests and design as a whole in American soccer.

More recently, the crest for Denver Summit FC – the NWSL's latest expansion club, which will debut in 2026 – only intensified what I'd already been thinking: why do these things all look the same in recent years? And despite that, why are some so inspiring, and some so … bland?

In some ways, Vermont-based designer Matthew Wolff holds the keys to the design direction of American club soccer. His work spans the entirety of the men's and women's game, having handled some of MLS' most well-received crests, elegant designs for LAFC and NYC FC among them. In the NWSL, Wolff was most recently tapped to craft a new logo for the club now known as Boston Legacy (after that club rolled out maybe the most roundly criticized name and brand in American soccer history.

His work dots the lower leagues as well, where several of his crests have felt like instant classics – Union Omaha, and even recent USL League 2 champions Vermont Green, a club Wolff helped co-found.

“I was at the right place at the right time,” said Wolff. “I think about the trajectory of American soccer in parallel to where I was in my education and my early career. [Everybody] has known that American soccer was going to explode for years and years. So I think I somewhat intentionally positioned myself to be ready, willing and able to create football crests in the United States.”

Wolff's works sometimes feels a little bit like Lyman's: uncluttered, bold, simple. Like Wyman did in ‘68, Wolff operates in a space where his work often ends up being representative of the community that commissioned it and he often incorporates elements of those places into his final design.

That's easy enough to see in NYC FC's crest, which looks like an old subway token, or the crest that Wolff designed for the NWSL's Gotham FC, which prominently features the Statue of Liberty. Others feel a lot more esoteric, like the crest Wolff crafted for USL's One Knox FC. That one, which features a color palette inspired by a handful of Knoxville's local monuments, feels distinctly more generic, as does Denver's.

It's an aesthetic summed up on a podcast I heard recently. In it, the host was raving about Denver's new crest, saying it would feel right at home on the side of a reusable metal water bottle. To that person, that was a compliment. At times, though, that type of ubiquity can rob a design of its character.

Wolff himself acknowledges the reality of design work as a whole. His job is done for the client, to meet the needs of their brief, not necessarily his own tastes or preferences.

“My ideal vision is kind of irrelevant to these crests,” says Wolff. “I'm trying to answer a brief, some parameters that have been set by a club or by me and the club together. There's obviously an infinite number of ways you can execute it, even in the tightest of briefs. If you told me ‘OK, this crest needs to have a heraldic lion that's blue, and be in a circle and say Chelsea at the top and Football Club at the bottom and have some ornaments … there are still infinite ways I can design that. I don't really think about my own tastes in the crests as much as ‘is this answering the brief.”

Designers, in other words, are only part of the equation these days in terms of crafting a brand identity.

“[The process] has been pulled away from graphic designers - specialists - and pulled into this nebulous room of other people who make design decisions by committee,” said Ben Mahler, a former creative director at MLS club DC United. “Marketing directors, focus groups, analytics driven shit, it all ends up pushing things into safer territory.

12s ago

Four years ago, Gio Reyna looked destined to be among the faces of the 2026 World Cup. Such was his rapid rise and prodigious talent, able to carve up Mexico on his dribble and dependably contribute to Champions League regular Borussia Dortmund's attack. A shoo-in for the U.S. men's national team squad in Qatar, it seemed only natural that he'd be a leading man by the time the next World Cup came to North America.

Advertisement

Instead, his perceived valuation is rapidly deteriorating — a ‘reverse Labubu' scenario at a pivotal point of his career.

For over half a decade, Reyna was the hot commodity among a bunch of burgeoning talents from the United States. Even as Christian Pulisic became a USMNT regular as a teenager and earned a record-setting move to Chelsea, whispers were that the son of Claudio Reyna was an even bigger prospect. When he debuted in 2020, he joined Dortmund teammates Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham among the most-hyped surefire stars of his generation.

The association hasn't aged well. While Haaland and Bellingham are leading figures for club and country, Reyna, presently, is hardly relevant for either.

Late last week, Dortmund confirmed that Reyna had lost his claim on the No. 7 shirt he had donned for four seasons. That very marketable digit is instead in the custody of Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother who arrived this summer as an upgrade in the position that Reyna plays. It wasn't a subtle handoff, either; atop an otherwise mundane “updated squad numbers” post, the club plastered a large banner of Bellingham pointing to his new number — inherited from a player just three years his senior.

At the Club World Cup, Bellingham (wearing 77 at the time) debuted mere days after signing, logging 228 minutes as Dortmund reached the quarterfinal. Reyna, who was propped up by FIFA for an interview on the tournament staged in his home country, was given a meager 12-minute cameo in the group stage finale when the main men were given the briefest of reprieve.

One suspects it would be much of the same if Reyna, now assigned shirt No. 21, sticks around. You can't fault the club for planning to move forward from a stagnated former prospect. The trick, for Reyna, is to do the same.

Advertisement

Simply, the streets of availability and opportunity have too seldom intersected. Reyna has a concerningly long injury ledger for a player who won't turn 23 until November. For most players, querying their name into Google gives autocompleted suggestions like “highlights,” “transfers,” or, for the most gawkerish of fans, some synonym of “partner.” For Reyna, “injury” is among the top assumptions.



Every year, Bundesliga teams play 34 league games totaling 3,060 minutes outside of stoppage time. Since the start of 2021-22, Reyna has logged just 1,929 minutes — fewer than he played in 2020-21 alone, and 15.8% of all available minutes.

The injury issues compound on such a high-pressure club when you aren't a guaranteed starter. Dortmund has changed coaches six times, counting the handoffs from managers to an interim to the permanent successor as two changes.

Each new coach concocts a crash course to identify who he can trust on his new squad. As coaches survey what each player has done lately, they'll see that Reyna misses considerable time with injuries, a reason to wonder how dependable he'll be for the task at hand. Other players get a look, they impress, they carve out roles in the rotation, and Reyna's path to playing time gets even more obstructed.

The trick, then, is to find a coach and a situation where Reyna can confidently be entrusted with a consistent, if not leading, role.

Clubs willing to take that gamble may not present the most favorable optics for the Gio Reyna brand, which still sees him as a very marketable figure with upside. A move to a mid-to-lower table club like Parma (a Serie A side to which Reyna has been linked this summer) would come with banterish suggestions that he's a flop. Facing the wrath of a thousand EA FC players whose Ultimate Teams have already found new dynamic playmakers shouldn't matter now. Not when such a move — one with playing time on offer — would undoubtedly be in Reyna's best interests.

Club transfers are a rare time when a coach can handpick an option to fit into his squad. Such an endorsement comes with trust and optimism that there's a role to be filled by the new signing. That backing carries into practice, then into picking a team if the player's training has been of the requisite standard. It's a fresh look that Reyna desperately needs.

It's a chance he had once, albeit with one vital difference. Reyna's loan away to Nottingham Forest was supposed to provide that change of scenery in the 2023-24 winter window. It seemed as though he could help unpick locks and add more dynamism to the recently promoted side.

The problem: Forest was in the thick of the relegation battle. While the sporting department surely would have loved to see Reyna get more time, Nuno Espirito Santo leaned into players with Premier League experience to stave off the drop. So while the club's absolute aim was achieved, it was a scenario that did little, if anything, to give Reyna a boost.

While the fit seemed imperfect almost immediately, Dortmund's hand was forced. It had held out hoping for a more lucrative offer until the final day of the window. It's a race against the clock that the club is seemingly prepared to face again as the close of this summer's window looms on September 1.

There would be a crucial difference between joining a projected bottom-half side now compared to at the end of the winter window: time. Rather than being a late arriver desperate to earn minutes, he would be part of the core from Matchday 1. It's an advantage that is rapidly waning, as teams have concluded preseason and are now fully preparing for season-opening fixtures.

Every day that Reyna stays at Dortmund is a wasted one if a move is mandatory for progress. Surely, he must recognize the urgency to resolve this years-long saga. Something has to give.

Advertisement

Those lower-bracket clubs that would most benefit from Reyna's services often operate far below Dortmund's stated asking price. Publicly available reporting suggests that linked suitor Parma hasn't spent over $15 million (€12.85 million) on a transfer fee in over two decades. Even if a generous sell-on cut was brokered, it's hard to envision Dortmund letting go of a one-time whiz kid for even that sum.

A half-year loan stint in MLS could help Reyna see the field and reignite a spark in potential suitors down the road (Reyna's current Dortmund contract is up after this season). Speculation is that Reyna has no interest in such a step, though, as those pesky optics suggest a move stateside may paint him as a player unable to return to a Champions League standard. Only Reyna could prove that narrative wrong.

These would still be playable games in a quality first-division league with exceptional facilities. Playing regularly in MLS has only bolstered Diego Luna's case to be among Mauricio Pochettino's playmakers, not hurt it. If Luna makes the squad for the 2026 World Cup, it could quite possibly come at Reyna's expense as an alternative in the same role.

Somewhere, somehow, there must be a rapid solution. For a now-rudderless young player and his boyhood club that seems quite ready to move on, compromises may need to be found.

If not, the consequences will be felt most by Reyna, not Dortmund. If it results in Reyna missing a home World Cup, the impact on his career and legacy could be irrevocably damning.

As the 2026 FIFA World Cup draws closer, the conditions in Atlanta “seem ripe for the Trump administration to clash with the city on its homeless policy” following President Trump's “federal takeover” of the Washington, D.C., police force earlier this week, according to Matt Reynolds of the ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION. Atlanta city officials said that their goal was to “house people, not throw them in jail” when they unveiled plans to clear homeless camps downtown before the World Cup. That housing-first approach “appears at odds” with Trump, who on Monday ordered 800 National Guard troops to the capital while stating that he “wanted to crack down on violent crime and homelessness.” The president also “threatened to send federal forces to other cities.” Trump in July signed an executive order “calling homelessness a public safety crisis.” The order directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to “end support for housing-first models.” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has “taken a housing-first approach” to homelessness but also stated that “people who illegally camp on city streets and refuse to leave could be taken to a pre-arrest detention center and offered treatment or other services.” Atlanta-based homeless advocate Nolan English said, “Don't use the World Cup as a broom. Use that as a deadline to do the right thing” (ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, 8/13).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

The clock is ticking on transfers in both MLS and Europe, with the end of August marking a crucial period for the U.S. men's national team. Several players face uncertain club futures, or need significant moves, to cement their place in Mauricio Pochettino's World Cup plans.

In Italy, Yunus Musah's status continues to swing like a pendulum. Last week, it was reported he would stay at Milan, but now it appears both Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are aggressively moving to acquire the talented midfielder, who has struggled for consistency in Serie A. 

Josh Sargent is off to a torrid start, scoring in his first two games of the season. Yet, Norwich manager Liam Manning stressed that the striker could still be on the move. In MLS, Max Arfsten has been linked with a move all summer and it appears Real Salt Lake's talented youngster, Zavier Gozo, is drawing interest from a Belgian giant.

Listen, I saw this and immediately thought that there's just no possible way that this has ever happened before. Surely a professional athlete knows the rules defined in their sport, especially regarding one that lets you take toilet breaks if you need to. For some context, this fella Mats Rosenkranz, who is ranked 358th in the world, went and took a quick shower that he says was only 10 seconds in between sets. On the tour, you're allowed a 3 minute toilet break that starts once you enter the bathroom, with an additional 2 minutes if you need to change clothes. Generally players do this to throw off some momentum, actually need to go to the bathroom, or just need a second to recollect their thoughts that isn't in the eye of the actual court surrounded by fans.

Well apparently showers are not allowed due to doping regulations, which my best guess is that they aren't following you into the shower so they can't see if you just start injecting some steroids into your butt or whatever would make you perform better? But are they doing that if you're in a stall taking a number 2 either? I know they send a supervisor with you and he probably heard the water turn on and was like ""welp, you're disqualified buddy"" which adds an even funnier twist to this. And not to mention the crazier part is that you're allowed to shower if you're at a best of 5 sets match at one of the Grand Slams but not one of these lowly tournaments that are still counting towards professional rank.

I'm no meteorologist but the real feel air temperature in Hersonissos, Greece, where this match was played, was 102 degrees today. It's hard to argue that he was doing anything else other than getting a cool breeze of water splashed on his body, especially when you consider the fact that he already won the first set and was firmly in the driver's seat. But rules are rules and instead the other lad got to advance to the next round.

Just another day in tennis.

Carlos Alcaraz bounced back from a scare against Damir Dzumhur to comfortably beat his third-round opponent in Cincinnati.

Alcaraz was simply too good when it mattered against Hamad Međedović, winning the contest 6-4 6-4.

The Spaniard was broken only once during the contest, at 3-2 in the second set. However, he composed himself, before breaking straight back.

Alcaraz had struggled in his opening Cincinnati Open match, dropping the second set against Damir Dzumhur 2-6 before eventually winning the contest in three sets.

The Spaniard showed greater consistency in his third-round match, creating history in the process.

Carlos Alcaraz's victory was not only a moment for the present; it transcended generations.

Alcaraz's defeat of Međedović put the Spaniard in rarefied air alongside two greats of the game: Rafael Nadal and Pete Sampras.

Nadal won 22 Grand Slam singles titles during his career, including 14 French Open titles. Sampras won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, including seven Wimbledon titles; a record only Roger Federer has bettered.

As per OptaScore, since the ATP Tour's inaugural season in 1990, Carlos Alcaraz has become the third-youngest player to achieve four consecutive 50-win seasons, older than only Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal.

50 – Since the ATP Tour's inaugural season in 1990, Carlos Alcaraz (22 years 94 days) has become the third-youngest player to achieve four consecutive 50-win seasons, older than only Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal. Wand.#CincyTennis | @CincyTennis @atptour @ATPMediaInfo pic.twitter.com/dL1vKyAZPc

Alcaraz achieved the feat while aged 22 years and 94 days. He is the first player to achieve this since Novak Djokovic, who registered four consecutive 50-win seasons from 2013 to 2016.

Alcaraz's feature in this conversation encapsulates his bottomless pool of talent and his remarkable maturity on and off the tennis court.

As an example, Alcaraz recently revealed it took him just hours to come to terms with his Wimbledon final loss to Jannik Sinner.

Alcaraz faces a tough opponent in the Cincinnati Open round of 16: Luca Nardi.

The 22-year-old Italian star has impressed so far this week, winning two rounds of qualifying before defeating Denis Shapovalov and Jakub Mensik on his way to the last 16.

Alcaraz and Nardi have played each other once before on the ATP Tour. The pair met earlier in 2025 at the Doha Open, with Alcaraz winning the round of 16 contest 6-1 4-6 6-3.

Alcaraz will need to be wary of the young Italian star, who has also beaten compatriot Flavio Cobolli in 2025.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner will have his entire ATP year-end bonus docked for failing to meet an important requirement in the ATP's 2025 rulebook.

As part of OneVision, the ATP's strategic plan to take tennis to new heights and which launched in the 2023 season, one of its key pillars is to ensure that tennis players can compete without worrying about their financial well-being.

A major driver for that pillar is the substantial increase in prize money year-on-year, the introduction of base earnings for lower-ranked players, and bonuses to reward the top-performing players in a season.

In 2025, the ATP's Bonus Pool will cater to award the Top 30 players (up from 12) with the most ranking points at the Masters 1000 tournaments and the ATP Finals (for those who will qualify). The total bonus is a whopping $21 million this season, nearly double what the ATP offered in its first year when OneVision launched.

Additionally, a second bonus pool of up to $3 million will be shared among the top six players with the most points from ATP 500 tournaments.

Sinner is ranked 16th in the ATP Masters Bonus Pool standings with 650 points and is currently competing in only his second Masters tournament of the season at the Cincinnati Open.

However, it is pertinent to note that the ATP year-end bonuses are subject to player participation in the Mandatory tournaments. Players who earned a bonus but missed four or more ATP 1000s will forfeit 100% of those earnings. In Sinner's case, he is set to lose the full bonus at the end of the season for missing at least four Masters 1000 tournaments.

Three absences were enforced. Sinner was infamously suspended for three months earlier this year because of two failed doping tests dating back to last season. He eventually reached a case resolution agreement with WADA and resumed playing in May. By that time, he had missed the Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open, and Madrid (Monte Carlo is a non-Mandatory Masters), which all count as missed events. Last month, Sinner withdrew from the Toronto Masters, taking his total absences to four Masters 1000s, which means he will not receive a penny in bonuses.

Frances Tiafoe seems to love this part of the tennis calendar.

Not only has the American gone to the semifinals in two of the last three US Opens, but he also was a runner-up at the 2024 Cincinnati Masters.

Tiafoe's 2025 campaign has been a mixed bag overall, but he had a similar output the last couple of years before peaking during the late summer.

Tiafoe is a +110 underdog against Holger Rune in the Round of 16 in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

Tiafoe has turned into one of the most watchable players on the ATP Tour thanks to his aggressive style and athletic ability.

He's got plenty of power, but the Maryland native also has a deft touch at the net and is a creative shot-maker. It's hard to profile his game because he can do so many things well when he is clicking.

It shouldn't be a surprise that Tiafoe has figured out how to get his game working at this time of year, since he's from the Mid-Atlantic and will not be a stranger to the hot, humid conditions in the States in August.

Rune, meanwhile, seemingly runs into problems in physical matches, especially in challenging conditions.

There is no doubt about the Dane's immense talent, but he tends to flail when things get a bit uncomfortable.

Tiafoe witnessed this firsthand at this event last year, defeating the Dane in three sets in a memorable semifinal.

Rune may be the more talented, dynamic player, but the conditions and the crowd will suit Tiafoe more than the World No. 9.

This should be a dramatic match, and the player who is more likely to unravel in this environment is the favorite.

We'll go the other way.

The Play: Frances Tiafoe (+110, bet365)

MASON, OH − After rain and lightning ended the Aug. 12 night session at the Cincinnati Open, the tournament will resume its Round of 32 matches and begin the Round of 16 on Aug. 13.

There are still four Round of 32 matches to be decided, two of which are already in progress. ATP No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev, the 2021 Cincinnati Open champion, is just one game away from taking out No. 27 seed Brandon Nakashima. Zverev leads 6-4, 5-4 when play resumes.

On Center Court, WTA No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula lost a first-set tiebreak against Magda Linette but bounced back with a 6-3 win in the second set. They'll play the third set in the second match of the afternoon on Center Court.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula and No. 31 seed Magda Linette are battling in the third set on Center Court. It is tied 3-3 with each seeded star holding serve thus far in the third set.

Alexander Zverev needed just a few minutes to win one game and finish off No. 27 seed Brandon Nakashima in the Round of 32 by a 6-4, 6-4 score. Zverev will face No. 14 seed Karen Khachanov in the Round of 16.

Iga Swiatek, the WTA No. 3, has her 24th WTA 1000 quarterfinals appearance after eliminating Sorona Cirstea in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.

Holger Rune is the first player to advance to the Cincinnati Open quarterfinals after Frances Tiafoe retired in the second round.

Rune led the second set, 3-1, when Tiafoe retired. This marks Rune's 10th ATP 1000 quarterfinals appearance. He'll face either Taylor Fritz or qualifier Terence Atmane for a spot in the semifinals.

Holger Rune got a key break, then held serve to take the opening set from Frances Tiafoe, 6-4. Rune is one set away from his 100th career hard-court victory and 10th ATP 1000 quarterfinals appearance.

Day 9 of the Cincinnati Open has begun with some of the top tennis stars trying to secure a spot in the quarterfinals. On the Grandstand Court, WTA No. 3 Iga Swiatek, who is in pursuit of the deep run that has eluded her in six previous Cincinnati appearance, just took the first set from Sorona Cirstea, 6-4.

Cincinnati is one of two WTA 1000 events (Canada) Swiatek has appeared in without reaching the final. She is a two-time semifinalist. A victory over Cirstea would mark Swiatek's 24th WTA 1000 quarterfinals appearance.

In a battle between two ATP Top 10 seeds on Center Court, Frances Tiafoe (No. 10) and Holger Rune (No. 7) are locked in a back-and-forth first set that is tied at 4-4. Last year, Tiafoe became the first American male to reach the Cincinnati Open finals since 2013.

Both World No. 1s will be in action Aug. 13 in Mason. WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka is bidding for her fourth consecutive quarterfinals appearance when she faces Jessica Bouzas Maneiro on Center Court to conclude the day session.

Jannik Sinner faces qualifier Adrian Mannarino on Center Court. Sinner is 7-1 in ATP 1000 events this year.

Canadian Open champion Ben Shelton will play in the Round of 32 against Roberto Bautista Agut Aug. 13 on the Grandstand Court.

Opening up on the Grandstand is WTA No. 3 Iga Swiatek, who is 4-0 all-time against her Round of 16 opponent, Sorona Cirstea.

The Spaniard moved through hours before an evening rainstorms and lightning spoiled the night-time scenario, leaving men's and women's third seeds stranded in third round matches.

Alexander Zverev was set to serve for the match against Brandon Nakashima, leading the American 6-4, 5-4 when the match was forced off court by the threat of lightning.

It was a similar situation for American Jessica Pegula, fighting back against Pole Magda Linette who won the first set 7-6 (5), before last year's finalist claimed the second 6-3.

Toronto champion Ben Shelton never got on court against Roberto Bautista Agut due to rainstorm conditions that forced officials to call it a night early.

Second seed Alcaraz kept his exposure to a minimum in 32 Celsius conditions, taking an efficient 95 minutes to dispatch Serb Hamad Medjedovic 6-4, 6-4, for his 50th match win of the year.

""Medjedovic doesn't like to run that much, so I tried to move him around as much as possible,"" Alcaraz said. ""But it was difficult with the ball flying so much and his shots coming so fast. I tried to defend in a good way.""

Alcaraz has been on a tear in 2025 as he chases Jannik Sinner in the ATP rankings, and now owns 13 straight victories at the Masters 1000 level.

He will play for the quarter-finals against Luca Nardi after the Italian defeated Jakob Mensik 6-2, 2-1 with the Czech retiring after 42 minutes.

Five-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz, who is preparing for the approaching US Open start, added: ""I was really happy to get the win in a very difficult match.

""The season is very long and in at least half of your matches you don't feel that good (physically).

""But you have to stay positive and play your best tennis on the day. I'm proud about that. It's a goal of the season.""

Toronto finalist Karen Khachanov, earned a 6-3, 6-3 win over Jenson Brooksby.

Francisco Comesano and Reilly Opelka both felt the heat of their mid-day match, which was interrupted for 45 minutes by rain, as the Argentine limped to a 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 win while saving three match points.

Comesano needed a medical time out midway through the second set, but came back out to continue what turned into a fight of nearly three hours against the American.

Opelka called for the doctor just moments from his eventual loss, complaining of dizziness and high blood pressure after being broken for 5-6 in the final set.

After a quick consultation at his chair, Opelka was back on court to weakly scoop a return into the net on his opponent's second match point.

The 71st-ranked South American will face ninth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Australian Alexei Popyrin 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 7-5.

Opelka, noted for his big serve, fired 27 aces but also committed nearly 60 unforced errors. Comesano broke on four of his 13 chances.

He is the first Argentine into the Cincy round of 16 since Diego Schwartzman in 2022.

In the WTA draw, second seed Coco Gauff eased into the fourth round when opponent Dayana Yastremska withdrew before their Tuesday match.

The American, who won the 2023 Cincinnati title and followed up with a US Open crown, will face Italian Lucia Bronzetti, who took out Jelena Ostapenko 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Yastremska was unable to play due to illness, the WTA said.

Seventh seed Jasmine Paolini, last season's Roland Garros and Wimbledon finalist, defeated American Ashlyn Krueger 7-6, (2), 6-1 while German qualifier Ella Seidel continued her strong showing with a 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (6) defeat of McCartney Kessler.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Venus Williams Barbie honors tennis legend's push for equal rights","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/08/13/venus-williams-barbie-wimbledon-2007/85631344007/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 10:25:51 GMT","

When Mattel approached Venus Williams to make her own Barbie for the Inspiring Women Series, the American tennis legend was given free rein to select any outfit to be immortalized in.

Williams, whose resume is long as her 6-foot-1 frame, had many moments to choose from throughout her trailblazing career. She could've selected the first of her seven Grand Slam singles titles at Wimbledon in 2000 or opted to memorialize her first of four Olympic gold medals at the Sydney Games that same year. Williams could've even took it back to the 1999 French Open, where she won the first of her 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her little sister Serena Williams in their iconic braids and colorful beads.

But Williams ultimately selected her win at the 2007 Wimbledon tournament and not for the reason you may think. It was the first year the women's and men's singles champions earned equal prize money at Wimbledon, a cause that Williams championed long before her win.

""Wimbledon 2007 was a huge moment in my career — not just because I won, but because of what was happening off the court,"" Williams told USA TODAY Sports ahead of her Barbie's release on Aug. 15. ""Championing for equal prize money wasn't just about me, it was about pushing for change for all women in sports. To see that moment honored with a Barbie doll is incredibly special. I hope it inspires young girls to speak up, believe in themselves, and know they have the power to change the game too.""

Williams said seeing her own Barbie marked a ""full-circle moment."" When she didn't have a tennis racket in her hand during her early years training alongside father, Richard Williams, and sister, Serena, Venus channeled her creative energy into giving her dolls one-of-a-kind makeovers.

""I've always loved being creative, even as a kid, I used to sew clothes for my dolls,"" Williams recalled. ""Seeing (my) finished doll was so surreal — it made me realize this doll represents something much bigger. It's about inspiring young girls they can dream big and break barriers too.""

Breaking barriers is Williams specialty. Two years before she triumphantly hoisted Wimbledon's Rosewater Dish for the fourth time in 2007, Williams met with officials from Wimbledon and the French Open. They were the two Grand Slams that didn't pay equal prize money at the time. When no change came from the meeting, Williams refused to leave the ball in the officials' court. She penned an article in The Times at the start of the 2006 tournament titled: Wimbledon has sent me a message: I'm only a second class champion.

Williams' article was the catalyst for Wimbledon and the French Open to change. Both tournaments announced equal prize money for all competitors, beginning in 2007. Williams went on to win her sixth major singles title at Wimbledon that year and was the first woman to win the same purse as male champion Roger Federer.

""My advice to any woman, not just advocating for equal pay but also advocating for themselves, is this: always bet on yourself and keep pushing, no matter how tough it gets,"" Williams told USA TODAY Sports. ""There's so much power in believing in yourself. When you use your voice, you create space for others to speak up too and that can create real change.""

Williams' Barbie is wearing a two-piece white set identical to what she wore to defeat France's Marion Bartoli, 6–4, 6–1, in the 2007 Wimbledon final. Her ""Inspiring Women Series"" doll also features Williams' accessories from the match, including her green gem necklace, dangly earrings, wristbands and visors, in addition to Reebok tennis shoes. (Williams signed a multi-million dollar deal with Reebok in 1995 at age 14 after walking away from Nike because she believed she could earn more, as depicted in the 2021 biopic, ""King Richard."")

Don't forget about her racket and tennis ball.

""Venus chose that outfit herself actually, so she collaborated really closely with our talented Barbie design team,"" Krista Berger, senior vice president of Barbie and global head of dolls at Mattel, told USA TODAY Sports. ""They (worked) closely throughout the entire process of designing the doll to ensure it accurately reflected her appearance and her personal style.""

Berger said Williams' involvement with creating her own Barbie ""added that personal touch to capture her impact as an athlete and an advocate. It's a moment that's important not only for the sport, for women, for fans, but to Venus personally.""

The release of Williams' Barbie doll comes days ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open, where Williams is teaming up with fellow American Reilly Opelka in mixed doubles. She recently returned to competition for the first time in 16-months at the D.C. Open in July.

""Coming back to D.C. reminded me how much I truly love this game,"" Williams said. ""I've always stayed true to myself and played on my own terms. For me, excellence has no limits — I play because I love the process, and fully embrace each moment.""

Williams, 45, earned a straight sets victory over World No. 35 Peyton Stearns in the opening round to become the oldest player to win a tour-level singles match since 2004. Williams fell short in the second round against Magdalena Frech and made a quick, first-round exit at the Cincinnati Open, but she nonetheless celebrated being able to play ""healthier than ever.""

""Reconnecting with that feeling, along with the energy and support of the fans, was truly something special,"" Williams added.

Sidelined with a right pectoral injury since Wimbledon, Grigor Dimitrov has officially withdrawn from the 2025 US Open. The 34-year-old Bulgarian ends an impressive streak of 58 consecutive Grand Slam appearances.

Former world No. 3 and current ATP No. 21 Grigor Dimitrov has officially pulled out of the US Open (August 24 – September 7), tournament organizers confirmed on Tuesday. The 34-year-old Bulgarian, who has been dealing with a right pectoral injury since his retirement against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon, will miss the entire US hard-court swing.

His withdrawal had been expected for several weeks, following comments from his manager suggesting the injury would not heal in time. It is now official: Dimitrov will not contest the final Grand Slam of the season.

The Bulgarian has not played since his Wimbledon fourth-round match, which was cut short while he led two sets to love against eventual champion Jannik Sinner. Persistent pain also forced him to skip the Masters 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati.

This absence brings an end to a remarkable streak of 58 consecutive Grand Slam main-draw appearances, which began at the 2011 Australian Open.

As a result, Chile's Alejandro Tabilo, initially slated to play the qualifying rounds, will now gain direct entry into the US Open main draw.

Hey everyone …

• Here's this week's Served podcast with special guest Hall of Famer Maria Sharapova. Note we will be doing a U.S. Open draw show from the grounds, a show from the Hall of Fame induction ceremony and at least one other live show during the tournament. 

• Bjorn Borg's memoir, coming soon.

• Congrats to Bill Simons and Inside Tennis (paper version) on a hell of a run.

• Kalamazoo happened, Darwin Blanch is back to winning and Zoo Tennis, as the name suggests, is on the case.

Onward …

For a pair of 1000 point events pockmarked by the absence of a few big stars, Canada served up real drama and a couple of stellar finals, along with some new spin on storylines heading into the U.S. Open. The biggest question in my mind: is [Victoria] Mboko a contender to win in New York this year? 

Ted Cornwell, Minneapolis

• Let's start with Mboko. Despite the withdrawal “pockmarks,” and with the Cincy event still undecided at this writing (more on this below), the women's winner in Canada remains the story of the week.

We had a few Mboko questions last week—and one heartwarming story I'll share at another time—but it seemed foolish to answer at the semifinal round when it remained to be seen whether Mboko had a fine tournament or an absolutely smashing one. She then, of course, beat Elena Rybakina in a third-set tiebreak and Naomi Osaka in a wild final, and this marked an absolute claw-out-of-the-egg breakthrough.

There is so much to like about Mboko. Her ballstriking. Her movement. Her ample but not overwhelming power (she had fewer than 10 total winners in her win against Gauff). But above all—the great source of long-term optimism—there was her poise.

Here was a wild card who projected such a sense of self-possession of I deserve to be here. There was no entitlement. There were no fits of pique. There was no panic in pivotal moments. But there wasn't a sense of dumbfounded awe either. She comported herself like a veteran. She strategized. She reset. She adjusted. In between matches she spoke eloquently—in French and English—but calmly and assuredly.

Then there was the fact that she was doing this all in front of a “home crowd,” having grown up one province over. The fallback was that Mboko was elevated by the home support. But ask British players about this dynamic at Wimbledon or French players at Roland Garros, and they will tell you that in an individual sport, especially, playing at “home” brings as many pressures as advantages. Whether it was precocious poise or teenage blissful ignorance, Mboko handled it all so well.

Having pulled out of Cincinnati (wisely, but another item in the bill of particulars against this summer schedule), Mboko now enters the U.S. Open as a seed, a player on a win streak and, above all, a burgeoning star. Given the presence and composure, evidenced by an epic point in the third set of the Canada Open final, she'll be fine.

Naomi Osaka had long checked out by this point, but that get by Victoria Mboko was electrifying 🔥 pic.twitter.com/FV8xthtqqH

Up until the finals of the WTA 1000 event in Montreal, Naomi Osaka was a consistent crowd favourite. Her story of rise, fall due to mental health and resurrection is a natural drama that people who don't even follow tennis can connect with. That all changes when your opponent in the finals is a Canadian with a great story of her own. So when the home, partisan crowd goes crazy for every point won by the local hero and somehow, Osaka seems to think that she is being vilified, my sympathy for her is diminished. But worse is that she actively tanked the last few games of the third set. Did she not remember how she felt when Serena's outburst at the U.S. Open made Naomi's moment feel compromised. Her lack of grace in the trophy presentation also betrayed a lack of sensitivity from someone who is such a proponent of kindness and positivity in a sport often not known for either of those attributes. Jon, in your typical even handedness, I suspect you'll chalk this up to disappointment at missing an opportunity after not winning a tournament in 4 1/2 years, or just having a brain cramp in an emotional moment. Maybe she's a victim of the high bar she has set for herself, but I thought the 18-year-old across the net from her might want to sit down with Naomi and remind her what class and sportsmanship are all about. Canada could not be prouder of Vicky.

Neil Grammer, Toronto

• The headline is Mboko and it's a pity that so much of the discussion has been Osaka's absence of grace under pressure. But here's a quick take: As a rule, we give grace to tennis players forced to self-assess after a disappointing day at the office. It's not remotely instinctive. It's not something we ask of others: Warren, rough day with the PowerPoint. I know the presentation didn't go as you had hoped. A couple of loose points—trying to modify the word unique; mispronouncing nuclear—may have worked against you. Good week overall, but a bittersweet way to conclude. Want to say a few words?

That disclaimer out of the way … yeah, that was pretty shabby stuff from Osaka. Forgetting to thank the ballkids or the volunteers is bad, but forgivable. Failing to congratulate the player who just beat you—a day after learning she idolized you as a kid; knowing what the moment meant to her; knowing she had captivated the crowd; knowing from firsthand experience that a dour, older losing opponent can suck the joy from a younger winner—is a really bad unforced error. Props to Osaka for the damage control the next day, but said damage was, largely, already done.

Compounding matters: Osaka's attitude in the final hour of that final. Giving up on points. Rifling balls after errors. The body language that said, unmistakably, Get me the freak outta here. If someone were new to tennis with only thumbnails of the two finalists, and judged the players based on their professionalism, how many would have guessed Osaka to be the teenaged newbie and assumed Mboko was four-time major champion in her late 20s?

Here's my larger issue with Osaka: does this not do a terrible disservice to her tennis? It's such a mental sport. We all see that. We all know that to be true, starting with other players. If I am on the other side of the net and know my opponent is capable of melting down in tight moments—losing her head, by her own admission, to the point she forgets to do something as basic as acknowledging the victorious player in front of her home crowd—this fires me with confidence. It's such a tell, and it sends the wrong message Osaka would want to convey to the field. The flip side: her tennis in Montreal was often sufficient to win a major. Which would add a fifth to her haul of four. She could win the U.S. Open. She could lose drearily in Week 1. Neither outcome would surprise. 

Hello Jon,

Once again I enjoy your mailbag offerings and comments. re: the mention of Olga Danilović and her $2.5 million career earnings. Sounds like a lot of money for a player not on every fan's radar.

However, that is income/winnings and not her earnings, if we consider as typical business income. She has expenses as a professional tennis player not to mention (though I will) investment by parents or early benefactors on her development prior to becoming a professional. The winnings are a useful comparison relative to other players including Novak Djokovic, but to the general public even $2.5 millions sounds like a nice income for a relatively young person. Whereas it may be reasonably above the breakeven point, it is not retire in the lap of luxury money … necessarily.

Related topic: What is the general range of outside sponsorship earnings for a player such as Olga? Generous racquet, shoes and wardrobe swag is nice, but … Thanks for hanging in there on your many platforms. Btw, I enjoy the Quick Served pods.

Sincerely, Tom Buhl

• Thanks Tom. Good question. And your thesis is correct: “income/winnings” only paints part of the financial picture.

Some scattered points…

A) As a rule, players pay their airfare. Tournaments cover lodging and food.

B) There is huge variance with regards to coaching expenses. Sometimes federations pay for players' coaches. Other times players pay out of pocket. I know of one instance when a coach actually paid a top player for the opportunity to coach her, reckoning that the publicity and branding was worth the outlay.

C) Note that different countries have vastly different tax policies. Suffice to say Scandinavians' tax forms look different from, say, the Monte Carlo exiles.

D) In addition to the prize money, there are abundant additional income streams. The top players, of course, make multiples more in endorsements than they do in prize money. Assorted other players (young, ascendant, usually from countries with a high GNP) even outside the top 20—Leylah Fernandez is a name that vaults to mind—can make more in endorsements than prize money.

E) There are “sneaky” endorsements as well. I was in Target the other day and, behold, Alycia Parks!

F) There are income one-offs. Exhibitions. Patch deals. Hamptons appearances. A few active players have “once you're eliminated stay and work for us” broadcast deals. Often the player will make more from the media work than from first- or even second-round prize money

G) Again, to your point: “Prize money” is an accessible metric, but doesn't tell the entire financial story.

Hey Jon,

Where are we on aces? I have no data but if feelings still count … It feels like we don't see as many aces as we did a few years ago. Or maybe we're just less enthralled with counting them. Serves seem faster and more players (ATP and WTA) are hitting big bombs, but returners look like they're getting rackets on them more often. Is it just me?

Michael, Asheville, NC

• I have some data. It's dirty but supports your thesis. “Total aces” is crass, taking into account neither the number of games played nor the quality of opponent. Tennis Abstract does a nice job refining, though we still wish the quality of opponent were given more weight. Twenty aces against a ponderous opponent is different from 20 aces against, say Alex de Minaur, to pick a name. But your overall thesis is valid. It's not dramatic but there seems to be a drop-off in aces compared to, say, 20 or 30 years ago when Rusedskis and Krajiceks and even Beckers and Samprases roamed the tennis earth.

And, I would argue, this is for the good of the game.

First, I would caution that a drop in aces doesn't necessarily mean the serve is less critical. Just that there are fewer untouchables.

Second, there's the question of why. Some theories: better returners? Less dramatic differences among surfaces? More rounded players means that even a guy like Ben Shelton can mix up kickers and cutters with pure fastballs? Also, as a tennis rule of thumb, the best servers have ranked among the worst returners. So as players like Ivo Karlović and John Isner have moved on, not only are their ace counts no longer tallied but they are not around to be the victim of aces. 

(If anyone with more bandwidth and quant skills than I wants to dive deeper here, I'd be happy to publish.)

Hi Jon,

How is it that the Canadian Open runs through August 7, while the Cincinnati Open starts on August 5?

Regards.

Joe from Branford CT

• Because … tennis. We have overlapping tournaments. We have Wednesday semifinals. We have star players missing tournament tournament X because they are saving themselves for tournament X+1. We have star players doing well in tournament X and then withdrawing from tournament X-1. At some point there has to be a “New Coke moment” when an adult in the room says, It was an experiment. It failed. Let's cut bait and go back to one-week Masters 1000 events that don't overlap.

Hi Jon,

I know you're not a fan of the 12-day Masters1000 event—neither am I—but if there's anything crazier than that, it's a Masters 1000 event that ends on a Thursday. Wot? So a fan who wants to attend the final now has to take off work to do so?

What's wrong with this picture? Plenty, if you ask me.

Gavin, NYC

• These events are the equivalent of best-of-seven matches. We all love tennis. We love the tournaments in question, the core product. But enough is as good as a feast.

I think it was Ted Robinson who said to McEnroe during a broadcast : John, do you favor the better server in the tiebreak? I favor the better player, John replies.

JB, PDX

• Occam's razor strikes again.

HAVE A GOOD WEEK, EVERYONE!

The US Open announced its wild cards on Wednesday, with #NextGenATP star Nishesh Basavareddy among six American featuring in the men's singles list.

Basavareddy, currently No. 109 in the PIF ATP Rankings, competed at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in last December before making the semi-finals at the ATP 250 in Auckland a month later. The 20-year-old, who rose to World No. 99 in June, will be making his US Open main-draw debut this year.

Brandon Holt, Tristan Boyer, Emilio Nava, Stefan Dostanic and Darwin Blanch are the other Americans to receive a wild card. They will be joined by Australian Tristan Schoolkate and Valentin Royer.

Holt, the son of former WTA World No. 1 Tracy Austin, also made his Top 100 debut this year after qualifying for the ATP 250 in Mallorca and recording his first ATP Tour match win. Dostancic, 23, earned his wild card by winning the men's singles title at the inaugural American Collegiate Wild Card Playoffs in June.

Nava, currently at a career-high No. 105 in the PIF ATP Rankings, received his wild card by winning the US Open Wild Card Challenge. The 23-year-old also captured three consecutive ATP Challenger Tour titles this spring. The 18-year-old Blanch, who played Rafael Nadal in his second tour-level match, will compete at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time. 



Two-time Challenger Tour winners in 2025, Royer and Schoolkate will also feature in the main draw. Schoolkate reached the second round on his US Open debut last year, while Royer will be competing in the main draw for the first time.

Men's singles qualifying wild cards were awarded to Andres Martin, Tyler Zink, Patrick Maloney, Garrett Johns, Martin Damm, Jack Kennedy, Benjamin Willwerth, Michael Zheng and Jack Satterfield.

Venus Williams will make her return to Grand Slam tennis at the US Open after a two-year absence, receiving a wild-card invitation Wednesday to compete in singles at Flushing Meadows at age 45.

The American will be the oldest entrant in singles at the tournament since Renée Richards was 47 in 1981, according to the International Tennis Federation.

Williams already had been given a wild-card entry by the U.S. Tennis Association for next week's mixed doubles competition. Singles matches begin in New York on Aug. 24.

She has won seven major singles championships -- including at the US Open in 2000 and 2001 -- along with another 14 in women's doubles, all won with her younger sister, Serena, plus two in mixed doubles. Serena Williams retired with 23 Slam singles trophies after playing at the 2022 US Open.

The older Williams last participated in a Grand Slam tournament at the 2023 US Open, losing in the first round. She hasn't won a singles match there since 2019.

Williams returned to competitive tennis in July after being away from the sport for more than a year. She won one match at the DC Open before being knocked out in the first round in Cincinnati last week.

""Coming off of this match, I feel amazing,"" Williams said after the Cincinnati loss. ""So that means that in this next period [ahead of the US Open] I won't have to fix injuries. Now I can work on power and speed instead of trying to just make sure I'm not hurt going into the tournament.""

Last year, Williams had surgery to remove uterine fibroids and missed most of the season. In Washington, she became the oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova was 47 at Wimbledon in 2004; Williams also won a doubles match at the DC Open.

In the process, Williams drew a ton of attention for her tennis, yes, but also for letting the world know she is engaged to Italian actor Andrea Preti and for her half-joking comments about needing to get back on court to get covered by health insurance.

In New York, Williams will play in the Aug. 19-20 mixed doubles tournament with Reilly Opelka, a 27-year-old American who used to be ranked in the top 20.

Other women getting singles wild cards for the US Open are Americans Clervie Ngounoue, Julieta Pareja, Caty McNally, Valerie Glozman and Alyssa Ahn, plus France's Caroline Garcia -- who will be playing in her last Grand Slam tournament before retirement -- and Australia's Talia Gibson.

Men's wild cards went to Americans Brandon Holt, Nishesh Basavareddy, Tristan Boyer, Emilio Nava, Stefan Dostanic and Darwin Blanch as well as France's Valentin Royer and Australia's Tristan Schoolkate.

US Open organizers are hoping to put on a show with a star-studded mixed doubles tournament -- but 2023 singles champ Coco Gauff will not be in the draw.

The WTA is well represented by Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, Elena Rybakina, Mirra Andreeva, Emma Raducanu, and Jasmine Paolini.

Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev, and Daniil Medvedev are also in the draw.

Gauff is a regular on the doubles circuit, but decided to take a step back in a blow for US Open chiefs as she is concerned about her schedule.

“For me, it was just because I know the free week of the US Open is already packed for me, for sponsor things, and it was just like a whole other thing,"" said the reigning French Open champion.

""And I'm very competitive; if I were to lose, I would not be happy. So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that.

“Then on top of the sponsor stuff, the pre-week, and then knowing that this finished on Monday and potentially having to play on Tuesday. Well, you would have to play on a Tuesday. So I just knew it wasn't going to work out for me, scheduling-wise.”

Gauff takes on Lucia Bronzetti in the last 16 of the Cincinnati Open on Thursday -- the final is on August 18, which is just a day before the mixed doubles begins in New York.

“I think it's cool, and I think it's going to be an exciting two days, and not knocking it off for the future,” Gauff added.

“It's just that I plan my sponsor weeks literally like a year out, sometimes a year and a half out. And when this whole thing was coming up, I was already booked and busy.”

Fellow American Pegula is a fan of the event but thinks players should have been consulted more.

“I'm honoured that they asked me to play. It's going to be great, it's going to be fun and the fans will really enjoy it,” she said.

“At the same time, how they went about it, I didn't think was really great. We were like, ‘Okay, you guys went rogue and changed the format and didn't tell anybody. You just did it. Did you talk to the players? Did you get their input about how it could be better?'

“That's something that we as players are trying to work with them on, having that line of communication be a lot smoother.

“I feel like maybe if there was feedback about the format, then the (reaction) would be a little different, not so all over the place.”

Pegula is already looking ahead to retirement having turned 31 in February.

Close friend Gauff is just 21 and wants her to stick around for a while yet.

""I think I was talking to Coco, and she was like, ‘You can play until LA!'. She was mad at me because I was like maybe a couple more years,"" Pegula admitted.

""She was like, ‘If you're going to play two more years, you might as well play another year for the LA Olympics. You can't retire before then!'

""This was like a year before, and I was like, 'Four years, that's a long time. I will be 34. What are you talking about? 

""She was like, ‘You can just stay top 20, with the way you hit the ball, you will be fine. I am not letting you retire before the LA Olympics, especially if I'm qualified!'""

If current trends continue, the US will be well represented in the women's draw in LA with Gauff leading a charge.

The whizkid has jokingly called on the men to follow their lead.

The US Open mixed doubles has been hyped up to an event not to miss this year. 

Mixed doubles at the US Open has received a complete overhaul this year, with the event being brought forward to before the main draw of singles.

It is also giving priority to singles players, something that the US Open has been heavily criticised for.

Despite attracting star-studded teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, the US Open may pay for the Cincinnati Open's scheduling this year.

The current tennis schedule is often criticised, and that has been even more amplified during the North American hard court swing.

Due to the Canadian Open taking place over 12 days, the finals took place on a Thursday, something Frances Tiafoe called ‘garbage'.

This has impacted the Cincinnati Open, which has also been expanded to 12 days for the first time.

As a result, the ATP and WTA singles finals will both take place on Monday, August 18, and are set to impact the US Open mixed doubles event.

The mixed doubles event begins on Tuesday, August 19, and also features players that are likely to reach the latter stages of the Cincinnati Open.

Singles is always going to be a priority for the likes of Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, and they are unlikely to be willing to rush to New York to play a mixed doubles event that could sacrifice their fitness ahead of the singles.

While there has been a lot of hype around the US Open mixed doubles event, it seems as though it will probably not be the spectacle they hoped it would be, something they will not thank the Cincinnati Open for.

14 teams are IN!Eight teams have received direct entry and six teams have received wild cards to the US Open Mixed Doubles Championship. The final two wild cards will be announced at a later date. pic.twitter.com/mkAteJDQVT

With less than a week to go until the US Open mixed doubles event begins, there are still 13 of the 26 announced participants remaining in Cincinnati.

This includes three full mixed doubles teams, as well as defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.

The only announced teams that have no players still competing in Cincinnati are Mirra Andreeva, who is nursing an injury, and Daniil Medvedev, Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic, as well as Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka.

One thing the US Open may be thankful for is that Djokovic withdrew from the Cincinnati Open, as he now appears more likely to compete in their mixed doubles event.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament will take place next week on August 19-20, and it remains to be seen who will actually be there at the start line.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

August 13, 2025 by Admin Leave a Comment

Emerging Australian talents Tristan Schoolkate and Talia Gibson have been awarded main draw wildcards into the 2025 US Open, recognising their breakout seasons and rising international profiles. Tennis Australia announced the wild cards ahead of the USTA's official public relations announcement of its wild cards.

For 24-year-old Schoolkate, the wildcard marks a significant milestone in a year of career-best performances.

The West Australian broke into the ATP top 100 for the first time last week following a string of strong results, including a standout victory over world No.47 Joao Fonseca at the Toronto Masters – his first win over a top-50 opponent.

Ranked No.173 when he competed at Australian Open 2025, Schoolkate's impressive rise into the top 100 in just over six months came a fraction too late for direct entry in New York. He was world No.110 at the 14 July entry deadline, less than 10 spots outside the main draw ranking cut-off.

Now ranked No.97, Schoolkate has also reached three Challenger finals this season – claiming titles in Brisbane and Ilkley, UK – to showcase his consistency and growth on the professional circuit.

“Thank you Tennis Australia for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to play the US Open main draw,” said Schoolkate. “It's such an amazing experience to play in the main draws of the Grand Slams – it's what we as players work towards, week in, week out. I'm excited and ready for the challenge in New York.”

Gibson, 21, has also enjoyed a breakthrough year, peaking at world No.107 last month.

The Perth native recently captured her 10th ITF singles title at the W75 event in Granby, Canada, winning 10 consecutive sets after dropping the opener in her first-round match.

Her Northern Hemisphere summer campaign has included quarterfinal appearances at WTA 125 events in Ilkley, UK and Newport, US, either side of a maiden Wimbledon main-draw appearance – which she achieved by winning three rounds of qualifying, saving match point in the final round.

Earlier this year, Gibson secured her first Grand Slam main draw win at the Australian Open, coming from a set down in a memorable debut at Melbourne Park.

Gibson also expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to make her US Open main draw debut.

“This is an incredibly rewarding acknowledgment for all the hard work my team and I have been putting in and for the results I've had this year. I can't wait to get out there and give it my very best and make everyone proud,” Gibson said.

Schoolkate and Gibson will join 12 other Australians – eight men and four women – in the US Open main draw, where the action kicks off on Sunday 24 August.

A further seven men and 10 women will represent Australia in qualifying, commencing Monday 18 August.

What a week for Victoria Mboko, who capped her breakout run by outlasting Naomi Osaka in three sets to win her first WTA 1000 title on home soil in Montreal.

Unlikely. Unexpected. Unforeseen. Those words seem to fall far short of explaining what happened in this abbreviated fortnight in Montreal.

Victoria Mboko, an 18-year-old Canadian wild card is the winner of the Omnium Banque Nationale. On Thursday night she completed another rousing comeback, defeating four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka 2-6, 6-4, 6-1.

It's the first WTA Tour title for Mboko.

Her fortnight included four victories over Grand Slam champions -- Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff, Elena Rybakina and Osaka. Gauff and Rybakina were seeded No. 1 and No. 3. It's the first time that's happened in a single tournament since Ons Jabeur and Elina Svitolina in Wimbledon 2023 -- but they weren't teenagers. Mboko is the second youngest to do it in the entire Open Era. The first was Serena Williams in 1999.

And to think: Mboko started the year ranked No. 333.

“It's been an incredible week here in Montreal,” Mboko said at the trophy presentation, going on to thank the ball kids, officials and volunteers. “I also want to thank Naomi for an incredible match. I've always looked up to her when I was really little, so it's always great to play with an amazing player like you.”

“Lastly, I want to thank every single one of you who came to support me throughout this whole week. You guys were incredible, and I couldn't be more grateful.”

Mboko is only the third Canadian champion at the Canadian Open in the Open Era after Faye Urban in 1969 and Bianca Andreescu în 2019. She's also only the third wild card to win a WTA 1000 title since the format's introduction in 2009 after Maria Sharapova (Cincinnati 2011) and Bianca Andreescu (Indian Wells 2019).

It was a wild one, featuring 13 service breaks -- in 25 games.

The most telling statistic: Mboko converted eight of nine break points.

There were 32 seeded players in the Canadian Open, but none in this final -- for only the third time in the Open Era. For only the sixth time in a WTA 1000. Two players ranked outside the Top 40 of the WTA rankings faced each other in a WTA 1000 final for the first time since the format's introduction in 2009.

Mboko was a revelation here. Her ranking will soar to No. 24 -- up 61 spots.

Both had earlier saved match points, Osaka versus Liudmila Samsonova and Mboko against Elena Rybakina.

The first set was a testament to nerves and, quite possibly, a lingering wrist injury. The 18-year-old Canadian hit two double faults in her opening service game and was broken. Throughout the set, she flexed that heavily taped joint -- after falling on it in the semifinals against Rybakina.

Osaka breezed through the first set, never facing a break point and taking advantage of 22 unforced errors.

But in recent days, Mboko has continually shown a sturdy resilience for someone so young. She lost the first set to Marie Bouzkova in the third round before coming back to win in three. She lost the opening set to Rybakina by the same score -- and came back to win in a third-set tiebreak.

Mboko broke Osaka's serve four times in the second set and held a commanding 5-2 lead, but Osaka fought back and narrowed it to 5-4. Despite opening with a double fault (her 12th), Mboko closed it out when another Osaka forehand soared long.

While Mboko scored a break of Osaka's serve in the third game of the final set, it was the fourth that ultimately proved pivotal.

Mboko fell into a love-30 hole and kept digging out from Osaka's pressure. In a game that featured six deuces, she saved four break-point bids -- and then won it with a cold-hearted drop shot winner, sending the partisan crowd into hysterics.

That made it 4-1 and Mboko backed it up with a hold that ended with an ace and another Osaka forehand into the net.

She broke Osaka for the eight time when a backhand found the net and fell to her knees. The capacity crowd rose to its feet one more time and gave her a sustained ovation.

.

In a new series of features, Formula 1.com is delving into the F1 driver bubble to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of Grand Prix racing. In this piece, Aston Martin Head of Performance Optimisation Ben Michell explains how the key relationship between driver and race engineer works.

Modern Formula 1 teams are huge companies with hundreds of employees all working hard to try to be the best in the sport. But within these vast organisations there are the teams within a team – the small cadre of people centred around helping each driver perform at their maximum.

In a new series of features, Formula 1.com is delving into those bubbles to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of F1. In this piece, Aston Martin Head of Performance Optimisation Ben Michell explains how the key relationship between driver and race engineer works…

Every time a driver climbs into the cockpit they are ensconced alone in one of the world's smallest offices. But back in the garage – and at their respective factories – they have a team of specialists studiously working to ensure that every ounce of performance is extracted from both the driver and their machine. And the link from the driver to all that expertise, data and experience is the race engineer – the person we hear talking to them over the team radio when they're out on track.

Iconic F1 camera angles

From films and TV, to music videos and more – Formula 1 has occasionally appeared in places many would least expect over its 75 years of history.

The appeal and influence of Formula 1 has stretched far beyond the boundaries of the world's race tracks over the last 75 years, with the sport, its drivers and teams appearing in a plethora of different media.

From films and TV series, to music videos, adverts and everything else in between, there's been no shortage of inspiration taken from the championship over the last seven-and-a-half decades.

Here are 20 unlikely times that F1 appeared elsewhere in the last 75 years...

Released in 2006, the film Cars follows rookie racer Lightning McQueen as he attempts to win the Piston Cup and put his name amongst the greats via the usual trials and tribulations that are the cornerstone of most Disney films.

The film is a favourite of many F1 fans, as well as Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson, in part due to the motorsport greats that lend their voices to the film, with voiceovers from 1978 Formula 1 World Champion Mario Andretti, and NASCAR legends Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr.

Perhaps the most memorable cameo, though, is by seven-time F1 World Champion Michael Schumacher, whose Ferrari character makes an appearance in the shop of hardcore Tifosi, Luigi and Guido.

This would also not be the last time other notable F1 drivers cropped up in the franchise, with the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel supplying their voices in the sequels.

Lewis Hamilton's interest in fashion has become well-known through his collaborations with Tommy Hilfiger and numerous appearances at the infamous Met Gala, where he has sported some truly show-stopping attire.

Before all that, though, the seven-time World Champion appeared in the 2016 film Zoolander 2, making a cameo appearance as a member of the audience during a model catwalk scene.

Quite what the Briton made of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson being covered in prune juice is anyone's guess, but it clearly didn't dissuade Hamilton's appetite for Hollywood, having taken on a producer role for F1 The Movie, which was released last month.

The Marvel franchise has become one of the biggest brands across the globe, its rise in popularity and run of countless movies stemming from the successful release of Iron Man in 2008.

The film's sequel two years later, while not as well-received, is famous with motorsport fans due to its racing scene at the Monaco Historique where Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr, gets behind the wheel.

Having commandeered his own Stark-sponsored car on the starting grid, and much to the disgust of regular driver 'Defilipo', Stark proceeds to race around the streets of Monte Carlo until attacked by arch-nemesis, Whiplash, who enters the track after posing as a marshal.

It makes for an eye-catching and memorable scene for motorsport fans on the streets of the Principality.

A story about a man confined to an airport may well be one of the most unlikely of places anyone might expect to see a reference about Formula 1, but Steven Spielberg's The Terminal, released in 2004, does just that.

Viktor Navorski, played by Academy Award-winner Tom Hanks, finds himself stranded in an American airport and without citizenship due to a coup back home in his native Krakozhia.

It leads to a scene with Navorski walking around his new but unconventional home in a bathrobe before heading to the bathroom, where he dons an Ayrton Senna McLaren towel no less.

It's anyone's guess where Hanks' character got the piece of F1 memorabilia or indeed what would happen to it, but no doubt the item would now be a treasured piece of merchandise.

Famous for being arguably the greatest driver never to win the Formula 1 World Championship, Sir Stirling Moss' passion for motorsport never diminished, even in his later years.

A 16-time Grand Prix winner as well as famously taking victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia, Moss also added narration to his résumé as he lent his voice to children's television programme, Roary the Racing Car.

Running across two seasons and 104 episodes between 2007 and 2010, Moss described it as ""a jolly good entertaining programme. I got involved in the show because I thought it was fun. It was nice for children, I've got grandchildren myself who, whenever they listen to it, they say, ‘There's grandpa'.""

The music video for Robbie Williams' song, Supreme, may have got a few more fans in the year 2000 thanks to its use of historical F1 footage, in particular the early 1970s and three-time World Champion, Jackie Stewart.

The singer plays the role of 'Bob Williams', with the video charting his quest to beat Stewart for the F1 World Championship, including escaping injury from a serious accident, victories and ultimately missing the championship decider after getting locked in a caravan!

Complete with period sideburns, Williams appears in several of his own scenes but is also super imposed alongside Stewart and Tyrrell team mate Francois Cevert on the podium, in some green screen work that even today looks just about passable!

Romain Grosjean achieved 10 podiums during an F1 career spanning more than a decade, although it's unclear if the Frenchman counts an unofficial rostrum finish that occurred during a David Guetta music video.

Guetta plays an F1 driver for his aptly named song, Dangerous, and goes head-to-head with his rival, played by actor James Purefoy, in a championship showdown at the Jerez Circuit with the help of a 2012 Lotus E20 F1 car, alongside what appears to be Formula Renault machines.

Guetta ultimately proves victorious before being joined on the podium by Purefoy and a confused-looking Grosjean, who appears gracious with third-place, while probably wondering why he's been dragged into the mix at all.

A collaboration between the Alpine F1 team and Amazon Music meant that Pierre Gasly appeared in the music video for Benson Boone's To Love Someone while at the Mexico City Grand Prix.

After being doorstepped, although presumably having been told it was going to happen, the one-time Grand Prix winner agrees to appear in the video, which is filmed in the hotel's gym and children's playroom area, because why not?

The video's narrative is of a 'bromance' between the two before Gasly's fame means they drift apart, leading to an interesting final result...

Formula 1 drivers appearing in adverts and promoting products from engine oil and cars, to watches and even milk is nothing new, and the practice stretches as far back as the inauguration of the championship.

Two-time World Champion Jim Clark was no stranger to the concept, appearing in an advert for the British School of Motoring during the 1960s.

The Scot, who won 27 Grands Prix as well as the Indianapolis 500 all with Lotus, died in an F2 accident at Hockenheim in 1968 just as major tobacco sponsorship entered the sport and heralded a new era of F1 driver advertisements and endorsements.

With five F1 world titles to his name for four different manufacturers during the inaugural decade of the championship, it's little wonder Juan Manuel Fangio is referred to as 'El Maestro'.

The Argentinian retired from racing in 1958 at the age of 47 but Fangio would still continue to showcase his prowess behind the wheel through demonstration runs over the following decades, including in adverts.

In one, for Pirelli's Cinturato tyre, Fangio – attired with leather gloves, goggles and a tie – takes the wheel of an Alfa Romeo on Monza's high-speed banking at racing speeds and rolls back the years.

With World Championship success comes added media attention and a plethora of endorsements, as proved to be the case for James Hunt, although the 1976 Champion already had quite the portfolio beforehand thanks to his playboy lifestyle and charismatic persona.

The season after his title success, Hunt found himself in an advert for Texaco oil, a prominent sponsor for McLaren during the Briton's tenure with the team.

Throw into the mix British comedic duo Morecambe and Wise, some quick-witted one-liners and an F1 World Champion trying to contain a laugh while being slapped, and an unforgettable sketch was born.

Prior to his full-time F1 racing career that would yield 31 wins and the 1992 World title, Nigel Mansell patrolled the streets of the Isle of Man as a police officer – and based on an advert from the 1980s, tried his hand as a bus driver briefly.

Attired in his Williams overalls, Mansell takes to the wheel of a double-decker bus around London, which presumably handled better than some of the racing cars he drove in his career.

By their nature, Formula 1 drivers are competitive beings even away from the racetrack and in their day-to-day lives.

That was certainly the case for Mansell (appearing on this list again), who in between his busy F1 schedule finds time to race against his son, Leo, on the latest Formula Tyco set. Complete with Murray Walker commentary, Mansell comes off second best in this blast from the past advert.

Long before Esports, high-end graphics and EA's F1 game franchise, racing games looked very different but still proved popular, and Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II was no different.

Released in 1992 by Sega for the Sega Genesis, the game revolved around the 1991 season, the year which produced the third and final F1 title for the Brazilian.

Senna himself was involved in the game's development, offering his insight into various elements of the gameplay, recording voicelines and even featuring in an advert that was used in Japan.

It wasn't the only racing game to hit the shelves that year endorsed by an F1 driver either, as Mansell also backed his own World Championship Racing title – although that one was advertised by British comedian Rik Mayall wearing a false moustache and eyebrows…

With his exuberance and sheer passion for the sport, Murray Walker became a well-loved mainstay for many in his role as a commentator.

His love of Formula 1 unsurprisingly helped him form close friendships with several drivers, not least co-commentators James Hunt and Martin Brundle, but also Damon Hill – and his 1996 Japanese Grand Prix commentary (""I've got a lump in my throat"") revealed the deep connection the two had.

It's not surprising then that the pair teamed up for a Pizza Hut commercial in the late 1990s, Murray bringing his usual excitement and wit, while Hill makes the disturbing decision of eating a slice of pizza… backwards!

Ferrari is synonymous with Formula 1, the Italian marque having been involved in the championship every year since the inaugural season 75 years ago.

Through all the highs and just as many lows that have both blessed and plagued Ferrari, Shell has been there as a partner for more than seven decades. It's perhaps fitting then that the fuel corporation launched an advert in the mid-2000s celebrating its collaboration with Ferrari in F1.

Cars throughout Ferrari's history are showcased as they take to the streets in Rome, New York and Monte Carlo, creating one of the most memorable motorsport adverts of all time.

The fractious battle between two-time and reigning World Champion Fernando Alonso and F1 rookie Lewis Hamilton during their one season together in 2007 as team mates at McLaren has gone down in infamy.

It's perhaps ironic then, that the pair filmed a commercial for Mercedes where their competitive nature came to the fore even before their relationship broke down.

Edited to the tune of Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better), the pair compete to be the first to do menial, day-to-day tasks, foreshadowing the intense intra-team battle that was to come that season as both missed out on the Drivers' Championship by a single point – ultimately losing out to a Finn in both the advert (Mika Hakkinen) and the 2007 championship (Kimi Raikkonen).

Driving solo around an in-door go-kart track, avoiding scattered milk cartons and proceeding to sing an out of tune melody probably doesn't rank that high on Mark Webber's list of accolades.

Yet the ex-F1 driver, who would claim nine Grand Prix victories with Red Bull, including two at the Monaco Grand Prix, performed just such an advert.

It's not clear whether Webber has erased all existence of the ad from his memory, but thankfully the clip remains available to view with the help of YouTube.

F1 drivers appearing in video games is nothing new, especially given the officially licensed racing games that have been released on a yearly basis.

But what is less common is for F1 drivers to appear in other genres of video games, not least the Call of Duty franchise. Eagle-eyed gamers will have noticed that Lewis Hamilton makes an appearance in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare as engineer Carl Hamilton, having been scanned into the game as well as delivering voiceovers.

The Dragon Ball franchise is not only one of the biggest in Japan but also globally through its manga and anime releases, predominantly during the 1980s and 1990s.

Main protagonist Goku even appeared as an ambassador for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, so it's no surprise that the franchise became involved with F1 for a time.

Back in 1990, creator Akira Toriyama travelled to Germany to meet Ayrton Senna and a collaboration developed over the season, with several pieces of artwork featuring Goku in McLaren gear created, while manga publication Shonen Jump featured as a sponsor on the team's MP4/5 at the Japanese Grand Prix.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

Iconic F1 camera angles

Tom Holland swaps webs for wheels, from waving Monaco's chequered flag, grinning in a Williams at Silverstone, and cheering Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris like Britain's biggest Formula 1 superfan.

Tom Holland might be best known for swinging through New York on the big screen as Spider Man, but away from the Marvel Universe, he's also a passionate Formula 1 fan.

Holland first stepped into the paddock at the 2019 British Grand Prix, and since then has become a familiar face at races from the glamour of the grid in Monaco to a rain-soaked Silverstone.

Here's everything you need to know about the biggest F1 fan in the spider-verse...

Born: 1 June 1996
Claim to Fame: From the West End's Billy Elliot to Hollywood's Spider-Man
Off-Track Life: Shares the spotlight (and plenty of red carpets) with co-star and partner Zendaya.
Fun Fact: Those superhero stunts? All thanks to years of gymnastics training.

1 / 5

Holland visits the Red Bull garage with ex-footballer Neymar

Holland's admiration for Lewis Hamilton is no secret. “He is setting an example for so many people around the world,” he said in an interview with BlackTree TV, noting the Ferrari driver's ability to combine competitive brilliance with personal grace. When he has been asked who he's backing on race day? “Lewis. Always!”

His other favourite Brit? McLaren's Lando Norris. A driver his looks have been compared to so often that he's in on the joke. When asked about a potential collab, “I'm sure there is something like that in the works already,” he teased to On Demand Entertainment. Cue speculation about Twitch streams, a buddy comedy, or the best PR stunt in F1 history.

Waving the chequered flag at Monaco 2023

Holland lived every fan's dream when he waved the chequered flag at F1's most glamorous race. At first, he handled it like a pro, as if he's been training for this moment for years, but then his enthusiastic style became a bit wild – but it was still an undoubtedly iconic moment from the Brit. His verdict on the sought after opportunity? “Unlike anything!”

Silverstone cockpit thrill

Not even rain could dampen his spirits at the 2025 British Grand Prix. After cheering on pal Lewis Hamilton, Holland climbed into a Williams F1 cockpit with palpable excitement.

McLaren plays the Spider-Man theme song

While strolling through the paddock at the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix, Holland was greeted by McLaren blasting the classic Spider-Man theme song as he walked past.

He's all in for the split-second strategy calls, the wheel-to-wheel battles, and the grid's easy camaraderie, maybe even using those Spidey senses to know when the action's about to hit. He's not just a celebrity in the paddock; he's one of us… just with a super-powered day job.

The casting reunites Holmes with the Globe's artistic director, Barry Edelstein, who directed her in the Off-Broadway production of ‘The Wanderers' in 2023. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Katie Holmes has a date with the stage in Southern California.


	The veteran star is set to topline a new adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's iconic work Hedda Gabler at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre. The casting reunites Holmes with the Globe's artistic director, Barry Edelstein, who directed her in the Off-Broadway production of The Wanderers in 2023.




	Hedda Gabler will kick off the 2026 season on the Donald and Darlene Shiley Stage at the Old Globe Theatre, part of the Globe's Conrad Prebys Theatre Center in San Diego's Balboa Park. Performances begin Feb. 7 and will continue through March 8. Opening night is Feb. 12.

					Katie Holmes on Why She's ""Adamant"" About Not Letting Hollywood ""Dictate"" What She Wears		
			









	Edelstein will direct the fresh take, which was commissioned by the Globe and adapted by veteran playwright and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, whose long list of feature film credits includes Secretary, Men, Women & Children, The Girl on the Train, Chloe and Snow White. For the stage, she has penned Hands, Wilder, Stop All the Clocks, The Trail of Her Inner Thigh, The Erotica Project, Hurricane, My Girl is in Front and others. 


	Holmes will star as the title character in the story of what happens when Hedda and her husband, George Tesman, return from their honeymoon with cracks in their union already showing. Bored and restless, she tries to control those around her but as her schemes tighten, her own world begins to unravel.


	“Hedda Gabler is one of the landmark works of world drama and I'm truly thrilled to bring a bracing new take on it to the Globe,” said Edelstein, who serves as the Erna Finci Viterbi artistic director at the Globe. “Like all of Ibsen's plays, this one is obsessed by how the choices we make in our pasts come back around to shape our present. That's why it's so fun that it reunites me with two artists I've had significant collaborations with over the years. One is playwright and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, who renews this classic through her frank and dynamic voice, with incendiary results. The other is a major figure in American film, TV, and theatre, the wonderful Katie Holmes.”

	











	Edelstein continued: “Hedda, like Hamlet, rises or falls with the actor in the title role. She's everything: victim, tyrant, femme fatale, funny, scathing, tragic. Only an actor with immense imagination and charisma can take on Hedda Gabler, and in Katie's radiant and powerful performance, Globe audiences are going to witness something rare and special. She's an artist at the height of her powers and we're lucky to have her in San Diego.”


	Norwegian scribe Ibsen debuted Hedda Gabler in 1891. The work's Wikipedia page is dense as it's been adapted, staged and reinterpreted countless times over the years. A long list of Hollywood stars have stepped into the title role, among them Anne Meacham, Ingrid Bergman, Peggy Ashcroft, Diana Rigg, Glenda Jackson, Isabelle Huppert, Kate Burton, Kelly McGillis, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Jane Fonda, Annette Bening, Judy Davis, Emmanuelle Seigner, Mary-Louise Parker, Harriet Walter, Rosamund Pike, Cate Blanchett and others.


	More information on casting and the show's creative team will be announced at a later date. Hedda Gabler is supported by lead production sponsor, the Erna Finci Viterbi Artistic Director Fund. Additional support comes from the City of San Diego and the Theodor and Audrey Geisel Fund.


	Holmes is currently shepherding Happy Hours, a feature film she is directing from her own script. She also stars opposite Joshua Jackson, Mary-Louise Parker, Constance Wu and Jack Martin, among others. She is repped by UTA, Untitled Entertainment and Vision PR.

Universal is buying the hot package that will reunite the 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' duo and pair them with action writer F. Scott Frazier. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Angelina Jolie and Doug Liman, who famously worked together on Mr. and Mrs. Smith, are reteaming for another thriller set in the world of spies.


	Coming on top of multi-studio competition, Universal is wrapping up the final deal points to land The Initiative, a hot spy package that sees Jolie attached to star, Liman on board to direct and F. Scott Frazier writing the script.




	Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum of RK Films will produce. The longstanding banner, which in recent years produced Netflix hit Damsel and Sony's rom-com smash Anyone But You, had previously worked with Jolie on the big-budget Disney fantasy Maleficent movies.

					Starry Palm Springs Film Awards to Get Bigger Dose of Glamour With New Kering Sponsorship		
			









	Described as a “Training Day set in the world spycraft,” the story would see Jolie playing a rogue master spy named Bright who works outside the lines (because sometimes you need someone bad to bring down people who are even worse, as the movies have taught us). When a new agent named Charlie joins Bright's team, he soon finds himself in situations where he isn't sure whether his new boss is trying to kill him or simply is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect the free world.


	The studio and filmmakers are hoping to move fast on this, eying a possible start of production in the first quarter of 2026.


	Executive vp of production development Jay Polidoro and director of development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio.


	Jolie has oscillated from the fantastical, starring in 2021's Eternals and the two Maleficent films, to the dramatic, appearing in last year's Maria Callas biopic Maria. A project such as Initiative could return the actress to her propulsive and perhaps stylish action thriller era in which she made movies such as Salt and The Tourist.

	











	Liman released two movies last year — Roadhouse, which was one of the biggest hit ever on Amazon MGM, and The Instigators, seen on Apple TV+.  The filmmaker has a bond with Universal, having worked the studio a few times before, launching the Bourne franchise in 2002 with The Bourne Identity, and with the Tom Cruise vehicle, American Made, in 2017.


	He remains attached to the underwater event film Deeper with Cruise starring and producing, which has been delayed due to specific weather window needs. (The whole movie takes place on and under water.) Liman is also developing the untitled Universal Pictures Space Film, also to star Cruise.


	Frazier is a veteran scribe of the action trade, having worked on movies such as Collide, starring Nicholas Hoult and Anthony Hopkins, and XXX: The Return of Xander Cage, which brought back the Vin Diesel-starring action hero for a new outing. Last year, he and collaborator Jimmy Loweree set up the adventure two-hander Outdueled in a bidding war won by Amazon.  


	Liman, Frazier and Kirschenbaum are repped by CAA. Liman is additionally repped by Weintraub Tobin and Frazier is additionally repped by manager Chris Cowles at AllDayEveryDay and McKuin Frankel.


	Jolie is repped by WME and Johnson Shapiro.

Sure, the podcast trailblazer interviewed Obama — but there are plenty more highlights among the 1600+ episodes he's logged over 16 years.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	Marc Maron's recent announcement that he's ending his long-running podcast may have come as a surprise, but it's not like the guy hasn't earned a break. The comic has delivered two episodes a week for 16 years, even as his workload has grown significantly with comedy specials and acting gigs in such series as GLOW and Stick and films like The Joker and Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere. So as this moments finds many revisiting his legacy or discovering him for the first time, here are a few of the many must-listen conversations — both heartbreaking and hilarious — that he's had since he helped pioneer the medium. (For more on Maron, read The Hollywood Reporter's cover story.)


Robin Williams


	Later inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress, the episode features the late comic on insecurities and suicide.


Gallagher


	When Maron questions the watermelon-smashing comic on his homophobic and racist remarks, we hear the first-ever WTF walk-off. “Come on, Gallagher!”


President Barack Obama


	The Secret Service came to Maron's house for one of the essential texts in WTF history and of the Obama presidency.


Lynn Shelton 


	This blind date between eventual partners doubles as a lovely portrait of a filmmaker whose brilliant career was cut far too short.


Lorne Michaels


	Maron gets to air his grievances over his failed SNL interview for a particularly game Michaels, who so rarely (read: never) gives this much of his time.


 Mavis Staples


	The then-80-year-old R&B singer mines her colorful career in what's regarded as one of WTF‘s best conversations.


Brad Pitt & Leonardo DiCaprio


	Not one but two A-listers pay a visit to talk about the '90s and mega-fame, all while fawning over the host.


Jane Goodall


	Another example of Maron's diverse interests, the acclaimed primatologist low-key suggests that Bigfoot is real before this recording stops.


Andrew Garfield


	The Garfieldnaissance can be traced to this winning hour where the actor opens up about career anxieties and losing his mother.


Ariana Grande


	A pop star at the top of her game, Grande gets real and tries to get even realer: “I thought we'd be talking a lot more about death.”

Comedy Central is celebrating a ""South Park Day"" of programming for the show's anniversary instead of airing another season 27 episode. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


South Park is so on fire right now, it even makes news for not airing an episode.


	Comedy Central is not airing a new episode of the animated hit series this week — the second time the show has not run a weekly episode since its season 27 premiere just a few weeks ago. But unlike when the show abruptly skipped its second week of the season (and unlike when the season premiere itself was delayed two weeks), this hiatus has been baked into the schedule for a while. 




	Instead, the cable network has declared Aug. 13 “South Park Day” and is running a marathon of fan-favorite episodes starting at 9 a.m. ET which leads up to an airing of the show's first episode, “Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,” in the show's usual 10 p.m. ET time slot. The programming will also feature interviews with creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, behind-the-scenes footage and rare clips. The event marks the anniversary of the show's first episode in 1997.

					Kristi Noem Fires Back at 'South Park' for Mocking Her Looks		
			









	The pause also gives the production a bit of breathing room. The show operates on a famously tight schedule, with Parker and Stone creating entire episodes in just six days and often delivering a locked cut hours before Comedy Central's deadline.  


	The skipped week comes amid the production experiencing a massive — and perhaps unprecedented — amount of attention and scrutiny while heavily targeting the Trump Administration (and, in the season premiere, its own parent company, Paramount Global). While the Administration has gamely, and repeatedly, fired back. 

	











	Earlier this week, the production released a bonus “end credits scene” to last week's episode mocking Kristi Noem. The clip (below) showed the Homeland Security Secretary shooting up a pets store. The production's X page also changed its avatar to Noem's “melting face” from the episode after she blasted the show, saying, “It's so lazy to make fun of women for how they look. Only the liberals and the extremists do that.” 


	Meanwhile, the show's ratings have been setting records. The season 27 premiere delivered 6 million cross-platform viewers and had the show's biggest share in 25 years. Early estimates from Samba on the show's second episode showed live viewing jumping 25 percent from the season premiere. 


	Season 27 consists of 10 episodes and is expected to continue next week.

Sixteen years after his show launched an industry and saved his career, the curmudgeonly conversationalist is feeling conflicted about what followed: “Things were better before everyone had a voice.”


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	Most mornings, Marc Maron wakes up spiraling. Each turn of the globe brings a fresh catastrophe, a crisis, real or imagined, that sends the comedian back into battle with his tenacious anxiety. This isn't great for mental health, but it does make for good material. And today, his psyche is playing the hits.


	“I got cat problems,” Maron sighs, a Zyn pouch migrating from the inside of his left cheek to the right. “I've got one that's just beating the shit out of another one, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. You want your home to be a place where you can relax.”

	Maybe the nicotine is helping with that. At least for the moment, Maron seems to surrender to the discord between two of his three roommates, though stand-up's most famous cat guy is never not a little on edge. He'll kvetch about anything to anyone. Right now, it's in his front yard with an audience of one. He'll find more humor in the latest war at home when he's onstage this evening. He'll write about it in his blog. And he'll absolutely monologue about this on his podcast.


	He launched WTF With Marc Maron in 2009, a time of personal and professional desperation, when podcasting was still a cultural vacuum mostly populated by repurposed NPR content. Many of his peers thought that Maron, who has struggled with depression and addiction, had finally lost it. But his candor and curiosity soon had comics, actors, intellectuals and eventually a sitting president trekking to a cluttered garage studio on the east side of Los Angeles to talk and listen to a self-described failure.

	











	“Sometimes the complete artist is there — they just need to find the medium,” says Conan O'Brien, who booked his longtime friend for 42 appearances on NBC's Late Night before WTF made Maron mainstream. “He was very funny on television, but for whatever reason, he needed to be in the wilderness for a while. The pod was the perfect place for his freak flag to fly at full mast.”


	For 16 years, Maron has used his platform to do just that. But in June, he and his day one producer, Brendan McDonald, announced that they were burned out. WTF ends in October after more than 1,680 episodes and inspiring countless others to grab a mic and capitalize on the booming genre Maron helped popularize. As for this 62-year-old pioneer, he'll focus on an accelerating acting career (see his supporting roles on the Apple TV+ comedy Stick and the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere), his stand-up and perhaps some self-care.


	“Howard Stern mentioned us stopping the show,” Maron says. “He said, ‘Well, if they're burnt out, I must be dead.' I don't know if he knows the irony in that. There is something about solidifying a legacy when you stop, as opposed to just fading away.”


	On more than one occasion, Maron refers to WTF‘s impending conclusion as “the change” — as if it were some biological rite of passage to endure rather than a decision he made. But for a guy with loner-ish tendencies like Maron, this could herald an existential crisis. The podcast is his primary tether to the world. His conversations — do not call them interviews — expand his social circle. And his confessional episode intros, which tackle matters as mundane as the latest cat updates and as wrenching as the death of his late partner, director Lynn Shelton, have cultivated a unique bond with many who contribute to his 55 million in annual listens. He's anxious about how he'll adjust to losing all of that. Still, he suggests zero reservations about leaving the medium that finally delivered the exposure he'd longed for. It's pretty crowded out there, if you hadn't noticed.

	











	“Things were better before everyone had a voice,” Maron says. “Now there's just hundreds of groups of two or three white guys, sitting behind mics, talking about the last time they shit their pants as adults. We live in a world of mediocre afternoon drive-time radio.”


	***


	The Maron house does not smell like cats. This feels worth acknowledging because almost every home with them, no matter how expensive the litter box, shares that unmistakable aroma. Oh, and when Maron returned from a trip to his home state of New Mexico days earlier, the youngest had defecated in almost every room. Charlie has hostility issues and anxiety-induced colitis. But when I arrive at the Glendale craftsman they all share, he lies down at my feet, belly up, as Buster and Sammy keep to themselves. Team Charlie.


	This is not the property where Maron launched WTF. He sold that in 2018. When it was back on the market two years ago, the listing emphasized Maron's time there and treated the since-remodeled garage studio like it was an architectural landmark. “Every guest had to come through that small house,” he says, coffee in hand and feet up on his wraparound porch. “If they had to use the bathroom, they had to use my bathroom and then walk out into that garage. It was an immersive experience in whatever the hell my life was at that time.”

	











	Maron's life was not where he wanted it to be when he started WTF. He'd been working as a stand-up since 1987, starting as a doorman at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles just after he graduated from Boston University. He briefly found himself in Sam Kinison's cocaine-fueled orbit until the volatile comic peed on Maron's bed. He'd spend a decade in New York before ultimately settling back in L.A. Neither coast saw his stage work bring the fame or TV opportunities that came to such contemporaries as Bob Odenkirk, Jon Stewart or Louis C.K. At this point sober for 10 years, he was still nursing the wounds inflicted by his second divorce — “the bad one” — and money was becoming a problem. Maron didn't shy away from any of it whenever he sat down to talk in that garage.


	His honesty about all of it — with himself, his listeners and his guests — immediately brought people to the fledgling medium. Six months in, a frank exchange with Robin Williams that prophetically touched on his suicidal thoughts accelerated Maron's upward trajectory. By 2015, he got an hour with then-President Barack Obama. It was a watershed moment for digital media. There were 735,063 downloads in the first 24 hours. What reservations publicists had about putting talent in a chair opposite Maron either dissipated or were merely ignored by their clients.


	“Marc has one hand flipping you off and one hand reaching out to you,” says Betty Gilpin, who sat down for WTF in 2019 after acting opposite him for three seasons of the Netflix dramedy GLOW. “It's what makes him so wonderful. His podcast is an antidote to the forced authenticity of so much press. Against all odds, two narcissistic, self-promoting people can talk to each other and really can get curious and vulnerable and connect. Of course everyone would try to copy him.”

	











	Comedian and actor Bobby Lee counts himself among those who took Maron's cues. “Marc became the light showing you where to go after Hollywood closed the door,” says Lee, a two-time WTF guest with two pods of his own. “Once MadTV was canceled, things weren't clicking for me. So, I followed his footsteps. He taught me the ropes, and it reinvented my career.”


	This kind of reverence and credit can be lost on Maron. “Constantly, out of a persistent insecurity or spite, I just compare myself to people that are more successful than I am — or people I've decided are more successful,” cops Maron, who will list off his bona fides then immediately insist his stand-up isn't entertaining. “I don't always understand why I'm not more successful. I'm starting to.”


	Nobody, not any therapist, friend or ex, has probably heard more of this than Maron's producer. McDonald has been with him since they worked at the short-lived liberal radio network Air America in 2004. And after putting together every episode of WTF, McDonald speaks about his collaborator with unique insight.


	“He's a very capable person despite presenting himself as just holding on by his fingernails,” says McDonald. “I keep telling him over and over again, like, ‘You won, dude. You've gotten to the place where a lot of people are trying to get to. You have complete financial and artistic independence to do what you wish.' ”

	











	Maron describes McDonald as the longest and healthiest relationship he's had. And while neither recall any big fights, there have been disagreements. After Obama's appearance blew their booking options wide open, Maron didn't always bite when McDonald wanted him to. Notably, Hillary Clinton was pitched around the release of her 2017 book about her then-fresh loss to Donald Trump. It was a quick pass for Maron.


	“‘You're the guy to do this,' ” McDonald recalls telling him. “He adamantly disagreed.”


	“The success rate of getting to a candid place with politicians is very small,” says Maron, who considers his Obama episode a rare exception. “And this is somebody who's divisive and controversial and has a history that's somewhat sordid, not by any fault of her own, but I just didn't see where I could go with that.”


	Their unanimous decision to end WTF came in October as they entered the final year of their distribution deal with Acast, knowing that taking the podcast further with any partner would involve concessions they weren't willing to make. More advertising and the pressure for spinoffs are among his reservations, but particularly offensive to Maron is the industry-wide expectation to put everything on camera. “A lot of yammering in makeshift studios,” he says. “It's lowering the bar for everything.”


	***

	











	Maron is almost singular in his ability to talk shit. Unfortunately, he claims to be watching his mouth today. An innocuous comment about his former (and one-sided) rivalry with The Daily Show‘s Stewart is making the rounds, and Maron is kicking himself for stepping into clickbait. One and a half more Zyns and another cup of coffee later, he cannot help himself — especially as the conversation turns to his fellow podcasters.


	I bring up a 2019 episode of actor Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert, during which Maron posed that podcasting might be becoming a cancer, and he does not wait for my question.


	“That was before he sort of became me,” says Maron.


	“What do you mean by that?”


	“I have a model that I established,” he explains. “There are certain people that work within that model. And I think Dax is one of them. I opened up a zone within this medium just before it became really viable. That's what I think.”


	We may have Maron to blame for the ubiquitous (and exhausting) podcast preamble, but he did not invent the interview — not that he'll ever call them that: “I needed to be in the show. And it was instinctual to insert myself into the conversations. It took some people a little time to adjust to that. They were used to interview shows, and I've never ever seen it as an interview show.”


	Shepherd, who cites Maron as his inspiration in that episode's description, is just a drop in the echo chamber. You can't open Spotify without figuratively tripping over an actor, athlete, comedian or musician who has gotten into the interview game. “There's a good chance I wouldn't be doing this if Marc hadn't put podcasting on the map,” says O'Brien, who sold his own podcast network, Team Coco, to SiriusXM in 2022 for a reported $150 million. “He made it legitimate.”

	











	When I ask Maron whether he envies any of the $100 million-plus mega deals his peers have gotten for going corporate, he shakes his head.


	“We did all right,” he says, meaning himself and McDonald, “definitely well enough for us to live the rest of our lives, but those kind of deals come with extreme responsibility. Why would I start scrambling now?”


	He'll mock the podcast industrial complex that sprang up around him, but Maron's also happy to play the mayor. Between our July meeting and a phone call two weeks later, he'll guest on no fewer than nine pods to plug his HBO comedy special Panicked and begin WTF‘s goodbye tour. But there are a few that can probably rule him out as a future booking. Days before the 2024 presidential election, on his blog and WTF, Maron took aim at the male comic podcasters he deemed complicit in normalizing America's far- right swing by cozying up to “self-proclaimed white supremacists and fascists.” He didn't name names, and even today he only calls them “those guys,” but there is little doubt he's nodding to Joe Rogen, Andrew Schulz and Theo Von. Each hosted Trump for softball interviews during the campaign, and all three cling to the “you can't say anything anymore” argument.


	“How they became the arbiters of what comedy should or shouldn't be is a fucking nightmare,” says Maron. “This anti-woke idea around free speech with comedians is bullshit. Whether they knew it or not, they were being used by the right to push this anti-woke agenda, which is now disassembling every progressive policy. They're responsible. I can't let them off the hook for that, even if some of them are kind of backpedaling now.”

	











	In Panicked, Maron makes a crack about how a Von-Hitler interview might go. It's part of the protracted arc where the comic again stews in his own political anxieties, and he just as eagerly blames liberals for “annoying the average American into fascism.” As many comics skirt or completely ignore the vitriolic landscape, Maron has no intention of doing anything but lean in further. And while he admits he's concerned about the small group of corporations who greenlight these projects being spooked by voices critical of the MAGA administration — we're speaking within days of CBS' Stephen Colbert cancellation — he has not heard a peep from HBO about his own content.


	Maron's previous special, 2023's From Bleak to Dark, stands apart from his body of work. It's an exploration of grief in the wake of Shelton's sudden 2020 death from undiagnosed leukemia, a blow that came after a few days of illness they passed off as strep throat. The filmmaker still looms large in Maron's work and life. He first met her during a recording of his podcast in 2015 before striking up a friendship, a collaboration and eventually a romance. He's processed it very publicly, first within days of her May 2020 death when he recorded a raw WTF intro before replaying their 2015 conversation. A small piece of this is included in Are We Good?, an upcoming documentary about Maron framed by Shelton's death, but he's never been able to listen back to that episode in its entirety.

	











	“There's no cultural apparatus to deal with grief,” says Maron. “It is something you have to sit with, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. And sharing it, even in its rawest form like that moment, feels like the right thing.”


	That's not to say Maron's handling of grief, or anything, ever gets too serious. Recounting his visit with Shelton's body after she'd been taken off of life support in From Bleak to Dark, Maron punctures the somber scene with a joke about taking a selfie. “Of course he does,” says Sarah Silverman, who's known Maron for more than 30 years. “I think life is a little bit like torture for him, yet he's still consistently, brilliantly funny about it.”


	***


	There is little Maron won't share, including some fresh psychoanalysis from his girlfriend, Kit. The two started dating in late 2020 after she cold-emailed him a condolence letter. They met for a hike and bonded over mutual anxieties.


	“She just texted me something this morning,” he says, pulling out his phone. “Here it is: ‘I believe you can get on the other side of the mountain in your head. You can do it. You're very powerful when you want to be, but you give that power away a lot because sometimes you want to feel taken care of instead of in charge.' Oh boy. … So, that came out of nowhere.”

	











	Maron does take charge. He'll put Charlie on Prozac in hopes he stops assaulting Buster, and a probiotic has already taken care of that other issue. He recently took his first lead role in a film for In Memoriam, a comedy from writer-director Rob Burnett about a dying actor trying to secure his postmortem slot in the Oscar montage. He'll make the call on who'll be there for his final WTF episode, even if it's just him, alone at the mic, being sad. (He wouldn't say no to a return from Obama, though.)


	“Marc adapts to change fairly well, even if it's done through gritted teeth,” says McDonald. “There's also an inevitability to all of this.”


	The variables that are out of Maron's hands are the ones that give him pause. When we speak again in early August, he's still grappling with the ticking clock on the lifeline he's chosen to sever. “My social life has really been the podcast, mostly, and comedy clubs,” he says. “I'll probably go back to [AA] meetings for a bit of support — to not spiral out with the isms, as they call it. But I don't do dinner parties. No one invites me anywhere. I don't vacation with friends. I need to nourish more relationships.”


	Does that mean Marc Maron wants to be invited out more?


	“Yeah,” he says. “I won't want to do it, but once I'm there, I'll be good. I think that some people like to have me around… But maybe this is all of the change talking. Maybe I am just an old man yelling at the burning sky.”

Eminem is never one to back down from a rap challenge, and after being called out by LL Cool J's Rock The Bells platform on X, Slim Shady delivered.


	Rock The Bells sent over a message claiming that nothing in the English dictionary rhymes with “silver,” and Em responded with a verse starting with just that word, and continued to put together a freestyled verse.

	The effortless bars included plenty of random name-drops, ranging from comic Bill Burr to Super Bowl-winning quarterback Trent Dilfer and a reference to his Stans documentary.

	Slim Shady is still keeping his mind and pen sharp these days. He reunited with JID for “Animals, Pt. 1” in July as part of the Atlanta rapper's GDLU preluxe.

With the help of writer-producers Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd, she crafted one of 2025's buzziest pop debuts.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


“Sometimes it takes you a long time to sound like yourself.”


	That phrase is written on a sign above the bathroom at the studio of all-star vocal coach Eric Vetro. The first time Addison Rae saw it at her own lesson there, the influencer-turned-singer did what she often does when she finds something compelling: She pulled out her phone and took a picture to save for later inspiration.


	“That's a Miles Davis quote,” she tells me. “It is just the realest thing ever because not only does that apply as far as literal vocal warmups go — like, you could sound one way at the beginning of a lesson and another way at the end — but also just finding who you are takes a really long time.”

	











	Today, it's hard to imagine Rae ever felt lost in search of her true self. The 24-year-old confidently struts into Casa Vega, a Mexican spot in Sherman Oaks, Calif., wearing a wide smile and a bright white tutu at noon sharp to meet me for lunch. This storied place has been intertwined with showbiz's rich and famous since it opened in 1956 — films like Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood and Valley Girl were shot here; Dakota Fanning has a signature margarita on the bar menu; Jane Fonda, Marlon Brando and Cary Grant were once regulars; and, more surprisingly, The Chainsmokers have a bronze plaque nailed to the wall above our booth. Rae's entrance makes it immediately clear that she knows she is not only bearing witness to the restaurant's celebrity history — she is part of it. It's easy to believe her.


	Back in 2019, Louisiana-born Addison Rae Easterling was in the process of self-invention. She got her start on TikTok that year as a beautiful girl next door, dancing to popular songs in her bedroom. The hope was that, if she just made enough videos and got enough followers, she could break into the entertainment business and have a multihyphenate career as a singer, dancer and actor. Within a few years, it worked. Rae — along with many of her TikTok contemporaries like Lil Huddy, Nessa Barrett and Dixie D'Amelio — were quickly scouted by major labels, which approached them with offers of big, shiny contracts and songs to record by proven hit-makers.

	











	Rae did not grow up writing songs or playing musical instruments; all of her time was taken up by competitive dance. But she still seized her moment and, in early 2021, signed a deal with Sandlot Records, founded by chart-topping writer-producer Jacob Kash “JKash” Hindlin. By that March, she released her first single, “Obsessed.” Despite co-writing it with a who's who of the writing/producing world, including Benny Blanco and Blake Slatkin, it was widely panned. Critics sneered at the cheeky dance-pop tune, claiming it was derivative and hollow (and that was nothing compared with the comments on social media).


	“Initially, I was pretty let down by myself in a lot of ways because I had such high expectations,” Rae says of her early releases. “But I love music so much, and it's ingrained in my life. It didn't make sense for me to ever stop making it.”


	Rae has always prided herself on her work ethic: At her TikTok peak around 2020, she was known for pushing herself to make seven or eight clips a day. And in the years following “Obsessed,” she took the time to hone her artistry, applying the same determined approach that fueled her short-form video output to her music. She studied performance clips from her favorite artists — Madonna, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, among others — and ramped up her own songwriting sessions. She also took more voice lessons and used Tumblr to assemble mood boards of colors, images, songs and videos. It was Rae's way of articulating what she didn't yet have the musical vocabulary for. After years of practice, releasing an EP (AR, which included “Obsessed”) and featuring on Charli xcx's “Von Dutch” remix, Rae finally knew exactly what she wanted. Now she just had to find the partners who could translate it into a hit album.


	“I went into [Columbia Records] with a binder full of my references, and I was like, ‘This is the album I want to make,' ” she recalls. Though the industry's gold rush to sign every TikToker who could carry a tune was largely over by fall 2023, Columbia saw promise in Rae's renewed vision and signed her. Then, in spring 2024, one of her many songwriting sessions brought her into contact with Los Angeles native Luka Kloser, 27, and Stockholm-born Elvira Anderfjärd, 26, a writer-producer duo reared by Swedish hit-maker Max Martin's MXM Publishing. The two women immediately clicked with Rae and understood her vision, helping her transform it within just one session into her musical proof of concept: “Diet Pepsi,” a breathy synth-pop track about the ephemerality of young romance.

	











	Prior to meeting Rae, Kloser and Anderfjärd had already racked up impressive wins. Kloser worked on Ariana Grande's “ordinary things” and Tate McRae's “grave” as well as multiple projects with her own brother, who records as Kid Bloom; Anderfjärd has become a trusted collaborator for artists like Tove Lo and Katy Perry and remixed multiple rerecordings for Taylor Swift. Still, Anderfjärd says that working with Rae was an especially “lucky” experience for herself and Kloser, who are best friends as well as creative collaborators and have joined us for lunch at Casa Vega. “It's so rare to get this kind of trust from an artist,” she says. Kloser adds: “I don't think I've ever experienced such magic in a first session, for lack of a better word. I think it surprised us all.”


	“Diet Pepsi,” released in August 2024, served as a hard reset for Rae's music career, gaining her new listeners and bringing back old ones who had counted her out. It became a critical success and her first Billboard Hot 100 and Pop Airplay hit, peaking at No. 54 and No. 9, respectively. In the following months, Rae sequestered herself with Kloser and Anderfjärd, aiming to create a debut album as sonically clear and acclaimed as “Diet Pepsi.” In June 2025, Addison arrived, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, with only a single additional writer featured on one track (Tove Burman on “High Fashion”) outside of the trio. “Diet Pepsi” remains the album's biggest commercial hit, but Addison spawned plenty of other standout tracks, including “Fame Is a Gun” and “Headphones On,” which also ranked on the Hot 100 and earned Rae the respect that had once eluded her.


	“It's hard to flip the public perception of you and she did it effortlessly,” says Charli xcx, a staunch supporter of Rae's for years. “Her growth and evolution has been expedited because [Rae] knows herself and she's truly not worried about what people think of her.”

	











	Over chips and salsa, I ask Rae what she attributes her success to: Hard work? Talent? Luck?


	“I really just never give up and never quit, no matter what,” Rae says, flashing me a confident grin. “Really, what it comes back to is that I'm fearless — I'm not afraid of much. It doesn't really take me much to try something new and go all in, and here, I went all in.”


“Diet Pepsi” was the first song the three of you wrote together. Tell me about the process of creating it.


Addison Rae: That one started with melody. I remember you were just on the piano, Luka. We were kind of nearing the end of the session and we were like, “OK, well, nothing happened. Nothing was inspiring. So I guess this was fun. You know, whatever.” Then we were like, “Let's just keep playing.” And then Luka went on the piano and —


Luka Kloser: It's so weird to think that those moments can be so substantial in your life. Had we been like, “Let's go get dinner,” there's a chance that we might have remained friendly but would never have entered this world of everything that has happened.


What are your roles in the studio when you're working together?


Rae: It depends… Sometimes I'll have a title or concept and just text it to them.


Elvira Anderfjärd: Addison has great one-liners.

	











Rae: That's what happened with [Addison's] “Summer Forever.” I just knew I wanted to name a song that, and we just went from there. A lot of my songs happen that way, except “Diet Pepsi.” That one was very on the spot while we were in a flow state writing.


Kloser: It's nice when you have a super comfortable environment to create in because we are all able to share just any thought with one another, even if they aren't thought out or massaged yet. It's a no-judgment zone. That makes everyone feel a little bit more fluid in their roles. But it all typically starts with a lyric first or melody first.


When did you decide that you were going to lock in for a full album that would mostly involve just the three of you?


Rae: Once “Diet Pepsi” happened. We all knew it was really special, and so we were, for sure, planning to write again, and the next time we ended up writing was in Sweden… “Money Is Everything” was the second song that we made. “Aquamarine” was the third. Both just came from notes on my Notes app… I think titles can be so telling about what a song is going to be.


How did you take “Aquamarine” from a title to a full track?


Rae: I rewatched [2006 teen rom-com] Aquamarine and wrote down the word just as a title. So I walked [into our next writing session] with “Aquamarine” as a title, and we were kind of just like, “What does this even mean? How do you write a song called ‘Aquamarine'?” But aquamarine, the stone, represents rebirth and transformation, so I ended up being like, “How can we dive into that world?” And then the track just started happening. (To Kloser and Anderfjärd.) I remember we were rewatching that one clip of those flowers. Do you remember that? I had this YouTube video that I put on loop for us while we were making it, of these flowers blooming really quickly…


Anderfjärd: Yeah, you'd put on all those little background videos. ­Honestly, they were super important for the process. It puts us in a trance.

	











Rae: When we did “Summer Forever,” I remember there was that black-and-white old movie. Remember, with the people on the beach rolling around together? I put that on in the background. I do that, I think, every time we write.


Did going to Sweden bring a different energy to the room? How much does location affect the song that gets made?


Anderfjärd: I think so, but sometimes not in a way you'd expect. The first session, for “Diet Pepsi,” we were in the city in this little s—ty place. The vibes weren't there, but that made us have to create our own.


Rae: Personally, I kind of thrive in a space where there's no vibe because then everything naturally doesn't sound as appealing. And then when you get something really special, it's obvious. I think when you're in a place or a space that's too great of a vibe, almost anything could sound good.


“Diet Pepsi” came out in August 2024, and Addison did not arrive for almost another year. Why such a large gap?


Rae: As much as I would have loved for there to be a confirmed album date before I started putting music out, it just didn't happen that way. When “Diet Pepsi” came out, we only had three songs done.


Just before writing and recording “Diet Pepsi,” you recorded the “Von Dutch” remix with Charli xcx. What did you learn from Charli or from watching the phenomenon of brat play out, and how did it inspire you in making your own music?


Rae: Charli really gave me the confidence as a writer, honestly. That's why I felt so sure going into our sessions [for Addison, which happened soon after brat came out]. Most of the sessions I had done before I did the “Von Dutch” remix session with Charli, I had a lot of writers in the room, and I was feeling like I was leaning on writers a lot. Charli really leaned on me and gave me so much confidence, and that's really when a big shift happened for me as far as being a songwriter.


It's rare to see a pop album that only has three people in the liner notes — and even more rare to see liner notes that only list women. How do you think this affected the songs you three made?












Rae: I think the perspective of having a room of only females was just a really different energy than what we're all used to. It doesn't really happen very often… I didn't expect it to happen this way, and I don't think anybody else expected that from me, which was really nice because I think it's always good to have people unsure of what you're going to do. We are all around the same age and have similar life experiences in a lot of ways, being women in this industry.


Luka and Elvira, you're signed to Max Martin's MXM Publishing. What did you learn from watching Martin and other MXM-signed hit-makers?


Anderfjärd: The main thing is that the most important thing is the song. Honestly, it's very easy to forget sometimes. You can get very stressed in a studio environment where it's like, “Let's finish the song when the day is over.” I think they create an environment of just taking our time with it because who's going to care if it took a year to finish or a day?


Kloser: That's true. It's been beautiful to be able to have that kind of mentorship. And I second Elvira: The song is always first. The ego should be left at the door. Just worry about the song. Those guys still show up worried about what song they're going to make today, and that's it. It's a beautiful example to have every day because it's really about the love for the music. It sounds cheesy, but I think their success speaks for themselves — they've really led with their love for the craft more than anything.


Luka, you're from Studio City, Calif., but you often work alongside Swedish talent, including Elvira. Why do you think Swedish pop producers have been so prominent over the past few decades?












Kloser: Oftentimes, people feel like there's this mathematical approach to pop songwriting. That's not completely wrong. There's definitely a toolbox that is there, but I think what sets Scandinavian people apart is that they have free music education. Also, when I hear Swedish people talk, I find it to be very melodic. I just think music is so deep rooted there. Also, Elvira always says that it's dark 90% of the year, so all you can do is huddle up and jam.


Addison, what was it like to show the people around you “Diet Pepsi” for the first time? It was a big departure from your previous work. Did they immediately understand your vision?


Rae: There were people I played it to who were like, “I don't know if this is what people want from you.” And I was like, “Well, I don't think people know what they want from me.” If I had to give any advice to anybody, it would probably just be to do what you want and don't do what people think they want from you because that's already so many steps behind. Once you give somebody what they think they want, it's old news already.


In the earliest part of your music career, did you feel like you were trying to give anyone what you thought they wanted?


Rae: Not necessarily. I didn't think I was trying to please anyone but myself. I had a very imagined world of what my music career would look like since I was little.


	Growing up in dance, my teachers were always playing Britney [Spears]. They were always playing [Lady] Gaga. The Fame had just come out when I was on a competition team and everybody loved Gaga's music. I remember doing an opening number to Madonna's “Hollywood” at my dance studio. I always loved these extravagant pop stars as a little girl. I was just like, “This is what it's like to be a woman, to be a pop star.”


	Maybe my EP felt a little bit more derivative of what I thought me as a pop star was, especially when I was growing up, but now I've become my own thing. I think the album totally took on a life of its own, and it became something that only we could have done by leaning on our instincts and our feelings. That's why it feels so rare and singular.

	











Did the success of “Diet Pepsi” add a lot of pressure for you when you were making Addison?


Rae: I initially struggled with the idea of not having the album done before “Diet Pepsi” came out. There was so much unknown before “Diet Pepsi” came out. We didn't really know what people would think, nor did we really care, which I thought was so nice. And then, people really loved it, which was really nice and so gratifying. But I think it definitely added a layer of pressure initially. It was a lot to follow up.


Anderfjärd: We talked about that a lot around that time because all of us felt that pressure, but then we said, “Let's just not feel the pressure of making another ‘Diet Pepsi' because why would we do that? It already exists.” I think once we settled into that mindset we just thrived.


Addison, your career has been very public from the beginning. How did the weight of public opinion affect you as a young musician who was still learning?


Rae: Initially, I was pretty let down by myself in a lot of ways because I had such high expectations. And then over time, I just completely let that go and released it. I know the way that music makes me feel, and I know that I trust my taste and my instincts.


	And even though I took a kind of break over time to figure out what that meant to me, I think it was so necessary, and that led me to exactly where I needed to be, which is right here with Luka and Elvira.


What other moments when making the album felt like you really coming into yourself as an artist?












Rae: “High Fashion” is probably the one for me because I remember we were struggling at that time. We didn't know where else to go creatively, maybe because of the success of “Diet Pepsi” around that time, and then “High Fashion” happened. That was one where I was like, “OK, I fully trust myself, I fully trust Luka and Elvira, and I fully trust this room we have.”


	Initially, [making music together] was so naive. Everything we were making was for us and private. Once everything was being received in real time and we were still making the album, it felt different. And then “High Fashion” brought us back to that same feeling.


	I had a phase where I was sitting in the studio for days and I had nothing. It was a struggle. It can be hard, communicating with people about your feelings and where you are in life, especially when you're going through a lot. When I was really struggling, there was a lot of weight being put on [Luka's and Elvira's] backs because I was unable to offer up my energy in those moments. I think those times are necessary, though, where you just sit and play and nothing happens or comes out of it.


Anderfjärd: It's those moments where either you can sit and do nothing with that and go home or you can sit and talk about it and become closer. A lot of those moments are what created the groundwork of making a song because we became close enough to talk about everything.


Only 18.9% of songwriters on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart in 2024 were women, according to the University of South California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. Women fared even worse in production roles, representing just 5.9% of production credits. Luka and Elvira, do you think your gender made it harder to break into the industry?


Kloser: In hindsight, allowing ourselves to actually feel it all: Yeah, it did make it harder. There are very supportive men in this industry. And we've been very lucky to be surrounded by men that believe in us. But I mean, it is just a thing, whether you actively feel that it is or not.

	











Anderfjärd: When I was younger, I didn't want to make it into a thing at all because I felt like there was a culture of, like, you have to be tough. Now, being a little older, there's actually things that are so annoying about being a young woman in production.


Kloser: Yeah, this might be self-inflicted, but I feel like I truly have to prove I can actually produce every single time. No one ever questions like, “Oh, he's a producer. Oh, does he actually produce?”


Luka and Elvira, what do you think it is that makes Addison such a standout artist?


Anderfjärd: She's a very creative person who's very tapped into herself. She sees a whole vision ahead of her. It's not just a song — it's a beautiful visual, beautiful styling. For her, everything is connected.


Kloser: Addison is so energetic, optimistic and driven. She has incredible taste. That was the first thing I noticed when I met her. She is truly a student of pop culture, and she knows herself in a way that is infectious to watch.


Are you three making any new music together right now?


Kloser: Nope, this was the last time we're ever [together]. We're divorcing at Casa Vega. (Laughs.)


Rae: (Coyly.) We have. (Laughs.)

Seth Meyers joked that runaway reptile Orpheus will probably get ""like three songs on the next album.""

Zoë Kravitz survived a potentially career-ending mushroom trip on the first season of The Studio, but she almost didn't make it out of a stay at Taylor Swift‘s house without destroying the joint in a mad panic. The actress/director stopped by Late Night With Seth Meyers on Tuesday night (Aug. 12) to share a hilariously harrowing story about the time her mom Lisa Bonet's adorable pet snake almost caused an A-list incident.


	Kravitz said Swift had generously invited the mother-daughter duo to stay in her home during the evacuations caused by the L.A. wildfires in January. “My mom lives in Topanga Canyon, so I said, ‘No, that's a dangerous place to be. Come [here].' And my mom has a pet snake, and so she has her evacuation stuff; she came over with the snake,” Kravitz said. “We ended up having to stay there for maybe about two weeks, and Taylor has this very beautiful house. I think it's from the '30s, like it's a beautiful house, something you want to preserve and take care of.”

	One way to take cover of such a jem is to not lose your reptile in it. But, as the pair were getting ready to leave on their last day and the Blink Twice director was packing up her things, Kravitz told her mom that she really wanted to “be a good house guest. I like to leave places better than I found them. I don't want her [Swift] to even know we were here.' So I was kind of going around and cleaning up, and I'm downstairs and she's upstairs and my phone rings and it's my mom.”




	Uh oh.


	It was Bonet and her voice was “super high,” which made Kravitz think something was amiss. “And she's like, ‘I'm in a little bit of a pickle. Can you come upstairs?'” Kravitz said. That's when she learned that Bonet's pet snake, Orpheus, had found “this little hole in the corner” of the room to hide in.


	Turns out the snake crawled into a hole next to a banquette built into the wall and while Bonet was able to get a hold of the snake's tail, “they're all muscle, they're very, very strong, so she's holding the snake's tail. We don't know what to do.” Kravitz said she started to panic as the snake crawled further and further into the hole. 


	“It's like that scene in Jurassic Park when they're in the car and the branches breaking every time they move,” Kravitz said. “I was panicking so much that my mom likes to say, ‘If I had both hands, I would have slapped you.'” They were saved by the house manager, who showed up with a crowbar to tear apart the banquette so they could reach the snake, adding that they were “ripping up the tile, we're scratching the walls.” 


	In the end, she said, “we completely destroyed Taylor's bathroom, and there was just this moment where I was like, ‘either we destroy her bathroom or I have to tell her that there's a snake somewhere in her house,'” explained Kravitz, with Meyers saying they were “both bad options.” They did end up destroying the bathroom, with Meyers holding up a pic of the aftermath, with cabinets torn apart and Bonet and Kravitz laying on the floor, head-to-head, holding on to the snake with all their might.


	Kravitz said she assured the house manager that she would pay for the damages, asking him to not say anything until was all fixed. “And I remember calling her [Swift] and saying, ‘Hey — also very high voice — I wanted to talk to you about something,' and she was like, ‘Is it the fact that you almost lost a stake in our house and destroyed my bathroom?,'” Kravitz said.

	











	The story — which came on the same day that Swift announced her upcoming 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl —  prompted Meyers to joke that Orpheus is definitely “gonna get like three songs on the next album.”

	U2 helped launch the venue in Sept. 2023, followed by Phish, Dead & Company, the Eagles, EDM artist Anyma and Kenny Chesney. BSB kicked off their 21-show run of Sphere gigs on July 11, with the current residency slated to wind down on Aug. 24 before picking back up in December.




	According to a Billboard report on opening night, the eye-popping spectacle, “transported fans to outer space as a massive screen surrounded them with visuals of a spacecraft right before the band appeared on stage. The Backstreet Boys — Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, AJ McLean and Kevin Richardson — launched into a night of hits with ‘Larger Than Life,' which was the perfect description of the show they had created.”

The new deal is expected to improve remuneration for songwriters, like UMPG and WCM's deals did earlier this year.

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


Spotify has struck a new direct licensing agreement with Kobalt. The news follows about six months after the streaming service struck agreements with other top publishers — Universal Music Publishing Group and Warner Chappell — both of which reported at the time that their deals with Spotify improved remuneration for songwriters on the platform. 


	Details of the deal remain limited, but a source familiar with the matter says it positions Kobalt to earn beyond the baseline mechanical royalties set by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board. Kobalt's CEO, Laurent Hubert, calls the company's direct deal with Spotify a “step in the right direction” which “reaffirms our unwavering commitment to ensuring our songwriters are paid fairly for their work, and underscores the importance of progressive licensing models that reflect the real-world use of music across digital platforms.”


	Spotify has had strained relations with music publishers and songwriters at different points throughout its history, due to royalty rate disputes, but tensions intensified in March 2024 when Spotify began paying a significantly lessened royalty rate for streams on its premium tiers to songwriters and publishers. This occurred as a result of Spotify reclassifying those tiers as “bundles,” a type of plan that qualifies for a discounted rate on U.S. mechanical royalties given that multiple products — in this case, Spotify's music and newly added audiobooks — are both offered under one price tag.




			Trending on Billboard		







	At the time, Billboard estimated that this change will lead songwriters and publishers to earn about $150 million less in royalties for the first year bundling is in effect, compared to what was projected pre-bundling. More recently, at the National Music Publishers' Association's (NMPA) annual meeting in June 2025, the trade organization representing UMPG, WCM, Kobalt and the vast majority of other publishers reported that the bundle actually led to a loss of $230 million in the first year.


	While the NMPA has lead a broad campaign against Spotify's bundling practices since March 2024, by January 2025, several major players in the music publishing industry had begun exploring private deals with the streaming platform. UMG announced a recording and publishing deal with Spotify first — becoming the first direct deal between Spotify and a publisher since the passage of the Music Modernization Act in 2018. The deal impacted both UMG's recorded music and publishing royalty rates and included language about protection for UMG talent through Spotify's fraud detection and enforcement systems.


	A Spotify spokesperson told Billboard at the time: “Spotify maintains its bundle, but with this direct deal, it has evolved to account for broader rights, including a different economic treatment for music and non-music content.”


	WCM followed shortly after, while Kobalt is the third to follow suit. A press release about Spotify's Kobalt deal says it will “deliver greater flexibility, efficiency, value, and protections to songwriters in the US.”


	Still, Spotify has yet to strike a similar deal with Sony Music Publishing, the largest publisher in the world. A source close to Spotify reveals that while they are having positive discussions with them, there is no deal to date.


	“This deal reflects the collaborative efforts between Kobalt and Spotify in building a licensing framework to enable new formats, innovations, and potential to connect creators and fans alike. The deal also reflects a broader shift toward licensing structures that allow songwriters to participate more directly in the value their work creates on streaming platforms,” the press release continues. 


	While Spotify works to secure direct licenses with music publishers, the company is also working to roll out new features, many of which require the music publishers' cooperation to go through. According to the Wall Street Journal, Spotify is working on a “remix” feature to speed up, mash up and otherwise edit sound recordings. It is also working on licensing music videos in countries around the world — both of which are expected to be part of Spotify's teased ultra-premium tier. As the NMPA warned Spotify in a cease and desist letter to the streamer last year, “any such feature … without the proper licenses in place from our members… may constitute additional direct infringement,” serving as a warning shot to the streamer.  


	“We've always believed that better partnerships lead to better outcomes,” says Alex Norström, co-president & Chief Business Officer, Spotify. “This agreement with Kobalt boosts our support of songwriters through a licensing model that unlocks new growth and will expand the way music is made and shared today.”


	Kobalt's Hubert, adds: “As the largest independent music publisher dedicated to fighting for the rights of songwriters, this deal reaffirms our unwavering commitment to ensuring our songwriters are paid fairly for their work, and underscores the importance of progressive licensing models that reflect the real-world use of music across digital platforms. This partnership is a step in the right direction, and we look forward to continuing to work with Spotify to increase the value of songwriter royalties.”

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Following a stellar opening weekend for Weapons, their mystery-horror film from Zach Cregger, which has grossed over $81M worldwide to date, BoulderLight Pictures is out to the town with Last Night Was a Movie, their first TV series, on which they've partnered with the hot sketch group Almost Friday, sources tell Deadline.


	While we're told the show is a high-concept comedy, specifics as to its plot are under wraps. At present, multiple buyers are circling, including Netflix, FX, HBO and Peacock, with written offers already said to be in from the latter two. The project originated as an idea from the BoulderLight duo of J.D. Lifshitz and Raphael Margules, which they brought to Almost Friday. Creator credit will go to Tyler Falbo, a comedic multi-hyphenate who serves as creator, lead writer, and director for Almost Friday TV. Benjamin Purdy, President of BoulderLight Television, developed the show with Falbo, as well as Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, the creators of Netflix's Peabody Award-winning mockumentary series American Vandal, who will serve as executive producers. 

	











	It's understood that members of the Almost Friday troupe — among them, Billy Langdon, Liam Cullagh, Chet Collins, Eilise Patton, and Will Angus — will be involved in writing and producing the series, though those credits aren't yet worked out. A&E Studios and Range, in which A&E has a minority stake, will serve as the studio.

	Almost Friday Media is a comedy-focused media studio and content network founded in 2019 by brothers Max, Jack, and Sam Barrett in November 2019. The digital-native comedy brand, also comprising a buzzy sketch group, has an interesting origin story, having emerged from the viral Instagram account @friday.beers. Over time, they've evolved into a full-fledged production company, expanding to 25+ brands and creators, and delivering over 1.5 billion impressions every quarter to their 25+ million followers.

	











	The driving concept behind Almost Friday is to dish out relatable content that stems from the relationships we have with our friends, capitalizing on a need for coming-of-age comedy by creating communities based around sports, culture, and comedy that are positive and inclusive. In addition to sketch comedy, the company is responsible for numerous podcasts. While still unknown to many, the company and its comedy troupe of the same name have recently emerged as the entity everyone in comedy is talking about. resently, they claim 802k subscribers on YouTube, 601k followers on Instagram, and 694.1k followers on TikTok, where they have 46.2M likes. Already, Falbo has a number of other big projects in the works, with members like Angus being approached for studio acting roles. Meanwhile, Patton was said to be one of two major standouts at a recent L.A. showcase for Saturday Night Live, as we reported exclusively in our Comedy Means Business newsletter.


	A rising force in comedy, Falbo has worked behind the scenes to shepherd Almost Friday TV to tens of millions of views on YouTube. Currently, he's writing an original feature for Warner Bros. under a blind script deal and developing another TV show with Rough House. Previously, he helmed Bill Burr Presents: Immoral Compass, a dark comedy anthology series for Roku TV, which brought its comedian star Burr an Emmy nomination for his performance.


	For BoulderLight, Weapons marked a reunion with Cregger on the heels of his breakout project, the 20th horror thriller Barbarian. While only grossing around $45M worldwide, that film was so well received, it led to a heated bidding war for his follow-up, which landed at New Line and delivered, critically and commercially, on its potential as one of this year's big breakout genre pictures. (Around the same time, New Line committed to releasing Companion, an AI-themed horror thriller released earlier this year, on which Cregger and the BoulderLight duo of J.D. Lifshitz and Raphael Margules were producers.) Starring Julia Garner, Josh Brolin and Alden Ehrenreich, Weapons tells the story of a town left to grapple with the abrupt disappearance of 17 schoolchildren from one teacher's class in the middle of the night. Already, talks for a prequel, exploring the origins of the malevolent force at the film's center, are underway.


	While BoulderLight's Margules and Lifshitz have been active as producers for a little over a decade, they've really broken through as a heavy-hitter in the genre space within the last few years, with Jason Blum predicting their banner as “the next Blumhouse.” Boasting a first-look deal at New Line, the company also has a real interest in comedy, and is thus a natural fit for a studio that has historically gravitated between their genres of choice. On the comedic side of things, they recently produced the hit A24 film Friendship starring Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd. Other credits include The Vigil, Becky, and Anna Kendrick's directorial debut Woman of the Hour. Most recently, they've been at work on Buddy, a mysterious indie horror film written and directed by Too Many Cooks helmer Casper Kelly, which stars young up-and-comer Delaney Quinn, Cristin Miloti, and Topher grace. They've also of late unveiled a new Amityville movie in development, on which we were first to report, and set up the sci-fi thriller spec Cut Outs at Lew Line.


	BoulderLight's principals are repped by Range and Ziffren Brittenham; Almost Friday by Range.

	











	Falbo is also repped by UTA, which additonally reps Cullagh, Collins, Patton and Angus. Cullagh is also with Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern; Collins with Range; Patton with Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman; and Angus by Mosaic and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the list of this year's Kennedy Center Honorees, the first since he took control of the institution, saying that he will host the December event.


	The honorees this year will be George Strait, Michael Crawford, Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and Sylvester Stallone.


	Unlike past selections, in which honorees were selected by a committee, Trump said that he was “about 98% involved” in the selection and “turned down plenty.” “They were too woke. I had a couple of wokesters,” he said today.


	Stallone has been a longtime supporter of Trump, and was tapped to be one of his so-called ambassadors to Hollywood. Crawford was the star of one of the president's favorite shows, Phantom of the Opera.











			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump appeared at the Kennedy Center today for a ceremony in which he unveiled each honoree, with their photos unveiled from beneath red sheets.


	By making the announcement of honorees himself, Trump is taking on the role of producer/showman, elevating the attention to the show, which has aired on CBS since its origin yet is hardly a ratings blockbuster. His announcement drew coverage across major cable news channels. In the past, the Kennedy Center and CBS have announced the honorees via press release, embargoed to some outlets.


	Trump has previously bashed the selections as including “radical left lunatics,” but the center has honored country music performers, like Amy Grant and Garth Brooks, and others who have kept their political opinions to themselves. Last year's honorees included Francis Ford Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Bonnie Raitt, Arturo Sandoval and the Apollo Theater. Queen Latifah hosted.


	Trump told reporters, “I've been asked to host. I said, ‘I'm the president of the United States. Are you folls asking me to do that.' ‘Sire, you'll get much higher ratings.' I said, ‘I don't care. I'm the president of the United States. I won't do it.' They said, ‘Please.' And then [chief of staff] Susie Wiles said, ‘Sir. I would like you to host.' I said, ‘OK, I'll do it.'”

	











	Trump floated the idea of himself hosting on a visit to the Kennedy Center in March, shortly after he took control of the institution, according to an audio of a board meeting obtained by the New York Times.


	“It's been a long time,” Trump said. “I used to host The Apprentice finales, and we did rather well with that.”


	But in taking on the role of host, Trump likely will be injecting politics into a ceremony that has tried to remain nonpartisan.


	As he spoke on Wednesday, Trump veered into criticism of the Democrats, then said, “I shouldn't make this political, because they made the Academy Awards political and they went down the tubes. So they'll say ‘Trump made it political,' but I think if we make it our kind of political, we'll go up. Okay, let's see if I'm right about that.”


	The ceremony drew a solid-enough 4.1 million viewers in December, down from 4.5 million a year earlier. CBS' rights expire at the end of this year, and no new deal has been announced. The Oscars, aired on ABC in March, drew 19.7 million viewers, steady from the previous year.


	Unlike his first term, when Trump avoided the ceremony, he has taken a special interest this time around, as he has seized control of an institution he has called “woke.”


	He ousted Joe Biden's nominees to the Kennedy Center board, ensuring that he would be appointed as the chairman of the institution, a first for a president. He's also taken a special interest in renovating the center, with the GOP-controlled Congress including $257 million in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to do so. Democrats have pointed out that Trump has sought to zero out funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, which spreads its grants out to arts organizations around the country, yet boosted the Kennedy Center, which has a core audience concentrated around the Beltway.

Release the Epstein Files!

“Sire?” – wtf is this? Game of Thrones? Madness of King George?

🤮

I love it!!

Sad. I do not need a president playing awards show host. This grandstanding is just dumb. He and his wife did not care for the Kennedy Center during the first term in office. As for the choices, I question some. My view is the honor is for a lifetime of sustained achievement and innovation in arts and culture. Many in the field of performing arts are a momentary white star burning quickly or for only one effort. I am happy to see George Strait's name on the list. And can someone tell me, was the Kennedy Center so much in trouble it needed all this… to be diplomatic… ‘improvement?'

					By Lynette Rice 

Senior TV Writer


Derek Hough just added another big partner to his dance card: the Dancing with the Stars judge and six-time Mirror Ball trophy winner is taking over as host of Extra in the fall. 


	“The ballroom has been my stage, my home, and my launchpad,” Hough said in a statement. “Now, I'm stepping into an exciting new spotlight as the host of Extra. I'm truly looking forward to collaborating with this incredible team, diving into this next creative chapter, and connecting with fans and audiences in a whole new way. It's an honor to join a show that's been a cornerstone of entertainment news for over 30 years — and I'm ready to help lead it into a bold, fresh new era for Season 32 and beyond.”

	











	Hough replaces Billy Bush, who revealed in May that he's leaving the syndicated entertainment news series after five seasons. The addition of Hough, a four-time Emmy Award winner, will mark a new chapter for the magazine show as it kicks off its 32nd season on Sept. 8. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Under EP Jeremy Spiegel, Extra will feature a new set and graphics while special segments will be built around Hough. The dance man will also conduct interviews with celebrities and go behind the scenes of many projects, including DWTS. Besides Hough, senior correspondent and weekend host Mona Kosar Abdi and correspondent Terri Seymour will continue to cover the industry.


	And don't worry, ballroom fans; Hough will continue to serve as a judge and occasional performer on DWTS. 


	“Derek has not only dominated the world of dance — he's become a beloved household name who has won America's hearts with his talent, charisma and boundless creativity,” said Spiegel. “I am excited to work closely with Derek as he brings his electrifying energy and fresh perspective to Extra.” 


	“We are thrilled to welcome the incredibly talented Derek Hough as the new host of Extra,” added Lauren Blincoe, Senior Vice President, Current Programming at Telepictures. “Derek brings a rare mix of energy, creativity, and a dynamic presence that perfectly captures the spirit of this exciting next era for our iconic show. We're energized by the future of Extra with Derek front and center and can't wait to see him turn the entertainment news genre on its head.”

	











Extra, the second longest–running entertainment news magazine in syndication, has been cleared for season 32 in over 95% of the country. It offers a half-hour edition every weekday and an original hour-long weekend installment for 52 weeks a year. The series is produced by Telepictures, a Warner Bros. Television Group company, and distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery Content Sales.  Hough is represented by UTA, Strand Entertainment, Reed Smith and Guttman Associates.

What?!?  Derek does not need to stoop to this. He's too talented for any of this. This guy should be on Broadway. This guys should find a way to be the next Astaire or Kelly. Not taking over Billy Bush's job.

Happy for Derek and as long as he stays on DWTS I'm happy

Me too. He and Mark Ballas are the most innovative choreographers and dancers to come from dwts!  ⭐️

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


A24 on Wednesday debuted the first trailer for Marty Supreme, one of the year's great cinematic curiosities, teaming Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) with filmmaker Josh Safdie (Uncut Gems).


	An original work set in the world of 1950s ping pong culture, the film tells the story of Marty Mauser (Chalamet), a young man with a dream no one respects, who goes to hell and back in pursuit of greatness.


	While never confirmed, sources have long indicated that the project draws loose inspiration from the story of pro ping pong player Marty Reisman.

	The trailer opens on Chalamet standing on the bed in his royal hotel suite, phoning a movie star played by Gwyneth Paltrow to let him know that he's “something of a performer,” as well.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In a later scene, Marty tells his love interest, played by Odessa A'zion, “I have a purpose, and if you think that's some sort of blessing, it's not. It means I have an obligation to see a very specific thing through, and with that obligation comes sacrifice.”


	Later still, in a scene with Kevin O'Leary (of Shark Tank fame), Mauser says, “I know it's hard to believe, but I'm telling you, this game, it fills stadiums overseas. And it's only a matter of time before I'm staring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box.”


	Slated for release in theaters on Christmas Day, Marty Supreme has quite the eclectic ensemble. Others appearing include musician Tyler, The Creator, magician Penn Jillette, Fran Drescher, Sandra Bernhard, and filmmaker Abel Ferrara, to name just a few. Safdie directed from a script written with Ronald Bronstein, with the pair producing alongside Eli Bush, Anthony Katagas, Chalamet and A24.

	











	A24 is next set to debut Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest, a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's High and Low starring Denzel Washington, which is slated to hit theaters on August 15 and be made available on Apple TV+ on September 5 after premiering at the Cannes Film Festival. The studio's slate for the remainder of the year also includes an English-language dub of Chinese box office smash Ne Zha 2 (August 22), Dwayne Johnson starrer The Smashing Machine (October 3) from Marty helmer Josh's brother Benny Safdie, and the Rose Byrne-led festival darling If I Had Legs I'd Kick You (October 10).

This is what you get when you have a filmmaker and a movie star who think they are funnier than they are and don't really understand the concept of irony. This looks ter-ri-ble. What the world absolutely does not need at the moment is false sincerity.

The conversation between Timothee Chalamet and Odessa Young is giving too much “whiplash”

Looks boring to be completely honest. Unpopular opinion, but I do not get the hype of Timothee Chalamet.

					By Matthew Carey 

Documentary Editor, Awards


EXCLUSIVE: When 18-year-old filmmaker Nico Ballesteros began capturing private moments of Kanye West – now known as Ye – he probably had no idea what he was in for. Over the ensuing six years he would shoot thousands of hours of material showing West's apparent worsening mental health struggles, collapsing marriage to Kim Kardashian, loss of lucrative sponsorships, and disturbing declarations.


	Ballesteros's documentary In Whose Name? chronicling Ye's inner world will be released by AMSI Entertainment on approximately 1,000 screens on September 19 in partnership with AMC, Regal, and Cinemark theater chains. We have your first look at the film in the teaser above.

	“I'm off my meds for five months now,” West declares at the beginning of the teaser. An anguished Kardashian says in a breaking voice, “Your personality was not like this a few years ago!”




			Watch on Deadline		







	It only gets more dramatic and worrisome from there. Ye vows, “I would rather be dead than be on medication… Either they destroy me or I destroy it.. I'm almost like a masochist… I write whatever I want when I want! It's words!”


	“What began as silent observation evolved into a profound journey of artistic and personal growth,” notes a synopsis of the documentary. “Immersed in Ye's world of extremes, [Ballesteros] bore witness to brilliance and breakdowns, triumphs and turmoil; but also observed the paranoia and intensity that increasingly shaped Ye's world. 

	











	“In the end, Ballesteros captured not just a portrait of Ye, but a reflection of the human condition in all its contradictions. The camera never blinks as Ye speaks candidly about living with bipolar disorder, offering rare insight into the realities of mental illness and its impact on identity, perception, and power. Through a personal lens, the film considers how mental health is handled – or left unspoken – among the weight of visibility and vulnerability.”


	Ballesteros grew up in Orange County, CA, and began shooting videos at the age of 8. “For a shy kid, the camera became both a shield and a window, a way to channel my introspection while still engaging with the world,” he said in a statement. “Ye has always had someone filming him too, a lens between him and the noise. Maybe that's why we understood each other without saying much. I was able to fade into the background, stay present, the camera always rolling, catching moments outside the public performance.”


	Producer Simran A. Singh commented, “This film presents a raw and often unsettling portrait, without commentary or conclusion, leaving viewers to interpret the events for themselves. Nico was living alongside Ye, camera in hand, not fully knowing what he was capturing or where it would lead, and that's exactly what makes the footage so powerful.”  


	“There was no agenda, no filter; just real, raw moments,” Singh continued. “Because of that, there's a level of honesty you don't usually get in documentaries. As things started to take shape, it became clear that Nico was the only one who could truly tell this story. He had the access, but more importantly, he had the perspective. He was inside the chaos but somehow still able to step back and find the story to make a movie.”


	A release about the project explains the meaning of the film's title, noting it “examines the evolving nature of idolatry, both in Ye's cultivation of public idolatry and in his pursuit of various idols, from luxury brands and celebrity to faith and family. It also speaks to the director's deeper creative and spiritual reckoning: Was this film made in Ye's name, his own, or something greater?”


In Whose Name? marks the directorial debut of Ballesteros, who also produced, shot and edited the film. Jack M. Russell and Justin Staple also serve as editors, Nick Jarjour as executive producer, Shy Ranje and Jack M. Russell as co-producers, and Justin Staple as co-executive producer.


	AMSI Entertainment, the film and television production company led by Simran A. Singh, specializes “in culturally resonant stories with global appeal.” Singh's producing credits include Selena y Los Dinos (acquired by Netflix following this year's Sundance Film Festival), Reggaeton: The Sound that Conquered the World (Peacock), Mon Laferte, te amo (Netflix), and Selena: The Series (Netflix), among others.

The Floor is heading to ITV.


	The popular Dutch gameshow, which is hosted by Rob Lowe in the U.S., has landed its 25th edition in the UK. 


	In The Floor, 81 quiz fanatics face off in quiz duels on a giant LED floor divided into 81 equal squares, each representing its own field of knowledge. The goal is to conquer the entire floor and take home a huge cash prize. The rules are simple – a random contestant challenges an adjoining opponent in a quiz duel. They play against each other in the category of the opponent's square. After 10 episodes, one person is left standing to take home a cash prize.

	











	The show was created by formats guru John de Mol and his Talpa Studios and will be produced in the UK by ITV Studios-backed South Shore. Airing next year, it will be produced from The Floor's hub in the Netherlands.

	Katie Rawcliffe, Director of Entertainment, Reality & Daytime Commissioning ITV, said: “The Floor, with its compelling game play, is an excellent addition to our roster of existing popular quiz shows across ITV and ITVX.” 


	The show is now in 25 territories. In the U.S., it has aired on Fox since last year and was recently renewed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Alien: Earth bursts onto TV with loving homages, lofty ideas, and not enough frights","https://www.avclub.com/alien-earth-premiere-recap-season-1-episodes-1-and-2","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 03:50:00 GMT","

The Alien series is a game of exquisite corpse. Even before James Cameron assumed the reins from Ridley Scott, director John Carpenter mined Dan O'Bannon's early ideas of an extraterrestrial slasher movie for his sci-fi comedy student film, Dark Star. But it wasn't until Ridley Scott married O'Bannon's script to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley and H.R. Giger's BDSM-inspired design language that the series took shape. Since 1979, there has been an Alien war film, an Alien prison film, an aggressively French interpretation, and a couple of Vs. Predator movies that aim for and occasionally hit the dumb-fun bullseye. When Scott returned for Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, he expanded his ideas from 1979 with metatextual musings prequels in the macro for philosophical splatter fests about humanity's relationship to intelligent design and designed intelligence. Through Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David, Scott theorized that, after 33 years away, the most alien aspect of these movies might be the synthetic robots.

FX's Alien: Earth, the franchise's first TV series, picks up where Scott left off. Set in 2120, roughly 15 years after Covenant and two years before 1979's Alien, the first episode of Earth appears as interested in synthetics as Xenomorphs. “If we're making Blade Runner,” creator Noah Hawley said before the premiere, “we're making the wrong Ridley Scott movie.” At least with the first episode, “Neverland,” you can see why he was concerned. 

Hawley is a remix artist best known for FX's Legion, a trippy, almost forgotten X-Men spin-off that remains one of Marvel's better television experiments, and Fargo. On the latter, he used the Coen brothers' 1996 Oscar winner as a jumping-off point to explore the directors' career-long interests, mashing together all their works so that Miller's Crossing‘s gang wars can interact with The Man Who Wasn't There‘s UFO encounters in a unified thesis statement on filmmakers Hawley reveres. With “Neverland,” Hawley, again, looks beyond the title and splits the difference between Scott's beloved sci-fi masterpieces, Alien and Blade Runner, offering a ruthlessly efficient remake of the former and the childlike, electric dreams of the latter. 

Written and directed by Hawley, who wrote all eight episodes of the series and directed the first half of tonight's two-part premiere, the show resets and expands the Alien mythos. He builds out the corporate hellscape of Earth 95 years from now, showing us, for the first time, the companies that sent the Nostromo to collect the facehugger. But instead of the Nostromo, we meet what could be its sibling ship, the Maginot. Our time with the Maginot is for exposition, primarily. After awakening from a dreamy, cross-fade heavy hypersleep, we meet an assortment of Alien archetypes sitting around the breakfast table, reciting conversations we've heard before. Complaints about the food and questions about the mission are mixed in with helpful exposition about which corporation owns which continents and planets and the differences between synthetics and cyborgs. 

Hawley takes great pains in re-establishing that sterile Nostromo atmosphere. Composer Jeff Ruso hits Jerry Goldsmith's familiar soundtrack. Production designer Andy Nicholson lovingly recreates the spacecraft with practical sets that look direct from 1979 and, similar to Andor, meld into the background and don't call attention to themselves. As they did in 1979, the slow cross-fades between moments elicit the feeling of waking up from a heavy sleep, recentering us in the world and settling the audience back into Scott's atmosphere. Yet the smartest thing about it is that we don't spend time here. Hawley does an Alien remake in the edit, showing us flashes of the inevitable containment breach of the mission's precious cargo and subsequent bloodbath. 

There's only one character on the Maginot worth meeting, and it's Morrow, the ship's cyborg security officer. Hiding in the MU/TH/UR room and setting a collision course for Earth, Morrow leaves his would-be Ripley to die by the Xenomorph's little mouth. (To the episode's credit, it doesn't delay an appearance from the big kitty.) But while the rest makes sense to seasoned Alien watchers, why is Morrow so intent on crashing the ship in Prodigy City? The question hangs over the episode. 

The other half of the episode lets us know what's happening on Prodigy through the eyes of a “hybrid” named Wendy (Sydney Chandler). Here's why Hawley worried about making the wrong Ridley Scott movie. Led by a young tech virtuoso named—I shit you not—Boy Kavalier (Samuel Belkin), Prodigy runs the southern half of Africa, Australia, and South East Asia. Prodigy City, or New Siam, is where Boy does his work, which concerns taking sick children, like Wendy, and transferring their consciousness into synthetic adult bodies. The episode's opening text tells us that whoever cracks how hybrid humans will win the robotic arm race. Boy has finally done that by dumping the contents of a sick child's brain into the body of a 30-year-old woman. But transferring consciousness leaves the hybrids feeling empty because Wendy doesn't understand her adult body. Wendy can leap from great heights and attach a paper cutter to her magnetic spine, but she misses eating and watching Ice Age with her brother, Hermit (Alex Lawther). Her hybrid body doesn't come with an owner's manual, so she's guided by the cold synthetic Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant, who relishes playing a robot) and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis), who's presumably a human or, at least, a synthetic with more advanced bedside-manner programming. 

Wendy is the first of many sick kids turned hybrid humans that Kirsh and Dame will be assisting. Appropriately (or annoyingly, if you're allergic to J.M. Barrie), Wendy (goddamn it) calls her “Lost Boys.” Just in case we didn't get it from Boy Kavalier playing Disney's Peter Pan (now that's what I call corporate synergy) during the consciousness transfer, all the Lost Boys are named after characters from the film (Tootles, Slightly, Nibs). The allusion hammers home the theme of the episode about staying forever young like Peter Pan. But once the Maginot crashes into Prodigy City, the two plots converge, as Wendy and her Lost Boys spring into action, leaving Neverland for the exact opposite: an Alien movie. 

Picking up immediately after Black Sabbath's “The Mob Rules” ends, the second episode, “Mr. October,” gives viewers what they expected from a show called Alien: Earth. Set in the building that is now the Maginot‘s crash site, Hermit and a pair of marines conduct a search and rescue mission as Wendy and her Lost Boys do the same for Hermit. These scenes with the Lost Boys can be pretty trying, given that these bots have the consciousness of children. Many of the performances rely on playacting as kids, which can get tiresome (especially when they aren't that funny). However, it gives Slightly (Adarsh Gouav) reason to immediately blurt out Wendy's plan to find her brother in front of Kirsh. Thankfully, being a thoroughbred Prodigy synthetic, Kirsh is more interested in the flora (or is fauna?) attached to the ceiling. 

Most importantly, the apartment building gives the Xenomorph room to play. As is the case in reality, whether it be a global pandemic or a spaceship containing numerous alien lifeforms crashing into their condo, rich people are immune to external tragedy. That's true regardless of the circumstances but especially when they're dressed as extras from Amadeus. The 18th-century costume party is as good a buffet that's ever existed for the alien hunter. That Hermit tries to get the idiot to evacuate makes his death even more delicious. You want there to be some chum in the waters for the monster to chew on, and it's a credit to the leniency FX gives toward violence because the show goes hard on the brutality in these scenes, with the Xenomorph cutting through the members of Prodigy City's one percent like paper and leaving nothing but entrails behind. Once inside, Hermit comes face-to-little-face with the monster in a slow-motion sequence recalling the alien's Vs. Predator days, which arrives in time for Morrow to bag and tag the beast in a futuristic and seemingly biological net. 

What's missing in all this action is scares. The first time we meet the Xenomorph, it's for the audience's edification, popping out from behind a collapsed wall as if to say, “Don't forget about me!” This happens throughout, with the conspicuous Xenomorph appearing in the frame and announcing its presence. “Mr. October” director Dana Gonzales isn't the first person to struggle to make the monster scary after 1979. Still, it is a persistent issue within the episode, which lacks tension despite the preponderance of monsters stalking the building.

Another issue is Boy Kavalier, who is perhaps the most purposefully annoying character in the series since Paul Resier's Burke, the company stooge that leads Ripley's doomed team in James Cameron's sequel. There needs to be someone in these movies that the audience can't wait to see maimed, and few fit the bill better than young Mr. Kavalier. Take his talk with Dame Sylvia, in which he pines for a person or a synthetic who challenges him. Hawley has more hope in today's tech wizards than I do because at least Kavalier is trying to make a product that fulfills his function. His modern-day equivalents are more interested in revolutionizing SPAM, deepfake revenge porn, and metaverses for their various Nazi and bot-plagued social networks. But still, it's not lost on Dame Sylvia how fucking rude it is for Kavalier to tell her to her face that she's not on his level and that maybe, with the proper training, a synthetic with the consciousness of a child can do it. This dude is in Neverland. 

The first two episodes of Alien: Earth throw a lot at the viewer. Some of it is even pretty interesting. It's striving for a unique tone, but in this premiere outing, it hews too close to the magical orphans of Alien Romulus. This whole thing could use a touch more Harry Dean Stanton energy. However, it's also trying to be the Andor of the Alien world, recreating the design language of the original while elevating the political and social framework that's always been present. There's a lot to dig into between Prodigy and Weyland-Yutani—to say nothing of the three other corporations we have yet to meet—and the ship crash gives Hawley good reason to explore the relationships of our current overlords. These companies have everything, and one of the things founders like Kavalier want is whatever they don't have, primarily the eyeball squid monsters Yutani is desperate to copyright. One might assume that he's going to regret that, but if Weyland-Yutani's centuries-long search for the Xenomorph teaches us anything, he won't.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The action world's dad joke goes nowhere when Nobody 2 pursues its own John Wick sequel","https://www.avclub.com/nobody-2-review","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:01:58 GMT","

There's a single joke in the Nobody films, one that the original film played earnestly enough for its middling action fare to pass muster: What if John Wick was played by Bob Odenkirk? It's not that Keanu Reeves was ever a young, spry killer in those movies—the point is that he's been dragged back into a life he left behind—but that Odenkirk, even in his most serious roles, has always seemed like a smarmy Midwestern pencil-pusher. So when he's dragged back into a life he left behind, there's an additional layer of levity in watching a dweeb who should be mowing the lawn in Crocs beat the asses of endless henchmen. But though the punches maintain their force in Nobody 2, the sole punchline they support has become a grating dad joke, one that you've heard so many times that it's lost all meaning.

Odenkirk's Hutch is no longer resisting the pull of his primal nature, now fully embracing the easy dopamine hits of hitting people very hard. The conflict between his feeble family-man exterior and murderous maniac interior has disappeared. The ground beneath the power trip fantasy has fallen away, leaving behind little but wrung-dry id. In fact, Hutch has so fully reverted to his former line of work—paying off some debt to a figure named The Barber; this was written by the John Wick guy, after all—that he's now disappointing his family through his absence rather than his temperance. That means it's time for reconnection, which means time for a family vacation to the only place Hutch ever got to go as a kid, hoping to make up for his fatherly failings with numbing nostalgia.

So Hutch, his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen), their kids (Gage Munroe, Paisley Cadorath), and his once-killer father (played unintelligibly by Christopher Lloyd) head to the low-rent Midwest amusement park town Plummerville. Family trips, especially ones based in tradition, often take bittersweet pit stops. Grasping at the past, trying to experience the same magic that made them memorable in the first place—or to pass on that magic to the next generation—is an exercise in futility. But don't ask Indonesian action/horror staple Timo Tjahjanto (The Shadow Strays, The Night Comes For Us) to find any of that depth in his English-language debut. 

The director and his screenwriters (Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin) choose lizard-brained stupidity throughout—from the story to the needledrops—and the cursory gestures they make towards the bonds between family members or the introspections of its killers are worse than if they hadn't tried at all. Even the idea Hutch must hope that his children will be better than him amounts to less than nothing; as soon as Hutch's son starts joining in the fights, everyone is thrilled. And there's no reluctance to engage in the film's initial encounter, between the family and a group of town big-shots including the park owner (John Ortiz) and his corrupt sheriff (Colin Hanks). The central, and only, conflict between keeping up appearances and giving in to the raging beast is gone; Nobody 2 is merely a change of setting, an excuse for Odenkirk to wreak havoc in Hawaiian shirts and socks with sandals.

This makes the shallow yet over-plotted rampage read like a 90-minute excuse, reverse-engineered to lead to an R-rated Home Alone battle of booby traps and bullets at a carnival. This setpiece, filled with brutality if not imagination (most of the attraction-specific ideas can be summed as “what if it exploded?”), will be enough to satisfy action junkies attracted by Tjahjanto's name. Chunks of gore spatter the screen, fingers and legs separate from their bodies, teeth scatter like rice at a wedding. But without the gags or personality of its predecessor (or even its veneer of emotional conflict), the silly, nasty fights of Nobody 2 more blatantly become Wick Lite.

And since Nobody has always been a half-hearted “Wick with a day job” idea from franchise writer Kolstad, Hutch again runs into a shadowy syndicate, led by another over-the-top star (Sharon Stone) slumming it as a screwy crime lord. She's got her own lore, her own definitive henchmen, and her own Joker-like performance—if she'd played the role a decade ago, there might've been some scenery left for her to chew. Her sweaty camp is at least preferable to the stiffness of Odenkirk and Nielsen, whose dynamic becomes so muddied that each actor simply grits their teeth through their scenes.

There's a pathetic irony to Nobody 2 having a midlife crisis. Abandoning what little individuality its milquetoast once had to chase the formula of its more successful acquaintance only undermines the still-serviceable violence and unchallenged stars. It's like a franchise-scale version of the phenomenon where a comic actor gets so committed to training for their superhero or action role that they forget why they were cast in the first place. This slapdash sequel doesn't so much go on vacation, knowing that it will soon return to its routine, as it goes on a bender. It can make those synapses fire in the moment, but even that buzz is nagged by the notion that there won't be much left in the aftermath.

Danielle Spencer has died. The former child actor who starred on the groundbreaking sitcom What's Happening!! before becoming a veterinarian later in life, died of stomach cancer on Monday, her brother confirmed on Instagram. She was 60.

“Many of you knew her as ‘Dee', but she was more than a child actress,” her brother, jazz trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, wrote. “She was a friend, an auntie to my three children who adored her, she was a daughter- and in many ways, my mother's best friend, she was a veterinarian, she was someone who always remained positive even during her darkest days fighting this disease. And she was MY sister and protector.”

Born in Trenton, N.J., in 1965 and raised in the Bronx by her mother, Cheryl, and stepfather, actor Tim Pelt, Spencer began acting at age 7 when she joined Pelt's repertory company. She found quick success, landing an uncredited part in Serpico before scoring her defining role as Dee Thomas on What's Happening!! Produced by Bud Yorkin, created by Good Times creator Eric Monte, and loosely based on the film Cooley High, the show was among the first sitcoms focused on Black teenagers. As the sarcastic, tattle-tale little sister Dee, Spencer showed off a hilarious deadpan that often got the better of her elders. With her catchphrase, “Oh, I'm tellin' Mama,” Dee became one of the “brattiest children on television,” and would later be awarded TV Land's “Character Most Desperately in Need of a Timeout” in 2006. In 2016, Spencer was inducted into the Smithsonian Institution as the youngest African American female child star on a TV sitcom.

﻿

What's Happening debuted as a summer fill-in but became a quick hit. It was canceled three seasons into its run as a result of a contract dispute between the network and Fred Berry, who played the show's breakout character, Rerun. What's Happening!! When the show returned for the sequel series, What's Happening Now!!, in 1985, Spencer reprised the role of Dee for 16 episodes.

Spencer didn't act much after the '80s. She became a veterinarian in 1993, earning her doctorate from Tuskegee University Veterinary School. She appeared on screen a few more times, playing a vet in James L. Brooks' 1997 Oscar-winning film, As Good As It Gets, and guesting on a 2001 episode of Days Of Our Lives. In 2011, she released a memoir, Through The Fire… Journal Of A Child Star.

Medical issues would continue throughout her life. Spencer's time on What's Happening was interrupted by a 1977 car crash that killed her stepfather and left Spencer in a coma for three weeks. She underwent extensive physical therapy as a result of broken bones in her leg, arm, and pelvis, but learned to walk again. In 2004, she underwent surgery for spinal stenosis. The procedure left her paralyzed from the waist down for nearly a year. A decade later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which went into remission after chemotherapy.

Dr. Spencer is survived by her brother and mother.

Reba McEntire is honoring the memory of her former stepson, Brandon Blackstock, after his passing at age 48 following a three-year battle with melanoma.

McEntire became Blackstock's stepmother when she married his father, Narvel Blackstock, in 1989. The couple were married until 2015. 

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

The country music legend shared her thoughts on her son Shelby Blackstock's Instagram tribute on Monday, writing, “Very well said Shelby. Yes we will miss him so much 💔💔🙏💔❤️❤️❤️🙏💔.”

Shelby, 34, remembered his half-brother as “an irreplaceable part of our family” and posted a series of personal photos.

“He taught me so much, leaving behind countless cherished memories that I will hold onto forever,” Shelby wrote. “For every treasured moment we shared, there are so many more we'll never get to make together, but I know you'll still be there. Every hunt, every flight, and in the everyday moments of life, I'll feel your presence.”

He concluded his tribute by promising the family would “never stop loving, remembering and celebrating you.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

McEntire was married to Brandon's father, television producer Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015. Despite the divorce, she remained close to Brandon, often referring to him as her stepson.

A family representative confirmed to People on Aug. 7 that Brandon died following a private fight with cancer.

The 70-year-old singer had previously addressed her affection for both Brandon and his ex-wife, Kelly Clarkson, during their contentious divorce. Both women have served as coaches on “The Voice,” though during different seasons.

“You know, I love them both. Brandon's my stepson, Kelly's my good friend… I am pulling for both of them,” McEntire told Extra in 2021. “I hope they're happy and healthy and pull through this. I pray everyone gives them the encouragement they can because they need it right now, both of them do.”

In a separate interview with Entertainment Tonight that same year, McEntire added, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. Although he's my stepson, I still love him like he's my total — my blood, so I'm praying for 'em both 'cause I love 'em both.”

A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)

Brandon and Clarkson were married from 2013 to 2022 and shared two children: River, 10, and Remington, 8. He also had daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth.

Less than 24 hours before news of Brandon's passing became public, Clarkson, 43, announced she was abruptly canceling her Las Vegas residency to focus on her family.

“While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” Clarkson wrote on Instagram on Aug. 6.

The American Idol winner did not elaborate further but has maintained a respectful silence since the announcement of Brandon's passing.

Leonardo DiCaprio stepped out for a night in Ibiza, but even without his regular face mask, he went completely unnoticed. The 50-year-old Oscar winner mixed up so well with the party crowd that police didn't seem to realize one of Hollywood's biggest stars was right in front of them.

The actor was caught on video obtained by the Daily Mail waiting outside a tequila party as officers carried out security checks. Dressed casually in all black with a baseball cap and chain, DiCaprio kept his head down and scrolled through his phone as he waited for his turn.

A woman nearby could be heard saying, “They are searching me full-on right now.” It's unclear if she was model Vittoria Ceretti, DiCaprio's 27-year-old girlfriend who accompanied him on the trip.

A source told Page Six that DiCaprio wasn't singled out for special treatment. “Every single person was patted down and ID'd,” they said, adding that the Spanish police didn't initially recognize him. “It's funny, they did a double-take and then he went in!”

While DiCaprio got through security, Travis Scott was reportedly denied entry to the private villa party hosted by Patron and Spanish actor-singer Aron Piper. Guests inside included Kendall Jenner and DiCaprio's longtime friend Tobey Maguire.

DiCaprio is no stranger to Ibiza, having vacationed there many times over the years. Earlier this month, he and Ceretti were photographed boarding Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's mega-yacht while in the area. 

The couple also attended Bezos and Sánchez's lavish June wedding in Venice, where Ceretti royally handled a wardrobe mishap, after her vintage Dolce & Gabbana dress was visibly torn off. 

Linked since summer 2023, Ceretti has said she doesn't like being known solely as “Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend,” telling Vogue France in March that labels can be “extremely annoying.”

A few days ago, DiCaprio and Ceretti joined Bezos and Sánchez for another luxury day at sea aboard the $485 million, three-deck superyacht Koru. 

DiCaprio kept his look casual in a white T-shirt, baseball cap, and shorts, while Ceretti wore a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos sported tropical swim trunks with a navy tee, and Sánchez turned heads in a printed kimono over her swimsuit.

The group's double date came just weeks after Bezos and Sánchez's $40 million wedding in Venice, which was attended by A-list names like Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'What's Happening!!' Star Danielle Spencer Fondly Remembered After BRAVE Breast Cancer Fight","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/danielle-spencer-fondly-remembered-after-passing/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 01:43:05 GMT","

Fans are fondly looking back on the comedy career of Danielle Spencer, who played Dee Thomas on '70s sitcom “What's Happening!” after her death was announced by several news outlets on Tuesday, August 12, 2025. She was 60 years old.

The Hollywood Reporter says they learned from Spencer's costar, Haywood Nelson, that the actress died the morning of Monday, August 11 in a Richmond, Virginia hospital. They say Nelson told them, “She suffered for a very long time but did it with a great deal of courage.”

The outlet says Spencer fought a years-long health battle, undergoing a double mastectomy after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2014, and emergency surgery for a brain bleed four years later.

Nelson, who played Dwayne on the show, took to his Instagram to remember the child star. He began his tribute by writing, “Brilliance! It comes in a great many forms. We all have them and we all have this family's – Danielle Spencer.'

He also called his friend loving, positive, and a “pragmatic warrior.”

Nelson also praised the actress for being an animal rights proponent. The New York Amsterdam News says she built a career as a veterinarian and “dedicated her life to caring for animals” after retiring from Hollywood.

A post shared by Haywood Nelson (@haywoodnelsonofficial)

Spencer previously battled back from the brink of death at the age of 12 while starring on TV. The New York Post says Spencer famously survived a serious car crash during production of “What's Happening!!” in 1977. The accident left Spencer in a three-week coma and killed her stepfather, Tim Pelt.

Although Spencer's precise cause of death has not yet been announced, a GoFundMe campaign to help with her medical bills which was started in 2019 left some clues. 

The page declared, “Losing is not an option” and called Spencer “an entertainer who kept many of us with smiles on our faces.”

The page went on to reveal that Spencer's childhood car crash left her with a broken leg arm and pelvis, and caused a bleeding hematoma to form that caused Spencer to start suffering debilitating headaches 42 years later. “These headaches left her unresponsive and caused her to almost succumb to her illness,” the statement said. Spencer required surgery for the hematoma.

The page went on to explain, “The surgery was a success and she must now heal and recover. As of today it is not known how long she will be in recovery because of her recent bout with cancer and spinal cord injury.”

Fans commemorated the UC Davis grad in the comments of an Action 5 News Facebook post about her death. 

“Dr. Spencer is a heroine in her own right. She is a very decent person. She made a great life of her own after acting. She was an outstanding veterinarian and advocate much to animal welfare. She will be missed,” wrote one fan, after declaring the news “heartbreaking.”

Another person said, “Very funny actress and had successful post-acting career as a veterinarian. Prayers for her family and friends.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","GH's Eden McCoy Dishes on Her WSB Storyline","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/general-hospital-eden-mccoy-kelly-thiebaud/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:56:03 GMT","

Kelly Thiebaud's return to “General Hospital” has been nothing short of celebratory. The actress is thrilled to come home again. Fans may not understand how Britt Westbourne is still alive, but they are here for it. 

The last time that we saw Britt, before her miraculous return, she was dying in her mother, Liesl Obrecht's, arms. She had gotten in between Heather Webber and Josslyn Jacks and was sliced by a poisonous hook. Joss watched Britt die while saving her life, or so she thought. 

This week, Joss caught her first glimpse of the very much alive Britt. Her portrayer, Eden McCoy, couldn't be happier about the plot twist. She recently shared her thoughts on Britt's return with Soap Opera Digest.

Eden McCoy's character on GH is currently undercover with Vaughn at The Five Poppies resort in Dalmatia. It is there that she first laid eyes on Britt again, and according to Eden, she couldn't be happier about the storyline twist.

“I absolutely adore Kelly! Kelly is amazing. She's such a badass, she's super-talented, and working with her is really, really fun. We are both jokesters and don't take anything too seriously, so it's challenging because there is always laughter, even when it seems like there shouldn't be laughter,” explains McCoy.

The actress also loves the current storyline that her character is embroiled in, and she is happy to share it with Kelly. “I was so excited when I heard she was coming back. I'm super-stoked to keep working with her, especially because it's been a few years and we are at such a different point in Josslyn's life. It's just so much more interesting because now we're both grown women and we're both in this, like, weird spy world. So, it's nice to have another female [in the storyline] that I'm so comfortable with, and for us to be doing similar things.”

Soap fans understand that no one is really, truly dead in this genre. There is always a chance that an old favorite will be revived, and that is exactly what has happened on GH. Eden explained her character's initial confusion to Soap Opera Digest.

“When Joss first sees Britt, there are so many things running through her brain. I don't know that she can even decipher her thoughts about it other than just pure shock, pure confusion. There's also a weird sense of relief that she's not dead, but then she goes to, ‘What is going on here?!' ”

Joss also realizes that there is a good chance that Britt is also following orders and can help each other.  “Joss has that hope because she's like, ‘Well, now I know somebody who's involved in this who can perhaps tell me some information,' you know? She's thinking, ‘We're friendly, we have a past.' She thinks she can use that moving forward.”

Viewers can expect Joss to run to Vaughn with every detail since he is currently her undercover husband. “He can kind of construct theories pretty immediately as to what she could be doing there — and it only makes sense that she's involved in some way with the project that they're there to look into because why else would someone fake their own death? Why else would she be here? And what are the odds that she's here at the same time they are? We may not have any answers, but that's kind of our answer for the time being.”

What are your thoughts on Joss joining the WSB? Are you intrigued by The Five Poppies storyline, and what is really going on at the resort?

The 2025 fall movie season is shaping up to be an embarrassment of riches for fans of Josh and Benny Safdie. The filmmaking duo went their separate creative ways after “Uncut Gems,” each choosing to embark on their own ambitious project… which just means there are twice as many Safdie movies to enjoy this fall. Benny Safdie's Dwayne Johnson-led MMA drama “The Smashing Machine” is up first, and then cinephiles will receive a holiday gift in the form of Josh Safdie‘s “Marty Supreme,” which hits theaters on Christmas Day and just dropped its first trailer. 

 










The film stars Timothée Chalamet as fictional table tennis star Marty Mauser in what has been characterized as an adventure film in the vein of “Catch Me If You Can.” Safdie and co-writer Ronald Bronstein (who also co-wrote and co-edited “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems”) took inspiration from the life of real ping pong pro Marty Reisman, though “Marty Supreme” is a fictionalized original story. Reisman's life was examined in the 2014 documentary “Fact or Fiction: The Life and Times of a Ping Pong Hustler,” which examined both his 22 table tennis championships and his early years as a New York con artist.

In true Safdie fashion, “Marty Supreme” features an eclectic mix of Hollywood A-listers and non-actors from other lines of work. In addition to Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow (who appears in her first on-screen film role since 2019's “Avengers: Endgame”) the cast includes Fran Drescher, Abel Ferrara (AKA The Weeknd), Tyler, the Creator, “Shark Tank” star and billionaire Kevin O'Leary, magician Pen Jillette, Odessa A'zion, Sandra Bernhard, and French highwire daredevil Philippe Petit.

“Marty Supreme” was shot by “Eddington” and “Uncut Gems” cinematographer Darius Khondji, who recently said that he expects the film to be “box office dynamite” despite the fact that “the shooting was so hard and crazy.” He also praised Chalamet's dedication to training with ping pong champions to prepare for the film's athletic sequences.

“He wanted to be like a real [professional] ping pong player when he started shooting,” Khondji said of Chalamet during an appearance at the Doha Film Institute (via Variety). “Because you can do anything, any camera tricks you want, but you need to have a core.”

An A24 release, “Marty Supreme” opens in theaters on December 25. Watch the trailer below.

Cillian Murphy is back on the big screen for only the second time since his Academy Award-winning turn in “Oppenheimer.” On September 19, Netflix will give a theatrical release to “Steve,” an adaptation of author Max Porter's 2023 novel “Shy,” set in the '90s and about the troubled youths at a British reform school. 

The title “Shy” refers to a troubled youth at a reform school, played by Jay Lycurgo in the film. “You're not alone, Shy,” Murphy's character says. “That's the whole point.” But as the retitling of the film to “Steve” suggests, the focus is very much now on Oscar winner Murphy's headteacher and his ability to manage the many personalities inhabiting his school of last resort. “Steve” also features performances by Tracey Ullmann, Simbi Ajikawo, and Emily Watson and will world premiere at TIFF in September.

Writer Porter's star is on the rise: An adaptation of his debut novel “Grief Is the Thing with Feathers” world premiered at Sundance in January 2025, retitled “The Thing with Feathers” and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a father raising his sons after the sudden death of his wife. Porter's novel “Shy” was a major bestseller in the U.K.

Stateside, in every sense the star draw is Murphy himself. Bearded and stressed, the first thing we hear him say in the trailer is that he's “very, very tired.” This is not the actor's first film since winning the best actor Oscar for “Oppenheimer” in early 2024: That film was actually “Small Things Like These,” like “Steve” a period piece — “Small Things Like These” was set in the '80s — and received a small U.S. release, ultimately making $1.6 million at the U.S. box office.

Next up, Murphy's “28 Days Later” character Jim is expected to appear in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” as well as Tom Harper's “The Immortal Man,” a continuation of the series “Peaky Blinders” written by Steven Knight. And there may be another exciting role ahead as well: In May 2025, IndieWire reported that Murphy was in talks to star opposite Daniel Craig in Damien Chazelle's next film.

Until those, “Steve” looks to be a meaty, satisfying role for Murphy fans to enjoy. 

Netflix will release “Steve” in theaters on Friday, September 19. It will stream on the platform starting on Friday, October 3. Watch the film's first trailer below.

Had “Nobody 2” been released 20 years ago, it probably would have been made for half of its budget, featured exactly one actor from the first film reprising their role, and been pushed directly to DVD. Everything about the half-baked redux spiritually recalls the heyday of shovelware like “Cruel Intentions 2” or “The Little Mermaid 2,” movies that existed not because anyone had exciting ideas for where to take the stories of the OG texts they spawned from, but to crowd the aisles of your local Blockbuster and convince unsuspecting customers who vaguely enjoyed the original to pick it up and waste the rental fee. 

 










This is not to imply “Nobody 2” is desecrating some classic text. The original movie, most notable for being one of the first films to do OK at the box office as cinemas slowly reopened following COVID, was about middle-of-the-road average as an action comedy can get, a warmed-over repeat of various tricks and tropes of the “John Wick” movies, which screenwriter Derek Kolstad created. At the same time, it had some positives worth praising: a charismatic turn from Bob Odenkirk, mainly, but also the general sense that the people making it were enthusiastic enough to put real effort and thought into the finished product. There's really no sense of any particular care or passion in the sequel, which frequently feels like the hurried Wikipedia plot summary of a more fleshed-out film that doesn't actually exist.

At only 89 minutes, “Nobody 2” has a threadbare story (the script is credited to Kolstad and Aaron Rabin), one that lazily rehashes central conflicts from the original without doing much to convincingly flesh out or expand these characters. In the original, Odenkirk's office drone Hutch Mansell was a doting family man who had to get back in touch with his dangerous side from his past as a government assassin in order to save his wife and kids and, more importantly for the narrative, prove his curdled masculinity; a somewhat regressive message, to be sure, but at least moderately satisfying as a power fantasy. “Nobody 2” lazily flips things around: back in the game as a contract assassin to pay off his debts, Hutch is now too distant from his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) and kids Brady (Gage Munroe) and Sammy (Paisley Cadorath), working late hours and missing Brady's basketball games, like a murderous version of Robin Williams in “Hook.”

So, to save his fraying marriage and relationship with his increasingly distant son, Hutch whisks the family to Plummerville, a small tourist trap hosting the water park that serves as the only vacation destination Hutch and his brother Harry (RZA) ever got to experience during their childhood raised by their FBI agent father David (Christopher Lloyd). It's not long after they arrive, with David in tow, that Hutch discovers why his dad made an exception for this specific place — it serves as a hub for illegal trade, with a corrupt police force in the pocket of crime lord and bootlegger Lendina (Sharon Stone, whose slicked-back hair and pantsuit visually recalls her much more enjoyable performance in 2004 camp classic “Catwoman”). 
 










A (contrived, unconvincing) brush-up between Brady and a town bully quickly gets Hutch on the radar of Lendina's sniveling toadie sheriff Abel (Colin Hanks, whose deliciously smug attitude makes for the movie's only memorable performance), forcing him to bare fists and kick ass to save his family.

The central question of the film, ostensibly, is how Hutch can balance being a father and his career as a killer, and whether his violent tendencies belong anywhere near his children (the overall family vacation premise makes the film, despite its swearing and bloodshed, feel oddly aimed for a younger audience than it actually is). “Nobody 2” doesn't actually have much interest in challenging its protagonist, however, and resolves this tension with the easiest, most conflict-free route possible. It's a decision that's well in line with a script that can't be bothered to depict these characters beyond their most basic descriptions (Becca the nagging wife, Brady the scowling teen), or provide anything more than the most barebones justifications for its action.

Not helping matters is a script that's frustratingly caught in between genres and failing to really deliver at any of them. There's plenty of comedy, but the film never actually delivers a joke that's all that funny, while its attempts at sincerity fall flat from such a thinly told story — Lendina, ostensibly the main villain, doesn't show up until 30 minutes before the film ends, giving zero time to give the conflict on screen personal or emotional stakes. The action is at at best competent but uninspired, and at worst (such as a sword fight toward the end) choppy and nauseating. Director Timo Tjahjanto, taking over from the first film's Ilya Naishuller, only rarely adds much verve or personality to the proceedings, and otherwise delivers an overlit, ugly film that doesn't take much advantage of its theme park location, aside from a hall of mirrors scene that pays mediocre homage to the iconic climax of “The Lady from Shanghai.”

 










The main draw of the original “Nobody” was Odenkirk, a beloved character actor who can turn a two-hour late entrance into a prestige literary adaptation into a crowd-pleasing applause moment. There was novelty to seeing Saul Goodman as a grizzled action dad, and he proved deft at merging both sides of the quietly intense Hutch into a coherent whole. In the sequel though, Odenkirk seems decidedly checked out: he, along with almost every other actor in the cast, approaches the material with a complete lack of energy, which can pass for an acting choice to represent Hutch's exhaustion but slowly begins to resemble a boredom with this character. 

“Nobody 2″ isn't the only thriller Odenkirk is starring in this year: At the Toronto International Film Festival, he'll be appearing in the crime film “Normal,” which also features a script from Kolstad. Whether it's good or bad, at least expect it to feel like a real movie, a low bar “Nobody 2” frequently proves incapable of reaching.

Universal Pictures will release “Nobody 2” in theaters on Friday, August 15.

David Mackenzie‘s latest film might be set in contemporary New York City, but “Relay” feels borne from a different (and not necessarily simpler) time: The '70s, when paranoia thrillers ruled at the box office. The set-up of the film, starring Riz Ahmed and Lily James, is wonderfully inventive: James plays a would-be whistleblower hoping to take down her former biotech bosses, and Ahmed is a lone wolf fixer working to broker a deal and keep his new client safe.

The twist? Ahmed's character — who goes by many different names and doesn't even speak until a solid 30 minutes into the film — favors old school technology for most of his communications. They mostly hinge on a relay system, a decidedly lo-fi electronic way of messaging that helps people with a hearing or speech disability make and receive telephone calls via text (with a human relay operator as ironclad intermediary). It's a smart way to avoid detection, and a hell of a way to build tension in the film itself.

As Mackenzie told me last year, he was attracted to the film because of the way it echoed the paranoid thrillers of the ‘60s and ‘70s he loved — stuff like “Three Days of the Condor” and “The Parallax View” and “Point Blank” and even something more recent like “Michael Clayton” — the kind of films where, as he said, “You're sort of feeling like the strange corporate forces are all around you and are kind of at work against you. … The old technology also sort of harks back to those cool '70s thrillers that kind of feel in the DNA of this project and hopefully echoes in it a little bit.”

And James added that she studied up on those same films for her work in “Relay.” 

“David gave me a ton of those classic thrillers watch to get into the right vibe and tone, and it felt really authentic,” James told IndieWire before last year's TIFF. “Just by the nature of the way that they need to communicate, being this old relay system and using the post office, it was such a brilliant throwback. Once you take away a mobile phone, there's automatically this greater need for connection and greater kind of drama.”

With that all in mind, Bleecker Street has now released a brand-new trailer for “Relay” that leans way into those '70s paranoia thrillers, making connections between Mackenzie's new film and the look and feel of the features that helped inspire him. In November of last year, Bleecker Street picked up the film after its well-received world premiere at TIFF, and the indie imprint seems to be going all-in on this very smart buy.

Bleecker Street will premiere “Relay” in theaters on Friday, August 22. Check out the film's new, retro-styled trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

[Editor's note: The following story contains spoilers for “Weapons.”]

With “Weapons” a hit at the box office and Zach Cregger suddenly one of the most in-demand filmmakers around, it makes sense that Warner Bros. and New Line would be thinking a follow-up. And according to THR, the studios have already discussed a potential prequel film with Cregger, but whether such a film actually happens depends a lot on the director's increasingly busy schedule. 

THR reports that Cregger had previously pulled from his script a chapter of backstory about Gladys, the mysterious antagonist played by Amy Madigan in the film. Many have compared Gladys to a classic fairy tale antagonist, a villain whose undefined age and unambiguously evil motivations thrust a town into chaos. The lack of clear backstory is one of the film's strengths, but it also gives Cregger a blank canvas to take the character in any direction he pleases. The studio, according to THR, has discussed with Cregger about expanding that cut segment into a feature, but no deals have been made, and there's no timeline for when any sort of movie could come together.

A source told IndieWire that any plans at the moment are merely speculation. 

 










Cregger is currently in prep on his next feature, a new “Resident Evil” film based on the video game franchise for Sony. Like “Weapons,” Cregger's take on that IP was also the subject of an aggressive bidding war, one that Warner Bros. pursued before it landed at Sony. That film is set to open in theaters September 2026.

Cregger in a separate interview with THR also mentioned he has an original script called “Henchman,” one that he wrote prior to writing his 2022 film “Barbarian” and that is set in the DC Universe but is not a superhero movie. He also discussed having completed a sci-fi script that THR reports is titled “Flood,” and he added that he has yet another original property he's working on in the vein of the film “Nightcrawler.” Any of those could be options for Cregger after “Resident Evil” and before a potential “Weapons” follow-up.

Through Monday, “Weapons” has earned $48.7 million domestic and a global cumulative haul of $81.3 million, all after Warner Bros. and New Line won the bidding war for the project with a $38 million budget. Like Warners' “Sinners,” the film is one of the best-reviewed films of the year.

Benjamin Lasky leapt into fame as the lowest of the low: A YouTube rapper. He built his name, Quadeca, with abrasive diss track hi-jinks and even more clickbaity imitations of famous MCs. But in the last half-decade, the Los Angeles musician has reinvented himself as an art-pop auteur, the kind of guy who travels to a small island in the Philippines to film a movie-length music video for his new and easily most ambitious album yet, Vanisher, Horizon Scraper.

Quadeca is obsessed with the open waters, its unconquerable hugeness. In the narrative of both the album and the movie, Quadeca plays a sailor leaving the comforts of his past life to embark on a quest for freedom and self-discovery—imagine Moby-Dick if Ahab were the last man on Earth and a 24-year-old with a neat puff of chin beard who's beloved by Rate Your Music. Along the way, he finds a bottle, fights a beast, and finally drowns. It's also a journey across the ocean of Quadeca's mind, traversing his anxieties and existential fears: The way that being a perfectionist feels like a solo voyage into the dark, unsure if he's benefiting anyone but himself; worries about AI “threatening the magic of the world” and ushering in the apocalypse. Vanisher bursts at the seams with metaphors, double-entendres, and a mille-feuille pastry's worth of musical layers. It's beautiful and overwrought, a stab at transcendence that works best as pure shivery sound rather than a story to dissect and decipher.

Quadeca departs from South America, looping the first three seconds of Brazilian artist Chico Buarque's 1971 album Construção into the beat for “No Questions Asked.” “Waging War” melds flamenco dance-clops with Lex Luger snares, and “That's Why” flips Alberto Baldan Bemo's sumptuous “Samoa,” originally composed for an erotic film in the '70s, into a canvas for existential wondering. His optimistic feelings collapse into dread as he realizes he's gone too far to turn back. He faces off against the mythological serpent-dragon Bakunawa, played by Danny Brown, who threatens to eat the moon and can only be quelled by music. The ending teeters between terror and relief, as the sailor accepts his imminent death while seemingly grateful for the voyage. And that's the story.

Along the way, Quadeca toys with baroque pop and bossa nova like a tweaked rap producer, finessing every chord loop and textural nano-layer until you can practically smell the salty coastline. His previous music was often experimental yet streamlined, constantly restless and mutating; he let the individual ideas sing without burying them in decorative textures. This album, by contrast, does everything, all the time. It's closer to brakence's neurotic intricacy, where songs contain rich stacks of instruments and verses unfold like a riddle without a solution.

While the results can be precious and overcooked, Vanisher mostly lives up to its titanic premise: an apocalyptic tale about a man chasing the horizon—and himself—channeled through what feels like a million sound-fragments. “Natural Causes” cuts between harrowing and heavenly, as Quadeca sings about trying to escape a psychic torment he can't shake. He's at his happiest on “Dancing Without Moving,” urging everyone to “get low with the setting sun” while the instruments tangle together like a terrarium of brightly colored plants.

Elsewhere, he sings from what seems to be the POV of a dirty bottle and the horizon itself; on the violent “Thundrrr,” he threatens to knock down trees in a delirious, gaspy warble. The serpent-fighting soundtrack for “The Great Bakunawa” is delightfully madcap, with distorted resonances from a healing bowl, bongos, pitched-up piano, arps that squelch like a cartoon TV theme. Vanisher has a detuned quality redolent of Mk.gee and an ear-pleasing evanescence similar to James Blake, where Quad sounds almost phantasmic. His voice shimmers with reverb, trembling and splintering in a way that reflects the fragmented lyrics. He has a knack for expressing the casual agony of depression—“When the walls cave in on you/They become your skin,” goes a line on “At a Time Like This”—and capturing that haunted feeling with vox and instrumental flourishes.

Despite the care put into the narrative, many verses still come out hazy. One section of “Waging War” apparently portrays Quadeca getting high and envisioning the ocean parting until there's a hallway, which he sees himself standing in; then he sobers up and the fantasy disappears, which is supposed to foreshadow the sailor's death later in the album. Later in the song, Quadeca goes, “reverse the loop and I'm swimming forward,” which he explains as: Reverse the word “loop” and you get “pool,” and thus pool equals… swimming? Even with Genius annotations describing his thought process, they feel completely puzzling.

For an album about exploring the world, it's pretty myopic: It centers a man painfully trapped in his own head, reliving his past mistakes, fantasizing about death, and learning to relinquish control. The constant focus on the self also distracts from the apocalyptic narrative, which could have been colored in more. There's a similar sort of sprawling insularity that starts to sound homogenous after a full listen. He incorporates Japanese taiko drums, Chinese cymbals, mandolin, marching band percussion, trombones bludgeoned into 808s, a recording of him smashing a table but filtered so it sounds freaky—but they're all buried and blurred together into this vaguely nautical atmosphere.

The irony of Vanisher is that Quadeca's trying to solve the unsolvable, packaging the complexities of life and adulthood into a pat allegory about a man and an ocean that seems to contain the world. Surrendering to life would really mean something messier, unfinished, genuinely inscrutable, and out-there. Still, there are many moments where the weight of the sound and symbols disappears, and all we're left with is a potent hit of euphoria. Quadeca and Olēka sound like twin angels on “Waging War,” willowy vocals wrapping around each other like cursive scripture. At one perfect point, Quadeca shatters into pixelated pieces, every mutilated word shadowed by cries. “I surrender to my heart,” he finally sings, and the instrumentation falls away. It sounds like giving yourself over to the waves and drifting off into the horizon.

On “the journey to the center of nothing,” the closer of Field Medic's eighth studio album, surrender instead, Kevin Patrick Sullivan starts singing about me. Not literally me—but when he gets to the line about “some journalist in Flatbush/Who'll write the headline that'll give you the push,” my instinct is to respond that the coffee shop where I'm drafting this review is technically in Crown Heights and that this probably isn't the one he's been waiting for.

Sullivan's reflection on his place in the music industry is a running theme on surrender instead. It follows a few years of introspection-prompting career shifts: In 2023, he released a final album on Run for Cover records, then, just a few months later, self-released another record; late last year, he put out a collection of rarities and B-sides spanning over a decade. On surrender instead, Field Medic's signature confessional songwriting takes a more meta-narrative focus. Opener “tricks & illusions” traces his relationship to music from childhood—when he used it as a refuge from his parents' tumultuous relationship—to his adult years, dominated by the touring grind and contract disputes. Bookended by two tracks that see Sullivan wrestling with what it means to “make it” in his industry, surrender instead comes across as an album about making albums. The shape of success shifts throughout these songs; sometimes, it's a glowing review, sometimes it's a moment of mutual recognition with an audience, sometimes it's earning enough from writing “songs for adverts and films” to technically say he's making a living off music.

The quality of Sullivan's stream-of-consciousness songwriting varies, even within a single track. “opposite fantasies” haunts in the chorus (“I've got these opposite fantasies/One where I live a long time, another one where I die soon”) but clumsily packs a few too many syllables into its verses. On “the journey to the center of nothing,” he's slanting his rhymes and emphasizing the last syllable of each line: “Living paycheck to paycheck/You're a postmodern survivalist/Grief or spite lost in the moment/Till you recall the Everest of crippling debt.” The lines are delivered almost like an acoustic Beastie Boys cover, which could be funny; instead, his stressed syllables stress me out.

Over a decade into his prolific run of folk records, Sullivan has proven himself adept at writing warm, pretty folk songs. surrender instead has those in spades, but it's the detours that occasionally elevate the record above coffee shop-friendly, paint-by-numbers singer-songwriter fare. On the bridge of “falling out,” Sullivan imagines what a conversation with an estranged friend might sound like if he were to reach out. It's perhaps the most compelling moment of the record, his speculation offering a reprieve from so much telling rather than showing. The bouncy drum machine on “simply obsessed” is a nice change of pace, though the song's lyrics scan a bit too cute and too middle-of-the-road—it makes me want him to either reign in the sentimentality or commit to I Love You, Honeybear levels of schmaltz. More satisfying is when he embraces goofy melodrama on “MELANCHOLY,” drawling, “My heart will never mend!” over a lonesome cowboy's waltz. Still, the song deserves a big finish, but instead gets a fade-out. As the doo-wop progression slows and the hazy girl group backing vocals dim alongside Sullivan's lead, you can hear the drums stumbling momentarily. The moment is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it vision of the calamity that could have been. It's a reminder that, eight albums in, Sullivan is nothing if not consistent—but once in a while, he could stand to let himself get a little lost on the way to saying exactly what he means.

Taylor Swift knows what she's getting into by joining boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce on their New Heights podcast. “You guys have a lot of male sports fans that listen your podcast,” the musician said in the latest preview for the episode set to premiere at 7 p.m. EST on Aug. 13. “And I think we all know that if there's one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it's more of me.” 


	In order to bridge the gap, Jason gave Swift the podcast introduction of a true champion. He knows how to speak the language of the sports fans who might not be well-versed in her history: league stats, awards, records, leaders, and scores.

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)


	“She is the most awarded artist in the history of the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards. And iHeart Radio Music Awards,” Jason began. He projected his voice loud enough to give any sports announcer a run for their money, earning an “Goddamn!” from Travis and an “Oh?” from Swift. “She has 14 Grammy Awards and is the only artist in history to win Album of the Year four times.”

	











The Eras Tour was the next championship Jason recounted on the podcast intro (He crowns the appearance as her podcast debut, but Swift did appear on Rolling Stone‘s 500 Greatest Albums Podcast in 2020 to go deep on Red). “Last December, she wrapped up the Eras Tour, which spanned 149 shows across 51 cities, five continents,” he said. “It was the most attended tour of all time.” Unable to resist, Travis echoed, “Of all time!” in a mocking tone, potentially calling back to some bad blood with Kanye West that Swift has long since wiped away.

	But wait, there's more. “Her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, set a record with 1.76 billion streams globally within the first week alone,” Jason announces, which really catches Swift by surprise. It's hard to believe anyone would forget milestones of this magnitude, but maybe it's easy to let a few slip through the cracks when you have so many. She picked some up from Travis, too. “And as a fan of that guy on the Chiefs, she has 19 wins, two AFC titles, and a Super Bowl.” 


	Swift is looking to rack up a few more accolades as she prepares to launch her 12th studio album The Life of a Showgirl, unveiled at 12:12 a.m. in the first New Heights teaser.

	Filmmaker Julia Loktev's voice is the first we hear in her epic new documentary. Over a nighttime shot of Moscow, she warns, “The world you're about to see no longer exists. None of us knew what was about to happen.” For the next five-and-a-half hours, My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow more than lives up to that ominous opening. Loktev's film chronicles the Russian government's systematic crackdown on journalists in late 2021 and early 2022 as Vladimir Putin plots his invasion of Ukraine. Shooting by herself with just an iPhone, Loktev spent weeks at a time shadowing the young women and men of TV Rain, the country's last independent news channel. The result is a gripping vérité portrait of citizens under siege by a tyrannical leader stripping away their freedoms.


	But since its international premiere at last year's New York Film Festival, My Undesirable Friends (which makes its U.S. theatrical debut in New York City's Film Forum on Friday) has become much more than a movie about Russia. Speaking over Zoom from New York, Loktev (who grew up in Russia before moving to the States when she was nine) is still absorbing her documentary's wide-reaching political implications — and how the film is sounding an alarm bell for what's taking place in America under Trump.

	











	“My roommates from Iran, friends who grew up under the dictatorship in Argentina, people from China — they all said, ‘This is about us,'” Loktev says. “‘This is what it feels like to live under an authoritarian regime. We'd never seen anything that shows it so well.' And now, Americans are going, ‘Oh, it's about us.'”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The 55-year-old filmmaker had not planned on making such a sweeping yet intimate portrait when she first reached out to her friend, TV Rain host Anna Nemzer. The initial spark was an August 2021 New York Times piece about young Russian independent journalists being labeled “foreign agents” by Putin's regime, which demanded they run a ridiculously long disclaimer before their segments identifying themselves as such. “The important part was that [the journalists] were fighting back with humor,” Loktev recalls. For example, some of those reporters responded by launching a snarky podcast called Hi, You're a Foreign Agent. “That's when I contacted Anna Nemzer and said, ‘Let's do something about this.'”

	Starting in October of that year, Loktev began filming Nemzer and her colleagues, who felt the weight of Putin's restrictive rule but had no sense that the war on Ukraine was imminent. “The impending doom was definitely there from the start,” says Loktev, “but the doom that people expected [was] different than the doom that happened. They thought that what awaited them was an internal crackdown aimed at them. They were all trying to figure out, ‘How long can we keep working as journalists here?' They kept saying they love [Russia] more than Putin loves it and they keep trying to fight inside the country.”


	Although Loktev directed the 1998 documentary Moment of Impact, she most recently made the feature films Day Night Day Night (starring Luisa Williams as a suicide bomber) and The Loneliest Planet (with Gael García Bernal and Hani Furstenberg playing lovers on a fateful backpacking trip). And while My Undesirable Friends is a real-life drama, it unspools like a paranoid thriller, so Loktev approached it with a narrative flair.


	“People describe it as very different things,” she says, from a horror film to a reality show to a Russian novel to a dark comedy. “I think it's all of those things. What it's not is a conventional documentary.” The film eschews dry talking-head interviews from political experts, instead presenting fly-on-the-wall encounters with these independent journalists — many of them women in their twenties — as they do their jobs and then blow off steam during their off hours. As Loktev describes it, “There is a tension that builds, but meanwhile, you're with these people who are hanging out. They're quite funny as horrible, horrible things are happening to them.”

	Unfolding over five chapters — three set before the Ukraine invasion, two in the midst of it — My Undesirable Friends details Putin's chilling effect on Loktev's subjects, and different individuals become the main character across the movie's runtime, including journalist Ksenia Mironova, a sweet but dogged reporter whose fiancé, fellow journalist Ivan Safronov, has been imprisoned. TV Rain covers massive protests in the wake of the 2021 incarceration of anti-Putin activist Alexei Navalny, which seem to suggest a sea change within the country — only to have the government crush dissent. The movie has the suffocating feel of a hand tightening around a throat as these women keep reporting while simultaneously worrying if they should flee Russia to avoid arrest, their anxiety captured nearly in real time.

	











	Inevitably, Americans will notice disturbing similarities between Putin and Trump, who has repeatedly threatened the press, challenged democratic norms, and ordered numerous detainments. Loktev, who is nearing completion of a second five-hour documentary that details what became of the exiled journalists, understands why American viewers will watch her film looking for clues to what might happen here. “We are so hungry for things that help us understand the current moment,” she says. “Part of living under an authoritarian [government] is it does make you feel like you're going crazy — it doesn't make sense. [Watching the movie] is a way of understanding, ‘Everything you're feeling is normal under these circumstances.'”


	Because she stayed close to the ground, documenting this pivotal political moment from the perspective of the journalists she followed, My Undesirable Friends is a powerfully emotional experience. And by cataloging everyday life under authoritarianism, she exposes the crushing normalcy that's never depicted in Hollywood portrayals of dystopian governments.


	“[TV Rain reporter] Sonya [Groysman] interviews this anthropologist: ‘It's a strange feeling because there's nice cafes everywhere and Moscow looks great and you can get anything delivered. Meanwhile, my friends are being arrested.' And the anthropologist explains to her that we're used to seeing films like V for Vendetta, which make it look like, in an authoritarian society, everyone suffers equally and everyone's miserable,” Loktev says. “But actually this is what it looks like to live under authoritarianism — it looks really nice for a lot of people, and there are matcha lattes everywhere. I think about this every day now that I walk out in New York. My neighborhood looks really nice — meanwhile, there are people in unmarked vans with masks snatching people off the street.”


	As frightening as the world around Loktev's subjects is, what's remarkable is how full of life they are, the filmmaker emphasizing their youthful energy, dark sense of humor, and endearing obsessions. (A running subplot is Mironova's love for Harry Potter, culminating in her meeting Draco Malfoy himself, Tom Felton.) But Loktev is quick to correct anyone who perceives My Undesirable Friends as a snapshot of idealists under duress.


	“You can't really be idealistic in 2021 Russia,” she counters. “Navalny has already been poisoned. There's been huge crackdowns by the police. People that go to protests get beaten with batons. It's not idealism, that's not the right word. It's a persistence despite the odds.” Loktev points to TV Rain's 2021 New Year's Eve broadcast, which plays out during one chapter of My Undesirable Friends. It's a defiantly celebratory evening, despite the journalists' fear that they could end up in prison soon. “The title of the New Year's show is We're Not Dispersing. That's incredibly inspiring because it's not idealism at all — it's a necessity to keep going.”

	











	If My Undesirable Friends were merely a close accounting of Russia's dismantling of a free society, it would be stunning enough. But by positioning this as a story of a younger generation refusing to cede their liberties to tyrants, Loktev has made a film about resistance, putting a human face on the daily struggles concerned citizens must endure to take back their country. For her, the film's message can be defined by one incident.

	“It was the closing of Memorial, Russia's oldest human rights organization, dedicated to preserving the memory of political terror going back to Stalin and also looking at political prisoners today,” Loktev recalls. “Right before New Year's Eve, Russia shut it down for ridiculous [reasons]. The way that Memorial dealt with being shut down is they had a holiday party that night. And this human rights lawyer stood up and said, ‘Let joy and laughter also be a part of our resistance.'


	“I think [it's] incredibly important not to become dispirited,” Loktev continues. “That's what you see in the film. I always say, for a film about political repression in a very cold place, it's strangely funny and warm. Life and warmth and laughter is also a form of resistance — that's what keeps you from giving up.”

Stephen King couldn't write anything as terrifying as Donald Trump‘s America. In a new interview, the author answered a series of fan questions for The Guardian, including “If you had to invent an ending for Trumpian America, what would it be?”


	“I think it would be impeachment – which, in my view, would be a good ending,” King responded. “I would love to see him retired, let's put it that way. The bad ending would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It's a horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn't he?”


	King has been an outspoken critic of Trump for years, sharing his thoughts on social media on an almost-daily basis. In June, he tweeted, “Deep down in his heart, I believe Trump knows he's an incompetent asshole.” He recently added, “Trump is like a spoiled child. When he doesn't get his way, he does a tantrum.” 


	In 2022, King was asked for his views on Trump during an interview for the Sunday Times and he didn't mince words. “I happen to think that Trump was a horrible president and is a horrible person,” King said. “I think he actually engaged in criminal behavior and, certainly, I felt that he was a sociopath who tried to overturn the American democracy not out of any political wish of his own but because he could not admit that he had lost.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Ahead of the 2024 election, King speculated that Trump had refused to debate Democratic nominee Kamala Harris despite an official announcement. “Trump has announced he won't debate Kamala Harris,” King wrote. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded in a statement to Newsweek, “Stephen King is a dumbass.”

	Elsewhere in his interview with The Guardian, King reflected on the many adaptations of his books and stories that been made recently, including The Life of Chuck and The Monkey. “I'm still excited when somebody makes a movie out of something that I've done,” he said. “I was excited to see The Monkey earlier this year, and The Life of Chuck. I'm very excited to see [Edgar Wright's remake of] The Running Man, which was filmed in England. I don't write with movies in mind. I just write what seems like a good story that people and I will enjoy. Then whatever happens to it happens. That's fine. I like the movies, but I think they're different things, like apples and oranges, so to speak.”


	He also responded to a question about whether he felt Netflix series Stranger Things was comparable to one of his novels. “I don't see it as a Stephen King story as much as some other people do,” he said. “I think the Duffer Brothers give me more credit than I deserve. Like a lot of talented people, they grew up with my material. When they were young and malleable, they read a lot of Stephen King and said: ‘We wanna do something like that.' But they're very talented guys and the story they have developed has a lot more to it than Stephen King. It's got a lot of Duffer Brothers in it. It's good. I've seen all the episodes. I like it a lot.”

	For all the talk of authenticity in country music, few artists are truly willing to go there when it comes to opening up about tough times in their lives. That's not the case with Ashley Monroe, whose new album, the stellar Tennessee Lightning, is informed in part by what she calls her “dark years.”


	The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter and member of Pistol Annies reached into her most harrowing experiences when recording the 17 tracks on the album, from the death of her father when she was just 13 to past use of pain pills to her 2021 cancer diagnosis. In a new interview with Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast, Monroe reveals that she once overdosed on a combination of substances around 2010. Instead of brushing it under the rug, she's using the tale to caution others.

A post shared by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone)


	“My deal was that I mixed things, and that's the thing I want people to know now,” she tells Nashville Now. “I always tell people who are younger than me: ‘Don't mix things. You don't have to do a lot of things to die.' That's why there are so many accidental ODs. It's not like you have to take a whole bottle of something. You can take a little Xanax, a little pain pill, and a double vodka, and you just stop breathing.”

	Monroe says she didn't go to rehab for her pain pill use, which started after her dad died when she was 13. Instead, after the overdose in her 20s, she made a hard and fast decision. “I was like, ‘No, I'm not going to go to rehab, I'm not going to do them anymore.' And I flushed them down the toilet,” she says. “We all have those dark years. There were a lot of good things happening, but me personally, I was just more lost than ever.”

	Why so green and lonely? Cheer up: Radiohead are revisiting 2003's Hail to the Thief with a new live album, out digitally today and on vinyl Oct. 31. 


Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 includes performances from that era in Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Buenos Aires. You can hear a sizzling “There There” from March 2009 below. The release spans 12 songs, nearly matching the track list of the original album, with only “Backdrifts” and “A Punch Up at a Wedding” omitted.


Hail to the Thief, Radiohead's much-awaited follow-up to the acclaimed sister albums Kid A and Amnesiac, celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. The album, which contains fan favorites like “2+2=5” and “Myxomatosis,” marked the band's final release on EMI. It's the longest Radiohead album, and the band has since expressed regrets about its length; in 2008, Thom Yorke even shared an alternative, slimmed-down track list.

	











	In a statement, Yorke said the new live album was born out of Hamlet Hail to the Thief, the recent stage production in the U.K. that mashed up the early-1600s Shakespeare play and the early-2000s LP. “In the process of thinking of how to build arrangements for the Shakespeare Hamlet/Hail to the Thief theatre production, I asked to hear some archive live recordings of the songs,” he said. “I was shocked by the kind of energy behind the way we played. I barely recognised us, and it helped me find a way forward. We decided to get these live recordings mixed and released (it would have been insane to keep them for ourselves). It has all been a very cathartic process. We very much hope you enjoy them.”

	











Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 arrives at a moment of reflection for Yorke, who is currently showing the retrospective Radiohead art exhibit This is What You Get in the band's hometown of Oxford, England. The live album follows the band's archival releases for OK Computer (2017's OKNOTOK 1997 2017) and Kid A and Amnesiac (2021's Kid A Mnesia), each pegged to their 20-year anniversaries. (Earlier this year, they commemorated the 30th anniversary of 1995's The Bends with an unearthed acoustic performance by Yorke.) It's their first-ever full-length live album, following the eight-track 2001 live release I Might Be Wrong.

	Last year, during a solo show in Auckland, New Zealand, Yorke played Hail to the Thief‘s “Sail to the Moon” for the first time in 16 years. (The most hardcore fans noted that it was his first solo rendition of the track in even longer.)


	Radiohead wrapped their most recent tour, pegged to 2016's A Moon Shaped Pool, in 2018. In the years since, Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood formed the side project the Smile with former Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner. They've released three Smile albums: 2022's A Light for Attracting Attention and Wall of Eyes and Cutouts, both released in 2024. Yorke then teamed up with producer Mark Pritchard for 2025's Tall Tales.


	In December 2024, bassist Colin Greenwood spoke to Rolling Stone about his photo book How to Disappear: A Portrait of Radiohead — and the band's private reunion earlier that year, reports of which prompted months of speculation and rumors. “It was just basically to check in with each other, I suppose, because we hadn't done it for so long,” he told us. “I guess it was also because I think maybe Thom and Jonny were going off to do some stuff [with the Smile]…. It was something we could all do cause we were all around that time. It was just really nice just to run through stuff… We ran through, like, The Bends. Kid A stuff. We ran through loads of stuff … We enjoy being with each other. So let's leave on a high.”


	The one-off LP pressing of Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 is available for preorder now, in both red and cyan-colored vinyl.

	The thing about puppies is, they start out all small and cute and oh-so-adorable. Look at their puppy paws, way too big for their itty-bitty widdle bodies! Listen to their playful woofs and yips, as they tumble around and trip over themselves! Feel how fuzzy their rolly-polly bellies are, as you give the lil' buddies an affectionate tummy scratch! Then they get older, and bigger, and more attuned to the interests of pets of a certain age. Biology starts to work its magic, as it does on all of God's beautiful creatures. And the next thing you know, the family dog is frantically fucking grandma's leg like like there's no tomorrow. 


	Genndy Tartakovsky's Fixed kicks off with this 0-to-60 mph progression, as a family brings home a baby bull terrier named, naturally, Bull. Cue a quick “Two years later” title card, and we find our hero en flagrante delecto with Nana's varicose-veined calf. To say that the running commentary accompanying this animated pooch's sexual encounter is pornographic would be putting it lightly; we'll just note that Bull is extremely verbal. After being shoo-ed away by his owners before he's reached a state of release, he then proceeds to have intimate relations with a cup of mint ice cream, a rubber ball, an umbrella, a purse, and a bowl of fruit. Finally, a garden hose gets turned on full-blast, and for better or worse, so does Bull. 

	











	You're either laughing hysterically after reading that paragraph above or have the same look on your face that occurs when encountering spoiled milk. And that's pretty much the either/or in terms of reactions to this. Tartakovsky is a bona fide legend in modern animation, but Samurai Jack this ain't, and this attempt to outswim Adult Swim in terms of giddily obscene humor just feels like he binged all of Ren & Stimpy and Ralph Bakshi's back catalog over a holiday weekend. It's a gross-out comedy aimed specifically at folks who have calendars of dogs dressed up in human clothes, 12-year-old boys and/or PornHub addicts in equal measure. The fact that Netflix, who dropped this on its site today, didn't let him call the movie Doggy Style may be the only sign of restraint here.

	You can't blame Bull (voiced by Adam Devine, who sounds like the only direction he was given was, “Do your best Jack Black impersonation”) for wanting to hump everything in sight. He's a literal horndog. Nor can you blame him for harboring a crush on Honey (Kathryn Hahn), the queen-bitch Afghan hound who lives next door to him. They've been best friends since they were pups, and she sees the kind heart behind the raging hormones. Still, Bull doesn't understand why Honey is so excited about taking part in a dog show, given that it's so demeaning to their species. Don't the judges just parade you around, then poke, prod and grope you? She has issues with that last verb: “They aren't groping me,” she protests. “They are gently touching my body, then judging me on how it feels.” 


	Bull also runs with a pack of other neighborhood dogs, including an alpha boxer named Rocco (Idris Elba), a nerdy but socially ambitious dachshund named Fetch (Fred Armisen), and a catshit-eating beagle named Lucky (Bobby Moynihan). They spend their days sniffing butts and chasing balls. Speaking of balls: The gang spots one of their peers sporting a cone around his head. He's just had a medical procedure done, see. And when the big guy turns around, everyone at the dog park notices that he's conspicuously missing his cojones. Bulls shrieks in terror. He can't imagine losing his prized possessions. 


	Then the bull terrier comes home later that afternoon, and starts to get suspicious about why his owners are acting uncharacteristically nice to him. It turns out that he is indeed scheduled to be neutered the next morning. So Bull does what any sensible, testicle-loving mutt would do. He gets the hell outta the house and heads for some imagined Shangri-La where he can perpetually fuck human legs in peace.

	From here, Fixed turns into one castration-anxiety punch line and dick joke after another, and while we do love a good dick joke, the whole thing wears out its welcome way too quickly. The manic jazzbo score doesn't help, even if it's meant to subversively evoke vintage Hanna-Barbera cartoons, nor does the feeling that Tartakovsky and co-writers Steve Greenberg and Jon Vitti aren't aiming for the funniest anthropomorphic gags so much merely plucking every low-hanging-fruit — pun 1000-percent intended in this case — in bulk. The closest thing to an imaginative set piece involves a kennel and the command to “Bellagio these fuckers,” which, yeah. Don't ask. Meanwhile, you wonder if Dave Chappelle wrote the scenes involving an intersex Dobermann voiced by River Gallo.

	











	There's also a love triangle involving Bull, Honey, and a snooty Borzoi (Beck Bennett) which is meant to gird all of the self-conscious raunchiness with rom-com sweetness, and somehow makes the whole affair feel even more phony and half-baked. Fixed should have been, by any measure, the fix we needed in terms of balls-out hilarity about neurotic, sex-crazed creatures, or even just a parable from an animation godhead about humans being just as beholden to animal instincts as our four-legged friends. Instead, we get a wildly uneven, totally obvious, and often painfully unfunny 80 minutes. It's enough to drive you nuts.

They both had the zoomies.

A British man accidentally caught a possible UFO zooming through the sky in a video of his dog playing fetch at a scenic location in England, according to a report.

Andrew Clifton, 40, was tossing a frisbee to Dash, his 5-year-old Labrador, on Malvern Hills, near Worcester, on Aug. 2, when the alleged object flashed in the sky, Gloucestershire Live reported.

Video played at full speed shows a slight flit appear under the cloudy sky, appearing for less than a split-second and barely visible to the naked eye.

But on a slow-motion replay, the alleged object appears tubular and missile-shaped with a blue-looking cap on its rear.

The clip was posted on a UFO Facebook group and on X and has over 7 million views, SWNS reported.

While some were certain the object was alien technology, Clifton shared his opinion that it could be a high-tech military project, SWNS reported.

England's Royal Air Force has a base near the scenic destination in the town of Worcester.

With eyes turned to the skies, stargazers taking in the Perseid meteor shower on Tuesday night witnessed something out of this world. 

In a publication on Facebook, the Astrolab du parc national du Mont-Mégantic in Quebec's Eastern Townships described it as ""a magnificent and luminous spiral streaking across the sky at around 10:40 p.m.""

Several people in the Montreal area also witnessed the strange phenomenon and reached out to CBC News describing a bright light enveloped by a fuzzy halo and warning of a UFO sighting.

While it was certainly unusual, it wasn't really an unidentified flying object, but more likely the result of a rocket launch, according to the Astrolab.

""It was in all likelihood the second stage of an Ariane 6 rocket which was igniting its engine in order to de-orbit itself after having released the European satellite Metop-SGA1 in a polar orbit,"" the Facebook post explained.

The European Space Agency confirmed on its website that a weather satellite was launched Tuesday evening at 9:37 p.m. local time, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana — an overseas department of France located in South America.

The new satellite is meant to usher in ""a new era of weather and climate monitoring from polar orbit.""

According to astrophysicist Robert Lamontagne, the rocket's orbit is what allowed for the spectacle to be visible in Quebec.

Most of the time rocket launches are on an equatorial orbit and so will be visible near the equator, he said. 

In a polar orbit, the rocket has to go around the earth circling each pole of the planet.

""So the the trajectory of that the rocket made it so that from our latitude it could be seen in Montreal or the south of Quebec,"" he said. 

But to witness the phenomena, other factors also need to align, according to Lamontagne, including the time of launch and the altitude reached by the rocket. 

""From our point of view, we were in the dark, the sun was low below the horizon, but the rocket itself was so high that it was still lit by the by the sun,"" he said. 

And as the second stage of the rocket re-entered the earth's atmosphere, he said, ""it was spinning a little bit, there was  exhaust gases coming out from it and that's what people saw in the sky.""

A spokesperson for the Canadian Space Agency told CBC News that many observers captured video of the event, with the agency confirming it was the ESA's  Ariane 6 rocket.

There's a technological revolution taking place in the auto care industry, transforming the distribution business and changing consumer behaviours.

As this transformation takes place, Alain Primeau, executive vice president of UAP, spoke with Auto Service World Conversations about the needed commitment to technological adaptation, comprehensive training and supporting the evolving needs of service providers and consumers alike.

“The new generation of service providers are more tech-oriented,” Primeau explained. “They want diagnostic tools. They want to make sure they make proper business decisions with proper value.”

The shift goes beyond technological tools, extending to consumer expectations and purchasing behaviours. Primeau, who recently expanded his role to oversee the NAPA, Altom and heavy vehicle divisions, noted that consumers are now more educated, arriving at repair shops with extensive research and understanding of part qualities and warranties.

A critical focus for the industry is the emerging electric vehicle market. UAP has already launched the NexDrive program, which provides 160 hours of specialized training and has 65 shops participating across Canada. He highlighted the training teams led by Yves Racette.

“[He] has so much authority on that business, so much,” Primeau praised. “He is somebody that anyone in Canada — and even in [the] United States — wants him as a speaker.”

He also highlighted a significant industry challenge: Succession planning for independent repair shops.

“We feel that the new generation is not as [entrepreneurial as] maybe their father or grandfather were,” Primeau observed, adding that the company is developing programs to help shop owners plan for retirement and transfer their businesses.

Economic conditions are driving another significant trend: consumers are keeping vehicles longer and investing in higher-quality parts.

“Now it's really changing because people are really looking to put quality parts [on their vehicle] because they know they're going to keep their car for seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 years,” Primeau said. “So by having the right parts — the right quality parts — that would allow the consumer, the driver, to keep their car longer.”

Musical stars may seem to be different from the rest of us, but they too put their pants on one leg at a time. And some even claim to have had paranormal experiences like the rest of the nearly 67% of Americans who believe they've witnessed something from beyond the grave. Musicians who've spoken about their strange experiences include pop stars like Adele and Miley Cyrus, shock-rocker Alice Cooper, hip-hop star Kendrick Lamar, and Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton. And that's just a few of the bevy of musicians who swear they've experienced unexplained phenomena.

Adele, Cyrus, and Cooper have had creepy encounters in supposedly haunted homes — the first two in England and the third in Upstate New York. Lamar and Newton, meanwhile, allegedly had ghostly meetings with other famous — and very dead — stars. So apparently the paranormal isn't limited to a single genre, but can manifest around artists of all stripes, whether it's pop, rock, or hip-hop. 




Miley Cyrus, the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, went from a child star to Grammy-winning pop diva. But neither awards nor stardom insulated her from some very creepy experiences at a London apartment near the famous Harrods department store during a European tour in 2009. Cyrus, her (now husband) Liam Hemsworth, and her family were renting the apartment that had once been an old bakery for use as a home base.

They soon began experiencing a series of terrifying incidents, from windows and doors that opened on their own to hot water faucets turning on to a ghostly presence. ""Before I felt this, I thought I had seen a little boy sitting on the sink watching me take a shower so I felt really freaked out,"" She told Elle UK in 2013. Cyrus may have wanted to use a wrecking ball on the flat, but instead, she and her family moved to the Soho hotel. Cyrus was just one of several celebrities who have claimed to have experienced chilling paranormal activity.




Acclaimed hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar has a Pulitzer Prize and nearly two-dozen Grammys to his name, and he may have had a ghostly experience from another rap legend to thank in part for some of his success. Besides being deeply inspired by Tupac Shakur, who died from gunshot wounds sustained in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, there may have been a supernatural element to Lamar's relationship to Tupac.

In a 2011 interview on Home Grown Radio, Lamar recounted a strange experience he had one night while asleep. He said he saw ""a blur, like a silhouette"" and heard the dead rapper's voice. ""Keep doing what you doing, don't let my music die,"" Lamar recalled the presence telling him. Lamar later included part of a 1994 interview with Shakur in his song ""Mortal Man"" from the 2015 album ""To Pimp a Butterfly."" Lamar wasn't the only artist to supposedly experience a supernatural meeting with a legendary performer.




Wayne Newton, known as ""Mr. Las Vegas,"" is a singer and actor who's been a staple in Sin City's entertainment scene for decades. He met Elvis Presley on the set of Bonanza in the mid-1960s, and the two hit it off. Not long after Presley died in 1977, Newton began performing at the Hilton in Las Vegas, where Elvis had also had a residency. To honor his friend, Newton decided to perform a medley of Elvis tunes. But on the night Newton debuted his tribute, the singer said he had an extremely weird and unsettling experience.

Just as his conductor began the medley, the lights in the venue suddenly went out along with the sound system. Only a single spotlight remained trained on the singer. Newton looked up towards the closed-off balcony and saw someone there. ""It was kind of backlit, and I realized the image I was looking at was Elvis standing in the balcony,"" Newton recounted in an episode of the TV program ""Celebrity Ghost Stories. ""There was no mistaking it."" 

Newton believed his dead friend had come to let him know he was at peace and happy with what he was seeing and hearing. As suddenly as the lights had gone out, they came back on and everything continued as normal. Newton thought he was losing his mind until his drummer mentioned how weird it was that the lights had gone out and someone was in the balcony.




In 2012, the Grammy-winning pop superstar Adele was riding high with the chart-smashing success of her album ""21"" which included hits like ""Rolling in the Deep,"" but she was also being hounded by paparazzi. She ended up renting an 85-acre estate in West Sussex, England, for two years to get a little privacy. Perhaps she should have reconsidered renting Lock House, a century-old former convent, when she began to hear strange noises there at night.

In an interview with Anderson Cooper for the CBS news show 60 Minutes, Adele admitted the seemingly haunted place creeped her out. ""This bit's all quite scary, really,"" she told Cooper as they walked down a long, dark hall. Adele ended up hiring an around-the-clock security guard, among other precautions. ""I'm not rattling around here on my own,"" she told a friend (via Page Six). ""It gives me the creeps."" She vacated the property a few months later. A previous owner who had the house for 20 years beginning in 1919 also had some unsettling experiences there and sold the property in 1939. Lock House came back to haunt Adele when its owner accused her of making the property unsellable because of her comments.




Shock-rocker Alice Cooper has been putting on blood-soaked and horror-tinged rock shows for more than 40 years, so his purported paranormal encounter is definitely on-brand. In the early 1980s, Cooper and Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry were working on songs for Perry's 1984 film ""Monster Dog"" at an old house in Copake, New York, when weird things started happening. ""It was very paranormal,"" Cooper said in an interview for Radio.com. ""You'd put something down and then go in the other room and come back and it wasn't there and then you'd go 'huh'.""

Both Cooper and Perry had just gotten out of rehab at the time and chalked it up to being newly sober. At dinner in the house that was owned by Cooper's manager, everyone began comparing stories and realized they'd all had creepy experiences there. ""And then we hear something in the basement that sounds like people moving furniture,"" Cooper recalled. They decided not to stay. So if you happen to experience something otherworldly, you'll be in good company with some of music's greatest performers.","{'href': 'https://www.grunge.com', 'title': 'grunge.com'}","other"

The detection of viable life is a key objective for both in situ astrobiological experiments on extraterrestrial bodies, and for planetary protection protocols on Earth following sample return. We evaluated the potential for common bacterial and archaeal intact polar lipids (IPLs) to be used as viable life markers owing to their particularly fast rate (hours to days) of post-mortem degradation. We determined the chemical signatures of IPLs using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (with and without derivatisation), to simulate the results of in situ pyrolytic organic analyses. Monoglycerides, formed as pyrolysis products of typical bacterial IPLs, were the strongest signature for the parent compounds, and were identified in both the pyrolysis of a phospholipid mixture and freeze-dried bacterial culture. Our results demonstrate that relatively rapid and elegant pyrolysis techniques can reveal the presence of IPLs, and therefore evidence of viable life in extraterrestrial samples.

Biological lipids serve a variety of cellular functions including their use as structural components of cell membranes. To enable self-assembly, amphiphilic membrane lipids consist of a hydrophilic polar head group and hydrophobic aliphatic side chains, all linked to a connecting backbone – most commonly glycerol. As a result of evolutionary divergence and adaptation, the composition of these membrane lipids varies across biological taxa1, enabling their use as biomarkers for particular organisms2. On the domain scale, the cellular membrane lipids of bacteria and eukarya are generally composed of fatty-acid derived tail groups ester-linked to the glycerol backbone, whereas archaeal lipids exhibit ether-linked branched tail groups derived from isoprenoids3.

Despite being susceptible to some degradational processes, lipids or their diagenetic derivatives are relatively well-preserved on geological timescales4. The endurance of lipid-derived molecules during diagenetic processes has made them a particular focus of astrobiological studies seeking biomarkers diagnostic of past life4,5,6,7. Intact polar lipids (IPLs) are the pristine, undegraded membrane lipids found in living cells that provide the most detailed taxonomic information2,8. Many IPLs are rapidly enzymatically degraded upon death of an organism9,10,11. Incubations of natural sediments exhibited 69% degradation of an ester-bound bacterial IPL after 4 days, compared with 4% of an archaeal ether-bound IPL12. Consideration of the degradation products indicates that post-mortem degradation of ester-bound IPLs initiates with the hydrolysis of the ester bond to the side chains12,13. For astrobiological studies, we propose the term viable life marker or “VLM” for the diagnostic molecular signatures of living organisms. The rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs has already led to their consideration as molecular evidence for active life10,14, constituting a potential VLM.

On Earth, the structure and abundance of IPLs is most commonly investigated by solvent extraction of relevant samples followed by liquid-based chromatography and mass spectrometry14,15,16. However, because of the difficulties associated with transporting solvents and concerns over forward contamination, the solvent extraction and liquid-based chromatography techniques conventionally used for IPL characterisation on Earth are less practical for in situ extra-terrestrial astrobiological experiments17. Moreover, the direct analysis of IPLs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is problematic as many IPLs, including phospholipids, are not stable in the gas phase10, requiring offline derivatisation or hydrolysis in order to be amenable to GC18.

Instead, in extraterrestrial environments, in situ organic analysis is typically performed through analytical pyrolysis, eliminating the requirement for solvents17,19. Pyrolysis is performed by raising the sample material to temperatures above 500 °C followed by transfer of the evolved compounds into a system for characterisation, typically GC-MS20,21,22. These elevated temperatures cause thermochemical decomposition of the organic material in the sample, potentially obscuring diagnostic compounds. However, through experiments using standard organic compounds, combined with an understanding of pyrolysis mechanisms, the characteristic products of biomarkers in analytical pyrolysis can be established, providing a signature for their presence in the pyrolysis of natural samples23,24. In situ extraterrestrial pyrolysis methods have previously been simulated in lab experiments using on-line pyrolysis followed by GC-MS (pyrolysis-GC-MS)25.

The potential for pyrolysis-GC-MS to distinguish biotic from abiotic organic assemblages for application in extraterrestrial settings has been well established26, but the characteristic products of IPLs in pyrolysis have not been specifically identified and targeted in such experiments. In this study, we aimed to identify the thermochemical decomposition products of IPLs using pyrolysis-GC-MS to simulate the in situ pyrolysis process, with the motivation that these signature products could constitute a chemical marker to distinguish viable life in extraterrestrial samples. This could have potential applications for in-situ life detection experiments and analysis of returned samples.

Techniques for distinguishing viable life, such as detecting VLMs, are of importance for planetary protection protocols aiming to mitigate the risk of the introduction of harmful organisms to Earth from returned terrestrial samples27. The issue is especially pressing due the plans for Mars sample return in the near future28. Analyses including cultivation, DNA sequencing, microscopic imaging and liquid-based chromatography have been proposed but have various individual limitations, especially regarding sample-size requirements and contamination risk29.

We selected lipid standards to exemplify typical microbial IPLs and the products of their post-mortem degradation. We identified products of pyrolysis that were unique to the IPLs, enabling their potential use as a signature of viable life. Then, by pyrolysing natural samples, we were able to determine whether these signatures could be discerned in complex organic mixtures. Further details of the methodology are outlined in the Methods section.”

1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) were selected as standards to represent a typical bacterial and archaeal IPL respectively. 9-Octadecenoic (oleic) acid standards and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (archaeol) were selected to represent the geologically stable products of their post-mortem degradation5,12,30 (Fig. 1).

DOPC = 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPE = 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, R1 = 9-octadecene, R2 = phytane

Table 1 displays the products resulting from pyrolysis-GC-MS or pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of DOPC and oleic acid standards. Compounds eluting after oleic acid were observed exclusively in the pyrolysis of DOPC (Supplementary Fig. 1). In particular, 9-octadecenoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester (glyceryl monooleate), 2 trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative and 9-octadecenoic acid, 3-hydroxypropenyl ester (dehydrated glyceryl monooleate) formed during the pyrolysis of DOPC, with and without the derivatisation step respectively.

In the experiment without derivatisation, the dehydrated form of glyceryl monooleate was identified by the low intensity peak at m/z = 338 in the mass spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2A). This peak was attributed to the molecular ion of the compound, being 18 Da less than the complete monoglyceride, reflecting a loss of H2O during pyrolysis. This process of dehydration during analytical pyrolysis has been previously established for alcohols generally31. The elimination reaction will have produced multiple olefinic positional isomers which are unlikely to be chromatographically separated32. In the experiment with derivatisation, glyceryl monooleate, 2TMS derivative could be confidently identified due to the high intensity peak for the characteristic ion at m/z = 39733 (Supplementary Fig. 2B). In experiments where the 1-monoglyceride (α isomer) was observed, the 2-monoglyceride (β isomer) was absent or observed at very low abundance. Therefore, all monoglycerides described in these results are in the structural arrangement of the 1-monoglyceride regioisomer.

Table 2 outlines the products arising from the pyrolysis-GC-MS and pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of archaeal lipid standards archaeol and DPPE. Without a derivatisation step, no products were exclusive to DPPE. With the derivatisation step, the formation of glycerol, 3TMS derivative and phosphoric acid, 3TMS derivative was exclusive to the pyrolysis of DPPE (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 3).

To explore the response of IPLs in a natural sample we selected soy lecithin, a natural mixture of phospholipids extracted from soybeans34. Pyrolysis of the lecithin sample resulted in the formation of fatty acids and their corresponding (dehydrated) monoglycerides (Table 3). In the experiment without derivatisation, the response for dehydrated monoglycerides was relatively low (Supplementary Fig. 4). In contrast, in the experiment with derivatisation, all of the derivatised monoglycerides expected (based on the identification of their respective free fatty acids) were detected with significant response (Supplementary Fig. 4). As with the pyrolysis of DOPC, (dehydrated) monoglycerides were significantly easier to discern in the experiment with derivatisation due to the greater intensity of characteristic ions in their mass spectra.

Pyrolysis of the freeze-dried bacteria Shewanella frigidimarina resulted in the formation of a wide range of products, similar to those identified in previous studies35. Due to the variety of complex compounds formed, often coeluting from the column, extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) were produced to investigate the presence of the signatures of bacterial IPLs, using target ions established in the soy lecithin experiments. Hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid was identified as the most abundant fatty acid. Hence, EICs were produced at target ions for the corresponding (dehydrated) monoglyceride: glyceryl monopalmitate (m/z = 239 and m/z = 371 for the underivatised and derivatised compound, respectively).

In the pyrolysis-GC-MS of the bacterial sample without derivatisation, the EIC at m/z = 239 exhibited a peak at a retention time closely matching (within 0.03 min) the elution of dehydrated glyceryl monopalmitate in the lecithin experiment (Fig. 2A, B, Supplementary Table 3). Though the mass spectrum associated with this peak would be inconclusive in isolation, the matching retention time increases confidence in the identification of the compound as dehydrated glyceryl monopalmitate. Owing to the low signal to noise ratio in this EIC, selected ion monitoring (SIM) was employed at three characteristic ions for the compound resulting in a greater signal clarity for the compound at the expected retention time (Fig. 2A, B).

A Chromatogram acquired from the pyrolysis-GC-MS of the bacteria in selected ion (SIM) mode. m/z = 239 was selected due to it being the most intense peak in the spectra of the dehydrated monoglyceride. The chromatogram displays a peak with a retention time matching the elution of the dehydrated monoglyceride in the soy lecithin experiment. B Spectrum acquired in an identical experiment using full scan mode, at the retention time of the peak labelled with * in A. C Extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) acquired from the pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of the bacteria, showing a peak with a retention time matching the elution of the derivatised monoglyceride in previous experiments. D Spectrum acquired at the peak labelled with * in C.

In the results from pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of the bacterial sample, the EIC at m/z = 371 exhibited a peak at a retention time closely matching that of glyceryl monopalmitate, 2TMS derivative in the lecithin experiment (Fig. 2C, D, Supplementary Table 3). In contrast to the experiment without derivatisation, the mass spectrum associated with this peak by itself would likely be sufficient to be confidently attributed to the compound due to the detection of many other characteristic fragment ions. A retention time that matched the compound observed in previous experiments further increased confidence in its identification as the monoglyceride.

By identifying products of DOPC pyrolysis that were not observed in the pyrolysis of oleic acid (i.e. its post-mortem degradation product), the distinguishing signatures of bacterial IPLs in pyrolysis can be constrained (Table 1). The observation of (dehydrated) glyceryl monooleate is the most pertinent of these species as its structure retains an intact ester bond from the parent IPL molecule. IPL ester bonds have been shown to be rapidly hydrolysed upon death of an organism9,12, thus their presence in the monoglyceride is indicative of viable life in the pyrolysed sample. While the parent phospholipid would not be stable in the gas phase, the monoglyceride is a relatively volatile product of pyrolysis that is amenable to GC and retains sufficient structural information to act as a VLM. Using the detection of monoglycerides as a VLM can be generalised for any ester-linked IPL with a glycerol backbone, although the composition of the monoglyceride would vary with the composition of the tail groups of the parent IPL. A conceptual summary of these interpretation steps is displayed in Fig. 3.

The generalised reasoning for the detection of a monoglyceride in the pyrolysis of a sample as evidence for the presence of viable life.

Both the dehydrated and derivatised forms of the monoglycerides observed in the pyrolysis experiments exhibit the intact ester bond inherited from the parent IPL, validating their use as a VLM. Therefore, for convenience, we will henceforth use the term ‘monoglyceride' to refer to both the dehydrated and derivatised forms of these compounds. Derivatisation likely improves sensitivity and certainty for the detection of the monoglycerides arising from the pyrolysis of bacterial IPLs. Because, compared to its underivatised counterpart, the mass spectrum of the derivatised monoglyceride is more clearly distinguished (Supplementary Fig. 2). The formation of more distinct mass spectra during pyrolysis-GC-MS has already been established as a general advantage of incorporating a silylation derivatisation step into pyrolytic organic analysis21,36,37, and the technique will be employed by future in situ pyrolysis experiments on Mars38.

Other pyrolysis products exclusive to the IPL were also observed including N,N-dimethyloleamide and phosphoric acid, 3TMS derivative. However, these products can be formed by secondary reactions39 or do not exhibit sufficient intact bonding to serve as a conclusive signature for the presence of IPLs, precluding their use as a VLM. Table 1 also includes the products resulting from the pyrolysis-GC-MS of both DOPC and oleic acid (e.g. cyclooctene). As these compounds arise from the pyrolysis of both the IPL and the product of its enzymatic hydrolysis, they lack the potential to be used to discern the presence of an IPL.

Pyrolysis of naturally derived lecithin demonstrated that monoglycerides can be detected as pyrolysis products from a sample containing a mixture of different IPLs with varying tail groups. In the chromatograms of all experiments, a greater response for a particular fatty acid was associated with a greater response for the corresponding monoglyceride (Supplementary Fig. 4), providing guidance for detecting monoglycerides in natural samples: by identifying the most abundant fatty acid in preliminary pyrolysis experiments, the corresponding monoglyceride will be expected to be at greatest abundance. Hence, its structure and properties can be deduced and then targeted with increased specificity.

Results from the pyrolysis of a bacterial culture indicated the potential for monoglycerides to be detected during the pyrolysis of cellular samples. Currently, astrobiological space missions equipped with pyrolysis-GC-MS instrumentation are believed to lack the capability to discriminate between the signatures of viable and deceased life21. The results of these pyrolysis experiments demonstrate the potential for typical bacterial IPLs to be detected by these in situ analyses and, thereby, recognise viable extraterrestrial life. Although no single product of thermochemical decomposition could be used to conclusively support the presence of an entire IPL structure, the ester bond preserved in a monoglyceride has been specifically demonstrated to be labile upon death of the host organism. Further to this, bacterial life is not viable without this bond being intact to enable the formation of a cohesive cell membrane. Therefore, the observation of monoglycerides as a pyrolysis product is sufficient to function as a VLM, especially if observed alongside the other signature pyrolysis products of bacterial IPLs outlined here (free fatty acids, phosphoric acid, etc.).

Archaeal type ether-linked IPLs have less potential to be distinguished from their post-mortem degradation products. The most significant difference between the pyrolysis products of a typical archaeal IPL and the post-mortem degradation product (archaeol) was the identification of phosphoric acid and glycerol TMS derivatives following pyrolysis-derivatisation of the IPL. The structure of these pyrolysis products can only support the possibility of the presence of an IPL and their observation is insufficient to independently establish the presence of living biomass. However, the characteristic pyrolysis products from archaeal type ether-linked IPLs could still act as independent biosignatures, although not necessarily of viable life, as abiotic synthesis of systematically branched chain compounds such as phytol has not been observed13, and their detection should prompt follow-up investigations by other techniques.

One additional use case of the technique is assessing returned extraterrestrial samples for the presence of active or viable life, which is a priority for planetary protection protocols40,41. For instance, the committee on space research (COSPAR) has developed a sample safety assessment framework (SSAF) to analytically exclude the possibility of the presence of life in samples returned from Mars prior to release and distribution29. The SSAF incorporates a test sequence of increasingly involved analyses with the aim of establishing sufficient confidence in the absence of life in a returned sample, while minimising damage and the risk of contamination.

Once a Martian sample is returned to Earth, many of the limitations associated with in situ organic analyses will no longer apply42,43. The detection of IPLs could be performed using wet chemistry techniques such as solvent extraction and liquid chromatography. However, the use of the pyrolytic signatures of IPLs as a VLM may constitute a valuable screening step in any sample safety test sequence. Pyrolysis-GC-MS holds significant advantages over liquid-based techniques, even when considering analyses of returned samples. Pyrolysis is a relatively simple procedure, which requires small samples, minimal sample preparation and releases organic material from the sample without the need for multi-stage wet chemical procedures25. Screening by pyrolysis-GC-MS can, therefore, provide valuable data with minimal exposure of the sample to the terrestrial environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of hazardous Martian organisms being released from the sample into the terrestrial biosphere.

The detection of dormant microorganisms, such as bacterial endospores, is crucial for planetary protection protocols since these viable forms of life are typically resilient to harsh extraterrestrial environmental conditions and could survive sterilisation procedures44. As phospholipids are considered essential for the formation of a functional spore inner membrane45, we propose that IPL signatures are likely to be detectable in the pyrolysis of viable endospore material. Further experimental investigation should verify this hypothesis. Additionally, future experimentation of the technique on a range of microbial species, especially those considered to be viable in space conditions, will be important to confirm the general application of IPL signatures as a marker of viable life for planetary protection protocols.

We have demonstrated that pyrolysis-GC-MS can serve as an elegant and rapid method for producing evidence to support the presence or absence of viable life in a returned Martian sample. Pyrolysis-GC-MS could be incorporated into future sample safety sequences, to provide data that informs decisions on further sample processing.

The novel method to distinguish viable and deceased biology in pyrolysis outlined in this study comes with significant considerations and limitations. Firstly, this method relies upon the assumption that IPLs can be used as a VLM due to their rapid degradation upon death of an organism. However, this rate of degradation is dependent on the specific chemical structure of the IPL as well as the environmental conditions it endures following death of the host organism8,9,12. Therefore, the lability of the parent IPL in its particular geochemical setting must be considered if its characteristic products of pyrolysis are to be used as a VLM. Similarly, the rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs is biologically mediated12, raising the possibility of increased preservation potential if enzymatic activity is inhibited. Though these factors may compound the post-mortem stability of IPLs, this is unlikely to entirely preclude their use as VLMs because even the slowest recorded IPL degradation rates are significant when compared with the geological preservation times typically observed for fossil life.

Secondly, pyrolysis of extraterrestrial samples will differ from the experiments in this study due to the presence of inorganic materials. For example, the Martian surface exhibits a variety of minerals, such as iron oxides and perchlorates, that have previously been shown to obfuscate the signatures of diagnostic organic compounds in pyrolysis experiments24,46. Further experiments, closely simulating specific extraterrestrial environments, may be important for future applications of the technique. Additionally, the influence of abiotic organic matter, such as that sourced from meteoritic infall47 or hydrothermal processes48, on this IPL detection technique warrants further investigation. Fortunately, our recognition of characteristic fragments and their mass spectrometry responses enables the use of selected ion monitoring to tackle sensitivity limitations.

Finally, the structural diversity of IPLs poses a further challenge for their detection using in situ pyrolysis. Variations in the structures of IPLs will change the products formed during pyrolysis of the compound. We have established the pyrolytic signatures of typical bacterial and archaeal IPLs. Yet this is by no means exhaustive of all IPL structures. Variations in the head group, tail group or backbone of an IPL would result in different pyrolytic signatures. Future investigation on a wider variety of IPLs would allow for these signatures to be determined. However, the possibility of any extraterrestrial organisms varying beyond the molecular biology known on Earth makes accounting for all possible IPL signatures impossible. While the compartmentalisation of a cellular membrane is considered an essential component for life49, extraterrestrial organisms could well have evolved to use different membrane chemistries. Nevertheless, the suggestion that phospholipids may have evolved independently in archaeal and bacterial lineages50, promotes the possibility of convergent Darwinian evolution tending towards such biochemistry given suitable conditions. Hence, we argue that using known terrestrial biomarkers of viable life as an “educated guess” represents a present-day and reasonable approach to extraterrestrial life detection until more data become available.

As a result of these limitations, the lack of the detection of the VLMs outlined in this study should not be used as definitive evidence against the presence of any viable life in a sample, only as an investigative step to lower the likelihood of “life as we know it” being present. On the other hand, we argue that a clear detection of monoglyceride IPL signatures in pyrolysis experiments constitutes strong evidence towards the presence of viable life.

In summary, we have demonstrated the capability of pyrolysis-based organic analyses to detect the signatures of common IPLs. Due to the rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs, we now have a tool for recognising the chemical signatures of viable life using readily available, highly sensitive analytical techniques. The detection of IPLs may have important applications for in situ life detection experiments that regularly employ pyrolysis as a method for organic analysis. IPL recognition also has utility for planetary protection and sample return missions. Although wet chemistry procedures can be used to identify the presence of IPLs on Earth, we have demonstrated how pyrolysis can reveal similarly useful information. As a result, this technique could also offer a simple and rapid screening method to aid the examination of returned Martian samples for the presence of potentially hazardous viable life.

Lipid standards of 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (archaeol) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. 9-Octadecenoic (oleic) acid was obtained from Merck Sigma-Aldrich. To prepare standard solutions, 2 mg of each lipid standard was dissolved in 2 ml dichloromethane (1 mg/ml) and stored at −20 °C. To prepare the soy lecithin samples, the capsule shell of a commercial supplement (Holland and Barrett, UK) was pierced and then 2 mg of the interior soy lecithin material was dissolved in 2 ml dichloromethane (1 mg/ml). A viable, freeze-dried bacterial culture of the strain Shewanella frigidimarina (a gamma-proteobacteria of the pseudomonadota phylum) was purchased from DSMZ GmbH.

Approximately 20 μl of each standard solution, or 0.5 mg of freeze-dried bacterial culture, was deposited individually onto a quartz wool plug in a quartz pyrolysis tube and then left at room temperature for any solvent to evaporate. In the pyroprobe, the sample was heated to 650 °C at a rate of 20 °C ms−1 and then held at this temperature for 15 s in a flow of helium. Following pyrolysis, the interface was raised from 150 °C (100 °C for oleic acid) to 280 °C at a rate of 60 °C min−1. The GC injector operated with a 10:1 split at 270 °C and with a helium constant column flow rate of 1.1 ml min−1. Separation was performed on a DB-5MS ultra inert column (J&W; 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness). After being held for 2 min at 40 °C, the GC oven temperature was ramped to 310 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and then held at this temperature for 9 min. Mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode (70 eV) over a scan range from 50 to 550 mass/charge (m/z). To increase sensitivity during the experiments pyrolysing freeze-dried bacteria, selected ion monitoring (SIM) was employed. The monitored ions were m/z = 98.1, 116.1 and 239.3, each with a dwell time of 100 ms. Compounds were identified using the NIST mass spectral database and relevant literature.

An additional derivatisation step was performed using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to produce trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. The standard pyrolysis-GC-MS protocol was followed as outlined above but with the additional injection of 5 μl HMDS to the pyrolysis tube immediately prior to pyrolysis and the use of an 8 min solvent delay on the mass spectrometer. For the freeze-dried bacteria, 8 μl HMDS was added to ensure sufficient derivatisation of the sample.

For the pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS experiments, to establish the pyrolysis products deriving from HMDS, control samples were analysed by pyrolyzing quartz wool loaded with 5 μl HMDS. Products detected in the analysis of the HMDS control eluted early in the experiment ( < 15 min), and were dominated by organic compounds containing silane and amine moieties resulting from thermal degradation or polymerisation of the HMDS. Contaminants such as phthalates were identified and attributed to procedural exposure to plastic laboratory equipment. Siloxanes from column-bleed were also recognised as contaminants. Occasional minor lipid components were excluded if their presence could only by explained by impurities in the standard. For clarity, all of these compounds were disregarded from the results presented herein and are not annotated in the figures.

All experiments were replicated at least once, and up to five times for the most important data, to ensure that any significant signals detected were not the result of contamination or methodological error.

Researchers from Leiden University analysed almost 30 years of communication on astrobiology. News articles proved most speculative, especially via quotes from scientists. Especially exoplanet research is often accompanied by high expectations about extraterrestrial life, they write in PLOS One.

Astrobiology poses fundamental questions about life in the universe: how did it emerge? Is there life beyond Earh? In the recently published study, researchers investigated how the field was portrayed in the public sphere from 1996 to 2024 by shining light on what speculations and promises about the search for life elsewhere are circulating in the media. 

The researchers examined three kinds of sources of information about science: academic papers, press releases and news articles. Albergaria and his colleagues found that the most frequent speculations were about conditions or ingredients for life beyond Earth, followed by speculations on the existence of life. They also found speculations about the outcomes of the search to be uncommon, while speculative content on potential evidence pointing to life detection is rare.

The study found that expectations that technology will help find life beyond Earth are relatively high, appearing roughly in 1/3 of news articles, 1/5 of press releases and 1/10 of papers. The promise that astrobiology is making progress in the search for life was also quite common, with about 1/5 of press releases and news articles exhibiting this kind of content. 

In contrast, they found that promises of life detection are very rare. ‘Among news articles, we examined those covering studies published in peer reviewed journals. In general, scientists don't seem comfortable setting expectations on the prospects of life detection when talking about their own research,' says Albergaria, the first author of the study.

News articles presented more speculations and promises than press releases and papers but press releases had slightly more speculative content when communicating about the significance of research results. ‘This may reflect pressures for institutional communications to emphasize the impact of a study to grab media attention,' explains Albergaria. 

Papers showed much less speculations and promises than press releases and news stories, yet peer reviewed articles also exhibited some speculative content, especially about conditions and ingredients for life beyond Earth. 

The team also mapped how frequently speculations and promises appeared associated with authors of studies, with outside experts or without attribution to researchers. Press releases presented speculations most frequently in quotes of authors of studies, while in news articles speculative content appears more balanced between quoted researchers and without attribution to scientists. This underlines the role researchers play in the communication of the field.

The study also found that expectations about the search for life are more associated with exoplanet research than solar system exploration, and much higher than about the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). 

Albergaria ponders that speculations are not necessarily bad science communication. ‘Speculative imagination helps to develop concepts and hypotheses that guide the search. There are many unknowns about life in the universe and that's why speculations in the communication of astrobiology seem almost inevitable. So, it's still difficult to clearly distinguish unwarranted speculative content and legitimate contextualization,' he explains. ‘We need more research on that.'

In total, 630 articles were subject to a quantitative content analysis. Most were published in English, but the analysis also includes news stories published in Portuguese and Spanish. Articles came from six reference newspapers: The New York Times (USA), The Guardian (UK), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal) and El País (Spain).

Jared Padalecki has opened up about the one particular Supernatural storyline he wishes he could go back and change.


	By Kai Young

During its 15-season run, Supernatural included many controversial storylines, but there's one particular story that even Jared Padalecki wishes he could go back and change. Even though his brother, Jensen Ackles' Dean Winchester, was Supernatural's “ladies' man,” Jared Padalecki's Sam Winchester had many more substantial romances throughout the entire run of the beloved CW series. One of these relationships is widely regarded to be a mistake, however, and even Padalecki agrees, as he revealed at a FAN EXPO Boston panel this August (via Screen Rant).

“Amelia,” Padalecki stated with little hesitation when asked if Sam Winchester would make any decisions differently now, five years after Supernatural came to an end. “I don't think he would've gotten into a romantic relationship after his brother… over a dog, yeah.” Sam dated Liane Balaban's Amelia Richardson while Dean was trapped in Purgatory after defeating the Leviathans at the end of season 7. Amelia was a widowed veterinarian from Kermit, Texas, who Sam meets after he hits a dog and brings it into the clinic. They started a romance that ultimately ended when Amelia's husband, Don, returned from Afghanistan.

Sam's decision to not look for Dean after he was sent to Purgatory and instead shack up with Amelia and seemingly move on very quickly has been a controversial one since Supernatural season 8. Sure, the Winchester brothers had a pact not to make any demon deals or waste their lives looking for ways to bring each other back to life, but Sam didn't even consider this to be an option after Dean defeated Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart). A large part of the fan base had a problem with this choice, and now Padalecki's comments suggest that he agrees.

There was nothing inherently wrong with Amelia as a character, or as a romantic interest for Sam. In fact, the story involving her husband returning actually provided a grounded, very human subplot for Sam, which was rare for Supernatural – this conflict included no monsters. However, the problem with this storyline was in the timing. It didn't make sense that Sam would simply give up on looking for his brother and settle down so soon after Dean's disappearance, especially since this was almost a perfect re-telling of Dean's own relationship with Cindy Sampson's Lisa Braeden only two seasons prior.

Amelia was far from Sam Winchester's only relationship, but was indeed one of his most prominent. He was also romantically linked to the kitsune Amy Pond (Jewel Straite), deaf hunter Eileen Leahy (Shoshannah Stern), his season 1 girlfriend Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki), and even Scooby-Doo's Velma Dinkley (Kate Micucci). Jared Padalecki and demon Ruby actor Genevieve Cortese even married in the real world, while Sam Winchester ended up with a mysterious woman – who some believe is Eileen – who becomes his wife and the mother of his child, Dean. Sam got his happy ending, long after Amelia was forgotten.

				Failures			


This past Friday, August 8th, Patrick Joseph White allegedly opened fire on the CDC campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer while expending nearly 200 shots that sprayed the office buildings. This being America, this news in and of itself is not particularly compelling. We do mass shootings and attempted mass shootings better than anyone else in the world, after all. USA! USA!

But the reported motive that led White to attack the CDC certainly did grab people's attention:

Police identified Patrick Joseph White as the gunman and said he opened fire on the campus following claims that the COVID-19 vaccine made him severely depressed and suicidal, AP reported.

Interestingly, NIH has studied psychiatric effects following COVID-19 vaccination and found that the opposite occurs at the macro level: vaccination is actually associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Obviously there can be differences in individual cases, but that's the data from a study in 2022.

Now, of course, there's a new man in charge of HHS and its child agencies. RFK Jr. has railed against vaccines generally, and COVID-19 vaccines specifically, for years. He recently killed off the federal funding for mRNA vaccines, including COVID vaccines. He has previously and continues now to engage in blatant vaccine misinformation. Back when he was failing to win the U.S. presidency, he said this:

It doesn't take tinfoil-levels of dot-connecting to understand how you get from anti-vaxx peddlers like Kennedy to a troubled man blasting up a CDC campus. Is RFK Jr. the only reason White shot up the agency? No, probably not. But he is almost certainly a reason it occurred and that means he has some blood on his hands. The outrageous, profane wielding of pseudo-science by the person now in charge of American healthcare is vulgar all on its own, but it also comes with these sorts of knock-on effects. I have no idea what White was dealing with in his life, but I do know that what comes out of RFK Jr.'s mouth and social media accounts is dangerous. Dangerous because of the health risk it puts upon people who believe him. And the risk of those that take him so seriously that they are willing to commit acts of violence.

As the Epictetus said, circumstance don't make the person, but they do reveal the person. And leaders are supposed to lead in a crisis. It was something like 13 hours after police in Atlanta gave the all clear on the attempted mass shooting that Kennedy managed to put out a statement about it:

I would argue first that the statement is entirely disingenous. I have yet to see anything that looks even remotely like support for the CDC from Kennedy in general. I've seen budget cuts. I've seen staffing cuts. I've seen claims about chemtrails. I've seen years and years of attacks and conspiracy theories against the very agency he now leads. Where is all of that support?

And I would also argue that it isn't a great look for this statement to have been delayed by 30 minutes because Kennedy was on his personal ExTwitter account posting some sweet pics of his fishing trip in Alaska:

Perhaps the brain worm ate the part that powers empathy.

The connection is not lost on those that were targeted by this shooting, it should be noted. The CDC staffers in Atlanta were obviously terrified during the shooting. After it was all over, they wanted assurances that their collective boss had some understanding of his own culpability in all of this.

On Sunday, CNN reported that the CDC held a video conference with approximately 800 staff members to discuss the traumatic event and allow them to ask questions. Staff said they felt like “sitting ducks” as bullets whizzed just over their cubicle walls and they dove for the floor.

Stat also got access to the call and reported that another employee asked newly confirmed CDC Director Susan Monarez if she had been in touch with Kennedy directly about the shooting.

“Do you expect Secretary Kennedy to make a statement about this, and are you able to speak to the misinformation—the disinformation—that caused this issue, and what your plan forward is to ensure this doesn't happen again?” the employee asked.

Monarez did not directly answer the question, saying only that she had been in touch with Kennedy's office. “It's a good question. We've been in constant communication with the Office of the Secretary, and more will be coming,” Monarez said.

That such a question even has to be asked by a public servant is a disgrace. Why any competent scientist would risk their lives to keep working for American health agencies while RFK Jr. is still leading HHS is a mystery to me.

Thanks for the comment, dude who shits on public health workers every day for decades.

About those salmon: Maybe adding some more oil wells and more unrestricted industrial fishing will help. Right?

RFK Jr may not have found the cause of autism yet, but I'm pretty sure he's now convinced that vaccine if the cause of all mass shooting.

So, when I say “crazy nutjob,” you don't really know who I'm referring to here–the one who appointed another one to an important role or the other ones who come out of the woodwork. (Sadly, all of the above.)

RFK and his fellow travelers spent years demonizing mRNA vaccines, and now, because some people (MAGAs) are skeptical of them, he is stopping research into mRNA vaccines.

This will put the US behind Europe and many countries in vaccine development. More science, and with it economic growth, will more out of the US.

The current GOP is a death cult. Unfortunately, it's the USA that is dying.

A federal judge on Tuesday denied Elon Musk's bid to dismiss OpenAI's claims of a ""years-long harassment campaign"" by the Tesla CEO against the company he co-founded in 2015 and later abandoned before ChatGPT became a global phenomenon.

In the latest turn in a court battle that kicked off last year, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Musk must face OpenAI's claims that the billionaire, through press statements, social media posts, legal claims and ""a sham bid for OpenAI's assets"" had attempted to harm the AI startup.

Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman last year over the company's transition to a for-profit model, accusing the company of straying from its founding mission of developing AI for the good of humanity, not profit.

OpenAI countersued Musk in April, accusing the billionaire of engaging in fraudulent business practices under California law. Musk then asked for OpenAI's counterclaims to be dismissed or delayed until a later stage in the case.

OpenAI argued in May its countersuit should not be put on hold, and the judge on Tuesday concluded that the company's allegations were legally sufficient to proceed.

A jury trial has been scheduled for spring 2026.

            Kid Cudi, a key witness in the sex trafficking trial against hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, revealed in a new interview published Wednesday that he declined to testify twice before he was ultimately subpoenaed.
    


            “I felt I was calm. I was there because I had to be,” Cudi told host Alex Cooper in a conversation for the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.
    


            “I hated every minute of it,” Cudi added. “I did not want to do it, but then I thought about, when I was up there, I'm here to support Cassie (Ventura.)”
    


            Cudi testified in the Combs trial in May that his home was broken into and his car set on fire in 2011, around the time he had been in a relationship with Ventura.
    


            “I've always just wanted to see her thrive and do well and be happy. I know she was living a nightmare,” Cudi said of Ventura. “I just was there to support her. That's what, kind of, gave me peace with it. When I sat down in that chair, it was just about, ‘Damn, I don't want to do this' to being like ‘Oh man, I got to hold homegirl down and look out for her.'”
    


Attorney for Sean ‘Diddy' Combs confirms they've approached Trump administration about pardon



            Last month, a jury convicted Combs of two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was acquitted of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though, he will likely receive a significantly shorter sentence, according to legal analysts.
    


            A sentencing hearing is set for Oct. 3.
    


            Cudi's new book, “Cudi: The Memoir,” debuted this week. He also has an upcoming album, “Free,” set to release on August 22.

Global artificial intelligence development has reached a decisive inflection point. Since 2023, China has accelerated its AI outreach and influence, a reflection of Beijing's wider aspiration to play a leading role in shaping a new world order. AI is emerging as the driving force behind a new round of scientific revolution and industrial transformation. The central question – whether technology can create genuine, lasting value – has, in China's case, been met with a confident “yes.”

China is now not only a major engine of global AI innovation but also an indispensable architect of AI governance. Its model – low cost, high performance, and open source – offers a new paradigm for global AI development, contrasting sharply with Western approaches rooted in competitive containment and proprietary advantage.

Beijing's ambitions are not improvised. In 2017, the Chinese government issued the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, a seminal strategic document charting a course to become the global leader in AI by 2030. By that point, China's AI industry and related sectors are projected to be worth $1.4 trillion.

Beyond raw market size, AI is expected to play a decisive role in offsetting demographic and productivity headwinds, including an aging population and slowing growth rates. The strategic vision is clear: AI will be central to upgrading China's socio-economic model to a more advanced, innovation-driven stage.

China's approach rests on four critical factors: data, energy supply, computing power, and skilled labor. It already enjoys substantial advantages in three. Its enormous population generates vast quantities of data; its energy sector is rapidly expanding and diversifying; and its labor force is highly qualified, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The weakest link remains computing hardware – where Western export controls have sought to constrain China's progress – but here too Beijing is actively investing in self-reliance.

The US has contained China's AI development through export controls, blocking Beijing's access to the most advanced chips. In July 2025, the Trump administration unveiled its own AI strategy, Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan, which aims to leverage both technological superiority and policy tools to capture a larger share of the global market. The plan focuses on preserving US technological leadership and dominance rather than addressing real-world challenges or fostering economic and social development. It advocates restricting exports of American AI equipment and curbing the dissemination of Chinese AI models. The US, however, remains locked in a zero-sum mindset – pursuing the illusion that technological blockades can secure lasting AI supremacy.

China was the first country to introduce detailed, binding domestic regulations on AI. These rules form part of a mixed strategy: combining state planning with market incentives, promoting both domestic resilience and international openness. The framework underscores AI's role not just as an engine of growth but as a pillar of national modernization, societal transformation, and global engagement.

A distinctive aspect of China's vision is its redefinition of data as the “fifth factor of production,” alongside labor, capital, land, and technology. By treating data as a strategic national asset, China seeks to enable innovation across all sectors, coordinate infrastructure to avoid monopolistic control, and protect public interest and national security.

China's AI strategy extends far beyond domestic development into the realm of global governance. Since 2023, Beijing has advanced an ambitious diplomatic agenda aimed at setting international norms and frameworks for AI. The Global AI Governance Initiative (GAIGI), launched in 2023, established principles such as a human-centered approach, respect for national sovereignty, adherence to international law, and equitable sharing of AI benefits. It emphasizes open-source collaboration, data security, privacy protection, and consensus-based decision-making to avoid the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few states or corporations.

In September 2024, China unveiled the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, designed to promote interoperability, enhance global connectivity – especially for the Global South – drive tangible economic outcomes, integrate AI into education, and strengthen data security. The plan even envisions a potential global data-sharing platform. In July 2025, China followed up with the Global AI Governance Action Plan, aligning its initiatives with the United Nations' Global Digital Compact and calling for widespread adoption, harmonized standards, and environmentally sustainable development.

At the UN, Beijing has sought to anchor these efforts in formal multilateral frameworks. In July 2024, the General Assembly adopted a China-led resolution on enhancing international AI cooperation, supported by over 140 countries. Later that year, China and Zambia jointly established the Group of Friends for International Cooperation on AI Capacity-Building focused on narrowing the AI divide and strengthening the UN's role in global AI governance.

China has also created international forums to build momentum. The World AI Conference (WAIC), inaugurated in 2024, adopted the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance. The 2025 edition not only released the global action plan but also proposed the creation of a Global AI Cooperation Organization, tentatively headquartered in Shanghai. This body would focus on joint governance of AI, bridging digital and data divides, and shaping consensus-based global rules – particularly reflecting the needs and aspirations of the Global South.

While state policy sets the strategic framework, much of China's AI progress is being delivered by private enterprises. Among the country's so-called “Six Tigers” – leading AI startups – recent breakthroughs have challenged Western dominance in large language models. One standout, Z.ai, released its GLM-4-Plus model in 2024, matching the performance of OpenAI's GPT-4o. Its 2025 follow-up, GLM-4.5, not only exceeded Western benchmarks and domestic competitors like DeepSeek but did so at significantly lower cost, undermining the logic of Washington's chip restrictions. In July, Alibaba-backed Moonshot launched its Kimi K2 model, a low-cost, open-source large language model that outperformed ChatGPT in several benchmarks.

One of the most striking differences between the Chinese and Western models lies in their approach to intellectual property and access. While leading US firms often guard their technologies behind proprietary walls, China has increasingly embraced open-source frameworks – especially for foundational AI models. Domestically, this lowers entry barriers for startups and researchers; internationally, it strengthens China's appeal as a partner for developing nations.

China's model offers a vision of AI as a tool for bridging divides rather than deepening them. By aligning AI development with modernization goals, integrating it into education and industry, and promoting it through global governance frameworks, Beijing is positioning itself as both a technological and normative leader. Computing capacity remains a strategic vulnerability, and questions persist about the balance between state control and innovation freedom. Yet, the direction is clear: China's AI strategy is purposeful, coordinated, and designed for the long term.

As AI becomes a defining factor in economic competitiveness, national security, and global governance, the choices made today will shape the international order for decades. The United States continues to pursue a strategy grounded in maintaining technological dominance through restriction and exclusion. China, in contrast, presents itself as a proponent of inclusion, open-source collaboration, and multilateral governance – though always within a framework that safeguards its national interests.

Whether Beijing's approach will become the dominant global model remains to be seen. But its growing technological capabilities, diplomatic outreach, and emphasis on equitable and shared development suggest that the competition for AI leadership is no longer a foregone conclusion. The rise of models such as GLM-4.5 and Kimi K2 underscores that the AI race is not a one-horse contest – and that innovation can thrive outside Silicon Valley's orbit. In a multipolar world, the future of AI will be shaped not by a single hegemon but by a complex interplay of technological, political, and ethical choices. China's bid to make AI a bridge rather than a barrier offers one possible – and increasingly influential – path forward.

MINSK, August 12. /TASS/. The Zapad 2025 military exercise will practice planning the use of nuclear weapons and the Oreshnik missile system, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin announced after presenting a report to the republic's President Alexander Lukashenko.

""This is an important element of what is predominantly strategic deterrence. We should be ready for everything, as requested by the head of state. We can see how things stand on our western and northern borders, and we cannot be complacent about the unfolding militarization and military activities. We demonstrate our openness and peace-loving nature, but the gun powder should always be kept dry,"" BelTA news agency quoted the Belarusian defense chief as saying.

Members of the Belarusian military and their Russian counterparts will also practice planning the use of the Oreshnik missile system during the joint drills next month, he stressed.

Earlier, Lukashenko stated that ""nobody wants to use nuclear weapons."" However, he warned, his country will use ""all weapons it has at its disposal"" in response to any attack on the republic. The Oreshnik missile system which Russia promised to deploy in Belarus before the end of the year is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, too, he said. Also, he added, the deployment of nukes on Belarusian soil by Russia altered the tone of communication with the United States and other Western countries.

On March 25, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus at Minsk's request, similar to what the United States had long done on the territory of its allies. On April 25, 2024, Lukashenko confirmed that several dozen nuclear warheads had been stationed in Belarus.

Under the latest agreement on security guarantees that took effect in the Union State earlier this month, the two countries view Russian nukes as a key factor in preventing nuclear conflicts or military conflicts involving conventional arms, as well as a means of containment that can only be used as an absolute last resort.

The Russia-Belarus strategic drills dubbed Zapad 2025 will run on September 12-16 in Belarus. The joint exercise will focus on employing groups of forces for ensuring military security of the Russia-Belarus Union State. Among other maneuvers, Belarusian and Russian servicemen plan to practice repelling air strikes and fighting against enemy sabotage groups.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Veteran scientists organize response to recent energy department report while top group of advisers ‘fast-track' review of greenhouse gas evidence

Veteran climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public comment to a US Department of Energy (DOE) report which cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the climate crisis.

The report, published late last month, claimed concerns about planet-warming fossil fuels are overblown, sparking widespread concern from scientists who said it was full of climate misinformation. It came as an attempt to support a proposal from the the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to undo the “endangerment finding”, which forms the legal basis of virtually all US climate regulations.

“A public comment from experts can be useful because it injects expert analysis into a decision-making process that might otherwise be dominated by political, economic, or ideological considerations,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A&M University who is organizing the response to the report. “Experts can identify technical errors, highlight overlooked data, and clarify uncertainties in ways that improve the accuracy and robustness of the final policy or report.”

The response comes as part of a broader wave of experts' attempts to uphold established climate science as the Trump administration promotes contrarian and unproven viewpoints.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), the country's top group of scientific advisers, has launched a “fast-track” review of the latest evidence on how greenhouse gases threaten human health and wellbeing – a move announced following the proposed endangerment finding rollback.

NASEM, which advises the EPA and other federal agencies, plans to release their findings in September, in time to inform the EPA's decision on the endangerment finding. The initiative will be self-funded by the organization – a highly unusual practice from the congressionally chartered group, which usually responds to federal bodies' calls for advice.

“It is critical that federal policymaking is informed by the best available scientific evidence,” said Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, in a statement.

Trump administration efforts to block access to data have also inspired pushback. This month, the president ousted the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after baselessly saying the data it publishes is “RIGGED”.

In earlier weeks, federal officials have also deleted key climate data and reports such as the national climate assessments and the US Global Change Research Program from government websites. The administration has changed 70% more of the information on official environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, according to a report the research group Environmental Data and Governance Initiative published last week.

In light of these actions, research organizations such as the Public Environmental Data Project and Cornerstone Sustainability Data Initiative have worked to safeguard and publicize data that the federal government is hiding from the public.

“Attacks on science are dangerous because they erode one of society's most effective tools for understanding the world and making decisions in the public interest,” said Dessler. “When political or ideological forces undermine scientific institutions or discredit experts, they weaken our ability to harness this powerful tool.”

Asked for comment about the NASEM review, an EPA spokesperson repeated a comment offered earlier this month: “Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to set emission standards for cars if the EPA administrator determines that their emissions endanger public health or welfare. That includes greenhouse gas emissions, due to the endangerment finding.

Asked for comment on the DOE report supporting the EPA's position, Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich also repeated an earlier comment. “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous Presidential administrations,” he said.

The UN and the US have regularly convened top scientists to produce scientific climate reports, which warn that urgent action to curb emissions is needed.

Dietderich also said officials “look forward to engaging with substantive comments” on the report.

However, “the real question is whether they'll listen to us,” said Dessler.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

On November 9, 2023, just over one month into Israel's genocide in Gaza, a group of U.S.-based journalists published an open letter. “We stand with our colleagues in Gaza and herald their brave efforts at reporting in the midst of carnage and destruction,” the letter's authors wrote. “We also hold Western newsrooms accountable for dehumanizing rhetoric that has served to justify ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.” 

Signed by 1,200 journalists in the first week of its publication, the letter called on reporters to “use precise terms” and “tell the full truth without fear or favor” — in other words, to do exactly what reporters are supposed to do. Instead, many Western newsrooms bristled at the demand for basic moral clarity and journalistic ethics. Coverage of employer backlash against the letter's signatories quickly drowned out the contents of the letter itself. Facing disciplinary action, staff at The Associated Press, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and other major media outlets requested their signatures be removed; the Los Angeles Times banned staff who signed the letter from covering Gaza for at least three months. 

At the time of the letter's publication, Israel's four-week siege had killed at least 36 Palestinian journalists. As of August 11, 2025, that death toll has ballooned to more than 270 — and more journalists have been murdered in Gaza than in the U.S. Civil War, both world wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan combined. Still, the widespread (and sometimes targeted) slaughter of their Palestinian colleagues has been unable to shake Western journalists from their cowardice. Hiding behind a mask of spurious objectivity, major outlets continue to shy away from words like “genocide” and “apartheid” while giving credence to the Israeli military's oft-debunked talking points. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Twenty-two months into Israel's dizzying, relentless assault on Gaza, it is easy to lose track of how much the goalposts have shifted. At the start of the genocide, Israel vehemently denied targeting journalists at all, despite ample evidence to the contrary. This week, Israel admitted to assassinating Anas al-Sharif, a 28-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter widely celebrated as “the voice of Gaza.” A targeted Israeli airstrike killed al-Sharif and five Al Jazeera staff and freelance colleagues while they were sheltering at a tent for journalists outside Al-Shifa Hospital.

Hiding behind a mask of spurious objectivity, major outlets continue to shy away from words like “genocide” and “apartheid” while giving credence to the Israeli military's oft-debunked talking points.

Israeli officials claim, without providing evidence, that al-Sharif was a Hamas leader and therefore a legitimate military target. (No explanation was offered for the deaths of the rest of the Al Jazeera crew.) But Israel levies baseless accusations so often that credulously reporting such claims would be journalistic malpractice: If one were to believe the Israeli military's accounting, throw a rock five feet into Gaza and you might hit a Hamas leader. The Jabalia refugee camp, destroyed by Israeli forces in late 2023? Israel claims it is a “Hamas stronghold.” The Al-Tabaeen school-turned-shelter, massacred in August 2024? “Hamas headquarters.” The Al-Shifa Hospital, raided in November 2023, and again in November 2024? “Hamas command center.” When the Israeli military gave 1.1 million Palestinians 24 hours to evacuate northern Gaza in October 2023, it said it was necessary to eradicate the Hamas members hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza City. Then, when Israel attacked the southern Gazan city of Rafah, it claimed it would eliminate Hamas's last remaining military battalions. Hamas does not operate in the occupied West Bank, but since October 7, 2023, the Israeli military and settlers have killed at least 964 Palestinians there. The Israeli military has also expelled residents from refugee camps in the territory, installed checkpoints and roadblocks, and destroyed civilian homes and infrastructure. And even though Israel has already succeeded in killing Hamas's key leaders — including Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, as well as top Hezbollah officials like Ibrahim Aqil in Lebanon — the siege on Gaza continues. 

In October 2023, Western media spent weeks debating whether a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City was caused by an Israeli airstrike or a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The furor over the one hospital blast looks quaint in hindsight: In 2025, only 19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals remain operational and 94 percent have been damaged or destroyed after Israeli attacks.

As a Western journalist, I am ashamed to see my media colleagues engage in war crime apologia. The Israeli military directly threatened al-Sharif's life for over a year: In November 2023, he reported receiving multiple phone calls from army officers instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza; shortly after, al-Sharif's 90-year-old father was killed in an Israeli airstrike on their family home. This past October, Israel published a list of six Al Jazeera journalists, including al-Sharif, and accused them of having ties to militant groups. In July, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called for al-Sharif's protection, expressing concerns that the Israeli military's public threats could be a precursor to the journalist's assassination.

Despite the documented Israeli smear campaign, following al-Sharif's assassination, Western news outlets have uncritically amplified Israel's claims that Al Jazeera is a Hamas mouthpiece. A BBC presenter questioned whether al-Sharif was truly operating as an independent journalist, since Israel has banned international news outlets from entering Gaza. The racist line of argument obfuscates the fact that it's Israel's responsibility not to suppress the press. And if Israel's ban on international journalists de facto discredits all of Gaza's remaining reporters — by necessity, Palestinians — how can the people of Gaza expect to have a voice? Israel is able to legitimize its assault by proliferating propaganda to the West, and for nearly two years, Palestinian journalists have worked bravely and diligently to share the truth of what's happening with the world. (Let us not forget, too, that in 2021, years before Hamas's October 7 attack, Israel destroyed the Gaza building housing both The Associated Press and Al Jazeera offices.)

Israeli officials have been clear from the beginning that their military goals in the region are not limited to the return of the hostages taken on October 7, but the total expulsion of Hamas, and, for some members of the Israeli parliament, Israel's takeover of Gaza. “Erase Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us,” said Israeli Knesset Deputy Speaker Nissim Vaturi on October 9, 2023. Now, nearly two years later, Israel's security cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for the occupation of Gaza City, claiming it is the only way to defeat Hamas. It is notable that, ahead of the planned offensive, Israel wiped out al-Sharif along with Al Jazeera's entire Gaza City crew.

“It is no coincidence that the smears against al-Sharif — who has reported night and day for Al Jazeera since the start of the war — surfaced every time he reported on a major development in the war,” CPJ's Regional Director Sara Qudah said in a statement. “Israel is murdering the messengers.” 

Since the journalists' open letter was first published in November 2023, it has only become more painfully obvious that Israel is engaging in a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Western outlets should have been clear-eyed about this from the beginning. There is no pleasure, however, in this type of vindication. I feel only a deep admiration for the Palestinian journalists who continue to share their message with the world in the face of horrific violence and destruction. 

After an Israeli airstrike killed Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul in July 2024, Palestinian journalists, including al-Sharif, were filmed throwing their press flak jackets to the ground. Now that al-Sharif has been killed, too, I find myself returning to his words from that time.

“This press vest is the vest the global and local institutions preach about. This vest did not protect our colleague Ismail. Nor did it protect any of my colleagues,” said al-Sharif. “What did Ismail do? What did he do? Broadcast the image? Broadcast the suffering of people? Sorry Ismail, we will continue sharing the message after you.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

US President Donald Trump has reportedly told Western European leaders that he wants to reach a ceasefire deal in the Ukraine conflict at his upcoming meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, according to France's Emmanuel Macron.

A video conference was held between Trump and the leaders of Germany, Finland, France, the UK, Italy, Poland, EU officials and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky on Wednesday. The virtual meeting was devoted to discussions of Trump's summit with Putin in Alaska scheduled for Friday.

Speaking to reporters after the call, Macron stated that the US president had indicated that he intends to “obtain a ceasefire in Ukraine during the meeting with Putin.” Trump also assured the Europeans that any discussions on territorial issues relating to Ukraine would be negotiated with Kiev at the table.

Macron said that Trump will push for a future trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky during the Alaska summit. The meeting could take place in Europe, according to the French president.

Previously, when announcing the summit with Putin, Trump suggested that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would have to include some sort of land swap. Zelensky has rejected the notion of recognizing Russia sovereignty over any of the territories claimed by Kiev, citing limitations imposed by Ukraine's constitution.

During a separate press briefing following Wednesday's video conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Western European leaders and Trump had agreed to put more “pressure” on Putin if no progress towards a peace deal is made in Alaska.

Russia has repeatedly stated that it is open to peaceful resolution, but has stressed that any deal would have to address the roots of the conflict and respect the realities on the ground. This includes the status of former Ukrainian territories that have joined Russia after holding public referendums.

Moscow has said that it expects a positive outcome of Friday's summit between Trump and Putin, adding that it sees the meeting as a chance to mend strained relations and move forward on long-standing issues.

Trump has also said that he expects the summit to be a “feel-out meeting” to determine whether the Ukraine conflict can be settled.

High-profile Western lawyers have joined the defense team of the jailed Euroskeptic head of Moldova's autonomous Gagauzia region, Evgenia Gutsul, who was sentenced to seven years in prison for alleged financial crimes that she claims are politically motivated. 

Paris-based law firm WJ Avocats and prominent Spanish lawyer Gonzalo Boye have been appointed to Gutsul's international defense team, according to a statement on Wednesday by WJ Avocats' founding partner William Julie. 

WJ Avocats specializes in international criminal defense and human rights, while Boye has taken on high-profile cases such as efforts to charge George W. Bush officials over the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo and the defense of former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont from extradition. They will work with Gutsul's local lawyers. Boye has called the case “very worrying.” 

Gutsul was sentenced last week by a Chisinau court for allegedly financing the now-banned Euroskeptic SOR party – a charge she insists is part of a broader effort to silence dissent ahead of elections. She denounced the verdict as a politically motivated crackdown, calling it “a blow to democracy” and a threat to anyone challenging the country's pro-Western leadership. 

Gutsul has led the predominantly Russian-speaking Gagauzia region since winning the 2023 election as the candidate from SOR, campaigning for closer ties with Russia in contrast to the pro-Western stance of President Maia Sandu's government. The party was banned the same year on allegations of illicit financing from abroad.

Julie said Gutsul has faced political attacks since taking office, calling the case another attempt to “silence and remove” her from politics. He said her international legal team will work to defend her “fundamental rights and the rule of law.” 

Russia has condemned what it described as a crackdown by the Moldovan government on Gutsul, calling it an example of “European anti-values in action” and a bid to pressure the opposition ahead of the country's September parliamentary election. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the ruling marked the “culmination of repression by the Chisinau regime against the entire Gagauz autonomy.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Scientists rush to bolster climate finding Trump administration aims to undo","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/climate-science-trump-administration","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Some experts tee up public comment on EPA report calling fossil fuel concerns overblown, as others fast-track review

Veteran climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public comment to a US Department of Energy (DOE) report that cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the climate crisis.

The report, published late last month, claimed concerns about planet-warming fossil fuels are overblown, sparking widespread concern from scientists who said it was full of climate misinformation; it was an attempt to support a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to undo the “endangerment finding”, which forms the legal basis of virtually all US climate regulations.

“A public comment from experts can be useful because it injects expert analysis into a decision-making process that might otherwise be dominated by political, economic, or ideological considerations,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A&M University who is organizing the response to the report. “Experts can identify technical errors, highlight overlooked data, and clarify uncertainties in ways that improve the accuracy and robustness of the final policy or report.”

The response comes as part of a broader wave of experts' attempts to uphold established climate science as the Trump administration promotes contrarian and unproven viewpoints.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (Nasem), the country's top group of scientific advisers, has launched a “fast-track” review of the latest evidence on how greenhouse gases threaten human health and wellbeing – a move announced following the proposed endangerment-finding rollback.

Nasem, which advises the EPA and other federal agencies, plans to release their findings in September, in time to inform the EPA's decision on the endangerment finding. The initiative will be self-funded by the organization – a highly unusual practice from the congressionally chartered group, which usually responds to federal bodies' calls for advice.

“It is critical that federal policymaking is informed by the best available scientific evidence,” said Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, in a statement.

Trump administration efforts to block access to data have also inspired pushback. This month, the president ousted the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after baselessly saying the data it publishes is “rigged”.

In earlier weeks, federal officials have also deleted key climate data and reports such as the national climate assessments and the US Global Change Research Program from government websites. The administration has changed 70% more of the information on official environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, according to a report the research group Environmental Data and Governance Initiative published last week.

In light of these actions, research organizations such as the Public Environmental Data Project and Cornerstone Sustainability Data Initiative have worked to safeguard and publicize data that the federal government is hiding from the public.

“Attacks on science are dangerous because they erode one of society's most effective tools for understanding the world and making decisions in the public interest,” said Dessler. “When political or ideological forces undermine scientific institutions or discredit experts, they weaken our ability to harness this powerful tool.”

Asked for comment about the Nasem review, an EPA spokesperson repeated a comment offered earlier this month: “Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to set emission standards for cars if the EPA administrator determines that their emissions endanger public health or welfare. That includes greenhouse gas emissions, due to the endangerment finding.

Asked for comment on the DOE report supporting the EPA's position, Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich also repeated an earlier comment. “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous presidential administrations,” he said.

The UN and the US have regularly convened top scientists to produce scientific climate reports, which warn that urgent action to curb emissions is needed.

Dietderich also said officials “look forward to engaging with substantive comments” on the report.

However, “the real question is whether they'll listen to us”, said Dessler.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Trump alone in a room with Putin is a recipe for disaster","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/13/trump-putin-meeting-alaska","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:03:00 GMT","

The two plan to meet behind closed doors Friday in Alaska to discuss ‘land swapping'. What will happen this time?

The lessons of Helsinki are clear: putting Donald Trump alone in a room with Vladimir Putin is an unpredictable – and often dangerous – affair.

It was 2018 when the two leaders met at the invitation of Sauli Niinistö, the Finnish president, to discuss a collapse in US-Russia relations, accusations of elections interference, and the grinding war in east Ukraine, among other topics.

By the time he came out of the room, Trump looked dazzled by the Kremlin leader. Asked at a press conference about the conclusions of the US intelligence community that Russia had interfered in the elections, Trump said: “President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.”

Fiona Hill, Trump's senior Kremlin adviser on the US national security council, later said that she had considered pulling a fire alarm or faking a medical emergency to end the press conference.

Somehow, the stakes are even higher as Trump and Putin plan to meet on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, where Trump has said the two will discuss “land swapping” in Putin's first meeting with a G7 leader since his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. European leaders are fearful that Trump could once again emerge from a closed-door meeting preaching the Kremlin gospel.

The White House has been lowering expectations for the summit – a sign that no concrete deal is on the table. “This is really a feel-out meeting, a little bit,” Trump said during a news conference on Monday. He said he would know within the first few minutes whether or not Putin was ready for a ceasefire and would pass that on to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. “I may say, ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting.' Or I may say, ‘We can make a deal,'” he said.

But Putin will still try his luck to shape Trump's image of what a peace deal could entail in a way that will bring maximum benefit to the Kremlin. Putin “wants a deal with Trump that will be presented to Kyiv and other European capitals as a fait accompli,” wrote John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former ambassador to Ukraine. The lack of invites for European leaders “has the smell of the Yalta Conference in 1945 … where the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom decided the fate of half of Europe over the heads of those nations”.

Europe and Ukraine have pushed back. Ahead of the summit, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would not cede Russia territory that it could use to launch a new offensive, effectively ruling out Trump's predictions that “there will be some [land] swapping”.

The ad-hoc nature of Trump's approach to foreign policy can play into the hands of the US's foreign adversaries – but it has frustrated them too. Leaders such as Xi Jinping, the president of China, are said to prefer more advance work before getting into the room with Trump specifically because of his unpredictability. Russia too has become frustrated with the lack of process in the Trump administration.

But that has not stopped Putin from taking his chances by stepping into the ring with Trump for their first one-on-one meeting of this administration.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the meeting between Trump and Putin would be one-on-one, and a “listening exercise” for Trump during which he could suss out the Russian point of view.

“That's the way Trump does it. He just wings it,” said Hill, the former presidential aide.

“And Putin likes sparring … he prides himself on being able to be light on his feet in these kinds of settings,” she said.

The lack of advisers in the room has raised a key question: will any agreements made in a private setting, even if interpreters or other notetakers are present, lead to lasting outcomes?

“It's kind of like a meeting falling in the forest,” said Hill.

A similar event took place during the Helsinki summit, when Trump exited the room and said that he had made an agreement with Putin for US law enforcement to have access to the GRU operatives accused of influencing the US elections. Putin later said in turn that he would have access to Americans responsible for pushing for the anti-corruption Magnitsky Act.

“Of course, that went nowhere,” Hill said. “Trump hadn't fully understood what Putin had said to him.”

“In other words, you know, there is a meeting or something, it doesn't solidify into something,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The union issued a strike notice on Tuesday after it submitted a counter proposal on wages that Air Canada did not respond to, says CUPE spokesperson Hugh Pouliot.Arlyn McAdorey/The Canadian Press

Air Canada AC-T will begin cancelling flights on Thursday ahead of a planned nationwide strike of flight attendants, after talks between the union representing them and the carrier broke down late Monday evening. 

The Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) issued a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday morning, meaning that more than 10,000 flight attendants at Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge could go on strike starting Saturday.

Air Canada said that in order to manage the uncertainty ahead of a heavy travel period, the first flights will be cancelled on Thursday, with more on Friday, and a complete suspension of all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations on Saturday if a deal between both sides is not reached by then. 

Explainer: Air Canada starts cancelling flights ahead of possible flight attendant strike. Here's what you need to know

Customers whose flights are cancelled will be notified, and will be eligible for a full refund, the airline said in a statement. 

Air Canada has requested that the federal government intervene in the labour dispute by directing the Canada Industrial Relations Board to impose binding arbitration, which would force both sides to settle on a new contract. 

But Ottawa has so far been reluctant to step in. In a statement issued late Tuesday evening, Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said that both parties should stay at the table until a deal is reached. “The best agreements are the ones the parties reach themselves,” she said. 

CUPE spokesperson Hugh Pouliot said that the union had submitted a counterproposal on wages on Tuesday evening, but Air Canada did not respond, forcing the union to issue a strike notice. Air Canada subsequently issued a lockout notice to staff, which would take effect at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday if a deal is not reached. 

Earlier: Air Canada labour talks break down hours before strike notice deadline

“We are still at the bargaining table. We are just waiting for Air Canada to respond,” Mr. Pouliot told the Globe. 

Air Canada did not respond to queries from The Globe and Mail about the state of negotiations. 

CUPE flight attendants delivered one of the strongest strike mandates in recent Canadian labour history, with 99.7 per cent voting in favour of a strike and 94.6 per cent of more than 10,000 members turning out to vote.

Wages are at the crux of the dispute between Air Canada and CUPE. 

The airline is offering a compounded wage bump of 17.2 per cent over the next four years (8 per cent in year one, followed by 3 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 2.75 per cent). The union argues that the cumulative wage increase does not come close to matching inflation over the last 10 years. 

Air Canada flight attendants last negotiated a contract in 2015. The compounded rate of inflation in Canada from 2015 to 2025 is almost 28 per cent.

The other key point of contention between both sides is unpaid work. The union is attempting to restructure compensation so that flight attendants get paid for the duration of their shift. Currently, they are compensated at an hourly rate from the time the plane takes off to the point where it lands, but are not paid during boarding safety checks and deplaning. CUPE is demanding that Air Canada start paying flight attendants for the work they do on the ground prior to departure and after landing. 

Compensating flight attendants for merely the duration of in-flight work has been an industry-wide practice for decades. But an increase in flight delays that emerged in the wake of the pandemic meant more time on the tarmac for flight attendants, with no compensation.

“The postpandemic environment for flight attendants has become increasingly exploitative because they are not being paid for ground time,” said Steven Tufts, a labour expert at York University. 

Prof. Tufts said that CUPE's push to restructure the compensation system for flight attendants is part of a broader global movement among airline unions for flight attendants to start being paid for the entirety of their shift. 

“If Air Canada does agree to change the terms of compensation, you'll likely see Air Transat and WestJet flight attendants get paid similarly. And that will spill over into the larger American airlines,” he added. 

In 2022, in an attempt to dissuade flight attendants from unionizing, Delta Air Lines started paying flight attendants at half their hourly rate for 40 to 50 minutes of boarding time. Porter Airlines also started compensating flight attendants for portions of their pre-departure work this year. 

Shanyn Elliott, a flight attendant who has worked for Air Canada Rouge since 2017, said that her pre-departure work is crucial because it involves safety briefings with the pilot and a check of safety equipment at each seat on the plane. “We also assist passengers with disabilities, help people find their seats, grab water for passengers – the entire time we are not getting paid.” she said. 

Ms. Elliott also said that flight attendants vie to get assigned what they term “productive turns,” which are shifts that have longer in-air flight times because it means they are paid more on an hourly basis if the entirety of their shift is considered. “If I do a Toronto-Montreal return trip, I'm only in the air for maybe two hours, but my total time working might be six hours. How is it fair that I only get paid for two hours?” 

According to the union, flight attendants work an average of 35 hours per month for free, almost a week's worth of pay. The union also said Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants work an average of 80 flight hours in a month. “If you factor in the total time worked, you're essentially earning less than federal minimum wage if you're a junior flight attendant,” said Mr. Pouliot, the CUPE spokesperson.

A backgrounder on Air Canada's website detailing flight attendant compensation states that the starting salary for a flight attendant hired in 2015 was $25.13 an hour. If the flight attendant continued working in the same position for a decade, their current pay would be $63.07 an hour – a 150-per-cent increase. The document also states that half of Air Canada's flight attendants earned more than $54,000 in 2024, excluding incentive rewards, and health and pension benefits.


The union representing around 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants could go on strike as early as Aug. 16 after negotiations between the two sides reached an impasse, and the company has already begun to cancel flights.

South Sudan is not in talks with Israel to resettle Palestinians from war-torn Gaza, South Sudan's foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the Associated Press, citing six people with knowledge of the matter, reported that Israel was holding discussions with Juba to resettle Palestinians from Gaza in the East African nation.

“These claims are baseless and do not reflect the official position or policy of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan,” South Sudan's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.

Israel's military has pounded Gaza City in recent days prior to its planned takeover of the shattered enclave, which is home to more than two million Palestinians.

In a Gazan refugee camp, Netanyahu's plans to expand war prompt fear, anger and many questions

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday reiterated a view – also enthusiastically floated by U.S. President Donald Trump – that Palestinians should simply leave Gaza.

Many world leaders are horrified at the idea of displacing the Gaza population, which Palestinians say would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe), when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.

In March, Somalia and its breakaway region of Somaliland also denied receiving any proposal from the United States or Israel to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, with Mogadishu saying it categorically rejected any such move.

South Sudan's Foreign Minister Monday Semaya Kumba visited Israel last month and met with Netanyahu, according to the foreign ministry in Juba.

Last month South Sudan's government confirmed that eight migrants deported to the African nation by the Trump administration were currently in the care of the authorities in Juba after they lost a legal battle to halt their transfer.

Since achieving independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has spent nearly half its life at war and is currently in the grip of a political crisis, after President Salva Kiir's government ordered the arrest of Vice President Riek Machar in March.

Israel's military pounded Gaza City on Wednesday prior to a planned takeover, with another 123 people killed in the last day, according to the Gaza health ministry, while militant group Hamas held further talks with Egyptian mediators.

The 24-hour death toll was the worst in a week and added to the massive fatalities from the nearly two-year war that has shattered the enclave housing more than two million Palestinians.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated an idea – also enthusiastically floated by U.S. President Donald Trump – that Palestinians should simply leave.

“They're not being pushed out, they'll be allowed to exit,” he told Israeli television channel i24NEWS. “All those who are concerned for the Palestinians and say they want to help the Palestinians should open their gates and stop lecturing us.”

Arabs and many world leaders are aghast at the idea of displacing the Gaza population, which Palestinians say would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe), when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out during a 1948 war.

Explainer: What to know about Israel's plan to take Gaza City

Israel denies UN reports of sexual violence by its military against detained Palestinians

Israel's planned reseizure of Gaza City – which it took in the early days of the war before withdrawing – is probably weeks away, officials say. That means a ceasefire is still possible though talks have been floundering and conflict still rages.

Israeli planes and tanks bombed eastern areas of Gaza City heavily, residents said, with many homes destroyed in the Zeitoun and Shejaia neighbourhoods overnight. Al-Ahli hospital said 12 people were killed in an air strike on a home in Zeitoun.

Tanks also destroyed several houses in the east of Khan Younis in south Gaza too, while in the centre Israeli gunfire killed nine aid-seekers in two separate incidents, Palestinian medics said. Israel's military did not comment.

Eight more people, including three children, have died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the territory's health ministry said. That took the total to 235, including 106 children, since the war began.

Israel disputes those malnutrition and hunger figures reported by the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.

In makeshift tents and vans converted into mobile newsrooms, Palestinian journalists remain on the front lines with their cameras set up and ready to document the daily struggles of Israel's war on Gaza.

Reuters

Hamas chief negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya's meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Wednesday were to focus on stopping the war, delivering aid and “ending the suffering of our people in Gaza,” Hamas official Taher al-Nono said in a statement.

Egyptian security sources said the talks would also discuss the possibility of a comprehensive ceasefire that would see Hamas relinquish governance in Gaza and concede its weapons.

A Hamas official told Reuters the group was open to all ideas if Israel ends the war and pulls out. However, “Laying down arms before the occupation is dismissed is impossible,” the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.

Netanyahu's plan to expand military control over Gaza, which Israeli sources said could be launched in October, has heightened global outcry over the widespread devastation, displacement and hunger in the enclave.

Analysis: Movement to recognize Palestinian statehood reflects Israel's growing isolation

Twenty-four nations this week decried the “unimaginable levels” of suffering and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid.

Israel accuses Hamas of stealing aid and says it has taken steps to increase supplies, including daily combat pauses in some areas and protected routes for convoys.

The Israeli military on Wednesday said that nearly 320 trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings and that a further nearly 320 trucks were collected and distributed by the U.N. and international organizations in the past 24 hours along with three tankers of fuel and 97 pallets of air-dropped aid.

But the U.N. and Palestinians say aid remains far from sufficient.

The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli figures. Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza since then has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once, rather than in phases.

The Associated Press

Arab states and much of the international community want post-war Gaza to be governed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited governance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

The authority's foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, told reporters it was ready to assume full responsibility in Gaza. Hamas would have no role and be required to hand over arms, she added, calling for an international peacekeeping force and withdrawal by Israel.

Hamas says it is ready to quit Gaza governance for a non-partisan technocratic entity agreed by all Palestinian parties.

Israel says it does not trust the PA to rule Gaza.

Michael Crawford has been honoured by Donald Trump for his contribution to American culture.

The US president named Crawford, 85, as a Kennedy Centre honouree on Wednesday in a ceremony at the Kennedy Centre in Washington, DC.

Crawford, whose career spans between stage, film and television, rose to national acclaim for his portrayal of Frank Spencer in the 1970s sitcom Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em, with his catchphrase “Ooh, Betty!” becoming a cultural hallmark.

The actor's performance as the titular character in the original production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera also earned him an Olivier and a Tony Award.

The Kennedy Centre Honours are considered one of the most prestigious prizes in the American performing arts. Winners are awarded a ceremonial medallion which symbolises symbolises lifetime artistic achievement.

Notable past honourees include Aretha Franklin, Bono, Meryl Streep, and Paul McCartney.

During the ceremony on Wednesday, Mr Trump also nominated George Strait, Gloria Gaynor, Sylvester Stallone, and the rock band KISS for this year's award.

Crawford and the other honourees will now be asked if they will accept their medals, which Mr Trump revealed he will present in person.

While announcing Crawford's nomination, the president described the British actor as a “generational talent” and an “international sensation”.

“He's one of the greatest talents I think I have ever actually seen... I'll say among the greatest artists in the world are the Broadway-London actors... all they want to do is be on the live stage.”

Mr Trump said he was “there” for Crawford's 1967 Broadway debut in Black Comedy and lauded him as “very special” with “unbelievable talents”.

“One of the greatest ever...you don't see them like that very often,” Mr Trump said, adding that Crawford “had a voice that was unbelievable”.

Mr Trump sparked outrage in February by purging the Kennedy Centre of its board members and appointing himself chairman.

He has since sought to exert his authority over America's premier cultural institution, appointing colleagues to leadership positions and condemning its recent shows as “woke” and “terrible”.

The president was booed when he appeared for his first appearance at the centre since taking over in June, for the opening night of Les Misérables.

Mr Trump's decision to host this year's awards marks a break from tradition. “I didn't want to do it,” he said, claiming Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, insisted he present the ceremony.

The event, which usually takes place in December, is normally hosted by past honourees or notable artistic figures. Previous hosts have included Leonard Bernstein and Walter Cronkite.

Mr Trump has also repeatedly flirted with changing the name of the centre, with some in the president's circle recently suggesting it should be renamed to honour Melania Trump.

Speaking about the awards on Truth Social, Mr Trump wrote: “Great nominees for the Trump/Kennedy Centre whoops, I mean, Kennedy Centre, awards.”

He added that under his leadership, the Kennedy Centre would be brought “back to the absolute top leve of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.”

An investigation conducted by Sen. Jon Ossoff's office (D-Georgia) has revealed rampant human rights violations committed against immigrants in detention in the first six months of President Donald Trump's second term, including dozens of incidents involving the mistreatment of children and pregnant women. 

Of the 510 credible reports of human rights abuses uncovered by the investigation, Ossoff's office identified 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in immigration detention, 14 reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 reports of mistreatment of children. 

During the senator's monthslong investigation, which began in January, Ossoff's staff “interviewed and received credible reports of abuse from dozens of witnesses and sources, including correctional staff, law enforcement officials, attorneys, detainees and their family members, doctors, and nurses.”

They spoke with 46 people in detention and conducted numerous site visits, although “obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees.” 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called the report “garbage” and denied the allegations of abuse. Ossoff said DHS's response is “absurd.”

“For DHS to immediately issue a blanket denial without any due-diligence or investigations of these credible reports of human rights abuses in U.S. facilities, is absurd,” Ossoff said. “It suggests they don't take seriously their obligation to investigate credible reports of human rights abuses in their facilities.”

The senator's investigation reported on several incidents that involved the mistreatment of children. In one case, a child, who is a U.S. citizen, was hospitalized three times while detained with her mother.

“[W]hen the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report says. “A CBP guard reportedly responded, ‘Just give the girl a cracker.'” 

In another case, a family was arrested and detained on their way to an emergency medical appointment for their daughter who was recovering from brain surgery. The government also deported a 4-year-old who was receiving treatment for kidney cancer. In April, immigration officers abducted the child and his sister, who are both U.S. citizens, along with their mother when they arrived for an immigration appointment. Within 24 hours, they were deported to Honduras. 

Ossoff's office identified more than a dozen credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women detained by DHS. They have been denied adequate medical care and timely checkups, as well as sufficient meals and snacks, according to the investigation. One anonymous agency official reported “seeing pregnant women sleeping on floors in overcrowded intake cells.” 

A partner of a pregnant woman in DHS custody relayed their horrific experience to Ossoff's office. The woman bled for days before she was taken to the hospital, where “she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.” DHS denied reports of pregnant women sleeping on the floor without providing evidence and insisted that detention of pregnant women is “rare.”  

Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, told NBC News that she met with the woman, who was 23 years old and had been living in Georgia. The woman told Yoon that she had experienced and witnessed “terrible conditions,” including, NBC News reported, “overcrowding, people forced to sleep on the floor, inadequate access to nutrition and medical care, as well as abusive treatment by the guards, lack of information about their case and limited ability to contact their loved ones and legal support.” 

The senator's investigation also uncovered numerous allegations of physical and sexual abuse against immigrants. At the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas, staff slammed a man's head in the ground and handcuffed him for stepping out of line in the dining hall, according to the man's attorneys. At another lockup, staff reportedly forced at least seven people into “stress positions” to punish them for “laughing and conversing.” 

There were at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California “referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults,” and at least four emergency calls from the South Texas ICE Processing Center referenced sexual abuse. The private prison company GEO Group owns both lockups. 

Victims held at Miami's Federal Detention Center, which is run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), said they were held in a “small room” for “hours on end,” with just one toilet, and no access to food or water, according to the report. Pursuant to an agreement between DHS and BOP), which runs the federal prison system, immigrants can be detained in BOP's prisons if DHS lockups are full. “Regardless of our views on immigration policy, the American people do not support the abuse of detainees and prisoners,” Ossoff told NBC News. “It's more important than ever to shine a light on what's happening behind bars and barbed wire, especially and most shockingly to children.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            A permit to climb the world's tallest mountain costs an eye-popping $15,000 — and that's before you add in the price of airfare, gear and a guide.
    


            But Nepal, which has long sought to diversify its tourism offerings beyond showpiece Mount Everest, has come up with a new plan to attract travelers to less expensive, less visited regions of the country.
    


            The government announced it's opening up 97 peaks in Karnali and Sudurpaschim, two states in far western Nepal, to international climbers for free.
    


            “There are so many mountains (in Nepal),” Himal Gautam, a director in the Nepal Tourism Department, told CNN.
    


            “Until now the government of Nepal has opened 462 mountains for commercial expedition. Out of them 102 mountains are still virgin, they are waiting for the first climbers.” He did not specify exactly which mountains are unclimbed.
    


            Gautam added that due to the region's remoteness and poverty, “those mountains have not been marketed properly.”
    


            Karnali and Sudurpaschim border the Indian state of Uttarakhand on one side and China's Tibet region on the other.
    


            Gautam said that permits to climb these Himalayan peaks will be free for the next two climbing seasons. After that, the government will re-evaluate the plan. Seventy-seven of the mountains are in Karnali, and the other 20 are in Sudurpaschim.
    


            “The government of Nepal wants to disseminate to the global mountaineering community that so many alluring and worth-climbing mountains are located in those two provinces. And there are many more other touristic destinations (there),” said Gautam.
    


            Getting travelers to these areas isn't easy. Sudurpaschim is 535 kilometers (330 miles) from Kathmandu, and Karnali is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) away. Both require three-hour flights from the capital. Once in Sudurpaschim and Karnali, roads are challenging and amenities sparse.
    


Mount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world's tallest mountain



            Tourism is big business in Nepal.
    


            The country welcomed 1.15 million international tourists in 2024, and the tourism industry employs more than one million Nepalis.
    


            Overcrowding at the world's tallest mountain has caused increasing problems in recent decades. As a result, Nepal — which is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks — has made efforts to crack down on the number of unprepared climbers on Everest while redirecting tourists to other parts of the country.
    


            The price of climbing permits went up 36% earlier this year, up from $11,000. And now, would-be Everest climbers must show proof that they have previously scaled at least one 7,000-meter-plus mountain in Nepal.
    


            Several of the mountains on the new free-to-climb list fit the bill, offering an opportunity to practice, explore and set records.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As a wary Washington waited, the White House promised a ramp-up of National Guard troops and federal officers on the streets of the nation's capital around the clock starting Wednesday, days after President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the city's police department for at least a month. 

The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an “authoritarian push” at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix — even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. 

For two days, small groups of federal officers have been visible in scattered areas of the city. That is about to change, the administration says.

A “significantly higher” presence of guard members was expected Wednesday night, and federal agents will be out during the day as well as at night, according to the White House. Hundreds of federal law enforcement and city police officers who patrolled the streets Tuesday night made 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before.

In one neighborhood, officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI could be seen along with the U.S. Park Police searching the car of a motorist parked just outside a legal parking area to eat takeout and drop off a friend. Two blocks away, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers gathered in a parking lot before driving off on patrol. 




In other parts of the city, including those with popular nightlife hot spots, federal patrols were harder to find. At the National Mall, there was little law enforcement activity aside from Park Police cruisers pulling over a taxi driver near the Washington Monument.

Unlike in other U.S. states and cities, the law gives Trump the power to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days. Extending his power over the city for longer would require approval from Congress, and that could be tough in the face of Democratic resistance. 

Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. “We're gonna do this very quickly. But we're gonna want extensions. I don't want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,” he said.

The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. Seven illegal firearms were seized. 

There have now been more than 100 arrests since Trump began beefing up the federal law enforcement presence in Washington last week, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital,” she said. 

The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As many as 800 troops were expected to be mobilized in a support role to law enforcement, though exactly what form remains to be determined.

The push also includes clearing out encampments for people who are homeless, Trump has said. U.S. Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March, and plan to take out two more this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said. People are offered the chance to go to shelters and get addiction treatment, if needed, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, she said. 

City officials said they are making more shelter space available and increasing their outreach. 

The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. since an increase during the coronavirus pandemic. 

On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb.

Police Chief Pamela Smith said during an interview with the local Fox affiliate that the city's Metro Police Department has been down nearly 800 officers. She said the increased number of federal agents on the streets would help fill that gap, at least for now. 

Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, “I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too.” 

She had previously called Trump's moves “unsettling and unprecedented” while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state.

For some residents, the increased presence of law enforcement and National Guard troops is nerve-racking. 

“I've seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,” Washington native Sheina Taylor said. “It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American.”

President Donald Trump says homeless people in the nation's capital will be moved far from the city as part of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia and crackdown on crime. 

With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. 

Washington's status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.

Here's a look at what we know and what questions remain about how Trump's actions will affect the city's homeless population:

It is difficult to obtain accurate counts of homeless populations. 

On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing.

The 2025 count in the district put the total at 5,138 adults and children, a 9% decrease compared with the year before, according to Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser.




It's not entirely clear.

Trump wrote on his social media site before Monday's news conference announcing the takeover that “The homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” 

Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.”

Citing a city regulation that she said gives local police “the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments,” Leavitt said homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services.” Those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

In the past five months, the U.S. Park Police has removed 70 homeless encampments, giving the people living in them the same options, she said. As of Tuesday, Leavitt said only two homeless encampments remained in district parks maintained by the National Park Service and would be removed this week.

District officials said Tuesday they were making additional shelter space available after Trump said federal agents would remove homeless people in the city. 

Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed.

Donahue made the comments during a conversation with community advocates and Bowser. The conversation was broadcast on X.

He said the outreach would continue through the week with a “greater level of urgency.”

Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.”

Washington residents emphasized reductions in crime in recent years and concerns over the removal of homeless encampments in interviews Tuesday criticizing the federal takeover of the city's police department.

Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.

Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she is more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in the city where she was born and raised.

Taylor said she has seen federal officers around her home and on the subway and worries about their targeting of young people and people experiencing homelessness.

“Being homeless isn't a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing.

In several spots across the city, AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up tents and belongings from parks and other public spaces before more formal removal measures. Some expressed fear and anxiety about what might be coming.

It's not exactly clear what agents specifically will be tasked with moving homeless people to areas outside the city.

There also hasn't been detailed information about how the people will be housed or provided for in new locations.

Some advocates have raised constitutional questions about the legality of forcibly removing homeless people from the city.

BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland's entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn't issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration's extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented. 

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland's 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration's aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump's authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda. 




“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush's solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”




Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government's lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration's case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement. 

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge's order. 

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee. His attorneys characterized the charge as an attempt to justify his erroneous deportation.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In an ironic twist, President Donald Trump is set to discuss the war in Ukraine with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a military base in Alaska that was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the height of Cold War and still plays a role today.

The meeting is scheduled to take place Friday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.

The base created by merging Elmendorf Air Force Base and Army Fort Richardson in 2010 has played a key strategic role in monitoring and deterring the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War.

Throughout its long history, the base hosted large numbers of aircraft and oversaw operations of a variety of early warning radar sites that were aimed at detecting Soviet military activity and any possible nuclear launches. It earned the motto “Top Cover for North America” at this time, according to the base website.

While much of the military hardware has since been deactivated, the base still hosts key aircraft squadrons, including the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet. Planes from the base also still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace.

The leaders' meeting at an American military base allows them to avoid any protests and provides an important level of security, said Benjamin Jensen, senior fellow for defense and security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.




“For President Trump, it's a great way for him to show American military strength while also isolating the ability of the public or others to intervene with what he probably hopes is a productive dialogue,” Jensen said.

He said the location means Trump can cultivate ties with Putin while “signaling military power to try to gain that bargaining advantage to make a second meeting possible.”

The irony of Putin visiting an American military base that long has — and still does — aimed to counter Russian threats comes as Trump works to reach a ceasefire deal in a war that he promised during the 2024 campaign to end quickly.

Officials from Ukraine and Europe fear that the one-on-one meeting they will not take part in could lead to an outcome that favors Russian goals.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump was “very clear” that the United States wants to achieve a ceasefire at the summit. Macron spoke after a virtual meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders.

Trump has said any major agreement could involve land swaps and that Zelenskyy and Putin could meet next or he could meet with both leaders.

“There's a very good chance that we're going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I'm going to find out where we are and what we're doing,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “It's going to be a very important meeting, but it's setting the table for the second meeting.”

BERLIN (AP) — Germany announced on Wednesday that it will work with a group of Ukraine's Western backers to supply a package of military aid to the war-ravaged country worth up to $500 million using a new NATO supply line.

Earlier this month, NATO started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said that it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($582 million).

Sweden announced the following day that it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts.

Germany's foreign and defense ministries said the support is focused on equipment like “critical air defense capabilities. These are urgently needed to defend against Russia's ongoing air strikes, which are killing more and more civilians throughout Ukraine.”

The United Nations has said that Russia's relentless pounding of urban areas behind the front line has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.

Two deliveries of equipment, most of it bought in the United States, were scheduled for this month, although the Nordic package was more likely to arrive in September. Germany did not name the group of countries it would be working with.

The equipment is supplied based on Ukraine's priority needs on the battlefield. NATO allies then locate the weapons and ammunition and send them on.

Germany has delivered or pledged military support to Ukraine worth around 40 billion euros ($47 billion) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Spanish authorities have located a missing American hiker's body and suspect he fell down a mountain, according to local media.

Guilford Cole Henderson fell around 650 feet down a mountain in a remote area in Spain while hiking on the Ordesa y Monte Pardido National Park in the Pyrenees, local newspapers El Espaniol and El Diario De Huesca reported. The area is along the borders of France and Spain. 

Authorities said his body was found on Friday.

Henderson was supposed to return home to the Netherlands on July 12, which caused the Spanish Civil Guard to launch a rescue effort. 

NBC News reported Henderson had parked his car in Torla, which is near the area he went hiking.

The Cincinnati police union is firing back as local leaders are calling for the prosecution of several White individuals involved in the viral downtown assault that led to six people being injured in late-July. 

The city's Fraternal Order of Police released a statement defending the department's investigation of the violent beatdown, while condemning city leaders' demands that additional arrests be made. 

""Cincinnati Police investigators have worked tirelessly to gather all of the facts, meet with prosecutors and sign appropriate charges to ensure those involved will be brought to justice,"" Ken Kober, president of Queen City Lodge #69, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Efforts have been made by politicians to influence the outcome of the investigation for their own gain. It's wildly inappropriate. There's no place for political games in law enforcement.""

(Hamilton County Jail; Fulton County Sheriff's Office)

The union previously noted the White individuals involved in the fight have been identified as ""victims,"" according to WKRC 12. 

The development comes after Ohio state Rep. Cecil Thomas spoke out at a public discussion Monday to discuss concerns over the city's handling of the investigation into the fight, WLWT reported. 

""The video speaks for itself,"" Thomas said, according to the outlet. ""The method by which this situation has been handled raises serious questions as to whether there is bias involved in this investigation. It also brings into question the lack of integrity and whether there is something else to hide.""

The Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office declined Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The comments are in response to a July 26 beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets that quickly went viral, sparking national outrage and putting pressure on Cincinnati's leadership to address safety concerns. 

Additional footage of the assault obtained by WLWT shows the unidentified White man allegedly hitting a Black man in the face, leading to several others joining in on the beatdown that ultimately led to seven arrests.

A separate video obtained by Fox News Digital revealed another angle of the moments before the fight, in which a White man can be heard repeatedly using a racial slur toward the group before the physical altercation began. 

CINCINNATI BRAWL TIMELINE: BRUTAL ASSAULT SPIRALS INTO NATIONAL FIRESTORM

The viral incident has sparked racial tensions within the city as all seven arrested individuals are African American.

Last week, a grand jury indicted Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, on three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.

If convicted, they would each face the possibility of up to 29 years in prison. 

A seventh individual, 32-year-old Gregory Wright, was arrested Monday afternoon and is facing charges of alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery, according to the Hamilton County Jail.

""It's a powder keg, it's a powder keg,"" Carl Lewis, the attorney for Wright, said during his client's arraignment on Monday, according to WKRC 12. 

Lewis reportedly was referring to the high-tension situation unfolding in the community following the beatdown.

""If, in fact, you start out with the narrative that they're 'victims' just based upon what you've seen in a video, that's a problem,"" Lewis said. 

Lewis did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The potentially explosive situation forced Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Tyrone Yates to request additional security during Wright's arraignment, WKRC 12 reported. 

""Can we send a couple of deputies to the outside to make sure that while I conduct this hearing, everyone understands that everyone is to be cool, to keep their cool,"" Yates said.

Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Kearney also reportedly weighed in on the criticism. 

""The actions of the White people involved appear to be the proximate cause of the violence, and they should be charged,"" Kearney said, according to WKRC 12. ""We should push for justice and not turn against each other."" 

Kearney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Vice President JD Vance touted the strength of the U.S. military at Fairford military base in the U.K. as the Trump administration gears up for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Adversaries' fear of the U.S. military is what makes tough negotiations like the one President Donald Trump is scheduled to have with Russian President Vladimir Putin possible, Vice President JD Vance told U.S. troops stationed in England on Wednesday. 

Vance's comments come as he's spent the past several days meeting with multiple European leaders in preparation for Trump's meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, with Putin in an attempt to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

""You guys make that possible,"" Vance, a former Marine, told U.S. troops stationed at Royal Air Force Base Fairford. ""You guys are the reason why we can go into a negotiation with strength. You guys are the reason why we have leverage in these conversations with world leaders. Because they know that if we cut a deal, it is backed up by the finest fighting force anywhere in the world. And that is what makes your job so important.""

""The fact that people are impressed by you, the fact that so many people are frankly afraid of you is why we're able to do what we do as an administration,"" Vance said. 

Royal Air Force Base Fairford is home to the U.S. Air Force's 501st Combat Support Wing and the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. It is also paramount for U.S. Air Force operations and serves as Air Force Global Strike Command's preferred bomber forward operating base in Europe. 

The Air Force routinely sends bomber aircraft to the military base as part of Bomber Task Force Europe 25-2 to train with NATO allies. For example, multiple Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers from Fairford participated in an exercise with Germany and Romania over NATO's eastern flank in March 2022 — just after Putin launched his invasion into Ukraine.

Roughly 10,000 U.S. troops are based in the U.K., according to foreign policy think-tank Council on Foreign Relations.

Vance told troops that he had just wrapped up a call with approximately 30 European leaders, coming on the heels of various meetings with other European allies about Ukraine talks in recent days.

A Saturday meeting with representatives of Ukraine and other European allies led to ""significant progress"" on ending the conflict in Ukraine, a U.S. official told Fox News Digital. More details on the discussions were not available. 

But Vance said in a Sunday interview that he informed European leaders the U.S. is ""done with the funding of the Ukraine war business,"" and that they must take on more of the burden in resolving the war. 

""What we said to Europeans is simply, ‘First of all, this is in your neck of the woods. This is in your back door. You guys have got to step up and take a bigger role in this thing, and if you care so much about this conflict, you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself,'"" Vance told Fox News Sunday.

Trump told reporters Monday that he'd be able to tell almost instantly if Putin is serious about negotiating a deal or not, and that he'd keep European leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the loop after the meeting.

""If it's a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,"" Trump said. ""I may say, ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting,' or I may say we can make a deal.""

Based Politics President Hannah Cox on NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdanis appeal to progressive voters, the impact his win could have on the Democratic Party and the role of youth influence in his campaign.

FIRST ON FOX: The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is rolling out a new ad tying the policies of ""radical"" Democrats, like New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, to the future outlook of the Democratic Party. 

The new message, targeting 25 vulnerable House Democrats across the country with a modest ad buy on digital platforms, hammers the party on ""Project 2026"" and outlines what the Republicans say Democrats will offer voters in the midterms. 

""Hakeem Jeffries' plan to remake America,"" the ad says. ""Raise taxes on working families, impeach President Trump.""

The ad then plays a clip of Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries saying, ""Donald Trump must be removed from office"" and Dem. Rep. Dina Titus saying, ""I'd like to impeach the bastard right now.""

The ad then claims Democrats want to ""open the border"" and ""restart the invasion"" of illegal immigrants that came into the country during the Biden administration, before quoting two Democrats, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Gabe Vasquez, calling to abolish ICE and defund the police.

""They riot, they loot,"" the ad continues before showing two clips of Mamdani saying ""we are unapologetic about our socialism"" and promoting the ""abolition of private property.""

Jeffries then says in a clip, ""Chip at it aggressively until we can unravel the whole system."" 

The ad closes by claiming that Democrats want to ""turn America into a socialist, crime-filled dystopia"" before airing a clip from Jeffries saying, ""We're gonna take back America and it starts today""

The ad closes with, ""Are you going to let them?""

The list of vulnerable elected officials targeted by the ad includes Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Emilia Sykes of Ohio, Eugene Vindman of Virginia, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Frank Mrvan of Indiana and others. 

""This is the America Democrats want to build: Raising taxes for working families, baseless impeachments, wide open borders, abolishing ICE, defunding the police, and turning America into a socialist, crime-filled dystopia,"" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital. ""House Republicans are the only thing standing between you and the nightmare of ‘Project 2026.'""

( Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)

The NRCC released a memo on Tuesday morning in which it knocked Jeffries for failing to meet a self-imposed deadline to roll out a new vision for America with a Democratic-controlled House.

The Hill reported in April that Jeffries committed that ""over these next 100 days, House Democrats are going to lay out a blueprint for a better America. And you will see a vision for this country's future that isn't about Donald Trump. It's all about you.""

With those 100 days having already elapsed, the NRCC published a satirical memo titled ""Project 2026,"" in which they accused the Democrats of being out of step with the American people.

In response, Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the DCCC, fired back at the messaging from the NRCC.

""House Republicans have done nothing to improve the lives of everyday Americans,"" Shelton said. 

""It's no wonder they're desperately attempting to distract from their disastrous record of higher costs for working families and ripping away health care from millions while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest few. Poll after poll shows voters across the country are fed up with their billionaire-first agenda and are going to reject them next year.""

FALLUJAH, IRAQ — In 2004 and 2005, the Iraqi city of Fallujah was a killing field. Al Qaeda dominated the streets. Insurgent snipers sought to pick off U.S. Marines on patrol. Some of the fiercest fighting of the Iraqi insurgency was in this largely Sunni Arab city, just 40 miles west of Baghdad. Nor were other parts of Anbar province much better.

Ramadi, the provincial capital, also experienced prolonged fighting. Even after some Sunni sheikhs in the region agreed to work with the United States and the new Iraqi government against Al Qaeda, violence continued as improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, and assassins continued to challenge American forces and terrorize local residents. Between 2003 and 2011, more than 1,300 Americans died in the Sunni Triangle and Euphrates Valley region.

Today, Fallujah is far different. Just a few yards away the Euphrates River bridge from which, in 2004, insurgents hung the bodies of four Blackwater contractors whom a mob had beaten, burned, and dragged through the streets, a coffee shop sells smoothies and young families stroll along a palm-tree studded promenade.

The Fallujah market looks run down with wires hung haphazardly and goods blocking the sidewalk, but it is vibrant. Even in 120°F heat, residents peruse the shops, though many escape into restaurants the Iraqis of different sects and ethnicities come to patronize, not only from elsewhere in Anbar, but also from Baghdad and other nearby cities. Several of these restaurants have been so successful, they have opened branches in other cities. Some of the stores sell products in boxes designed with American flags. The city is also clean: Litter is minimal, especially compared to elsewhere in Iraq, perhaps because municipal trash trucks clear the garbage on schedule.

Nor is Fallujah alone. Anbar is now, after Iraqi Kurdistan, the second most prosperous region of Iraq; it has an advantage over Kurdistan in suffering far less corruption and no kleptocratic duopoly of ruling families. Ramadi boasts new hospitals, universities, and its own airport is on the horizon. Roads are well paved. While Iranian pressure on Baghdad continues to deny Anbar the full benefits of its highway to Amman, Jordan, Ramadi is nonetheless booming, with warehouses belonging to different international companies full, just inside the city gates. I saw similar scenes driving through Habbaniyah and Alsufia. All along the highway and main roads, billboards and banners promoted candidates and slates in forthcoming elections. U.S. democracy promotion efforts worked in Iraq, albeit not on the timeline envisioned by President George W. Bush.

In Fallujah and Ramadi, locals had one message: Americans are now welcome. People in no-go areas of the past gave me a thumbs up when they asked and I told them where I was from. Part of this is due to the passage of time — more than half of all Iraqis were born after 2003 — and part is subsequent experience with the Islamic State and American efforts to re-liberate the land. Local leaders said they would especially welcome back U.S. Marines. It was the Marines, after all, who made alliances with local leaders to work with them in smashing al Qaeda and bringing order to chaos.

Many American servicemen visited Vietnam decades after to remember fallen colleagues, see developments in the country, and even meet those whom they once fought. Many veterans found such experiences therapeutic. There's a lesson here. Too many Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans question why they fought while many in Congress see Iraq through the lens of 2005 rather than 2025. Returning to Iraq — there is no need for security to travel from Baghdad to Fallujah or Ramadi — could recalibrate perceptions to reality, and cement bonds of brotherhood between those who departed the conflict in bitterness.

GRAHAM ECHOES TRUMP ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE ‘LAND SWAPS' THAT ZELENSKY REJECTED

Indeed, Vietnam is not the best analogy for Iraq; South Korea is. The investment there was far higher than President Harry S. Truman expected and the press pilloried him for seeking to implant democracy on a culture, they said, which was impervious to it. South Korea's evolution to democracy was far from smooth, but juxtaposition with North Korea shows the price was worth it. 

The energy Iraq effuses today — from Kurdistan to Baghdad to Anbar — is infectious. American politicos may self-flagellate for the U.S. role in Iraq's liberation but life in Anbar tells a different story. The Americans who sacrificed so much to make this possible should come back and bear witness.

State Department reports portray Germany as more oppressive than El Salvador.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

For nearly half a century, the State Department has reported annually on human-rights conditions in countries around the world. The purpose of this exercise is not to cast aspersions, but to collect and disseminate reliable information. Congress mandated the reports back in 1977, and since then, legislators and diplomats have used them to shape decisions about sanctions, foreign aid, immigration, and political asylum.

Because the reports were perceived as relatively impartial, because they tried to reflect well-articulated standards—“internationally recognized individual, civil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”—and because they were composed by professionals reporting from the ground, the annual documents became a gold standard, widely used by people around the world, cited in court cases and political campaigns. Year in and year out, one former official told me, they have been the most downloaded items on the State Department website.

Quite a few people will also read the 2024 reports, published yesterday. But they will do so for very different reasons. The original drafts were ready in January, before the Biden administration left office, following the usual practice. In past years, the reports were published in March or April. But this year they were delayed for several months while President Donald Trump's political appointees, including Michael Anton, the MAGA intellectual who is now the State Department's director of policy planning, rewrote the drafts.

Some of the changes affect the whole collection of documents, as entire categories of interest were removed. The Obama administration had previously put a strong focus on corruption, on the grounds that kleptocracy and autocracy are deeply linked, and it started collecting information on the persecution of sexual minorities. Over the past few weeks, as the new reports were being prepared, I spoke with former officials who had seen early versions, or who had worked on the reports in the past. As many of them expected, the latest reports do not address systemic discrimination against gay or trans people, and they remove observations about rape and violence against women.

But the revisions also go much further than expected, dropping references to corruption, restrictions on free and fair elections, rights to a fair trial, and the harassment of human-rights organizations. Threats to freedom of assembly are no longer considered sufficiently important to mention. In a number of instances, criticism of Israel is classified, crudely, as “antisemitism.” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's use of the word genocide to describe the war in Gaza, for example, is listed as an act of “antisemitism and antisemitic incitement,” even though that term, however disputable or controversial, has also been used by Israelis and in any case violates no international human-rights norms at all.

Jonathan Chait: The pro-Israel right is shifting the definition of anti-Semitism

Along with the category changes, entries for 20 countries were also flagged for special consideration. These were sent for review to Samuel Samson, a political appointee in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Dozens of professionals have been fired or removed from that office, widely known as DRL; Samson—who is, according to NPR, a recent college graduate and an alumnus of a program designed to put conservative activists into government jobs—remains. The end result of his and others' efforts are reports that contain harsh and surprising assessments of democratic U.S. allies, including the U.K., Romania, Germany, and Brazil, and softer depictions of some dictatorships and other countries favored by Trump or his entourage. El Salvador and Israel, I was told, required so much rewriting that these two entries help explain the long delay in the reports' publication.

Reading the results, you can see why. The new Israel report is simply far shorter than the original draft, with no significant discussion of the humanitarian crisis or high death toll in Gaza. El Salvador is a blatant whitewash. “There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the latest report claims. By contrast, the previous report spoke of “significant human rights issues” and specifically mentioned harsh, even lethal prison conditions. An Amnesty International report also covering 2024 speaks of “arbitrary detentions and human rights violations” in El Salvador, as well as “serious failings in the judicial system.” In overcrowded prisons, “detention conditions were inhumane, with reports of torture and other ill-treatment.” Here, the State Department's motivation is not hard to guess. Because the Trump administration is sending prisoners to El Salvador, the department massaged the report to avoid the glaring truth: The U.S. is endangering people by sending them to Salvadoran prisons.

The report on Germany, a highly functional democracy, is equally strange. The State report speaks of “significant human rights issues,” including “restrictions on freedom of expression.” One specific example: German law “required internet companies, including U.S. internet platforms, to take down hate speech within 24 hours or face stiff fines.” Germans, in other words, are being called human-rights abusers because they continue to outlaw Nazi propaganda, as they have done since 1945. The Trump administration's motives are clear here too. The goal is to please U.S. tech companies, notably X, that find it convenient or profitable to spread Nazi propaganda, and perhaps to help the Alternative for Germany, the far-right party publicly praised and courted by J. D. Vance.

But the details of the reports are less important than the overall impact. Several former officials pointed out that the U.S. has not only abandoned internationally accepted definitions of what is meant by rights, but also  any objectivity or consistency. Original reporting from embassies has been removed, replaced with language clearly—and in a few cases ludicrously—manipulated by political appointees. This is very bad for human-rights defenders in places like Cuba or China, where activists in the past used U.S. language and reporting to make arguments to their own governments or to international institutions.

From the May 2025 issue: America's future is Hungary

None of them can now claim that the State Department Human Rights Report has any factual standing, or indeed that any U.S.-government document on human rights is an objective measure of anything. “This essentially says the United States is no longer your ally, that the United States doesn't see clearly beyond the rhetoric of your regime,” one former official who still has relationships with DRL told me. “And I think that's really, really tragic.”

In truth, some of the changes seem designed not so much to shape U.S. foreign policy as to shape U.S. domestic policy. Christopher Le Mon, a former DRL official, told me he thinks that “the domestic political agenda is really the organizing principle here.” He might be right. The administration is saying, after all, that it no longer finds electoral cheating or manipulation to be a problem; it doesn't think the harassment of civic groups is a bad thing; it doesn't object to discrimination against women or sexual minorities; and it will never demand transparency or accountability from the providers of internet algorithms, no matter what they choose to amplify or promote. The reports' authors, who include some of the most ideological people in the administration, are also telling Americans what they think of the standards that both Republicans and Democrats have held up for years. Now, says Le Mon, “they're making it that much easier to just erase human rights from what has been a long-standing, relatively bipartisan history in U.S. foreign policy.”

Ironically, this shift in American language puts the U.S. directly in alliance with China, whose diplomats have been campaigning for years to change the diplomatic discourse about human rights. Christopher Walker, a co-author of an influential paper on Chinese influence campaigns, which he calls “sharp power,” told me that the Chinese Communist Party has been seeking to “neuter or muddy the waters” around international discussions of fundamental human rights. “From Beijing's point of view, the more such language is emasculated, the greater the CCP's competitive advantage,” he said. Russians, North Koreans, Iranians, Cubans, and others will also find this shift an immense relief.

We knew this was coming. In a speech in Riyadh earlier this year, Trump flagged America's new indifference to human rights, promising the Saudis and other Middle Eastern monarchs that America would stop “giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs.” That made it sound like the administration would be somehow neutral. But as Walker pointed out, in a world of intense ideological competition, there is no such thing as neutrality. Debates about the definition of human rights will continue. The U.S. will simply play a different role in them. Tom Malinowski, a former congressman who once ran the DRL bureau, puts it best. The reports, he told me, show that the “U.S. still has a values-based foreign policy, but with twisted values.” Americans are giving plenty of lectures to other people on how to live, but to different people and with a different result.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In authoritarian regimes, good numbers are always right.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In 2013, ahead of a scheduled visit from President Vladimir Putin to the small Russian town of Suzdal, local officials worried that he would be disappointed by the dilapidated buildings. In a modern revival of Grigory Potemkin's possibly apocryphal deception of Catherine the Great, they slapped exterior wallpaper onto buildings, hoping to hide the decaying concrete behind illustrations of charming village homes. It was intended as a comforting myth to keep Putin happy. (In the end, Putin never showed up.)

On August 1, President Donald Trump demanded a comforting myth of his own, one that could have far greater consequences for the world economy. He began by firing a skilled economist, Erika McEntarfer, from her job running the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for a cardinal sin that ordinarily exists only in dictatorships: producing “bad numbers.” In authoritarian regimes, good numbers are always right, and if anyone says otherwise—if they are foolish enough to produce statistics that suggest the economy is souring or that Dear Leader isn't producing historic growth and blockbuster jobs numbers—then it's curtains on their career (if not their life). As is so often the case with Trump, reality itself seems to be “rigged.” Time to fix reality with Potemkin statistics.

This week, Trump named E. J. Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, as McEntarfer's replacement, subject to the charade of Senate Republican rubber-stamping that has become so common in Trump's second term. As with despots throughout the world, Trump selected Antoni on the two criteria that consistently warm a dictator's heart: loyalty and ideology.

Antoni, who contributed to Project 2025, has a résumé that's thin on qualifications. Five years ago, according to his LinkedIn profile, he completed his doctorate in economics at Northern Illinois University, after a short stint teaching at Sauk Valley Community College. His only scholarly publication—ever—appears to be his doctoral thesis, which has been cited by other economists a grand total of one time. That sole citation came from a policy briefing written by Antoni's then-colleague at the archconservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Tim Naftali: Trump just did what not even Nixon dared to do

Antoni has shown ignorance of basic economic data, including in a recent social-media post supporting Trump's tariffs, in which he appeared to not grasp that a major index of import prices did not include tariffs in its published data. (Several established economists helpfully pointed this out to him.) Menzie Chinn, a renowned economics professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has chronicled a wide array of Antoni's basic misunderstandings, misrepresentations, and mistakes. In other words, Antoni would probably not get hired as a junior economist at the agency he's now slated to run.

By contrast, McEntarfer received her doctorate from Virginia Tech in 2002, then worked as an economist in a variety of roles at the Census Bureau—under both Republican and Democratic presidents—as well as in top jobs at the Treasury Department and the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Last year, she was confirmed by the Senate to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a bipartisan 86–8 vote. Then-Senators J. D. Vance and Marco Rubio both voted to confirm her. During her time in public service—not in academia—she produced at least 44 publications, which have been cited by other scholars 1,327 times.

But what Antoni lacks in credentials and expertise he makes up for in his MAGA worldview. On X, he follows a who's who of Trump acolytes, including Carpe Donktum, a prolific meme creator who once shared an AI-generated video depicting Trump killing journalists and critics, and Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich, who both promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory. International investors can see this, too—and they understand that nonpartisan government officials devoted to statistical accuracy do not behave like this.

Even conservative economists can see what's going on. Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has noted that economists had hoped that Trump would appoint a competent, fair expert who could ensure confidence in the government's data. “EJ Antoni is really the opposite of that,” Veuger lamented. “Even the people who may be somewhat sympathetic to his economic policy views don't think he's qualified.”

Yet again, the United States is lurching toward dynamics previously seen only in authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. Autocrats and wannabe despots consistently cook the books, manipulating statistics to make their nation's economy appear better than it is. This comes at a cost: Once the statistical facade peels away, providing a glimpse of the crumbling structure below, investors stop believing the data. Eventually they flee, taking their money with them.

The economist Luis Martinez has used satellite images to test whether dictators were overstating their country's growth rate. (Because real, sustained GDP growth inevitably produces increased light pollution in developing countries as cities expand and economic activity increases, nighttime images from space have proved to be a good proxy for economic growth.) Martinez's data showed that the answer was yes—and by a lot. The leaders he studied were overstating GDP numbers by up to 35 percent. And they weren't just fudging the numbers; they were almost certainly making them up.

Similarly, after Rwanda—which has long promoted itself as an African success story under the economic management of its dictator, Paul Kagame—boasted that it had reduced poverty by 6 percent over a five-year period, independent researchers concluded that poverty had actually increased by 5 to 7 percent. Other studies have confirmed that authoritarians frequently manipulate statistics strategically, ensuring that bad news never coincides with election cycles.

Rogé Karma: The mystery of the strong economy has finally been solved

A dictator's ability to snap their fingers and transform economic malaise into a perceived miracle is an exercise of unconstrained personal power. But it is also a sign of weakness—one that inflicts significant damage to a country's economy. That's because economic investments involve putting capital at calculated risk, and those risks become unattractive when the underlying calculations are not based on trustworthy information. By contrast, leaders in functioning democracies tie themselves to the economic masts of independent institutions that are designed to speak truth to power—and investors trust them accordingly with their money.

Effective decision making is impossible without reliable, accurate information. And many crucial decisions in economic governance and investment rely on the BLS jobs numbers. The monthly reports sway Federal Reserve decisions, affect pension-payout calculations, and are factored into virtually every determination involving major global investment. Economists have expressed their worries that if the jobs data are even perceived as being subject to political pressure, international lending to the United States will decline. When Fox News highlighted this week that Antoni had previously expressed his desire to get rid of the monthly jobs reports, the value of the dollar fell shortly thereafter.

Antoni might not be able to manipulate the statistics themselves. Many economists are involved in compiling the data, and cooking the books without drawing notice would be difficult. But in the current American information environment, Antoni could do enormous damage simply by giving misleading political ammunition to the MAGA movement, dressed up in the official guise of a previously nonpartisan office. Antoni presumably has few qualms about the political pressure he's inevitably going to face from Trump; after all, he has accepted a nomination for a job that now clearly comes with a risk of being fired if the official statistics aren't to the president's liking. And that means the clock is ticking for Antoni even if he is confirmed, because Potemkin villages all eventually crumble.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

North America's herds will likely be hit the hardest.

It's bad enough that climate change is ruining the dream of a white Christmas for many people, as warming makes snow in some regions less likely.

Now, apparently, it's coming for reindeer, too.

Reindeer aren't just creatures of Christmas myth; they're real animals — a kind of deer that live in the Arctic, from northern Europe and Russia to North America, where they're commonly known as caribou. These animals are remarkably adapted to cold weather, sporting thick fur, a snout that warms the air they take in, and uniquely structured hooves that help them shovel snow to find food, such as lichen. But they've also survived bouts of Arctic warming that occurred thousands of years ago, thanks to their ability to travel long distances in search of colder habitats.

These adaptations are, however, no match for modern climate change. The Arctic is warming quickly from a higher baseline temperature compared to natural fluctuations in the distant past.

Over the last few decades, wild Arctic reindeer populations have declined by about two-thirds, from 5.5 million to around 1.9 million, largely due to warming, according to previous research. Rising temperatures can affect reindeer health directly — causing the animals to overheat and get sick — and indirectly by limiting their supply of food.

Now, it's clear those declines will likely continue. A new study in the journal Science Advances found that if the world doesn't quickly rein in greenhouse gas emissions, the global wild reindeer population could plummet by nearly 60 percent by the end of the century. Those declines will be far more severe in North America, where they could exceed 80 percent, according to the study's models, which reconstructed 21,000 years of reindeer population data using fossil records, DNA, and other data sources. That's because North America is expected to lose more habitat that can support reindeer to warming than elsewhere, said Damien Fordham, a study author and researcher at the University of Adelaide.

Even under a more modest emissions scenario — in which countries cut back what they spew into the atmosphere — the study projects steep population declines. You can see these results in the chart below, which shows projected declines based on a high and moderate emissions scenario, respectively.

“These results are absolutely concerning,” said Jennifer Watts — Arctic program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a nonprofit research organization — who was not involved in the new study. “Given how quickly and severely the Arctic is warming at present, the results from this study are not overly surprising, and should serve as yet another wake-up call for humans to curtail anthropogenic drivers of climate warming.”

The study offers yet another example of how climate change is threatening biodiversity and how those threats in turn affect humans. Reindeer are not only a critical food source for some Arctic Indigenous communities — like Alaskan Natives and the Inuit people of North America — but also a cornerstone of their culture, similar to salmon or wolves for some tribal nations in other parts of the US. If major polluting nations, like the US, China, and India don't curtail their emissions, it could further endanger the food sovereignty of those communities.

Beyond their direct impact on human well-being, reindeer also shape the tundra ecosystems — quite literally making them what they are — by limiting the growth of trees and shrubs, spreading seeds, and fertilizing the soil.

“We should care about the fate of reindeer and caribou with the same concern we give to the fate of polar bears and other Arctic animals,” Watts told Vox. “The well-being of entire ecosystems and humans living across the Arctic depend on their survival.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday shrugged off a question about a new report that Russia is at least partially responsible for hacking the electronic system that manages U.S. federal court case documents.

""Are you surprised?"" Trump said during a press event at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, D.C.

""They hack in, that's what they do,"" he said about Russia.

""They're good at it, we're good at it, we're actually better at it.""

Revelations of the breach came days before Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska about Russia's war against Ukraine.

Trump said that he ""could"" bring up the hack during the meeting.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that evidence shows that an entity in Russia appeared to have hacked the court case document system and ""recently compromised sealed records.""

That system, in addition to containing publicly available court documents, also has hidden records, including information on individuals charged with national security crimes.

""Some of the searches included midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,"" the Times reported.

The hack is believed to be part of a yearslong effort, the news outlet reported.

The U.S. courts system last week announced it ""is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents in response to recent escalated cyberattacks of a sophisticated and persistent nature on its case management system.""

""The Judiciary is also further enhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants,"" the system said.

An internal memo to Justice Department officials and staffers from the courts system, which the Times reviewed, warned that ""persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.""

""This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,"" the memo said.

In this article

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish rocketed Wednesday after the company raised about $1.1 billion in an initial public offering.

The stock opened at $90 on the New York Stock Exchange, 143% above its IPO price of $37. At one point, it rose as high as $118. It closed with a more than 83% gain at $68.

The company priced its IPO early Wednesday far above this week's expected range of $32 to $33 and an initial range last week of between $28 and $31, valuing the company at some $5.4 billion before trading began.

Bullish, which is led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley and backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, focuses on institutional investors and blends decentralized finance protocols with the security of a centralized company.

""The last leg of growth in crypto, the last 10 years, was basically all retail and … the institutional wave has begun,"" Farley told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Wednesday. ""It's here, and it's a question of how big it will be. Based on the reception we've gotten thus far as part of our IPO, it feels like institutional investors feel like this could be the moment.""

Since the company's launch in 2021, total trading volume on the Bullish platform exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31. The Cayman Islands-headquartered company also owns the crypto news website CoinDesk, which includes crypto indexes, data and analytics.

Bullish joins a batch of companies looking to take advantage of the Trump administration's favorable attitude toward the crypto industry. In June, stablecoin issuer Circle made a highly successful stock market debut, raising more than $1 billion. That followed the transfer of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to the Nasdaq from Toronto, and stock and crypto trading app eToro's IPO that valued it at $5.4 billion. Crypto custody startup BitGo and crypto exchange Gemini have also confidentially filed for U.S. listings. 

This is the second attempt by Bullish to go public in the four years since the company launched.

More older student loan borrowers are struggling to pay their monthly bill, as the Trump administration ramps up its collection efforts.

Nearly 1 in 5 — or roughly 18% — of student loan borrowers who are 50 and older became ""seriously delinquent,"" or 90 days or more late on their payments, in the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The rate for that age group was closer to 10% in 2019.

For comparison, closer to 8% of student loan borrowers between the ages of 18 and 29 became seriously delinquent during that time frame, and around 11% of those aged 30 to 39 did.

""Being delinquent on student loan debt is difficult for people who are approaching their retirement years,"" said Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP.

""People end up having to make extremely difficult choices,"" Trawinski said.

Some of the repayment troubles may stem from older Americans borrowing more than they can afford for their children's college education, experts say. Other people run into financial difficulties after returning to school later in life and then not accessing the career opportunities they'd hoped for.

Whatever the reason, falling behind on your education debt may quickly have more financial consequences.

Earlier this summer, the Trump administration announced that it would soon resume collection activity against student loan borrowers who aren't making their payments. This comes after a nearly five-year period during which student loan holders were shielded from the consequences of missing their bills, a policy that began at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Here's what older borrowers in the red need to know.

There are key differences between student loan delinquency and default.

While becoming delinquent for 90 days or more on your student loans can show up on your credit report and lower your score, the more severe consequences of federal collection activity don't usually start until you're more than 270 days late and eventually fall into default, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. 

Meanwhile, private lenders typically consider student borrowers in default after 120 days without a payment, he said.

Delinquent student loan borrowers have time to get current, said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.

""For those struggling, the first step is to explore all available federal repayment options, especially income-driven repayment plans, which can significantly lower monthly payments and prevent default,"" said Boneparth, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.

You can try to find a repayment plan with monthly bills you can afford at Studentaid.gov.

The so-called Income-Based Repayment plan is one of what may be a dwindling number of manageable repayment options left to borrowers, after recent court actions and the passage of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill. That legislation phases out several other repayment plans.

There are tools from the Education Department to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans.

Struggling borrowers can also see if they're eligible to pause their payments, such as through a forbearance or economic hardship deferment — though it's important to check if your debt will accrue interest during the reprieve.

""Requesting a temporary forbearance can buy time, but ideally, borrowers should aim for an affordable, sustainable payment plan rather than stop-gap measures,"" Boneparth said.

Older student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments received some good news earlier this summer: The Department of Education has paused its plan to garnish defaulted borrowers' Social Security benefits. Normally, Social Security recipients can see their checks reduced by up to 15% to pay back their defaulted student loan.

An Education Department spokesperson told CNBC in an email Tuesday that the department has not offset any Social Security benefits since restarting collections on May 5 and has paused future Social Security offsets.

Still, older borrowers should take steps to get their debt out of delinquency as quickly as possible and avoid becoming at risk for more punishing collection activity, said AARP's Trawinski.

While the Trump administration said in June that it was pausing Social Security offsets, ""what they did not do is issue a formal rule or regulation saying they won't do so in the future,"" Trawinski said. As a result, she said, ""there's an expectation that they will at some point resume those garnishments.""

For those older borrowers who are still working, the Education Department can also garnish up to 15% of your disposable, or after-tax, pay, toward a defaulted student loan, Kantrowitz said.

""We anticipate wage garnishment to begin later this summer,"" a spokesperson for the Education Department told CNBC on Aug. 5.

In this article

As tariffs spark worries of higher prices, Walmart is dangling more discounts for its own employees.

The largest private U.S. employer said Wednesday that it will offer a 10% employee discount on nearly all groceries, including milk, meat and frozen food. That discount previously applied to fresh produce and most general merchandise items, such as clothing and toys, but only to other food during the holiday season.

In a memo to employees obtained by CNBC, Walmart's chief people officer, Donna Morris, said the expanded price cut takes effect immediately. Walmart's approximately 1.6 million U.S. employees qualify for the discount after their first 90 days with the company. With the expansion, the reduction will now include 95% of regularly priced items across the store, she said.

""We've heard your feedback that these savings make a real difference for you and your families,"" she wrote in the memo. ""And we have continued to hear that you would like to see this benefit expanded. In fact, it's one of our most requested benefits.""

Walmart's announcement comes as economists and companies closely watch how rising tariffs trickle through the U.S. economy and shape consumer spending. The consumer price index, a closely watched inflation metric from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, came in better than feared on Tuesday, with food prices flat. Yet the data still pointed to higher prices on some items. For example, household furnishings and supplies rose 0.7% month over month after climbing 1% in June.

Walmart itself has warned that higher prices are coming. In May, the company's CFO, John David Rainey, told CNBC that the discounter was ""wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb.""

The expanded employee discount could boost Walmart's own business, too. It could motivate its huge workforce to spend more of their money at its stores and website rather than at other grocers or retailers. And the perk could also help attract and retain workers.

Walmart announced the expanded discount at its holiday meeting in Houston, which all store managers attended.

According to a video obtained by CNBC, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner brought a Walmart store manager to the stage to read the surprise announcement that its 10% discount on food would become year-round.

""All I can think is about my associates back at home,"" the store manager told Furner, as he thanked him. He said employees at his store ""don't know how they're going to be paying their next meal and now this is going to help them.""

Walmart is scheduled to report its latest earnings on Aug. 21. The retailer's expanded discount was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

 Bitcoin growth models project $200,000 by 2025 and up to $1.5 million by 2035, outpacing gold and the Nasdaq in long-term returns. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's long-term CAGR of 42.5% outpaces the Nasdaq and gold, but is projected to drop to 30% by 2030.

The power-law and quantile models keep BTC's Q4 2025 target between $150,000–$200,000, with $1.2million to $1.5 million possible by 2035.

The long-term growth of Bitcoin (BTC) remains exceptional, according to a recent Bitcoin Intelligence Report, noting that even in the context of other major assets, its trajectory stands out. 

The report compared the Nasdaq's 10-year rolling compound annual growth rate (CAGR), which typically sits in the mid-single to low-teens, with the latest decade delivering 16%. Gold has averaged 10.65% over the past decade, rising to 12.88% when adjusted for its 2% annual supply growth. 

Meanwhile, the US M2 money supply has expanded at roughly 6% annually over the same period. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin's modeled CAGR of 42.5% underscores its outsized performance.

The firm's power-law model, which has tracked Bitcoin with “unprecedented consistency” for 16 years, projects a gradual, adoption-driven deceleration toward 30% by 2030, still triple gold's supply-adjusted growth rate. 

“Bitcoin remains the cleanest barometer of global liquidity,” the report states, citing its smaller market size and role as a “liquidity sponge” in a structurally expansive monetary regime.

The report shows that the $114,000–$117,000 accumulation zone proved resilient, triggering a spot-led rebound to $122,000.

While the immediate resistance lies just above $130,000, the year-end target for Bitcoin remains close to $200,000. Its price projection combines the power-law approach with quantile analysis to track Bitcoin's historical growth.

According to the model, the base trend for Bitcoin by the end of 2025 sits around $120,000. Factoring in the cyclical bull phase, the price could realistically climb to between $150,000 and $200,000. Looking further out, by 2035, the model anticipates Bitcoin could reach $1.2 million to $1.5 million, a forecast based on exponential, network-like growth rather than speculative hype.

The chart shows that every 50% increase in Bitcoin's age has historically driven about a 10x jump in price, a pattern the model has tracked with strong accuracy (R² > 0.95). This data-backed trend, paired with solid onchain strength and supportive macroeconomic conditions (future interest rate cuts), suggests the best may still be ahead for Bitcoin in 2025.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan indicates a similar outcome. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Hougan said that Bitcoin's supply-demand balance is increasingly skewed toward demand, with miners producing fewer coins than publicly traded companies and ETFs are collectively buying. In May, Hougan said,

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Best Crypto to Buy as Blockchain Futurist Announces Speakers","https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-ahead-of-blockchain-futurist/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:21:36 GMT","

The Blockchain Futurist Conference lands in Miami, Florida, on November 5–6, 2025. And it's set to bring crypto heavyweights like TRON's Justin Sun and BitGo's Mike Belshe to the stage.

With the market heating up and industry bigwigs set to reveal their next big moves, now could be the perfect time to load up on the best crypto to buy – before they possibly rally alongside increased attention.

After seven years of event hosting across Canada, the Blockchain Futurist Conference is finally getting ready to hit the US soil for the first ever time.

Given that US crypto regulatory clarity is finally taking shape, with the passing of the ‘GENIUS Act' and the SEC's announcement of ‘Project Crypto,' its timing is spot on.

Over 300 of the most influential voices in crypto, blockchain, and emerging tech are set to take the stage across four stages, some of which include:

Backing the event are top sponsors like Tangem Wallet, Nexa, DoLorean Labs, and ZDKL, with more to be announced.

Meanwhile, media partners like Blockchain North and Genzio will capture live interviews and behind-the-scenes moments to share the conference's biggest highlights.

With the event's biggest announcements anticipated to be shared across major news sites, now could be the prime time to inject capital into top cryptos.

Coins like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), Vertical AI ($VERTAI), and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) each have high-profit potential. You'll understand why after diving into their utility.

$BEST is the backbone of Best Wallet, a mobile-first, non-custodial crypto wallet.

Designed for beginners yet packed with cutting-edge tools, the wallet allows you to buy, sell, swap, and manage over 1K cryptocurrencies easily and seamlessly.

Whether you're interested in meme coins like $SHIB and $DOGE, stablecoins like $USDC and $USDT, or crypto leaders like $BTC and $ETH, it has options for all types of traders.

The wallet's support of major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain makes this possible. Once it integrates with 60+ networks, as promised on its roadmap, you'll soon be able to diversify your crypto portfolio even further.

You'll soon also be able to spend your assets while on the move, thanks to the upcoming launch of Best Card, its very own crypto debit card.

To top it off, you can anticipate the best rates and lowest fees. Best Wallet's Cross-Chain Swaps feature leverages 330 decentralized exchanges and 30 blockchain bridges so you can execute trades with the most cost-effective deals across top networks.

$BEST is available on presale for its lowest current price at $0.025475. But in less than nine hours, its price will automatically increase.

The token might also reach a high of $0.072 by the year's end, partly driven by exchange listings and new app developments. So why not join the presale now before the price bump and to enjoy possible 182%+ returns?

$VERTAI is the native utility token that powers Vertical AI, a no-code platform that allows all involved to deploy their own AI models with ease.

Helping Vertical AI achieve this is its three core products:

$VERTAI is used in every part of the ecosystem: to pay for AI services, unlock premium features at a lower cost, and participate in staking for rewards.

The token also lets you vote on platform upgrades, as well as monetize AI models and datasets through the integrated marketplace.

Seeing as $VERTAI is key to the platform's functionality and growth, its value often soars when new features and developments arise.

For instance, since Vertical AI announced a strategic equity stake in Levangie Labs (an enterprise AI solutions provider), its price has spiked by 30% in just 24 hours.

As Vertical AI continues expanding its ecosystem to greater heights, $VERAI is positioned for more gains. Therefore, its current $0.37 price tag (up for grabs on exchanges like eToro and Uniswap) signals an advantageous entry point.

$MAXI is a new dog on the block(chain), one of which takes inspiration from meme coin giants like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB).

Also donning a Shiba Inu mascot, one of which has muscles to boost its industry weight, it's looking to sniff out success similar to its canine predecessors. And it's no surprise: $DOGE boasts a hefty $37B market cap, while $SHIB commands an impressive $8.2B.

But much like $SHIB, $MAXI doesn't want to be just another dog-themed coin with no real-world use case.

Differently, however, $MAXI aims to stand out with upcoming contests that reward ROI hunters. It's also seeking to roll out gamified tournaments and futures platform integrations in the future.

Its futures platform integrations suit it down to a tee, as its tagline promises ‘1,000x leverage' and ‘no stop loss' to ‘feel the maxi pump.'

Since launching on presale on July 30, 2025, it has already fetched over $803K on presale, even though you can currently buy $MAXI on presale for just $0.000252.

Also attracting eyes to the presale is the fact that you can stake $MAXI for 352% APY. But if you're interested, act fast: the token's price climbs in just two days, and this staking percentage will drop as more users join the pack.

The Blockchain Futurist Conference, set to make its long-awaited US debut in Miami, will highlight the latest market insights and potential breakout opportunities.

When taking into account the US' current crypto stance and growing mainstream adoption, its timing couldn't be better – and it could send the best crypto to buy flying.

Better yet, they each have bustling roadmaps and are currently low-cap, so the next few months could offer substantial returns.

As always, this isn't investment advice. DYOR and never invest more than you'd be sad to lose.

 The two entities requested that the financial regulator provide a ""safe harbor"" for certain applications under the SEC's broker-dealer registration requirements. 

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the advocacy organization DeFi Education Fund have asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set up a safe harbor program for non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications from the agency's broker-dealer registration requirements.

In a Wednesday letter to SEC Commissioner and Crypto Task Force head Hester Peirce, a16z and the DeFi group said they were following up on US President Donald Trump's Working Group on Digital Assets call to “provide relief for certain DeFi service providers from the broker-dealer [...], exchange [...], and clearing agency [...] registration provisions of the Exchange Act.” 

In July, SEC Chair Paul Atkins also said he had directed the agency's staff to “update antiquated agency rules and regulations” concerning certain crypto and blockchain applications. 

A safe harbor, in terms of SEC regulations, would allow many companies offering crypto-related products and services to avoid enforcement actions. The commission and individual investors have previously filed civil lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies for operating as unregistered dealers, including Cumberland DRW, Coinbase and Kraken.

“The guiding principle of the safe harbor is that only those Apps which do not engender the risks that the Exchange Act's broker-dealer regulatory regime was designed to address should be eligible; in such cases, registration as a broker under the Exchange Act is unwarranted and inappropriate,” said the letter to the SEC, adding:

The proposed change in SEC policy followed a16z sending a letter in March to Peirce, detailing recommendations for an NFT safe harbor at the agency. The company also said in a separate letter that the commission “could take the following steps” of setting up safe harbors for airdrops and network tokens.

In June, the SEC reported that about 3,340 broker-dealers with $6.4 trillion in assets had registered with the agency as of 2024. The agency noted at the time that there had been a trend of “industry consolidation, with a declining fraction of market participants responsible for a larger asset pool.”

The commission established the category of Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) in December 2020 for custodying digital asset securities. However, the SEC clarified in May that the SPBD designation was not mandatory for “broker-dealers seeking to custody customer crypto assets that are securities,” adding that standard requirements would apply for both engaging in digital asset and traditional securities.

How the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) handle digital assets could change once lawmakers in the US Congress address proposed legislation to establish a crypto market structure. The leading bill for market structure, called the CLARITY Act, was passed by the House of Representatives in July and awaits consideration in the Senate.

- Andreessen Horowitz and DeFi Education Fund urge SEC to create a regulatory safe harbor for DeFi/NFT apps, exempting them from broker-dealer rules.

- The proposal emphasizes eligibility for apps that avoid traditional broker risks, aligning with broader industry demands for crypto regulatory clarity.

- It follows SEC Chair's directive to modernize crypto rules but does not address past enforcement actions against major exchanges like Coinbase.

- The initiative aims to foster innovation while maintaining investor protection, as the CLARITY Act progresses to redefine crypto market regulations.

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the DeFi Education Fund have jointly called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a regulatory “safe harbor” for certain decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications, exempting them from the agency's broker-dealer registration requirements. The advocacy and investment group argue that such a framework would bring much-needed clarity to the crypto space and protect innovation by preventing developers from being misclassified as brokers under the Exchange Act [1]. In a letter to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, the entities emphasized that only applications that do not generate the risks traditionally addressed by broker-dealer regulations should be eligible for the safe harbor [2]. The proposal follows a similar request made by a16z in March for a specific NFT safe harbor, including potential exemptions for airdrops and network token activities [3].

The move aligns with broader industry and policy calls for regulatory relief, including the Working Group on Digital Assets under the Trump administration, which had urged similar action for DeFi service providers. The request also follows a directive from SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has instructed agency staff to update outdated rules affecting crypto and blockchain technologies [4]. Despite these developments, the proposal does not address past enforcement actions by the SEC, including lawsuits against major firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Cumberland DRW for operating as unregistered brokers [5]. 

Currently, the SEC allows for the designation of Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBDs) for custodying digital asset securities. However, the agency has made clear that these designations are not mandatory and that standard broker-dealer requirements still apply to firms dealing in digital assets [6]. The regulatory landscape is expected to undergo further changes as the CLARITY Act, which aims to define the legal structure of crypto markets, moves through the U.S. Senate following its House passage in July 2025 [7]. 

A16z and the DeFi Education Fund argue that the proposed safe harbor would not undermine investor protection but instead enhance it by fostering a clear and balanced legal environment that encourages innovation. The initiative reflects a growing demand for regulatory certainty in the DeFi and NFT sectors, where many developers fear that inconsistent enforcement could stifle development and push projects overseas [8].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Ethereum Fortune Locked Away: Early ICO Buy Now Worth Over $1B","https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fortune-locked-away-early-ico-buy-worth-1b/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:00:43 GMT","

Ethereum is on the verge of breaking its all-time high after surging to the $4,700 level, its strongest price since November 2021. Bulls remain firmly in control, with momentum building after weeks of steady gains that have reignited market optimism. The rally has positioned ETH just shy of the $4,860 peak, a breakout point that could usher in a long-awaited price discovery phase.

Adding intrigue to the current bullish backdrop, Arkham Intelligence — a blockchain analytics platform known for deanonymizing the individuals and companies behind blockchain wallets and transactions — has uncovered a remarkable story. According to their findings, a prominent figure has lost access to a wallet holding over $1.1 billion worth of Ethereum. The loss stems from forgotten or inaccessible credentials, effectively locking away a fortune that will never enter the market unless recovered.

With sentiment riding high and technicals pointing to a breakout, traders are watching closely to see if ETH can finally surpass its all-time high and enter a new chapter in its market history — one defined by both record valuations and extraordinary blockchain narratives.

Arkham Intelligence has revealed a striking chapter in Ethereum's history — one that underscores both the potential and the risks of early crypto investment. According to their report, Rain Lohmus, a well-known Estonian investor and entrepreneur, spent just $75,000 on ETH during the 2015 initial coin offering (ICO).

Those coins, purchased when Ethereum was still in its infancy, would today be worth over $1 billion. Unfortunately, Lohmus lost access to the wallet, rendering the fortune permanently inaccessible unless the keys are recovered — a near-impossible feat without the original credentials.

This story surfaces at a pivotal moment for Ethereum. The asset is trading near $4,700, within striking distance of its all-time high at $4,860, and market dynamics are turning increasingly favorable for bulls. Supply on exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks is drying up rapidly, a sign of strong accumulation from both retail and institutional players. As fewer coins are available for sale, upward price pressure intensifies, especially when demand remains strong.

Ethereum is on the verge of entering uncharted territory, and the broader altcoin market is showing renewed signs of life, fueled by ETH's leadership. The next few days could be critical in determining whether Ethereum breaks decisively higher, setting new records and potentially igniting a fresh wave of altcoin rallies.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,699 on the weekly chart, up 10.52% in the latest session, as bullish momentum pushes the asset toward its all-time high near $4,860. The recent rally has been fueled by a decisive breakout above the $3,860 resistance zone, which now acts as strong support.

Technically, ETH is trading well above its 50-week SMA ($2,776), 100-week SMA ($2,763), and 200-week SMA ($2,443), reflecting a strong long-term bullish trend. The slope of the 50-week SMA has turned sharply upward, underscoring the strength of the current move. The vertical nature of the breakout from the $2,852–$3,860 range highlights intense buying pressure, likely supported by institutional flows and reduced exchange supply.

If ETH can close above $4,860, it will enter price discovery for the first time since November 2021, potentially triggering accelerated gains as momentum traders and long-term investors add to positions. However, the $4,700–$4,860 range remains a major resistance zone where profit-taking could temporarily slow the rally.

A growing sentiment in the cryptocurrency community suggests that XRP could be on the verge of becoming the next big crypto asset after Bitcoin. A recent exchange on the social media platform X between investment account Invest In Assets and crypto commentator Jake Claver relayed this sentiment, especially when it comes to selling too soon. The discussion comes when XRP is at its greatest level of support among its supporters, with some predicting it could mirror the meteoric runs made by Bitcoin in previous market cycles.

XRP Following In The Footsteps Of Bitcoin

The conversation began when an account on X known as “Invest In Assets” advised investors against prematurely selling a big winner. In response, Jake Claver noted Bitcoin's runs as textbook examples of missed opportunities. Particularly, he noted that the mistake of selling too early happened to many people with Bitcoin, and it will ultimately happen again with XRP.

Many traders who were fortunate to invest in Bitcoin very early exited when it started to soar in 2017 and 2021, only to watch prices soar far higher. Now, XRP is being framed as the next potential case study, and many analysts, not only Jake Claver, argue that the psychological trap of early profit-taking could strike again.

Adding more weight to this argument is crypto commentator Vincent Van Code's claim that Bitcoin was only an experiment, while XRP represents the final form of money. According to Van Code, although Bitcoin revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency with a fixed supply, its slow speed, high transaction costs, and scarcity-focused design ultimately limit its global liquidity potential. 

XRP, which is engineered for speed, scalability, and cross-border liquidity, offers a far more practical architecture for real-world value transfer.

Don't Sell XRP Too Early

The discussions about not selling XRP early have taken strong root among investors looking to position themselves ahead of what could be another run. This ties into a similar admonishment by investor Johnny Crypto, who once revealed his personal perspective of selling too early. 

Particularly, Johnny Crypto recalled how selling his Amazon stock too early in 1997 cost him $52 million in missed gains, an error he's determined not to repeat with XRP. He even warned that banks could attempt to seize control of retail crypto holdings within the next year and advised investors to think strategically about asset protection.

XRP has already broken above its 2018 peak of $3.40 to register a new all-time high of $3.65 this cycle. However, several technical analyses have predicted the possibility of entering double-digit territory before the end of 2025.

Analysts agree that the most important thing is patience, because the biggest mistake XRP holders can make this cycle might be selling before the real rally begins. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.24, up by 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soared to $102 in initial trades on Wednesday, their first day of action on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share, above the expected $32 to $33 range. That price valued the Cayman Island-based crypto exchange at a total market value of $5.4 billion.

Bullish, which is the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this week expanded the amount of shares it sold in its IPO to 20.3 million as investor appetite turned out to be larger than anticipated. Both BlackRock and Ark Investment Management had expressed interest to buy up to $200 million worth of shares.

“The last leg of growth in crypto in the last 10 years was basically all retail and if you look now, the institutional wave has begun, it's here, it's a question of how big it will be,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley said in an interview with CNBC.

Unlike retail-focused exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, Bullish targets institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets while relying on the oversight and safeguards of a centralized platform.

The exchange saw trading volume of over $1.25 trillion as of March 31, since its launch in 2021, according to a filing.

“Bullish's $1.1 billion IPO raise reflects growing institutional confidence in the crypto exchange sector, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration and Bitcoin's surge past $100,000,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

“This success, alongside Circle's strong IPO performance, signals that institutional investors are increasingly viewing centralized exchanges as viable long-term investments. However, sustained confidence will depend on regulatory clarity and market stability,” he said.

The company's debut comes at a time of booming interest in crypto-related projects, specifically from Wall Street, as U.S. regulators are getting close to a regulatory framework for the space, allowing participants to engage in a safe way.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on Ethereum have leapfrogged Solana for the first time since April after a swift shift in sentiment away from Solana-based memecoins and towards ether {{ETH}} amid a wave of institutional activity. 

Over the past 48 hours Ethereum-based DEXs have facilitated $24.5 billion in trading volume compared to Solana's tally of $10 billion, according to DefiLlama.

The two weeks prior were also dominated by Ethereum, with a total of $28 billion and $27 billion beating Solana's total of $20 billion and $24 billion.

This represents a contrast in trader behavior from earlier this year, which was dominated by Solana and BNB Chain in a wave of speculative memecoin trading.

However, institutional flows into spot ether ETFs has buoyed the second largest cryptocurrency, lifting it to $4,680 this month after a 53% gain over the past 30 days.

Coinglass data shows that Monday's net inflows to ETFs topped $1 billion for the first time ever, this was followed by more relentless buying on Tuesday with another $523 million inflow.

Solana, meanwhile, appears to have lost its magic in the second quarter of this year.  In January, for example, DEX volumes topped $98 billion in one week and $84 billion in the next. That hype subsided after U.S. President Donald Trump released the TRUMP memecoin, which ultimately lost more than 88% of its value over the subsequent seven months, a moment that obliterated investor confidence in memecoins.

Uniswap remains the most commonly used DEX on Ethereum with $8.6 billion being traded over the past 24 hours, the next best being Fluid, which topped $1 billion during the same period.

The change in behavior could bode well for Ethereum-based staking tokens, which experienced a boost following SEC clarification last week. Tokens like LDO , the governance token of liquid staking protocol Lido are up by 65% over the past week.

 Bitcoin already has new key price levels beyond current all-time highs as traders wait for Ether price discovery to hit. 

Key points:

Bitcoin takes another shot at price discovery as volatility returns with Wall Street traders.

Crypto liquidations pass $500 million in 24 hours.

Ether comes within $150 of new all-time highs as institutional interest surges.

Bitcoin (BTC) sought new all-time highs at the Wednesday Wall Street open as institutional demand punished late shorts.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD piercing the $122,000 mark before cooling.

Up 1% on the day, the pair faced resistance around current all-time highs as short positions were liquidated across crypto markets.

Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass put total 24-hour liquidations at over half a billion dollars at the time of writing.

“$BTC went right through,” trading commentator TheKingfisher summarized in part of a reaction on X.

Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades concluded that Bitcoin would either continue to range or break out into price discovery next.

“BTC is still range-bound currently and will need to either break out into price discovery or continue to go sideways to build up more positions on both sides,” he told X followers about the CoinGlass data. 

Anticipation of new all-time highs for the top altcoin, Ether (ETH), continued to build on the day, with ETH/USD reaching its highest levels since December 2021 — less than $150 away from uncharted territory.

Both Ether and Bitcoin fielded increased institutional interest. As Cointelegraph reported, blockchain technology firm BitMine announced a $20 billion fundraising round to purchase ETH, while institutional entities made up 75% of Coinbase trading volume on Tuesday.

In further good news for the bulls, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital said that $120,000 was now BTC price support.

“Bitcoin has fully confirmed its breakout from the Bull Flag and turned the $120k level into new support. Bitcoin has entered trend continuation, with a chance at challenging new All Time Highs soon,” he wrote on the day.

Rekt Capital added that $126,000 would be the “pivotal” price point to watch.

 Standard Chartered now sees ETH hitting $7,500 in 2025, fueled by record ETF and treasury buying, stablecoin growth and Ethereum network upgrades. 

Standard Chartered has raised its Ether price forecast for 2025 to $7,500, up from a previous $4,000 target, citing a surge in institutional buying and the accelerating adoption of stablecoins following recent US regulatory changes.

In a report shared with Cointelegraph, the bank said Ether (ETH) treasury companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have acquired 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June, almost double the fastest rate of Bitcoin accumulation by similar entities during the 2024 US election cycle.

“A lot has changed since our last ETH forecast update in March,” Standard Chartered wrote. “The first strongly positive sign was significant industry engagement from the Ethereum Foundation and Etherialize, two of the organisations behind the Ethereum ecosystem,” it added.

The British bank also noted plans by Vitalik Buterin to boost Ethereum's layer-1 throughput by 10x, enabling more high-value transactions to settle onchain while delegating smaller transfers to layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Base.

Standard Chartered cited the passage of the GENIUS Act in July as another major catalyst. The legislation provides a clear framework for stablecoins, paving the way for mainstream adoption. The bank noted that stablecoins account for 40% of all blockchain fees, with over half issued on Ethereum.

The bank expects the sector's market capitalization to grow eightfold to $2 trillion by 2028, driving both direct and indirect demand for Ethereum through decentralised finance (DeFi) growth, where ETH already holds a 65% share of total value locked.

Standard Chartered anticipates ETH will surpass its previous all-time high by the end of Q3 2025, continuing its recent outperformance against Bitcoin. It projects the ETH-BTC ratio will climb from 0.036 to 0.05 as Ethereum's fundamentals strengthen.

At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,692, less than 4% from its previous ATH of $4,891 registered in November 2021, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Meanwhile, Standard Chartered's new long-term outlook sets ETH at $12,000 in 2026, $18,000 in 2027 and $25,000 by 2028.

With ETH nearing a new all-time high, profit-taking is kicking in. As reported, the Ethereum whale collective known as 7 Siblings has sold $88.2 million worth of ETH over the past day, unloading 19,461 ETH at an average price of $4,532.

The Ethereum Foundation also sold 2,795 ETH worth about $12.7 million in two transactions late Tuesday.

Why Glacial Lake Outbursts like the One in Alaska May Happen More Often

Meltwater from a glacial lake outburst is flooding Juneau, Alaska. Such events are likely to happen more often as climate change destabilizes ice and glacial lakes fill with more meltwater

Meltwater from a glacial outburst near Juneau, Alaska, is flooding nearby neighborhoods, and officials are urging some residents of the city of 30,000 to evacuate.

The meltwater is rushing downstream from Suicide Basin, a basin of water dammed in by the Mendenhall Glacier. As of 6:00 A.M. local time on Wednesday morning, the Mendenhall River was in a major flood stage. At 16.17 feet (4.93 meters) and rising, the water level had passed the record flood stage of 15.99 feet (4.87 m) that hit during an August 2024 glacial outburst flood, according to the National Weather Service.

The river and Mendenhall Lake, both of which are downstream from the glacier's tongue, are under a flood warning. The NWS predicts the Mendenhall River will crest at up to 16.75 feet (5.11 m) around 8 A.M. local time on Wednesday.

Glacial outburst floods happen when the ice dams holding back glacial lakes fail, allowing a sudden release of water. They're unpredictable and happen without warning. A 2023 study found that, globally, 15 million people live in areas that could flood. More than half of people in at-risk areas are in India, Pakistan, China and Peru. And with a warming climate, ice is becoming more unstable, and glacial lakes are growing—a 2020 study based on satellite imagery found that, between 1990 and 2018, the volume of water dammed in glacial lakes had grown by 48 percent.

Suicide Basin has flooded before. In fact, according to the NWS, the basin has released an outburst flood at least once a year since 2011. These floods have now set a record three years in a row: In 2023 the river crested at 14.97 feet (4.56 m) after an outburst, a record exceeded just a year later in the August 2024 flood. Some residents had to evacuate by inflatable boat in the middle of the night during the 2024 outburst, according to the American Red Cross. Now, only a year after that disaster, the river is setting a new record.

It's a threat glaciologists in mountainous areas around the world are trying to better understand, said Fabian Walter, now a senior scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, in an interview with Scientific American in 2020. “These glaciated mountain faces were more or less stable,” Walter said. “And now, with climate change, the whole stability is changing.”

These Spiders Puke Up Toxic Digestive Fluid to Marinate Their Prey Alive

Without a venomous bite, some spiders use a disturbing second option to prepare their food

You don't always need a book or movie for a good horror story. Sometimes, if you dare look closely enough, you can find one in your own backyard. Researchers have just confirmed the inner workings of a brutal food-prep technique some spiders use: wrapping their web-snagged prey tightly in silk strands, then puking up toxic digestive fluids to soak the entire package to marinate their meal alive.

Spiders from the Uloboridae family, usually just a few millimeters long, have puzzled scientists because they seemed to lack venom—a substance that is widespread among spiders and “really linked to their evolutionary success,” says Alex Winsor, a neuroethologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who wasn't involved in the new research.

And there was another mystery. Uloboridae spiders were already known to wrap their prey in hundreds of meters of silk and then regurgitate on them, but researchers hadn't fully pinned down the function of their dramatic vomit. Intrigued, a study team took a closer look at how these predators prepare a snack for themselves. The findings were published in BMC Biology.

By analyzing one species called Uloborus plumipes, the researchers confirmed that these spiders lack venom glands and thus are unable to administer venom in the classic spider way: injecting it into their prey with a fanged bite. But the scientists did find genes actively producing toxinlike proteins in the spiders' digestive system—particularly in the midgut area—and these potential toxins “appear to be very strong,” says study co-author Giulia Zancolli, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

Injecting these digestive fluids into fruit flies in the laboratory proved their high toxicity: just 230 nanograms—billionths of a gram—killed more than half the flies within an hour. The researchers theorize that these spiders do indeed marinate their prey to death this way. Strangely, some spiders from other families that kill with the usual venomous bites are also known to have toxins in their digestive fluids, Zancolli says. This fact raises what she calls a “fascinating question”: What role do these substances play for species outside the Uloboridae family?

The study's finding “solves a puzzle within spider biology,” Winsor says. A next step, he adds, could be to investigate whether digestive-system toxins appear in other animal species, such as some lizards. “If these compounds do have some special ability to subdue insects, then you might expect them to emerge in other groups of animals,” Winsor says. If that proves true, “then maybe these are a recurring answer in the animal kingdom.”

Why ChatGPT Shouldn't Be Your Therapist

Using AI chatbots for “therapy” is dangerous, mental health experts say. Here's why

By Allison Parshall edited by Dean Visser

Keeproll/Getty Images

Artificial intelligence chatbots don't judge. Tell them the most private, vulnerable details of your life, and most of them will validate you and may even provide advice. This has resulted in many people turning to applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT for life guidance.

But AI “therapy” comes with significant risks—in late July OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned ChatGPT users against using the chatbot as a “therapist” because of privacy concerns. The American Psychological Association (APA) has called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate “deceptive practices” that the APA claims AI chatbot companies are using by “passing themselves off as trained mental health providers,” citing two ongoing lawsuits in which parents have alleged harm brought to their children by a chatbot.

“What stands out to me is just how humanlike it sounds,” says C. Vaile Wright, a licensed psychologist and senior director of the APA's Office of Health Care Innovation, which focuses on the safe and effective use of technology in mental health care. “The level of sophistication of the technology, even relative to six to 12 months ago, is pretty staggering. And I can appreciate how people kind of fall down a rabbit hole.”

Scientific American spoke with Wright about how AI chatbots used for therapy could potentially be dangerous and whether it's possible to engineer one that is reliably both helpful and safe.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

What have you seen happening with AI in the mental health care world in the past few years?

I think we've seen kind of two major trends. One is AI products geared toward providers, and those are primarily administrative tools to help you with your therapy notes and your claims.

The other major trend is [people seeking help from] direct-to-consumer chatbots. And not all chatbots are the same, right? You have some chatbots that are developed specifically to provide emotional support to individuals, and that's how they're marketed. Then you have these more generalist chatbot offerings [such as ChatGPT] that were not designed for mental health purposes but that we know are being used for that purpose.

What concerns do you have about this trend? 

We have a lot of concern when individuals use chatbots [as if they were a therapist]. Not only were these not designed to address mental health or emotional support; they're actually being coded in a way to keep you on the platform for as long as possible because that's the business model. And the way that they do that is by being unconditionally validating and reinforcing, almost to the point of sycophancy.

The problem with that is that if you are a vulnerable person coming to these chatbots for help, and you're expressing harmful or unhealthy thoughts or behaviors, the chatbot's just going to reinforce you to continue to do that. Whereas, [as] a therapist, while I might be validating, it's my job to point out when you're engaging in unhealthy or harmful thoughts and behaviors and to help you to address that pattern by changing it.

And in addition, what's even more troubling is when these chatbots actually refer to themselves as a therapist or a psychologist. It's pretty scary because they can sound very convincing and like they are legitimate—when of course they're not.

Some of these apps explicitly market themselves as “AI therapy” even though they're not licensed therapy providers. Are they allowed to do that? 

A lot of these apps are really operating in a gray space. The rule is that if you make claims that you treat or cure any sort of mental disorder or mental illness, then you should be regulated by the FDA [the U.S. Food and Drug Administration]. But a lot of these apps will [essentially] say in their fine print, “We do not treat or provide an intervention [for mental health conditions].”

Because they're marketing themselves as a direct-to-consumer wellness app, they don't fall under FDA oversight, [where they'd have to] demonstrate at least a minimal level of safety and effectiveness. These wellness apps have no responsibility to do either.

What are some of the main privacy risks?

These chatbots have absolutely no legal obligation to protect your information at all. So not only could [your chat logs] be subpoenaed, but in the case of a data breach, do you really want these chats with a chatbot available for everybody? Do you want your boss, for example, to know that you are talking to a chatbot about your alcohol use? I don't think people are as aware that they're putting themselves at risk by putting [their information] out there.

The difference with the therapist is: sure, I might get subpoenaed, but I do have to operate under HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] laws and other types of confidentiality laws as part of my ethics code.

You mentioned that some people might be more vulnerable to harm than others. Who is most at risk?

Certainly younger individuals, such as teenagers and children. That's in part because they just developmentally haven't matured as much as older adults. They may be less likely to trust their gut when something doesn't feel right. And there have been some data that suggest that not only are young people more comfortable with these technologies; they actually say they trust them more than people because they feel less judged by them. Also, anybody who is emotionally or physically isolated or has preexisting mental health challenges, I think they're certainly at greater risk as well.

What do you think is driving more people to seek help from chatbots?

I think it's very human to want to seek out answers to what's bothering us. In some ways, chatbots are just the next iteration of a tool for us to do that. Before it was Google and the Internet. Before that, it was self-help books. But it's complicated by the fact that we do have a broken system where, for a variety of reasons, it's very challenging to access mental health care. That's in part because there is a shortage of providers. We also hear from providers that they are disincentivized from taking insurance, which, again, reduces access. Technologies need to play a role in helping to address access to care. We just have to make sure it's safe and effective and responsible.

What are some of the ways it could be made safe and responsible?

In the absence of companies doing it on their own—which is not likely, although they have made some changes to be sure—[the APA's] preference would be legislation at the federal level. That regulation could include protection of confidential personal information, some restrictions on advertising, minimizing addictive coding tactics, and specific audit and disclosure requirements. For example, companies could be required to report the number of times suicidal ideation was detected and any known attempts or completions. And certainly we would want legislation that would prevent the misrepresentation of psychological services, so companies wouldn't be able to call a chatbot a psychologist or a therapist.

How could an idealized, safe version of this technology help people?

The two most common use cases that I think of is, one, let's say it's two in the morning, and you're on the verge of a panic attack. Even if you're in therapy, you're not going be able to reach your therapist. So what if there was a chatbot that could help remind you of the tools to help to calm you down and adjust your panic before it gets too bad?

The other use that we hear a lot about is using chatbots as a way to practice social skills, particularly for younger individuals. So you want to approach new friends at school, but you don't know what to say. Can you practice on this chatbot? Then, ideally, you take that practice, and you use it in real life.

It seems like there is a tension in trying to build a safe chatbot to provide mental help to someone: the more flexible and less scripted you make it, the less control you have over the output and the higher risk that it says something that causes harm. 

I agree. I think there absolutely is a tension there. I think part of what makes the [AI] chatbot the go-to choice for people over well-developed wellness apps to address mental health is that they are so engaging. They really do feel like this interactive back-and-forth, a kind of exchange, whereas some of these other apps' engagement is often very low. The majority of people that download [mental health apps] use them once and abandon them. We're clearly seeing much more engagement [with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT].

I look forward to a future where you have a mental health chatbot that is rooted in psychological science, has been rigorously tested, is co-created with experts. It would be built for the purpose of addressing mental health, and therefore it would be regulated, ideally by the FDA. For example, there's a chatbot called Therabot that was developed by researchers at Dartmouth [College]. It's not what's on the commercial market right now, but I think there is a future in that.

Entirely New Species of Human Ancestor Discovered

Ancient teeth found in Ethiopia belong to a never-before-seen species in the Australopithecus genus of human ancestors

By Kate Wong edited by Jeanna Bryner

Thirteen fossilized teeth were collected in the Ledi-Geraru Research Area from 2015 to 2018. The collections at LD 750 and LD 760 localities represent a newly discovered species of Australopithecus. LD 302 and AS 100 represent early Homo already known from the LD 350 mandible discovered in 2013.

Researchers working in northeastern Ethiopia have discovered remains of a previously unknown branch of humanity. The fossils, which include teeth that date to between 2.8 million and 2.6 million years ago, belong to a never-before-seen member of the genus Australopithecus—the same genus to which the famous Lucy fossil belongs. They show that this newly identified member of the human family lived alongside early representatives of our own genus, Homo. The findings were published in Nature on August 13.

The discovery team, led by investigators at Arizona State University, has yet to name the new species because the researchers need more fossils from other parts of the body to do so. But comparisons of the teeth with other fossils from the same site—Ledi-Geraru in the Afar Region of Ethiopia—as well as with other hominin fossils, revealed that they are distinctive enough to represent a species of Australopithecus that is new to science.

The Ledi-Geraru paleontological team searches for fossils in the Lee Adoyta Basin in Ethiopia, where the genera Homo and Australopithecus have been recovered.

Together with previous finds, the new fossils demonstrate that at least four lineages of hominins (creatures more closely related to us than to our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos) lived in eastern Africa between three million and 2.5 million years ago.

How these hominins were able to share the landscape is a question the team is working to answer. One possible explanation is that they preferred different foods. Studies of the enamel of their fossilized teeth may yield clues to what they were eating.

Once upon a time, scholars thought that human evolution was a march of progress in which our forebears evolved in linear fashion from an apelike ancestor to a series of increasingly humanlike forms. The new find underscores the complexity of human origins. Although Homo sapiens is the only hominin species on Earth today, for the vast majority of humanity's existence, multiple hominin species shared the planet. Our family tree is more like a bush, with lots of twigs that were dead ends—failed evolutionary experiments that occurred outside of our direct line of ancestry.

A single bout of either resistance or high intensity interval training could help in the cancer battle, new research from Edith Cowan University (ECU) has found.

ECU PhD student Mr Francesco Bettariga found that a single bout of exercise increased the levels of myokines, a protein produced by muscles which have anti-cancer effects, and which could reduce the proliferation of cancer growth by 20 to 30 per cent.

""Exercise has emerged as a therapeutic intervention in the management of cancer, and a large body of evidence exists that show the safety and effectiveness of exercise as medicine, either during or post cancer treatment,"" Mr Bettariga said.

His research with survivors of breast cancer measured myokine levels before, immediately after and 30 minutes post a single bout of either resistance of high intensity interval training and found that both sets of exercise had a resultant increase in myokine levels.

While higher levels of myokines were expected in a healthy population, post a vigorous workout, Mr Bettariga investigated whether breast cancer survivors would see the same results, given the impact that cancer treatments and cancer itself often has on the body.

""The results from the study show that both types of exercise really work to produce these anti-cancer myokines in breast cancer survivors. The results from this study are excellent motivators to add exercise as standard care in the treatment of cancer,"" Mr Bettariga said.

He added that the long-term implications of elevated myokine levels should be further investigated, particularly in relation to cancer recurrence.

Further research by Mr Bettariga investigated how changes in body composition, following consistent exercise, could impact inflammation, which plays a key role in breast cancer recurrence and mortality by promoting tumour progression.

Persistent inflammation not only promotes tumour progression by influencing cell proliferation, survival, invasiveness, and metastasis, but also inhibits immune function. Given that the cancer itself and the side-effects of treatments can elevate levels of inflammatory biomarkers, survivors of breast cancer are at increased risk of cancer progression, recurrence and mortality.

""Strategies are needed to reduce inflammation which may provide a less supportive environment for cancer progression, leading to a lower risk of recurrence and mortality in survivors of breast cancer,"" Mr Bettariga said.

The new research found that by reducing fat mass and increasing lean mass, through consistent and persistent exercise, cancer survivors had a better chance at reducing inflammation.

""If we are able to improve body composition, we have a better chance of decreasing inflammation because we are improving lean mass and reducing fat mass, which is responsible for releasing anti and pro-inflammatory markers,"" Mr Bettariga said.

Unfortunately, quick fixes to reduce fat mass would not have the same beneficial effects, Mt Bettariga stressed.

""You never want to reduce your weight without exercising, because you need to build or preserve muscle mass and produce these chemicals that you can't do through just diet alone.""

The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus.

Over the past few decades, the African hominin fossil record predating 3.0 million years ago (Ma) has expanded to include several potential ancestors for later taxa4,5,6,7. Currently, systematic analyses place A. afarensis as the most likely candidate for the middle Pliocene stem taxon from which multiple later hominin genera (that is, Homo and Paranthropus), and possibly other species of Australopithecus, descended8,9,10. A. afarensis was geographically and temporally widespread, and fossil sites with its remains are known from Tanzania to northern Ethiopia and, potentially, Chad. However, temporally, A. afarensis is not known after 2.95 Ma (ref. 11).

Paranthropus and Homo are well-documented in the eastern African fossil record after 2.0 Ma, especially in the Omo-Turkana Basin and at northern Tanzanian localities12,13,14,15, but the hominin fossil record between the last appearance of A. afarensis (around 2.95 Ma) and 2.0 Ma is patchy. For example, no Paranthropus fossils have been recorded from the Afar Region to date, despite its presence in the Omo-Turkana Basin and at Nyayanga, Kenya2 at approximately 2.7 Ma and in the Upper Ndolanya Beds at Laetoli16 at about 2.66 Ma. Additionally, a Homo specimen at Ledi-Geraru, Ethiopia, extends the genus closer in time17 (2.78 Ma) to the last known appearance of A. afarensis1,11. However a simple cladogenic model of A. afarensis, or any other stem taxon, splitting into these daughter genera is complicated by the presence of A. garhi in the Afar3 at approximately 2.5 Ma.

The Ledi-Geraru Research Project (LGRP) area is located towards the northern extent of palaeoanthropological sites in the Afar Region, Ethiopia (Extended Data Fig. 1). New discoveries in Ledi-Geraru suggest that early Homo and Australopithecus were both present in the Afar Region before 2.5 Ma, just as early Homo and Paranthropus are sympatric in the Omo-Turkana Basin and sites to the south18,19 after about 2 Ma. Whether the apparent absence of Paranthropus from the Afar Region reflects the spotty nature of the fossil record or a biogeographical signal is yet to be determined. What is clear is that the Afar Region has currently yielded the only definitive evidence for Australopithecus in eastern Africa after 2.95 Ma—A. garhi and the newly discovered specimens from Ledi-Geraru.

The LGRP area contains fossiliferous sediments from the critical 3.0–2.0 Ma time period17. The fossil sites in the Lee Adoyta and Asboli regions of the LGRP area are located west of the Awash River in a region incised by the Mille and Geraru River drainages and their tributaries (Extended Data Fig. 1). The 3.0–2.5 Ma fossiliferous sediments are exposed in fault blocks bounded by post-depositional northeast–southwest and nothwest–southeast trending faults (Fig. 1); age control is provided by many dated and correlated tephra deposits and by magnetostratigraphy17. Detailed 40Ar/39Ar dating methods are described in Methods.

The distribution and stratigraphy of fossiliferous units and tephra deposits provide context for the hominin fossils described here, which were discovered in sediments cropping out in the Lee Adoyta and Asboli regions (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). The Gurumaha sedimentary package is present in narrow fault-bounded exposures in the central Lee Adoyta basin and in drag-faulted blocks adjacent to basalt ridges bounding the basin to the east (Fig. 1a). The Gurumaha Tuff (GT), a light grey lapilli tuff dated to 2.782 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ; recalculated17,20), provides age control for the unit (Fig. 1b). Stratigraphically younger, the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package is widely exposed in the Lee Adoyta basin and is correlated to exposures in Asboli (Fig. 1). The Lee Adoyta Tuffs (LAT) comprise two thin, geochemically distinct tephras: a yellow altered basaltic ash which occurs approximately 10 cm above a white rhyolitic ash dated to 2.631 ± 0.011 Ma (1σ; recalculated17,20). These tuffs, and an underlying olive-green clay, provide an excellent marker sequence (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). The Giddi Sands sedimentary package (Tgs; containing the Giddi Sands Tuff (GST)) and the Markaytoli sedimentary package (Tmk; containing the Markaytoli Tuff) crop out in the eastern Lee Adoyta basin (Fig. 1a). The base of the Giddi Sands sedimentary package is an erosional unconformity cutting into the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package in the Lee Adoyta Basin (Fig. 1b). The GST is a 3- to 8-cm-thick laminated, multicoloured (orange, yellow and white), crystal bentonite tuff. 40Ar/39Ar single-crystal incremental heating (SCIH) yielded a weighted-mean age of 2.593 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ) for the GST sampled in Asboli (Methods and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). In Asboli, the Giddi Sands sedimentary package containing the AS 100 fossil site unconformably overlies a sequence of mudstones containing the Asboli Tuffs, which in turn overlies the LAT exposed approximately 500 m to the south (Fig. 1c).

Hominin dental specimens (Fig. 2) were recovered from the three sedimentary packages described above—the Gurumaha, Lee Adoyta, and Giddi Sands (Table 1). Comparative methods and sampling protocols are described in Methods.

Right, from top: LD 302-23 P3, LD 750 P4, AS 100 M1 and AS 100 M2. Left, images show the LD 760 assemblage (top, from left: maxillary molar, I2, I1, maxillary canine; bottom, mandibular molars).

A mandibular right third premolar, LD 302-23 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3), was recovered approximately 22 m to the southwest and 7 m stratigraphically below the LD 350 early Homo mandible locality1, above the Gurumaha Tuff17 (Fig. 1b). An enamel fragment is missing from the lingual corner, but the crown is otherwise well preserved. The crown is shorter mesiodistally (MD) than buccolingually (BL) (11.5 mm BL × 10.5 mm MD; Extended Data Fig. 3) and the major crown axis is oriented buccolingually. A relatively small metaconid sits well mesial to the protoconid, creating a tiny, centrally placed anterior fovea that is bounded by a low, but continuous, mesial marginal ridge. Occlusal wear makes it difficult to determine if the metaconid would have been completely distinct from the protoconid at the outer enamel surface. The talonid is mesiodistally short and occupies a relatively small portion of the crown area in occlusal view.

LD 302-23 departs strongly in shape and occlusal form from P3s attributed to Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus deyiremeda, and unicuspid specimens of A. afarensis (for example, A.L. 128-23 and A.L. 288-1), in which the major axis of an asymmetric crown runs mesiobuccal to distolingual and in having a continuous mesial marginal ridge that creates a ‘closed' anterior fovea7,21,22 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Some A. afarensis specimens (such as A.L. 437-2) resemble the crown outline of LD 302-23 (Extended Data Fig. 3a); however, LD 302-23 also differs from those specimens in having a mesially shifted metaconid, which creates an acute angle between the transverse crest and mesial protoconid crest, and in having a highly reduced anterior fovea relative to crown size23. In crown shape index (MD/BL), LD 302-23 falls in the middle range of the A. afarensis distribution (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). In area (BL × MD), LD 302-23 falls within the range of the A. afarensis size distribution, at the lower limit of the range of Paranthropus boisei, but within the range of values of Paranthropus robustus (Extended Data Fig. 3b,d). Unlike Paranthropus12, the talonid of LD 302-23 is not expansive. We attribute LD 302-23 to Homo for a number of reasons. Although the sample of P3s attributed to early Homo is morphologically diverse (for example, KNM-ER 5431, OMO 75-14, KNM-ER 1802 and OH 7), LD 302-23 is clearly derived relative to pre-3.0 Ma Australopithecus, lacks the suite of derived nonmetric features characteristic of Paranthropus, and is consistent with the size, crown morphology and mesiodistal compression of the LD 350-1 specimen (the LD 350-1 P3 crown is damaged mesiolingually, with only around 65% of the crown remaining), which was found in the same sedimentary package and shares numerous dental and mandibular apomorphies with Homo.

An isolated P4, LD 750-115670 (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4), was collected from locality LD 750 at the base of an approximately 8-m-thick fossiliferous exposure of mudstone and sandstone. The stratigraphic position of the locality lies between the 2.63 Ma LAT and the 2.59 Ma GST (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). The LD 750 P4 is unworn, with salient mesial cusps (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The roots are broken beneath the crown, but the mesial portion preserves a maximum root height of about 2.0 mm. The tooth may not have been fully erupted, as there are no interproximal contact facets and the occlusal surface is unworn. The protoconid and metaconid are shifted relatively mesially on the crown and tightly compressed BL, giving the tooth a slightly ‘puffy' appearance. The anterior fovea is distinct and deep, but relatively small (reflecting the mesial placement of the cusps), centrally placed and bounded by a narrow mesial marginal ridge. The talonid is relatively large, the distal marginal ridge is low and rounded, and a distinct, but low, distolingual cusp is present, giving the tooth an asymmetric occlusal profile.

With dimensions of 12.4 mm BL × 11.4 mm MD, the tooth area is in the upper size range of A. afarensis, exceeded in area only by A.L. 996-1 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Morphologically, however, the LD 750 P4 departs from the typical Hadar A. afarensis appearance. For example, the lingual to mesial face transition is smooth and rounded, whereas in Hadar P4s there is a more distinct corner. The occlusal layout differs from that of Hadar P4s in that the metaconid and protoconid are placed more centrally in relation to buccolingual crown breadth and shifted mesially in relation to crown length. Thus, compared with Hadar A. afarensis teeth, the buccal face is more convex occlusocervically and the anterior fovea more confined. The index of protoconid–metaconid apex distance/BL breadth shows the central placement of the LD 750 mesial cusp apices in relation to crown breadth compared with A. afarensis (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

Not only is LD 750 large relative to most A. afarensis specimens, it also exceeds the area of all specimens attributed to A. anamensis and all but two specimens of Australopithecus africanus (StW 498 and StW 384). The LD 750 crown area falls within the size distribution of P. robustus and Paranthropus aethiopicus; however, it lacks any of the distinct ‘molarization' seen in Paranthropus P4s (for example, expanded talonid and distal cusps, thick marginal ridges, symmetrically rounded occlusal profile caused by the filling of the crown distobuccally, and surface complexity in unworn specimens12). We note that the known specimen of A. garhi lacks any mandibular remains3, but LD 750 cannot be excluded from that species on the basis of size alone (see randomization analysis in Extended Data Fig. 4e). In occlusal form and crown outline, LD 750 does resemble OMO 75-14 (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which has been attributed to aff. Homo by Suwa et al.12 and Hlusko et al.24, and KNM-ER 5431, which is also attributed to Homo by Suwa et al.12. However, these attributions are provisional and based mostly on the nonmetric morphology of their associated molars (for example, presence of C7 on M1 and M2 of both specimens). In fact, P4 morphology poorly distinguishes between early Homo and Australopithecus12,24. Thus, the phenetic resemblance between OMO 75-14, KNM-ER 5431 and LD 750, which are all large but lack features typical of Paranthropus, could be most parsimoniously interpreted as symplesiomorphic retentions. Since LD 750-115670 lacks any clear Homo synapomorphies associated with other specimens of early Homo from Koobi Fora (such as talonid reduction in KNM-ER 99225), we provisionally assign it to aff. Australopithecus.

An associated set of five mandibular molars, a maxillary molar fragment, and three maxillary anterior teeth (Fig. 2 and Table 1) representing a single individual were collected at locality LD 760, a relatively flat-lying area dominated by fine-grained sand and silts (Supplementary Video 1). The hominin teeth were all found in close association, in a relatively dense cluster among scattered faunal elements (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The mandibular molars were found eroding from the surface and the maxillary dentition was sieved from the surface silt (approximately 5–10 cm of loose and eroded surface soil) downslope on a gentle gradient over a 7 × 4 m area to the northwest. The LD 760 collection area lies approximately 10 m below the 2.631 ± 0.011 Ma LAT17 mapped in hillslopes surrounding the site (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Mammalian fossils were also observed eroding from sand units around 3.5 m and 6.5 m above the LAT (Fig. 1b). However, on the basis of the slope and distance to these sand units, as well as the abundance and spread of other fossil specimens, the hominin teeth and other fossils on the LD 760 surface represent a distinct fossiliferous unit below the LAT.

The LD 760 mandibular molars are moderately worn, with dentine exposure visible at buccal cusp apices in the M1 (Fig. 3). They are relatively wide BL compared to their MD length (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6) and do not taper strongly distally, which gives the crowns, especially M1 and M2, a squarish profile (Fig. 4). The buccal grooves are indistinct, and the buccal profile is convex in occlusal view, in part because a protostylid partially fills in the buccal groove. Further, the buccal crown face slopes occlusocervically, reflecting an internal placement of cusp apices.

Left molars from Ledi-Geraru specimen LD 760 (left) and Hadar specimen A.L. 400-1 (right). Measurements in mm of the LD 760 molars (BL × MD): LM1: 13.3 × 13.4, LM2: 14.5 × 14.6, LM3: 14.0 (estimated) × 15.7, RM1: 13.2 × 13.1, RM2: 14.8 × 15.2 (Supplementary Data 1). Specimens are oriented with their buccal surfaces to the left and mesial surfaces up.

Detail of distal taper (orange lines) and bilobate contour (blue lines) seen in A. afarensis M1 specimen A.L. 400-1 (right) contrasted with the overall more equilateral occlusal profile of the LD 760 M1 (left). The M2s also show this pattern (Fig. 3). Specimens are oriented with their buccal surfaces to the left and mesial surfaces up.

There is no hint of M3 reduction (as seen, for example, in some early Homo such as LD 350-1 and OMO-75-14); instead, the molars follow the plesiomorphic pattern of relative molar size, M1 < M2 < M3. The M1 and M2 are subequally square (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), unlike in early Homo which tend to have rectangular crowns that are mesiodistally elongated. Further, the teeth are relatively simple, with few accessory cusps; the M1s show no expression of a C7, unlike LD 350-1 and KNM-ER 1802, and the M2s also lack a C7, which is seen in many specimens attributed to early Homo (for example, OMO-75-14, KNM-ER 5431, KNM-ER 60000 and OH 7). The mesiodistal dimensions of the mandibular molars comfortably fit within the metric variation seen in individual A. afarensis molars (Extended Data Fig. 5), and the buccolingual breadths fall in the upper third of the A. afarensis distribution. However, the sum of the molar areas for the LD 760 individual (614.3 mm2) exceeds all but one (NFR-VP-1/29; Woranso-Mille, Afar Region, Ethiopia) of the 11 A. afarensis individuals that preserve all 3 molars; yet, among Paranthropus, only 1 individual (DNH 7) is smaller in M1–M3 area than LD 760 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). The LD 760 molars depart from the typical feature set of A. afarensis in three ways: (1) the M1s are buccolingually broad relative to their mesiodistsal length (A. afarensis M1s and M2s are buccolingually widest across the mesial cusps, the LD 760 M1 is equally wide at midcrown and the M2 is only slightly narrower at midcrown) (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6); (2) the M1 and M2 do not taper distally to the extent seen in A. afarensis (Figs. 3 and 4); and (3) the LD 760 molars lack the distinct bilobate buccal contour seen in A. afarensis12 (Fig. 4).

A fragmentary maxillary molar, LD 760-115911, was recovered at the LD 760 locality (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Although the protocone is the only fully preserved cusp, the lingual groove is distinct occlusally and the mesial edge of the hypocone is present. On A. garhi upper molars, the lingual groove is indistinct, but the lingual margin of the crown begins to curve buccally distal to the lingual groove, reflecting the relatively small hypocone and buccolingually narrow distal crown (Extended Data Fig. 7a). This reduction in hypocone area produces a triangular form for the Bouri specimen's protocone. The LD 760 upper molar fragment shows no similar curvature of the crown margin distal to the lingual groove. Instead, it appears to have had a fully expressed hypocone. However, in terms of absolute molar area (BL × MD), the ratio of LD 760 lower molars to the A. garhi upper molars does not falsify a single-species hypothesis using modern ape comparative data—see resampling analysis in Extended Data Fig. 6b.

A right maxillary canine, a complete left maxillary lateral incisor and a left fragmentary maxillary central incisor were also found at the LD 760 locality (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The canine (LD 760-115979) is well preserved, with all but the root apex present (Fig. 5). The crown has mesial and distal interproximal contact facets. A distal interproximal contact facet is also present on the LI2, which indicates bilateral absence of a canine/I2 diastema; a diastema is present on the BOU-VP-12/130 A. garhi maxilla and is variably present in A. afarensis. The canine crown is worn apically and along the mesial and distal crests. Apical wear makes it difficult to examine the relative placement of the crown shoulders, but the mesial shoulder appears to have been placed apically. Despite the wear, the canine is not small (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c), and the ratio of the canine to molar mesiodistal dimensions puts this specimen in the upper range of Australopithecus and well beyond the observed values for Paranthropus (Extended Data Fig. 8d).

Note that the LD 760 canine is a right canine, whereas the A. afarensis canines are from the left and are mirrored in these images. b–d, LD 760-115979 (b; shown in lingual view) contrasted with Hadar A. afarensis specimen A.L. 199-1 (c; right canine shown; distal to the upper right) and Bouri A. garhi specimen BOU-VP-12/130 (d; left canine, mirrored; distal is to the right). Note the simple mesial–distal chisel-like wear pattern on the LD 760 canine (b) in contrast to the complex multi-faceted wear pattern of A. afarensis (c) and the broad curved basin on the distal side of the A. garhi upper canine (d; this is seen on both left and right canines). Images are oriented differently to emphasize the distinctive relevant morphology. Photos of BOU-VP-12/130 A. garhi holotype fossil by T. White; use courtesy of the Middle Awash research project. Images in b–d are not to scale.

The LD 760 canine departs subtly from the macrowear of A. afarensis (Fig. 5). For example, its wear pattern lacks the characteristic ‘j-pattern' along the distal crest26; instead, apical wear dominates. In basal size (10.4 mm BL × 10.5 mm MD) the tooth resembles A. afarensis and is narrower than the labio-lingually broad canine of A. garhi (Extended Data Fig. 9). The LD 760 canine also departs morphologically from A. garhi. The A. garhi canine, uniquely among hominins, possesses a broad, shallow distal basin reminiscent of a talon (Fig. 5d); this smooth basin is contiguous with a wide wear furrow that characterizes the entire postcanine dental row (Extended Data Fig. 9a).

The LD 760 individual cannot be attributed to Paranthropus. It lacks the derived reduction of anterior tooth size, which is reflected both in the absolute sizes of the anterior teeth and their size relative to the postcanine dentition (Extended Data Fig. 8d). The mandibular molars do not express relatively large C6s12 and they show a buccolingual wear gradient distinct from the planar pattern typical of Paranthropus12. The LD 760 teeth also lack any derived Homo traits (such as steeply walled molars, narrow M1, C7 presence and M3 reduction). We regard the morphology of LD 760 as inconsistent with known eastern African Australopithecus species because: (1) the lack of any of the derived A. garhi traits, notably the reduced hypocone of the maxillary molars and highly distinctive upper canine ‘talon' basin; and (2) a morphology derived relative to A. afarensis (that is, lack of bilobate mandibular molar walls and distal taper, and canine wear pattern). Because of the plesiomorphic resemblance to A. afarensis, we make a generic-level attribution and assign the LD 760 assemblage to Australopithecus sp. indet.

A partial left M1 crown with lingual cusps only partially preserved (AS 100-1a) and 2 fragments assembled into a complete left M2 crown (AS 100-1b) were discovered eroded from the approximately 1-m-thick Giddi Sands unit in the Asboli region immediately below the GST (Fig. 2, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Subsequent screening produced no additional hominin material.

Wear on these teeth is slight, with crown apices salient and no dentine exposed. Interstitial wear is present and the interproximal contact facets are congruent, consistent with identification of AS 100-1a as an M1 and AS 100-1b as an M2 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 7). The AS 100-1b M2 is rhomboidal in occlusal outline, with the cusps offset such that the buccal pair sits mesial to the lingual pair, the hypocone is relatively large and projects distolingually, and the lingual profile is straight. A. afarensis M2s range in shape from squarish (for example, A.L. 199-1, A.L. 486-1) to more rhomboidal (for example, A.L. 444-2, A.L. 200-1)27, but A. afarensis specimens invariably show more pronounced lingual occlusocervical sloping, indicating a more internally placed cuspal arrangement than is apparent for AS 100-1b. The lingual cusps of the AS 100 molars are relatively steep vertically and lack the ‘puffy' contour seen in relatively unworn specimens of A. afarensis (for example, A.L. 200-1). The rhomboidal crown outline, relatively large and projecting hypocone, and cuspal placement of AS 100-1b are closely matched by A.L. 666-1, a Homo specimen from the Busidima Formation at Hadar28 from 2.3 Ma, and MLP-1549, a Homo specimen from Mille-Logya29, 2.5–2.4 Ma. This feature set strongly contrasts with the A. garhi M2 in which the hypocone is relatively small and placed transverse to the metacone, the lingual profile is strongly curved, and the cusps are more internally placed (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In size, the AS 100-1b M2 (14.2 mm BL × 13.9 mm MD) and Homo specimen A.L. 666-1 are nearly identical and both slightly exceed the Mille-Logya M2 in BL breadth; AS 100-1b is smaller in area than the M2 of A. garhi and eastern African Paranthropus (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We attribute AS 100-1 to Homo sp. indet. based on the presence of a derived M2 crown outline (that is, rhomboidal with projecting relatively large hypocone30), a feature shared with other specimens of early Homo.

The presence of both early Homo and Australopithecus at Ledi-Geraru has implications for hominin taxonomy and diversity in this region in the 3.0–2.0 million year interval. Despite the relative paucity of fossils discovered in this time interval, evidence for multiple non-robust lineages in eastern and southern Africa indicates that taxonomic diversity had already evolved by 2.5 Ma. Here we examine taxonomic and phylogenetic hypotheses for the newly discovered hominin specimens from Ledi-Geraru.

First, although the Asboli sample contains only two molars (Table 1), and they predate Homo specimens A.L. 666-1 and MLP-1549 by more than 150,000 years, we regard the most parsimonious hypothesis to be that these are members of the same species of Homo30. The existence of Homo at Ledi-Geraru by around 2.78 Ma was previously established by the LD 350-1 mandible1; the new dental material from the Asboli area, as well as the LD 302-23 premolar described here from the Gurumaha sedimentary package, provide additional evidence of Homo prior to 2.5 Ma.

Second, LD 750 and LD 760 are separated by 24 m of strata and straddle the LAT. We provisionally regard all teeth recovered from the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package as representatives of a single species of Australopithecus, partially premised on our expectation of the low likelihood of two Australopithecus species existing in such close geographic and temporal proximity. The following are potential phylogenetic scenarios for the LD 750 premolar and the LD 760 teeth:

The Ledi-Geraru australopith teeth represent a late-surviving population of A. afarensis. The Lee Adoyta sample is approximately 350,000 years younger than the last appearance of A. afarensis, which is documented by specimens from the Kada Hadar 2 Submember at Hadar11. Contradicting this hypothesis, the mandibular M1s and M2s are not bilobate and are squarer in crown shape than the majority of A. afarensis; the P4 and molar sizes fall just at the upper limit of size variation in that species; and the pattern of maxillary canine wear in the LD 760 canine is not seen in A. afarensis. Accordingly, if these teeth do represent A. afarensis, they may capture further evolutionary change within the lineage. The resemblances between the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus specimens and A. afarensis are symplesiomorphic. In addition to A. garhi, this is the only other record of the persistence of this genus in eastern Africa after 2.95 Ma, although it has approximate contemporaneity with A. africanus found in South Africa.

The Lee Adoyta Australopithecus teeth represent a population ancestral to later Paranthropus, which is currently undocumented in the Afar Region; this inference could be supported by the large size of the postcanine teeth. However, the appearance of Homo by 2.78 Ma implies a divergence between that clade and Paranthropus by at least that date, and Paranthropus is present as early as 2.66 Ma in the Upper Ndolanya Beds at Laetoli, Tanzania16 and around 2.7 Ma at Nyayanga, Kenya2. Moreover, the Lee Adoyta teeth share no synapomorphies with Paranthropus (such as presence of C6 on the molars, reduced anterior tooth size or planar wear pattern) and megadonty is common in early hominin lineages, including A. garhi, A. africanus and early Homo3. Given these constraints, it is unlikely that the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus is ancestral to Paranthropus.

The Lee Adoyta Australopithecus teeth are early representatives of A. garhi. Accepting this hypothesis would require that A. garhi includes very different canine and maxillary molar forms and postcanine wear patterns on their upper and lower dentitions. This alternative is difficult to evaluate as there are only a few overlapping anatomical elements to compare between the current A. garhi fossil material and the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus sample. However, our assessment is that the lack of similar forms on the few shared elements suggests the Lee Adoyta australopith is not A. garhi.

The Lee Adoyta teeth are a previously unknown species of Australopithecus from the early Pleistocene. This hypothesis is the only alternative that offers no contradictions with the data presented in the previous three hypotheses.

The Ledi-Geraru fossils described here demonstrate that there were at least 3 lineages in the Afar Region between 3.0 and 2.5 Ma: Homo, A. garhi and the newly identified Australopithecus from Ledi-Geraru. The diversity of hominins in the interval around 2.5 Ma demonstrates the ways in which evolution was experimenting with the overall hominin pattern; in addition to these Afar region hominins, A. africanus is present in South Africa and Paranthropus is found in Kenya, Tanzania and southern Ethiopia by this time. The apparent absence of Australopithecus after approximately 2.0 Ma in eastern Africa means that only two hominin genera remained, Homo and Paranthropus, and these were well differentiated in terms of their dietary ecology31. Moreover, the discoveries of Australopithecus and Homo at Ledi-Geraru between 2.78 Ma and 2.59 Ma reveal that a drier, more open habitat was not uniquely associated with the appearance of Homo17,32, raising intriguing questions about niche breadth and landscape use among early hominins—including why Australopithecus was able to survive in the Afar Region alongside Homo until at least 2.5 Ma, and whether Paranthropus was competitively excluded from the Afar Region by late-surviving Australopithecus filling a similar niche.

Individual phenocrysts of K-feldspar (sanidine to anorthoclase, ~400–1,000 μm) from tuff sample LG-1048-1 of the Giddi Sands Tuff were analysed at the Berkeley Geochronology Center by the SCIH 40Ar/39Ar dating technique17. The feldspar concentrate was irradiated in the Cd-lined CLICIT position of the Oregon State University TRIGA reactor for four hours (BGC irradiation no. 461). Sanidine phenocrysts from the Alder Creek Rhyolite of California were used as the neutron-fluence monitor mineral, with an orbitally referenced age20 of 1.1848 ± 0.0006 Ma. Reactor-induced isotopic production ratios for this irradiation was: (36Ar/37Ar)Ca = 2.65 ± 0.02 × 10−4, (38Ar/37Ar)Ca = 1.96 ± 0.08 × 10−5, (39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 6.95 ± 0.09 × 10−4, (37Ar/39Ar)K = 2.24 ± 0.16 × 10−4, (38Ar/39Ar)K = 1.220 ± 0.003 × 10−2, (40Ar/39Ar)K = 2.5 ± 0.9 × 10−4. Atmospheric 40Ar/36Ar = 298.56 ± 0.31 (ref. 33) and decay constants follow ref. 34.

In total, 26 individual grains were analysed separately by the SCIH approach. One grain was rejected after the initial step as an old xenocryst (27361-08, ~100 Ma), while all others yielded geologically reasonable eruption ages and were carried to conclusion (Supplementary Table 1). All completed experiments demonstrated apparent-age plateaus, typically across the entirety of the 39Ar release spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating an absence of complexity to the internal argon systematics, and that these feldspars show no evidence of alteration or inherited argon. A probability density plot of the plateau ages is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, revealing that the age distribution is symmetrical and gaussian-like. The weighted-mean age of the accepted plateaus is 2.593 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ analytical error). Isochrons (36Ar/40Ar versus 39Ar/40Ar) calculated from the plateau steps yield an indistinguishable weighted-mean age of 2.597 ± 0.006 Ma (Supplementary Fig. 3) but, given the high proportion of radiogenic 40Ar of total 40Ar (typically >90%) in these crystals, we prefer the straightforward plateau weighted mean as the reference age for this sample (2.593 ± 0.006 Ma).

Hominin specimens discovered in 2015 and 2018 from the LGRP area are described and evaluated taxonomically, using comparative fossil material from eastern and southern Africa including A. anamensis, A. afarensis, A. africanus, A. deyiremeda, A. garhi, Paranthropus aethiopicus, P. boisei, P. robustus, Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and Homo sp. (see Extended Data Table 1 for sites, localities and references for these taxa). Resampling data from Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla metrics are also used to evaluate the comparative relative variation within and between samples. Bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) was performed in R v. 4.4.135. The analyses were conducted using code written by the authors that utilizes the sample function. For each analysis, distributions of values for extant taxa were derived from 10,000 bootstraps. The ratio of the Ledi-Geraru and A. garhi specimens were compared to the bootstrapped distributions for chimpanzees and gorillas; all statistical tests were two-tailed using α = 0.05. All photographed material (including comparative specimens) were examined directly by the authors. Quantitative data came from a variety of sources, including the authors' and published measurements; both quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses were performed. See Extended Data Table 1 for references and Supplementary Data 1 for all hominin dental metrics.

This mandibular premolar was found 6 February 2015 by K.G.T. during palaeontological survey ~22 m to the southwest and ~7 m stratigraphically below the LD 350 early Homo mandible locality1, above the 2.782 ± 0.006 Ma Gurumaha Tuff17 (Fig. 1b). The fossil was recorded in the LGRP database with GPS coordinates. Numerous non-hominin fossils were also recovered in the area.

This mandibular premolar was found by O.A.O. during palaeontological survey on 14 February 2018 (Supplementary Fig. 4). It was located ~9 m stratigraphically above the 2.63 Ma Lee Adoyta Tuff, on the eastern side of the Lee Adoyta Basin (Extended Data Fig. 2a) The fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates and an in situ photograph. The sequence includes fine sandy silts to very fine sand, tuffaceous silts and brown mudstones.

The first molar, LD 760-115329, an M1, was found by O.A.O. on 14 February 2018, followed by the discovery of four more lower molars by A.L.R. and O.A.O. within ~30 min. These teeth were located ~10 m stratigraphically below the 2.63 Ma Lee Adoyta Tuff on the eastern side of the Lee Adoyta Basin (Extended Data Fig. 2). All fossils surrounding the hominin teeth were flagged and collected during surveying for additional hominin material (Supplementary Video 1). The fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates and in situ photographs. The area was subsequently (19–25 February 2018) screened with 2 mm screen mesh and the maxillary dentition was discovered in the surrounding 4 × 7 m in the upper 5–7 cm of loose surface material. Expanded sieving in 2020 did not produce additional fossils. Fossil survey, collection, and screening are shown in Supplementary Video 1. The sediments below the Lee Adoyta Tuff at the site include fine sands overlain by brown mudstones.

On 23 February 2015, one partial hominin molar, AS 100-1a (LM1), was found by B.M.A. and a tooth fragment, AS 100-1b, was subsequently found by E.M.L. during palaeontological survey (Supplementary Fig. 5). Further exploration of the small area revealed a second fragment, found by B.M.A., which fit onto AS 100-1b (completing the LM2). All teeth were found within 0.5 m2. All fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates. The area was subsequently screened with 2 mm screen mesh without recovering more fossils. The sequence includes ~1 m thick sand (Giddi Sands) and thin pebble conglomerate units immediately below the Giddi Sands Tuff (Fig. 1).

For all localities, geological data were collected using StraboSpot 2.12.18, Avenza 5.4 and GaiaGPS 2025.2 and integrated in ArcGIS Pro 3.2.2.

a, The Ledi-Geraru Research Project area (yellow star) is located towards the northern extent of palaeontological sites (red circles) in the Afar depression, Afar Region, Ethiopia. b, Within the Ledi-Geraru project area, the Lee Adoyta and Asboli fossil sites are located approximately 12.5 km apart.

a, Geologic mapping draped on orthophotograph created from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with cm-scale ground resolution, showing LD 750 and LD 760 fossil sites, including traces of the Lee Adoyta Tuffs (2.63 Ma; shown in green) and the Giddi Sands Tuff (2.59 Ma; shown in yellow), as well as NE-SW and NW-SE trending faults. Small offset faults (a few metres) in the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package (light green shading) are present near the fossil sites. b, Hominin specimens recovered from the LD 760 locality are represented by yellow stars and other faunal fossils by red circles. The hominin locality topography is relatively flat-lying, grading downslope gently to the northwest (Supplementary Video S1).

a, P3 occlusal morphology of eastern African hominins. A.L. 128-23, A.L. 333w-1 (mirrored), KNM-ER 5431, A.L. 437-2, OMO 33-73-5496, and LD 302-23. The crown of LD 302-23 measures 10.5 mm MD x 11.5 mm BL (est.). Mesial is oriented up and lingual is oriented to the right. Scale bar in centimetres; images are to scale. b, Bivariate plot of P3 crown dimensions. The LD 302-23 P3 (magenta star) falls near the upper range of Homo and well within Australopithecus. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1. Although LD 302-23 is large for a Homo P3, our interpretation of the occlusal morphology is more consistent with assignment to this genus. c, P3 (MD/BL ratio) shape variation. LD 302-23 falls in the middle range of Australopithecus and lower in the range of Homo, although these patterns show overlap. d, P3 variation in area (mm2). LD 302-23 falls in the upper ranges of Australopithecus and Homo but is small compared to P. boisei.

a, Comparison of the Ledi-Geraru LD 750-115670 P4 to other pre-2.0 Ma hominin specimens. All A.L. specimens attributed to A. afarensis. OMO 75-14 and LD 350-1 are attributed to Homo1,2, StW 404 and OMO L51-79 are attributed to Paranthropus1. LD 750-115670 measures 11.4 mm MD x 12.4 mm BL. Mesial is oriented up and lingual is oriented to the right. Scale bar in centimetres; images are to scale. b, Bivariate plot of P4 crown dimensions. The LD 750-115670 premolar (magenta star) falls at the upper range of A. afarensis P4 areas and just outside the range of eastern African early Homo. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1. c, Premolar cusp apices are marked in yellow with the outline of anterior fovea to aid identification of trait. d, Protoconid-metaconid cusp apex distance relative to overall BL breadth in unworn Hadar A. afarensis P4 specimens (n = 8 including A.L. 966-1, in D) and LD 750-115670. This specimen falls outside the known range of variation for unworn P4s from Hadar (unpublished data from W.H.K.). e, Ratio of Bouri (A. garhi) P4 area to LD 750 P4 area compared to bootstrapped ratios of upper to lower P4 areas from Pan troglodytes (n = 98P4s/95P4s) and Gorilla gorilla (n = 119P4s/120P4s). The ratio of the Bouri upper premolar to the lower LD 750 specimen could be resampled within the 95% confidence intervals of the randomly selected gorilla (two-way p-value = 0.486) and chimpanzee (two-way p-value = 0.402) samples; although there are no lower A. garhi premolars, the size of LD 750 does not preclude it from being within the appropriate size range for A. garhi based on gorilla and chimp models of upper premolar areas compared to lower premolar areas. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated from the bootstrapped distributions using the percentile method; no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1.

a, Bivariate plot of M1 crown dimensions (mm) for LD 760 and comparative taxa. The LD 760 M1s fall just at the upper edge of Homo but well within Australopithecus. Note that LD 760 M1 crown dimensions have no overlap with P. boisei. b, Bivariate plot of M2 crown dimensions (mm) for LD 760 and comparative taxa. As with the M1s, the LD 760 M2s fall just at the upper edge of Homo but well within Australopithecus. Note the lack of overlap with Paranthropus. c, Bivariate plot of M3 crown dimensions (mm) for LD 760 and comparative taxa. The LD 760 M3 falls just at the upper edge of Homo but well within Australopithecus. Note the lack of overlap with eastern African Paranthropus. d, Area of the LD 760 M1–M3 molar row (mm2 on the y-axis) compared to distributions of eastern and southern African Australopithecus, early Homo, and Paranthropus. The LD 760 molar row area is larger than all but one A. afarensis individual. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1.

a, Ratio of MD/BL measurements (mm) on the y-axis as a representation of shape variation for the LD 760 molars compared to Hadar A. afarensis and eastern African early Homo and Paranthropus molars. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1. b, Ratio of Bouri (A. garhi) upper molar row area to LD 760 lower molar area compared to bootstrapped ratios of upper to lower molar row areas from Pan troglodytes (n = 74 mandibular molar row areas/71 maxillary molar row areas) and Gorilla gorilla (n = 77 mandibular molar row area/87 maxillary molar row areas). The ratio of the Bouri upper molar row area to the lower LD 760 molar row area could be resampled within the 95% confidence intervals of randomly selected upper and molar rows from these two African apes (Gorilla gorilla two-way p-value = 0.196; Pan troglodytes two-way p-value = 0.269); the LD 760 molar row area size does not preclude it from being within the appropriate size range for A. garhi based on gorilla and chimpanzee variation. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated from the bootstrapped distributions using the percentile method; no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Authors' data supplemented by references in Extended Data Table 1.

a, Comparison of M1 and M2 Australopithecus and Homo pairs with AS 100-1a and 100-1b. Hadar A. afarensis specimens A.L. 444-2 (opposite side, mirrored – note missing enamel on lingual M1), and A.L. 199-1. Australopithecus garhi specimen BOU-VP-12/130 (mirrored), early Homo maxilla A.L. 666-1, and fragmentary M1 specimen AS 100-1a and M2 specimen AS 100-1b (M2 MD 13.9 ×14.2 BL). Note the relatively small hypocone and expanded BL dimensions of the A. garhi specimen across the mesial cusps. The LD 760-115911 upper right molar (mirrored) preserves the protocone. The mesial edge of the hypocone is visible distal to the lingual groove.

a, The A. garhi BOU-VP-12/130 specimen has a very distinctive wear pattern with a continuous, broad longitudinal furrow from the maxillary canine to the molars, extending mesiodistally through the basin of each tooth, with differential wear on the lingual cusps (pers. obs., BV, LKD). This is different from the pattern on upper postcanine teeth in A. afarensis, A. africanus, P. robustus, and P. boisei, in which wear is more even across the breadth of the teeth (typically with a slight lingual-buccal wear gradient), and the cusps are ultimately reduced to the level of the central basin, producing a relatively flat occlusal profile. In A. garhi, the wear in the longitudinal furrow is sufficient to obliterate the central fissure, even in teeth with relatively unworn cusp apices (for example, contrast the P3s in the two specimens). We see no evidence of any wear pattern on the LD 760 assemblage that would indicate similarity to BOU-VP-12/130 (notably on the preserved fragmentary upper molar). The LD 760 wear pattern is more consistent with A. afarensis. b, In A. afarensis (A.L. 199-1), the canine lacks the large concave talon; the postcanine wear pattern is flatter with more wear on the cusps, ultimately approaching the level of the tooth's central basin, which creates a flat rather than concave surface (note the visibility of the fissures on the first upper molar of A.L. 199-1 despite considerable cusp wear).

While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines1,2. Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population3,4,5,6,7,8. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs5,7,9,10,11. Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users (N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits1. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area.

A substantial number of people worldwide are physically inactive4,12,13 and therefore at risk for common and deadly non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes13,14,15. Meanwhile, urban environments worldwide have grown rapidly, with current estimates predicting that 6.7 billion people will be living in cities by 2050 (ref. 16). While the evidence base on the impacts of the design of urban environments on physical activity levels has grown, further information is needed on the putative causal impacts of diverse urban environments on key health behaviours such as physical activity5,7,10,11,17,18 and interactions between environmental and individual factors19. Specifically, current evidence has not been able to determine whether physical activity levels are directly influenced by the built environment or are mainly a product of personal preferences10,20. Understanding these factors is critical for developing optimal public policy1,8,21, and for planning cities5,22 and designing behaviour change interventions23,24.

Previous studies on the effects of the built environment on physical activity have led to mixed or modest findings and have not been able to reliably distinguish between direct environmental impacts and individual preferences. Common methodological limitations include small cohorts, data from a single location or a limited number of locations, over-reliance on self-reported activity, with its attendant biases25, cross-sectional designs that constrain temporal understanding and causal inference, residential self-selection and other confounding factors5,7,9,20,26,27. Today's mobile phones, including the now globally dominant smartphone, can capture physical activity and geolocation in a continuous fashion, making them a powerful tool for studying large-scale population dynamics and health23, the use of which can reveal the basic patterns of physical activity3, sleep28, human movement29 and mood rhythms30, along with the dynamics of the spread of diseases such as malaria31 and COVID-19 (ref. 32) and linkages with socioeconomic status in low- and middle-income countries33. In this study, we use a large-scale physical activity dataset to disentangle the influences of the built environment from personal proclivities through a natural experiment, and quantify the impact of walkability on changes in physical activity levels at the individual and population scale.

We study 248,266 days of minute-by-minute step recordings from 5,424 users of the Azumio Argus smartphone application who relocated at least once within a 3-year observation period. Overall, these participants relocated a total of 7,447 times among 1,609 cities within the USA, forming a countrywide natural experiment (Fig. 1a). The dataset includes smartphone-derived accelerometry recordings of physical activity for free-living individuals that were exposed to different built environments, enabling us to compare their objectively measured, longitudinal physical activity for up to 90 days before and after relocation (Fig. 1b). The average participant recorded 5,574 steps per day (standard deviation σ = 3,055) over an average span of 14.2 hours. Research has demonstrated that smartphones provide accurate step counts34 and reliable activity estimates in both laboratory and free-living settings35. We ensured that our dataset included a broad range of relocating and non-relocating participants, including across age, gender and weight status (as measured by body mass index (BMI)) (Extended Data Table 1). Previous work further verified that data from the Argus smartphone application used in this study reproduced established relationships between age, gender, weight status and activity, as well as country-level variations in activity and obesity levels3. We also verified that our findings were robust to different relocation definitions, including those aimed at removing business and leisure travel and excluding time periods right before and right after relocation, which are probably impacted by the relocation process itself (Extended Data Fig. 6; Methods: ‘Identifying participant relocation').

a, During the observation period, 5,424 participants relocated 7,447 times between 1,609 US cities. Circle area is proportional to the square root of the number of relocations to and from the city. b, The physical activity levels of participants were tracked through smartphone accelerometry over several months before and after relocation, creating a countrywide study of 7,447 quasi-experiments. c–f, Physical activity of participants moving from less walkable locations to New York City (c,e), in comparison to participants moving in the opposite direction (d,f) (Methods). Activity levels change significantly immediately after relocation and are symmetric but inverted for participants moving in the opposite direction (e,f).

Our large-scale activity measurements enable us to characterize the impact of built environments on physical activity. Consider the 178 participants relocating to New York City (a walkability score of 89 out of 100) coming from various less walkable US locations (Fig. 1c; a Walk Score of at least one standard deviation or 15.4 points lower; mean walkability 48). When exposed to the built environment of New York City after relocating, these participants increased their physical activity by 1,400 steps, their average daily steps increasing from 5,600 to 7,000 (Fig. 1e; P < 10−10; all statistical hypothesis tests throughout refer to two-sided Student's t-tests unless indicated otherwise; Methods: ‘Statistical methods'). Participants relocating in the opposite direction, that is, from New York City to other less walkable US cities (Fig. 1d), exhibited an inverted, symmetric effect of decreasing their physical activity by 1,400 steps, going from 7,000 to 5,600 average daily steps (P < 10−10, Fig. 1f; more examples in Supplementary Fig. 1).

To investigate whether moving to more walkable environments generally leads to increased physical activity, we aggregate changes in physical activity across all relocations in the dataset (Fig. 2a; Methods: ‘Aggregating relocation-based quasi-experiments'). We find that relocations to more walkable cities (Walk Score increases of 49 and higher) are associated with increases of about 1,100 daily steps, equivalent to 11 minutes more walking activity every day36.

a, Difference in average daily steps aggregated across all relocations. We find that significantly more walkable locations are associated with increases of about 1,100 daily steps, and significantly less walkable locations are associated with similar decreases (for 49–80 point Walk Score increase or decrease). Moving to locations of similar walkability is associated with unchanged physical activity levels. b, Higher walkability is associated with increased daily steps across age, gender, BMI and baseline activity level groups. Bars show the steps gained per day for each point increase in walkability score (assuming linear model; Methods). Positive values across all bars reveal that, with increasing walkability, more steps are taken by every subgroup, which is significant for all the subgroups except women over 50 years of age (Student's t-tests, all P < 0.05; women over 50 years of age, P = 0.14).

Notably, we attempt to estimate the impact of substantial built environment changes in-place on physical activity through events of substantial built environment changes resulting from relocation. This approach provides unique advantages, as substantial in-place changes are exceedingly rare and costly, leading to recent calls for quasi-experimental study designs such as ours37. However, this approach could lead to biased estimates due to selection effects, such as participants moving to a new environment being particularly motivated to increase physical activity. Importantly, we find robust evidence that our estimates are unlikely to be significantly influenced by such selection effects. Critical to this argument are (1) that we find no evidence of increases in average physical activity of participants when they are relocating to environments with walkability scores similar to the environment from which they came (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for walkability differences between −16 and 16 is [−76 to 122]) and (2) that the estimated relationship between walkability differences and physical activity is approximately point symmetric (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). If participants that moved were motivated to increase their physical activity after moving, we should have observed this increase also for relocations to environments of similar walkability, but we did not observe any difference. If participants that moved relocated to higher-walkability locations specifically for this quality, a form of residential self-selection, we should have observed higher physical increases relative to physical activity decreases when relocating to a lower-physical-activity location. Instead, we observed point symmetric changes.

In addition, we observe that these increases are sustained over 3 months after moving (Supplementary Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 2). Furthermore, we find similar, consistent effects of walkability increases and decreases between cities in similar climates (for example, Ellicott City, MD to New York, NY in Fig. 2a), and more generally across relocations during all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6), and after relocating to cities of higher, similar and lower median household income (Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition, census data suggest that between 77% and 98% of participants that move do not move for walkability reasons, but instead for family, job and housing-related reasons (Methods: ‘Selection effects in relocation and mobile app usage'). We also find that relocating and non-relocating app users are similar in age, gender and weight status, and that those relocating to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5; Methods: ‘Selection effects in relocation and mobile app usage'). Overall, these results suggest that physical activity levels are directly influenced by the built environment and not simply a product of personal preferences or other types of selection effects.

We find that higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and baseline activity level groups, which is significant for all the subgroups except women over 50 years of age (Fig. 2b; all P < 0.05; women over 50 years of age, P = 0.14). Previous research has identified additional barriers to physical activity relevant to older women including cultural expectations, norms, societal messages discouraging physical activity, family priorities and safety38,39. The relationship between walkability and activity is strongest for highly active women (gaining 43.7 steps per walkability point increase). Importantly, we find that regardless of BMI status, individuals record more steps after moving to more walkable cities, and that these increases are also shared by individuals who were less active before moving (Fig. 2b). These findings suggest that compared with interventions targeting individuals and reaching small numbers of people, changes to the built environment can influence large populations. However, the relatively smaller effect for older women suggests that, for this group in particular, built environment changes may need to be accompanied by additional age- and gender-specific interventions aimed at their specific constraints. Previous work has described person-level factors that impede physical activity participation of older women, such as a greater number of functional impairments that discourage activity, more frequent caregiving demands that interfere with physical activity, more difficulties with outdoor wayfinding and lower driving rates, which can limit their ability to get to local parks to exercise40,41,42,43,44,45. In addition, older women are less well served by public transit in many US cities, which base their routes on commuter patterns46,47. Therefore, multilevel interventions that focus on social environmental factors in addition to built environment factors are recommended, such as encouraging walking groups and advising on how to overcome the above types of personal barriers41,48.

Next, we investigate whether the walkability-induced increase in steps reflected an increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which has been shown to be beneficial for many health outcomes, including lower all-cause mortality risk14,15. Using minute-by-minute step data, we find that extra steps taken after moving to a more walkable location are predominantly composed of MVPA corresponding to brisk walks (Fig. 3a). We estimate that large increases in walkability (that is, 49–80 points) are associated with an increase in MVPA of about 1 hour per week (Fig. 3d). Further emphasizing the consistency and symmetry of built environment effects, we find that similar amounts of MVPA are lost when relocating to a less walkable location (Fig. 3b), and that the activity intensity distribution remains effectively unchanged when relocating to a similarly walkable location (Fig. 3c). US national physical activity guidelines recommend, similar to international guidelines, 150 minutes or more per week of MVPA to obtain optimal health benefits49. For a walkability increase of between 48 and 80 points, we find that the associated increases in MVPA would support 42.5% of participants meeting guidelines for MVPA versus 21.5% before relocation, a 98% relative increase (Fig. 3e; Methods: ‘Physical activity measure' and ‘Simulating the impact of walkability improvements'). Our findings substantively expand on the findings of previous literature, indicating that improving the walkability of built environments can lead to better health outcomes across large populations.

a–c, Changes in physical activity stratified by intensity of physical activity (steps per minute) following relocation to more (a; more than 16-point walkability increase), less (b; more than 16-point walkability decrease) and similarly (c; 16-point walkability difference or less) walkable environments. a, We find that walkability-induced additional physical activity (Fig. 2a) predominantly consists of MVPA, which has been shown to be beneficial for many health outcomes14,15. b, Moving to less walkable locations is associated with a symmetric loss of MVPA that is equivalent to the increase in more walkable locations (a). c, Further, moving to similarly walkable locations is associated with an unchanged distribution of intensity levels. This suggests that relocation, in and of itself, is not generally associated with increases in physical activity, for instance, owing to an individual's motivation to increase physical activity. d, Change in MVPA (minutes per week) versus differences in walkability. ΔT(I) is defined as the change in weekly minutes (ΔT) of activity at intensity level I after relocation, in units of steps per minute. ΔTMVPA, that is, change in the time spent in MVPA, is computed by summing ΔT(I) for I ≥ 100 (inset). Large increases in walkability (that is, 49–80 points) are associated with an increase of about 1 hour per week in MVPA. e, The increases in time spent in MVPA lead to twice as many participants meeting national and international aerobic physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes per week or more in MVPA (before 21.5%, after 42.5%). f, A simulation based on these estimates predicts that if all US cities had the walkability of Chicago or Philadelphia (a walkability score of 78), then individuals would increase their average daily step activity by 443 steps and their MVPA per week by 24 minutes, which would mean that 11.2% or 36 million more Americans would then meet national physical activity guidelines for MVPA (Methods).

We perform a simulation study to predict how improving walkability would support increasing the fraction of the US population that meets aerobic physical activity guidelines (Methods: ‘Simulating the impact of walkability improvements'). Our dataset covers 1,609 US cities, which are home to more than 41% of the country's population (137 million), and we adjust for age differences between the smartphone user population and the US adult population. According to our smartphone-based objective measurements, about 18% or 58 million Americans met the guidelines for MVPA between 2013 and 2016. Our estimate of 18% meeting aerobic guidelines is within expectations, given well-established differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity50,51. Our simulation (Fig. 3f) predicts that bringing all US locations to the level of Chicago or Philadelphia (a walkability score of 78) may lead to 11.2% or 36 million more Americans meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines. Bringing all US locations to the level of New York City (a walkability score of 89) may lead to 14.5% or 47 million more Americans meeting these guidelines.

There are limitations to the device-based instrument (that is, people's personal smartphones) we used to collect physical activity data in participants' natural environments. For example, our sample may be biased towards individuals of higher socioeconomic status and people interested in their activity and health. However, we find that walkability improvements led to increased physical activity after relocating to cities of higher, similar and lower median household income (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city's walkability (for example, climate, availability of transit, or land use mix)52,53. However, we find that walkability differences are associated with physical activity differences in cities of similar climate (Supplementary Fig. 5) and across all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6). While relocation uniquely enables the quasi-experimental study of behavioural changes in different environments, there may be selection effects driving relocation, referred to as residential self-selection20. However, as previously discussed, we report evidence against such selection effects.

Over 90% of adults in the USA already own a smartphone54 and the number of mobile connections worldwide has risen to 8.5 billion55, exhibiting significant year-to-year increases. Therefore, we expect any biases related to smartphone ownership and usage to continue to diminish in the future. This study is restricted to a single country and results may not generalize to other countries. However, previous studies have found, in general, similar types of built environment relationships across countries diverse in climate, demographics, income, culture and activity supportiveness5,56,57,58. As these studies used walkability indices that were based on elements shared with the measure used here (Methods: ‘Walkability measure'), this suggests that our findings may generalize to other countries. We chose a simple, highly used and extensively validated measure of walkability at a city level59,60,61,62,63,64. However, this type of aggregated, non-divisible walkability score precludes the ability to identify which elements of walkability may confer the largest benefits. Location data to assess walkability on a neighbourhood or census tract level was not available, preventing the analysis of within-city variation in walkability. Further research is needed to identify key environmental features on a neighbourhood level and disentangle their individual contributions, building on past cross-sectional research and smaller-scale studies using self-reported physical activity measures, which currently constitute the majority of research in the field65. Future research is also needed to untangle how the built environment may differentially affect physical activity related to leisure, transportation and working. While walking is the most popular aerobic physical activity66, our dataset may fail to capture time spent in activities where it is impractical to carry a phone (for example, football) or for which steps are not a major component of the activity (for example, bicycling), and there may exist systematic differences in wear time because participants in the current dataset had to carry their phone for steps to be recorded. The increasing prevalence of wearable activity trackers in the form of smartwatches and similar devices will continue to enable more convenient methods of capturing daily movement and steps. Further, our smartphone dataset reproduces previously established relationships between activity across geographic locations, gender and age3. We also find that the span of time over which steps were recorded is uncorrelated with relocating to higher- or lower-walkability areas (Extended Data Fig. 7), and thus systematic wear time differences are unlikely to affect our analyses. Together, these findings increase confidence that our dataset is able to identify activity differences between built environments and groups based on gender, age and weight status.

Further research is needed to determine which policies, on topics such as land use mix, intersection design and access to public transit, are most effective in increasing city walkability for both new and existing urban areas53. While increasing walkability of all cities to the level of New York City is probably not possible, earlier research has shown promising connections between implemented changes to the built environment, walkability and physical activity67. The results of our analysis will provide researchers and policy-makers with the information to estimate the effects of targeted increases in walkability on physical activity and weigh the cost effectiveness of changes to the built environment against other public health interventions.

This countrywide natural experiment presents prospective evidence of built environments affecting physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities over a 3-year timespan. It reveals the direct behavioural impacts of differing built environments on the physical activity levels of individuals and demonstrates the utility of such massive, digitally enabled, real-world datasets for evidence-based policy. Our findings suggest that designing built environments to be more activity-friendly could have significant effects on the physical activity of large populations, and serve as a powerful complement to interventions that focus on changing behaviour at the individual level. However, changes in built environments may need to be accompanied by additional age- and gender-specific interventions aimed at specific subgroups who could particularly benefit from physical activity increases (that is, women over 50 years old). The quality of the prospective device-collected evidence and consistency of findings across numerous cities, demographic groups and relocation-related walkability differentials highlight the fundamental importance of the urban built environment in improving physical activity and health.

We conducted a countrywide, prospective, longitudinal physical activity study of US residents that evaluated their physical activity levels within the context of the walkability of their built environments before and after relocation (‘participants'). We leveraged the naturally occurring physical activity data that was captured by a health app on participants' phones to compare each person's physical activity levels before and after they relocated to a different area within the USA. While similar relocation-based study designs have been used previously to estimate effects of place and built environments26,68,69, the vast majority have been limited by relatively small sample sizes, using only self-report physical activity measurement and the limited diversity with respect to the areas to which they relocated. Objective measures of both urban walkability and physical activity were used and are discussed in more detail throughout the Methods. We analysed anonymized, prospectively collected data from 2,112,288 US smartphone users using the Azumio Argus health app over 3 years (March 2013 to February 2016) to identify 5,424 participants that relocated 7,447 times among 1,609 US cities. These 1,609 cities are home to 137 million Americans, or more than 42% of the US population. We note that relocation is neither purely exogenous nor random, and discuss the important implications of this below. We follow established best practices for analysing large-scale health data from wearables and smartphone apps70.

The Azumio Argus app is a free smartphone application for tracking physical activity and other health behaviours. Participants were excluded from a particular analysis if necessary information was unreported (for example, participants with no reported age were excluded from the analysis of Fig. 2b). Extended Data Table 1 includes basic statistics on study population demographics and weight status (BMI). Anonymized Azumio Argus app data was obtained through a Data Use Agreement. Data handling and analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, which deemed this study exempt.

For population size statistics, refer to Extended Data Tables 1–3.

All error bars throughout this paper correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. When these bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals do not include the null value (typically 0), they indicate a statistically significant difference at the α = 0.05 level. All statistical hypothesis tests were two-sided Student's t-tests unless indicated otherwise.

We defined participant relocation as the action of moving to a new place for a substantial amount of time. We identified participant relocation as follows. Participant location on a given day was assigned to a city based on the weather update in the participant's app activity feed. Weather updates are automatically added to the feed of each participant according to the nearest cell phone tower. We searched for participants that stayed in one location within a 100-km radius for at least 14 days and then moved to a different location that was at least 100 km away. Participants were required to stay within a 100-km radius of this new location for at least another 14 days. The 14-day threshold was chosen to filter out short trips that may be related to business or leisure travel. Using this threshold, we find that most participants do not relocate again and spend a median of 81 days in the new location, effectively excluding the impact of short-term travel on our analyses. Most participants stopped tracking their activity at this time, rather than relocating again. In addition, we repeated our analyses with thresholds of 21 and 30 days and found highly consistent results (Extended Data Fig. 6). We required a substantial move distance (100 km or more) to ensure that relocating participants were exposed to a new built environment. We allowed for up to 5 days of intermediate travel between these two locations and ignored these days during analyses. We applied this method to 2,112,288 users of the Argus smartphone app and identified 31,034 relocations. Among these, we required participants to have used the app to track their physical activity for at least 10 days within the 30 days before and after their relocation (as in previous work3). We further required at least 1 day of tracked physical activity before and after relocation to ensure that, whenever we compare two participant populations, these populations are identical and therefore comparable (that is, we seek to identify within-participant changes in physical activity). We repeated our statistical analyses with alternative data inclusion criteria, such as the number of days with tracked physical activity, and found similar results.

Our device-based (historically often called objective) measure of physical activity was the number of steps over time recorded by the participant's smartphone. Steps were determined based on the smartphone accelerometers and the manufacturer's proprietary algorithms for step counting. The Azumio Argus app records step measurements on a minute-by-minute basis. These measurements are collected passively without requiring the smartphone or Azumio Argus app to be in active use. Extended Data Table 2 includes basic statistics on physical activity and tracking in the study population.

Data from the Azumio Argus app have been used previously to study physical activity in large populations3,71,72, where the authors showed that this form of data follows well-established trends3. For example, they demonstrated that activity decreased with increasing age12,19,73,74 and BMI19,74,75, and is lower in female individuals than in male individuals12,19,73,74,76, trends that are consistent with national surveillance data in this area. Physical activity estimates were also reasonably well correlated with self-report-based population estimates on a country level3.

Several studies have established significant differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity50,51. Self-reports typically overestimate moderate and vigorous activity and underestimate sedentary activity50. In a US study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006 data, 59.6% of adults self-reported meeting MVPA guidelines for aerobic physical activity, whereas estimates using accelerometry were much lower at 9.6%51. For our observation period between 2013 and 2016, the US National Health Interview Survey reported that 49.6–52.6% of the US population met MVPA guidelines. Nationally representative accelerometer-based estimates for this time are not available. Our smartphone-accelerometry-based estimate of 18% meeting aerobic guidelines is within expectations, given well-established differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity and earlier data (Methods)50,51. In addition, unlike many previous studies mailing accelerometers to study participants to wear for a week, our study focuses on real-world physical activity by free-living individuals that may not be equally affected by their awareness of being observed (that is, the Hawthorne effect).

We filtered out days as invalid when less than 500 or more than 50,000 steps had been recorded. We further ignored days immediately preceding and following the relocation itself (5 days before and 5 days after relocation), because the process of relocating, rather than the new built environment itself, could impact physical activity during these days. Physical activity was relatively stable outside this period (Supplementary Fig. 4). We considered physical activity within a window of 30 days before and 30 days after relocation (with the exception of Supplementary Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2 that use 90-day windows to illustrate long-term changes). In total, our dataset included 248,266 days of objectively measured minute-by-minute physical activity surrounding 7,447 relocations (595,803 days for the 180-day period).

We used the following measures as primary outcomes in this study: (1) Change in average daily steps following relocation (Figs. 1e,f and 2a,b). (2) Change in average weekly minutes spent in MVPA following relocation, where we considered all minutes spent at intensities greater than or equal to 100 steps per minute as MVPA36: \(\Delta {T}_{{\rm{MVPA}}}={\sum }_{I=100}^{\infty }\Delta T(I)\), where ΔT(I) is defined as the change in weekly minutes of activity at intensity level I, in units of steps per minute, after moving. Figure 3a–c shows changes in average weekly minutes spent at different intensity levels. (3) Change in the fraction of the population that met aerobic physical activity guidelines following relocation, defined as spending at least 150 minutes per week in MVPA1 (Fig. 3e,f). All error bars correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals77.

We considered relocations among 1,609 cities in the USA. Walkability scores for these cities were based on the publicly available and systematically developed Walk Score78. Scores are on a scale of 1 to 100 (where 100 is the most walkable) and are based on amenities (for example, grocery stores, schools, parks, restaurants and retail) within a 0.25-mile to 1.5-mile radius (a decay function penalizes more distant amenities) and measures of friendliness to pedestrians, such as city block length and intersection density. Extended Data Table 3 includes basic statistics on the cities included in our study and their walkability scores. Walk Scores at the city level are computed by weighting the Walk Score of each geographic unit within a city (typically about the size of a city block) by the population density of that unit79.

The Walk Score measure is a frequently used measure of walkability that is freely and widely available across the USA and other countries including Canada and Australia78. It is highly correlated62 with other walkability measures80,81,82, and was found to offer the best fit to walking trips in a study conducted in Montréal62. It is widely used in the literature and has been extensively validated59,60,61,62,63,64. Although other measures of walkability exist80,81,82, the Walk Score measure was chosen in light of the pragmatic focus of the investigation and its ease of use and accessibility. More comprehensive walkability indices could provide further granular information related to specific aspects of walkability that might be of prime importance.

We determined cut points for Walk Score differences of −16 to +16, 16 to 48 and 49 to 80, as we preferred cut points that were symmetric around 0 (no change in walkability score), equivalent in size (32 Walk Score points difference) and balanced granularity and statistical power, as large Walk Score differences are more rare. Among the 7,447 relocations, 2.4% (2.4%) were associated with 49+ walkability point increases (decreases), 20.7% (21.3%) were associated with 16–48 walkability point increases (decreases) and 53.1% of relocations were to locations of similar walkability (−16 to +16 point difference).

We aggregated changes in physical activity following relocation based on the difference in walkability scores between the origin and destination city, Δ. In Fig. 2a, each circle corresponds to a pair of cities sized by the number of participants moving between those cities. We fit a linear model mΔ + b to these data with slope m = 16.6 (Student's t-test; P < 10−10) and intercept b = 25.0 (Student's t-test; P = 0.462).

We considered potential confounders such as differences in climate (using Köppen climate type83) and median income between the origin and destination city. We found that the relationship between walkability and walking behaviour still holds within pairs of cities with similar climate, for instance, moving from Miami, FL to Jacksonville, FL, or from Amarillo, TX to Euless, TX (see annotations in Fig. 2a as well as more generally in Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, we found similar effects across relocations in all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6) and relocations to cities with higher, lower and similar median household income levels (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We considered the effect of walkability differences on change in physical activity across subgroups based on demographics (ages 18–29, 30–49 and 50+ years), weight status (normal, overweight and obese levels of BMI), previous activity level (below 5,000, 5,000–8,500 and above 8,500 average daily steps before relocation) and gender (men and women). Owing to the approximately linear nature of the relationship between walkability changes and physical activity changes (Fig. 2a), we used a linear model for estimation. For each subgroup, we ran independent linear regressions of the difference in daily steps on differences in walkability between cities at the level of individual relocations. The models included an intercept coefficient: m ⋅ Δ + b. We determined the estimated coefficient of walkability (m; that is, the increase in daily steps for each one-point increase in walkability of a city) along with 95% confidence intervals (based on Student's t-distribution) for each subgroup (Fig. 2b). We performed Student's t-tests on the regression model coefficients, which establish that relocation to a city of higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and activity level groups (Student's t-test; all P < 0.05), with the exception of women over 50 years old, for which the positive difference was not statistically significant (Student's t-test, P = 0.14). We found that the effect was diminished in overweight and obese women relative to normal-weight women. Thus, the non-significant effect on women over 50 years of age may be explained, in part, by the larger average BMI of this group (27.4) compared with other women (25.3; P < 10−10). In comparison, men over 50 years of age also had a larger BMI compared with other men, but the difference was smaller than in women (28.2 versus 27.0; P < 10−7).

Physical activity is influenced by climate and weather84 and relocations are not equally distributed across seasons (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We found that differences in physical activity levels following relocations may be influenced by seasonal variation, especially when considering comparatively long observation periods of about 6 months (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). For analyses of variation in activity over time (Fig. 1e,f, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3), we adjusted for these seasonal effects by weighting relocations in each calendar month equally. This was achieved by first estimating physical activity levels separately for each calendar month and then taking the average. This process is repeated 1,000 times in our bootstrap estimates.

While relocation uniquely enabled the quasi-experimental study of behavioural changes in different environments, there may be selection effects driving relocation, often referred to as residential self-selection. According to a 2013 US Census Bureau report, 98% of people moved primarily for reasons of housing, family and employment85. Less than 1% of people moved primarily for health reasons. There are some categories that might, in part, include people who want to reduce their dependence on cars. These include ‘health reasons' (0.4%), ‘other housing-related' (14.0%), ‘wanted better neighborhood/less crime' (3.2%) and ‘to be closer to work/easier commute' (5.4%), suggesting that at least 77% of participants moved for reasons completely unrelated to car dependence85. In addition, neighbourhood selection may be influenced by personal preferences such as exercise and walking activities20. With respect to this possibility, note that we found no indication of increases in physical activity after moving to a location of similar walkability (Figs. 2a and 3c). This suggests that those relocating participants are not simply more motivated to exercise, on average, but that changes in physical activity may be explained by the changing built environment. It is possible that selection effects were absent because participants may not have perceived themselves as being observed, in contrast to previous studies that featured explicit, short periods of monitoring (Hawthorne effect). We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city's walkability (for example, length of work days). We investigated potential selection effects further by comparing the population of relocating mobile app users, first, to the overall US population, and, second, to the overall mobile app user population, including non-relocating app users. We found that the relocating participant population is similar in age (36 versus 37.7 years median age) and gender (49.8% versus 51.0% female, P = 0.132; Student's t-test) to the US population (Extended Data Fig. 3). We adjusted for differences in age for the simulation estimates in Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 1. Within the app user population, we found that movers and non-movers (that is, relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be close in age (43.8 versus 37.9 and 38.5 versus 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), and weight status (68.1% versus 59.8% and 45.6% versus 44.3% overweight and obese for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 versus 5,825 and 5,279 versus 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Furthermore, we found that within movers, those that relocate to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Fig. 5).

We simulated the impact of US nationwide walkability improvements on US population physical activity levels. Concretely, we simulated the impact of increasing US city walkability scores to a constant target walkability score between 1 and 100. We also highlight the walkability scores of Chicago and Philadelphia (78) as well as New York City (89) to aid interpretation. As the relocation population was not explicitly drawn to be representative of the US population, we adjusted our estimates through ratio-based post-stratification weights across age-based strata86. We used civilian population estimates from the US Census Bureau for 2016 as the target population distribution. While there were no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female versus 51.0% female, P = 0.132; Extended Data Fig. 3a), we found slight differences in age (36.0 versus 37.7 years median age; Extended Data Fig. 3b), which we corrected for through sampling weights. We acknowledge that other selection effects and heterogeneous treatment effects may exist. Using a bootstrap with 1,000 replications, we estimated the difference in the overall US population that would meet US national aerobic physical activity guidelines for MVPA1 after relocating based on the relocation-induced difference in walkability. We used a linear regression model and data from relocations associated with both walkability increases and decreases. We estimated the total fraction of US population meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines as the sum between the fraction of people already meeting these guidelines before relocating plus the estimated addition based on the regression model. Confidence intervals represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Final estimates are depicted in Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 1.

Examples show physical activity levels for participants moving from/to San Diego, CA (a,b), San Francisco, CA (c,d), and Baltimore, MD (e,f). The observation period is extended from 30 days to 90 days pre- and post-relocation. Observed changes in physical activity levels suggest that built environment influences persist over at least three months and may lead to sustained long-term behavior change.

a, While there are no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female vs. 50.4% female, P = 0.423, Z-test), b, We find a slightly lower age in our data for movers compared to the US Census reported movers (36.0 vs 37.7 median age), that we corrected for in the simulation experiment (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 1).

Within the study population, we find that movers and non-movers (i.e., relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be a-b, close in age (43.8 vs 37.9 and 38.5 vs 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively), c-d, and weight status (68.1 vs 59.8 and 45.6 vs 44.3 percent overweight and obese for men and women, respectively). e-f, However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 vs 5,825 and 5,279 vs 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively).

Within the study population, we find that movers to higher (greater than 16 walkability points), similar (within 16 walkability points), and lower (less than -16 walkability points) walkability locations tend to be a-b, close in age (44.4 vs 43.7 vs 45.0 and 39.0 vs 38.3 vs 38.3 average age for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively), c-d, weight status (69.3 vs 67.3 vs 66.5 and 46.6 vs 44.9 vs 46.1 percent overweight and obese for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively), e-f, and baseline physical activity levels (6,257 vs 6,229 vs 6,301 and 5,422 vs 5,239 vs 5,405 average daily steps for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively).

After relocation, participants are required to stay in the new location for at least 14, 21, or 30 days. We find that all of these definitions lead to highly consistent results as most relocating participants stay for substantially longer periods of time (median 81 days). In the rest of the paper, we use the 14 day definition (purple).

Participants have an average span of 14.2h between the first and last recorded step, our proxy for daily wear time (Methods). a, Wear time estimates before and after relocation are 14.16 hours and 14.18 hours, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.807; t-test). b, We find no significant association between relocation-induced difference in walkability and wear time. The line shows the best linear fit using data from all relocations. Its slope is not significantly different from zero (slope 0.0014; P = 0.371; t-test). These results suggest that differences in recorded steps after relocation are due to actual differences in physical activity behavior and are not explained by differences in wear time.

The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood1. Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement2,3. We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels4. Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla)5,6, chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions7,8. Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes9,10, without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence11,12, our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan.

Whereas different scenarios have been proposed to account for the emergence of animal phyla such as chordates13, arthropods14 or annelids15, other lineages resist attempts to do so. A prominent example is the chaetognaths, whose phylogenetic position in the tree of bilaterians has long been disputed2. Although chaetognaths do not share obvious similarities with any other extant animal group and their ancient fossil record does not provide obvious clues into their origins, their body plan has remained remarkably stable since the Cambrian period11,12. Patterns of embryonic development (enterocoely and secondary mouth opening)16 originally suggested an association with deuterostomes, whereas other traits were reminiscent of protostomes (chitinous grasping spines and nervous system)3,4. After years of sometimes contradictory molecular analyses10,17, chaetognaths have been assigned to the clade Gnathifera, which represents the sister group to the rest of lophotrochozoan animals within spiralians5,6 (Fig. 1a,b). This placement was then corroborated by the shared presence of the MedPost Hox gene—a unique Hox gene bearing median and posterior molecular signatures—with rotifers, another prominent gnathiferan group18,19, and was further supported by fossil interpretation11,12,20.

Chr., chromsome. d, Gene ontology terms (biological functions) enriched in gene families lost in the gnathiferan lineage (Fisher's exact test, two-sided). e, Evolution of gene linkage in gnathiferans, highlighting the fusions that took place in chaetognath and the extensive chromosomal scrambling in the Adineta rotifer. Links between chromosomes showing significant reciprocal enrichment are displayed and coloured according to their bilaterian linkage group as defined by a comparison with amphioxus. Amphioxus chromosomes not showing an enrichment with P. gotoi are omitted. f, Pearson correlation matrix and corresponding eigenvector (EV1) derived from Hi-C data for chromosome 1. The shift in contacts associated with position of centromere is highlighted (for other chromosomes, see Extended Data Fig. 4).

Understanding the genomic events that led to the emergence of such an unusual body plan thus represents a key challenge to understanding the origin of animals itself. Recent studies have shown how genomic and regulatory changes have sometimes (for example, vertebrates21 and annelids7) but not always (for example, echinoderms22) accompanied the emergence of novel bodyplans. Many lophotrochozoans, such as annelids, molluscs or lophophorates, retained ancestral bilaterian genomic characters, such as gene content, introns23, or conserved chromosomal ancestral linkage7,24. However, within their sister group (the Gnathifera) the only lineage characterized from a genomic standpoint are the rotifers, which underwent fast genomic evolution associated with the acquisition of asexuality in bdelloids25,26. Determining how the evolution of genes and genomes shaped the cell-type complement of gnathiferan lineages is thus crucial to understand the evolution of organismal complexity27. To try to determine whether gnathiferans preserved some of the ancestral traits uncovered in other spiralians and to grasp the origin of the enigmatic chaetognath body plan, we focused on the free-living predatory chaetognath Paraspadella gotoi, and generated a chromosome-scale genome, regulatory profiling resources (Hi-C-seq, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC–seq) and methylome data) as well as a single-cell sequencing atlas, which, together, reveal how changes in the gene repertoire and gene regulation underlined the cell-type bases of body plan evolution in this active predator with elaborate sensory organs and complex behaviours28.

We sequenced the genome of the chaetognath P. gotoi by using long and short reads from a five-generation inbred line and scaffolded the assembly to chromosome-scale level using proximity ligation data (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We obtained a relatively small assembly size of 257 Mb and found 9 major chromosome-size scaffolds, consistent with cytogenetic data in other species2,29. Repeats make up to 20% of the genome, with the major class being long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (8.6% of repeats), followed by long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) (4.6%) and DNA transposons (3.4%) and a large fraction of unclassified repeats (around 80%) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Of note, several DNA transposons are enriched in localized putative centromeric regions (Fig. 1c). We annotated 22,072 protein-coding genes using long and short-read transcriptomic data (Supplementary Table 1).

To characterize the genomic evolution of gnathiferans, we compared our chaetognath genome and transcriptomes with those of other spiralians7,25,30. Gene family analysis uncovered extensive gene loss (2,542 ancestral gene families) in the branch leading to Gnathifera (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). This observation is confirmed by the distribution of PANTHER families (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and maximum-likelihood estimation of gene loss (Extended Data Fig. 2b), and is accompanied with contraction of neural- and sensory-related gene families (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Among gnathiferans, both rotifers and to a lesser extent chaetognaths further experienced lineage-specific gene losses (2,165 and 1,456 families lost, respectively) and contractions of multiple gene families31 (172 and 116 families, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2c). Estimation of these gene family events is robust to alternative species tree5,6 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Functional enrichment analyses surprisingly indicate that nearly all genes involved in CenH3 (also known as CENP-A) centromeric chromatin assembly have been lost in Gnathifera (12 out of 20, including the CenH3 and centromere protein T (CENP-T) genes; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 4), a condition that has been observed in insects exhibiting non-localized holocentromeres32.

Absence of CenH3 centromeres has previously been associated with accelerated genomic rearrangements33. We thus investigated the retention in chaetognath and rotifers of bilaterian ancestral linkage groups (BLGs), which are conserved throughout bilaterian animal evolution, from chordates to annelids7,8. We found that most BLGs remain statistically detectable when comparing chaetognaths with amphioxus, sea star and sea scallop despite multiple fusions, whereas they appear completely scrambled in rotifers (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). Most chaetognath chromosomes seem to derive from 2 to 4 fused BLGs with detected BLGs only represented once, and A2, B2, L, N or Q not detected. Among the four fusions-with-mixing (⊗) previously reported in spiralians, namely H⊗Q, J2⊗L, K⊗O2, and O1⊗R7,8,34, we identified the presence of K⊗O2 and O1⊗R in chaetognaths, indicating that they are likely to be shared by all spiralians (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3). We could not detect Q and L, which could mean either that J2⊗L and H⊗Q fusions took place after the divergence of gnathiferans (particularly as we detected H and J2 alone) or that the signal is too limited. No chromosomal correspondence is detectable between chaetognaths and rotifers (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3d), indicating a similar fast pace of chromosomal evolution in bdelloid and monogonont rotifers (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Together, these results suggest an accelerated rate of chromosomal rearrangement in the gnathiferan lineages.

The loss of CenH3 has been associated in other lineages with the presence of holocentromeres and correlated with an absence of chromatin compartmentalization at the level of chromosome arms in plants33. Here we conversely found a bimodal compartmentalization of the three-dimensional chromatin architecture for all P. gotoi chromosomes (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 4). The borders between these two interacting compartments are enriched in several mobile element categories observed in centromeric regions of other lineages, such as DNA transposons (for example, PIF/Harbinger and ISL2EU transposons; Fig. 1c) as well as LINE/SINE retrotransposons (Supplementary Table 5) and they show increased CpG methylation (Fig. 1c). These regions therefore exhibit classical features of centromeres indicating that chaetognaths possess localized centromeres despite lacking CenH3 and other molecular actors of centromere assembly35 and corroborating prior microscopic observations2,29. Unlike chaetognaths, the rotifer Adineta vaga are likely to possesses holocentromeres25,35,36, suggesting that centromeres have broadly diverged in the gnathiferan lineage and have been replaced in chaetognaths by neocentromeres making use of alternative molecular components.

At a smaller scale, chaetognath chromosomes appear to display very limited large-scale A/B compartmentalization (Extended Data Fig. 4a,e) and we did not observe an aggregated signal consistent with the presence of local topologically associating domains37 (TADs) (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

To better understand how the observed changes in genome architecture and gene complement have shaped the unusual body of chaetognaths, we generated a single-cell atlas of P. gotoi juveniles and adults comprising almost 30,000 cells classified into roughly 30 differentiated cell types (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). We used a combination of in situ hybridization, literature surveys and cross-species comparisons to characterize these cell types and found neuronal, epidermal and muscle cell types, ciliary cells, stem cells, chaetal cells, gut cells and eye cells. To determine their evolutionary origin, we compared chaetognaths cell types to those of selected representatives of main animal lineages38,39,40 (Extended Data Fig. 6). We found multiple cell types that are likely to be derived from the bilaterian ancestor (namely, neurons, muscles, gut, ciliary or germ cells), as supported by the shared expression of multiple orthologous genes (Fig. 2c). However, several cell types appear to be chaetognath-specific, such as their characteristic grasping spines, sensory papillae or ciliary sense organs.

All in situ hybridization experiments were carried out on at least three distinct individuals. The second row shows higher magnification of images in the first row. Numbers indicate clusters in a that are represented by the labelled cells. Chs2-5 is indicative of the chaete cells located near the grasping spines. Vwf-2 is expressed in the epidermal cells, in a subset of which Wnt1 seems to be localized. Tbx2 and Fmar-5 are expressed in ciliary organs. Cac1a-2 is expressed in the main ventral neural ganglion as well as other cephalic cells. Pxdn-9 marks the papillae sensory cells in the head. A full list of cell-type markers is provided in Supplementary Table 6 and molecular probes are listed in Supplementary Table 7. Scale bars, 50 µm.

Among ancestral cell types, we identified two neuronal clusters (clusters 11 and 26) that exhibit gene expression of the neuronal marker Elav, several synaptotagmins, calcium (for example Cac1a-2) and sodium (for example, Scna-3) channels and a dopamine-synthesizing enzyme (Ddc), and can be distinguished by distinct gene expression of glutamate receptors (Grik2 and Grm) and degrading enzymes (Glna) (Fig. 2b). Cac1a-2 is expressed in both the ventral and cephalic ganglia as well as in some peripheral neurons, an abundant cell type in the chaetognath nervous system41 (Fig. 2d). These neuronal clusters map well to those of other protostomes (shared expression of the transcription factor genes Bc11a, Cot1, Csde1 and Meis and the splicing factor gene Rfox3; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 9). Identified sensory cells comprise a photoreceptor cell-type in the eye (cluster 29) that expresses xenopsin 1 (Opsd-1) as described42. Notably, P. gotoi ciliary cell types express Lophotrochin, a gene that was previously shown to be expressed in ciliary bands of lophotrochozoans larvae and adults, including the corona of cilia of rotifers39,43. Two muscle cell types express titin and troponin as well as distinct actin paralogues, corroborating prior expression surveys of alpha actin (Acts-1), localized in longitudinal muscles (cluster 12), and Actin 1 (Acti1-5), in the muscles of the gnatha (cluster 19)44. Finally, two putative germline clusters (clusters 16 and 32; Fig. 2b) express stem cell markers, multiple copies of Vasa (Ddx) previously showed to be present in chaetognath germ cells45, other germline markers such as piwi, Maelstrom and Elav, as well as several enzymes controlling DNA methylation (DNMT3.1, DNMT3.4 and TETb). More than a third of the total of cell-type marker genes are specific to these germline clusters (Extended Data Fig. 6), indicating a massive expression of maternal transcripts during oogenesis, as previously observed in other species46. Chaetognath stem cells co-express multiple chromatin modifiers (for example, Atrx, Chd5 and Dek) or splicing factors (Tra2b and Srrm1) as well as the transcription factors Yboxh-2 with other protostomes (Supplementary Table 9). Overall, we observed a small overlap in transcription factor co-expression among protostome cell types, which agrees with similar comparisons39,40,47 and was further confirmed by a 1:1 comparison between the earthworm and a flatworm dataset (Schmidtea mediterranea; Supplementary Fig. 2).

Chaetognath-specific cell types—that is, those that appear unrelated to any other bilaterian cell types in our cross-species comparison—are associated with phylum-specific sensory and structural roles. Among these, we find two peripheral sensory papillae cell types (expressing neuronal genes such as synaptotagmins and acetylcholine receptors Acha7-1) (clusters 15 and 25) positioned around the mouth and interspersed in the epidermis throughout the body (see Pxdn-9 (ref. 48) in Fig. 2d). We also recover two cell types (clusters 10 and 13) that are associated with ciliary sense organs, mechanoreceptors distributed on the body of the animal that constitute their primary sensory system for swimming and predation, as indicated by expression of Tbx2 and Fmar-5 in these structures48 (Fig. 2b,d). The expression of chitin synthase (Chs2-5) near chaetognath grasping spines indicates that these are probably ensuring the growth and synthesis of the grasping spines (cluster 18), whereas the gene Vwf-2 (clusters 2, 6 and 17) and Ifea-2 (clusters 8 and 20) show expression in the epidermal layer (Fig. 2d). The presence of multiple epidermal cell types is consistent with the presence of a complex pluristratified epidermis in chaetognaths, a condition rarely found outside of vertebrates49. All these structural cell types express various chitin synthase and chitinases, with alternative paralogues present in the ‘chaete' cells (clusters 18: Chs2-5, Chi10-1, Chi10-3 and Chi10-4) and epidermal cells (clusters 2, 6 and 17: Chs2-3, Chit1-7 and Chit1-8).

To further understand the origin and diversification of chaetognath cell types, we then investigated the evolution of the genes involved in their making.

Phylogenetic reconciliation indicated that chaetognaths share a large burst of gene duplication, but whether this event results from a whole-genome duplication or not remains unclear9,10 (Fig. 1b). The magnitude of this event (3,379 families) is comparable in extent to other gene duplication events such as the vertebrate 2R (4,203 families) or the clitellate-specific gene expansion event34 (Fig. 1b). Functional enrichment in P. gotoi duplicated genes highlighted terms related to ion transmembrane transport, as well as developmental genes (Fig. 3a), which is also corroborated with phylogenetic estimation of gene family expansion in chaetognaths (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). This gene expansion is linked to cell-type novelty, as for instance, P. gotoi has eight copies of the piezo gene, a mechanosensory ion channel (with one paralogue specifically expressed in the Papillae cluster 25), which is present as a single copy in limpet or sea urchin50, or up to eight copies of Elav (expressed in neurons and germline cells), which is present as a single copy in most non-vertebrates (Supplementary Table 3).

Each bubble represents the number of shared orthologues between a pair of chromosomes, which is shown in colour (Fig. 1e) if the enrichment is significant (Fisher test) and is otherwise shown in grey. c, Distribution of synonymous transversions at fourfold degenerate sites (FDTvs) between pairs of paralogues in sets of duplicates showing distinct numbers of chaetognath-specific paralogues. d, Number of paralogue pairs shared across chaetognath chromosomes indicate the absence of pairwise chromosome clustering. Each duplicated gene was only counted in paralogue pair to avoid giving excess weight to large paralogous families, thus the matrix is asymmetrical. e, Expected patterns of paralogue pairing in chromosomes in case of whole-genome duplication (WGD; top) or tandem duplication (bottom). f, Phylostratigraphic distribution of cell-type marker genes for P. gotoi (arrow). g,h, Hypergeometric enrichment of genes that originated (g) or duplicated (h) at successive phylostrata in broad cell types of chaetognaths. Box and arrow highlight recently evolved and duplicated genes, respectively.

To determine whether gene duplications occurred at the same evolutionary time, we examined the distribution of transversions at fourfold degenerate sites (FDTv) in pairwise gene comparison. We observe a single FDTv peak for genes that belong to duplicated subfamilies showing distinct numbers of paralogues, indicating that they probably originated in a single event (Fig. 3c). Duplicated genes mostly occur in pairs, but higher copy numbers make up more than 50% of these duplicates (3 or more copies; Extended Data Fig. 7a). Next, we examined the location of duplicates across the genome. The chromosomal distribution of duplicates does not match the distribution of ancestral linkages across chromosomes as only one copy of bilaterian linkage groups is detected in P. gotoi chromosomes (Fig. 3b). We also found that about 25% of duplicate pairs are located on the same chromosomes, and that no chromosome pair displays a mutual enrichment in duplicates, as would be expected in a whole-genome duplication event (Fig. 3d,e). The separation between duplicate pairs shows a bimodal distribution, with some pairs approximately 10 kb apart and some around 10 Mb apart (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Similarly, we did not detect fewer introns in members of duplicated gene families, ruling out a burst of retrotransposition (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Together, these observations are more consistent with a burst of tandem duplication than with a single whole-genome duplication event, which is a rather unique condition among animals. The unusual expansion of median and posterior Hox genes of chaetognaths is an example of such tandem expansion (Fig. 4a).

All in situ hybridization experiments were carried out on at least three distinct individuals.

MedPost appears to be expressed in an array of sensory cells that are interspersed in the epidermis. c, Schematic of a juvenile P. gotoi with overlaid Hox expression domains. Scale bar, 100 µm.

This reshuffling of the chaetognath gene repertoire is not limited to gene duplications. In total, up to 2,250 gene families appear to be specific to chaetognaths (that is, found in at least two of the four chaetognath species considered, but not outside chaetognaths) (Fig. 1a). This is quite a remarkable condition for a bilaterian phylum; by contrast, we detected only 157 and 124 lineage-specific gene families in molluscs or echinoderms, respectively51 (Fig. 1a). In P. gotoi, these families include 1,832 genes, 8.3% of all predicted genes; to ascertain these numbers, we further confirmed that 1,307 of these genes do not have detectable homology outside chaetognaths in a direct phylostratigraphy assignment, and we observed Pfam domains in only 397 of them (Supplementary Table 1). These distinct lines of evidence support that this observation is not a reconstruction artefact such as those pointed out by recent studies31. These novel genes appear to have a regulated expression and putative functional role, as 1,471 of them are among cell-type markers in at least a single-cell cluster (Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Table 1). We did not observe similar bursts of gene novelties in similarly fast-evolving lineages such as platyhelminths or ecdysozoans, which further rules out the possiblity of homology detection failure (Fig. 1a).

We found that both novel and duplicated gene populations have a key role in chaetognath cell types, particularly novel ones, as many of them are cell-type-specific (for example, ‘chaete', Fmar, ciliary and epidermis; Fig. 3g,h). We estimated the phylostratigraphic age of gene sets specific to each cell type by leveraging gene phylogenetic age and noticed that ciliary cells appear among the ones with the most recent profile (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Notably, such an incorporation of phylum-specific genes among cell-type markers is observed only in chaetognaths when compared to five other investigated species in which most marker genes are either ancient or species-specific (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8c). We therefore hypothesize that after extensive gene loss in the gnathiferan lineage, particularly that affecting gene families involved in sensory and nervous functions, the evolution of cell types in chaetognaths relied on newly evolved genes as well as lineage-specific tandemly duplicated genes. This reshuffling of the gene repertoire therefore probably had an instrumental role in the establishment of their distinctive body plan of chaetognaths.

As a primary example of tandem duplication, we found that P. gotoi possesses an increased complement of 14 Hox genes19, related to an expansion of both median (7 genes, 3 copies of the PG6/8 paralogy group) and posterior Hox genes (5 genes), an exceptional situation outside vertebrates (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3). The Hox cluster of P. gotoi is unusually large, spanning 2.4 Mb (Extended Data Fig. 9a), with genes arranged in the expected ‘colinear' order, and also includes 15 interspersed non-Hox genes (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Remarkably, the MedPost gene, originally described as an oddity19 and later as a synapomorphy of Gnathifera18, is consistently located in the cluster between median and bona fide posterior Hox genes, as originally predicted; its location could not be corroborated in rotifers in which the Hox cluster is dispersed25.

Hox genes are expressed in several cell types, mainly epidermal, neuronal and papillae cell types (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In situ hybridization on six Hox genes in P. gotoi juveniles (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Table 7) indicates that whereas anterior Hox genes show a broad expression in the chaetognath nervous system (paired ventral and cephalic ganglions for Hox1 and Hox4), median and posterior Hox genes show a more classical staggered expression in the ventral ganglion that appears coherent with the paralogy group (MedN3 is more anterior than MedN4, and PostN4 in the posterior-most part of the ganglion)19 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). PostN4 presents a dual domain, both in the posterior-most part of the ventral ganglion and in the postanal region of the juvenile (Fig. 4b). Surprisingly, MedPost is localized in papillae peripheral sensory neurons interspersed in the epidermis (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9b). The expression of MedPost in sensory neurons throughout the body is different from that observed in rotifers, where it is expressed specifically in the postanal components of the nervous system (Extended Data Fig. 9c). In chaetognaths, posterior Hox genes are expressed in this postanal region; these genes have been lost in rotifers18. The cell-type-specific expression of MedPost suggests that acquisition of new expression domains could have participated in the emergence of novelties at the body plan or cell-type level.

We set out to understand whether the reshuffling of chaetognath gene complement had an effect on their gene regulation52. We found that P. gotoi represents an outlier in terms of DNA methylation among animals. Whereas most non-vertebrate lineages have highest levels of DNA methylation on gene bodies, usually associated with robustly expressed genes53, the vast majority of P. gotoi genes are not methylated (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 10), and the few that are contain protein domains that are typical of retrotransposons and have depleted chromatin accessibility, suggesting that they are silent genes with transposon origins (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Morevoer, whereas transposable elements in most invertebrates are rarely directly methylated, P. gotoi shows a clear targeting of DNA methylation on transposons—most acutely on LTR retrotransposons, but also on other classes—but none on low-complexity repeats that are less likely to be parasitic (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10c). This pattern of exclusive transposable element methylation and absence of gene body methylation represents a pattern reminiscent of fungi and other unicellular eukaryotes, and has been observed in only few animal lineages, including early diverging nematodes and ctenophores54,55.

To explore how P. gotoi has modified its methylome compared to other animals, we examined the genetic toolkit responsible for DNA methylation in this species. We found that DNMT1 and its partner UHRF1 underwent gene duplications, with their paralogues undergoing probable sub-functionalization through the loss of ancestral protein domains such as zinc-finger CXXC in DNMT1 or the ubiquitin domain in UHRF1 (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 10d). Similarly, none of the three copies of TET (including a retrocopy) encode the ancestral zinc-finger CXXC domain combination that is probably shared by most spiralians56. Finally, six copies of DNMT3 are present in chaetognaths, which all lost the ADD and PWWP domains; the latter drives DNA methylation to gene bodies by binding to H3K36me3 in other animals, a histone post translational modification that is typical of gene bodies57. Most DNA methylation genes are expressed in germ line cell types similarly to what has been observed in mice58 (Extended Data Fig. 10e). In sum, P. gotoi represents an independent example of DNA methylation retargeting from gene bodies to transposable elements, associated with protein domain simplification of the DNA methylation toolkit.

Many genes in chaetognaths have been reported to undergo trans-splicing, a post-transcriptional spliceosomal modification that is associated with operonic transcription and resolves polycistronic transcripts10,59. At the genome scale, we found that trans-splicing is prevalent, occurring in nearly half the genes (10,197 out of 21,072 predicted genes), and 18% of all genes are organized in operons resolved by trans-splicing (Fig. 5c). Trans-splicing involves spliceosomal addition of splice leaders to messenger RNAs, with the splice leader sequence derived from genes often located in the ribosomal DNA clusters far from their target genes60. We identified three distinct splice leaders in P. gotoi, of which one (SLs1) is shared with Spadella cephaloptera10. Trans-splicing and operonic transcription have a patchy distributions across animals, which suggests independent evolution in distinct lineages (nematodes, tunicates and rotifers)10,60. However, despite its proposed role in recovery from growth arrest59 or germline maintenance61, the evolution role of trans-splicing remains debated. Here, multiple splice leaders are found among the various transcripts of a given gene, and contrary to nematodes60, we did not identify operon-specific splice leaders (Fig. 5d).

Functionally, operonic genes are preferentially related to nitrogen and protein metabolism and they are negatively associated with development, nervous system and signalling, suggesting that finely regulated genes are excluded from this process (Fig. 5e). For instance, the longest operon gathers nine genes, including genes encoding ribosomal proteins, ubiquitin and proteasome subunits (Supplementary Table 1). Trans-spliced genes have a higher expression level (Extended Data Fig. 7f) and have, in general, a lower expression specificity at the cell-type level than those not subjected to splice leader addition (Fig. 5f); however, operonic and trans-spliced genes make up most of cell-type marker genes in the germline clusters (Fig. 5g). Trans-spliced genes are also not restricted to a phylogenetic origin and belong to all phylostrata (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Consistently, trans-spliced genes have a smaller number of putative regulatory elements (for example, as indicated by ATAC–seq peaks), in agreement with their lower regulatory and expression complexity (Fig. 5h). The presence of a large fraction of trans-spliced genes could have contributed to the overall compact regulatory landscape of P. gotoi compared to other lineages, with open chromatin regions located closer to the transcription start site (TSS)7,21 (Extended Data Fig. 7h and Supplementary Table 11). However, we identified conserved distal regulatory regions and transcription factor binding properties with that of other animals (Extended Data Fig. 7h–k). Interestingly, this also suggests that non operonic trans-spliced genes share these functional properties with operon genes rather than non-trans-spliced ones. We also detected enriched motifs associated with trans-spliced genes (for example, Fig. 5i), which do not correspond to transcription factors characterized in other lineages, corroborating the idea of independent origin of trans-splicing and operonic transcription in metazoans10,60.

Our results show that chaetognaths stand out from other animal lineages at the molecular and genomic levels, and provide clues to explain why their unique body plan appears so distinctive from other animal phyla2. Chaetognaths have undergone an extensive reshuffling of their gene complement as well as major fusions of ancestral chromosomal linkages (Fig. 1). This extensive duplication of genes does not appear to be related to a single whole-genome duplication event, but rather a burst of tandem duplications (Fig. 3). In contrast to the microscopic rotifers and other gnathiferans, large-bodied chaetognaths have an active predatory lifestyle with an array of sensory receptors, such as ciliary organs reminiscent of the lateral line4, that are associated with innovation and diversification at the cell-type level (papillar, Fmar, ciliated and epidermal).

The gnathiferan lineage underwent accelerated genomic evolution, either as a single event or as multiple lineage-specific events that could plausibly have been coupled with morphological and body size reduction from their ancestors. In this view, chaetognaths would have secondarily evolved complex organ systems by mobilizing lineage-specific duplicated and novel genes instead of mainly relying on genes from the ancestral bilaterian toolkit, which had been decimated in this lineage, unlike what is observed in other animals (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 7). Of note, rotifers also acquired new genes, albeit through the distinct process of horizontal gene transfer, that were involved in the evolution of novel traits such as resistance to desiccation or ionizing radiation62. The paucity of Cambrian fossils for other gnathiferans such as rotifers or gnathostomulids, and their relatively large body size (for example, Amiskwia12) does not provide palaeontological support for a small-bodied gnathiferan ancestor. Further characterization of genomes and gene expression in other gnathiferan lineages (such as micrognathozoans or gnathostomulids) would help to further resolve organismal and genomic evolution in the gnathiferan lineage.

Chaetognaths also shed some light on the relationship between gene regulation and gene and genome evolution. The reshuffling of the gene repertoire in chaetognaths coincides with the evolution of novel strategies of gene regulation, such as the acquisition of trans-splicing10. Consistent with a previously proposed model61, trans-spliced genes are particularly enriched in the germinal cells and show limited regulation. Trans-splicing may have a role in stabilizing housekeeping gene expression when gene body methylation is lost, suggesting a recurrent evolutionary process. Of note, trans-splicing is present in ctenophores, chaetognaths and nematodes53,54, the three animal phyla in which gene body methylation has been repurposed for transposable element targeting. However, other evolutionary forces may have a role in the loss of gene body methylation, such as the DNA repair burden imposed by DNA methyltransferases54. Notably, lineages with trans-splicing, such as nematodes, tunicates, rotifers, platyhelminths and potentially ctenophores, are also prone to loss of ancestral linkage8,60. The absence of detectable sequence-insulated chromatin domains in chaetognaths, which have recently been shown to be a bilaterian innovation55, would require further confirmation (for example, using micro-C55), but could suggest that such structures are less widespread than anticipated.

Our analysis of the genome, cell types and gene regulation provides clues to the origin of one of the most enigmatic bilaterian lineages, and a molecular explanation for its derived state and distinctive characteristics.

An inbred line was generated for five generations by crossing the progeny of an adult P. gotoi collected in the tidal zone near Amakusa (Kyushu prefecture, Japan). To this aim, juvenile chaetognaths were fed with increasingly older nauplii of the copepod Tigriopus japonicus to match their size until capable of feeding on adults according to previously established culture protocol64. DNA was extracted from about 20 adults using phenol-chloroform65. Illumina paired-end (25.9 Gb, about 100×), mate-pair (4 libraries: 3, 5, 7 and 10 kb insert) and Pacbio long-reads (5 Gb, about 20×) were sequenced from libraries prepared with this material. A proximity ligation library was constructed from about 20 adults collected at the same locality near Amakusa. In brief, animals were crosslinked in 1% paraformaledehyde, and chromatin was subsequently extracted, immobilized on solid-phase reversible immobilization beads, washed and digested with DpnII as described66. After end-labelling, proximity ligation was carried out using T4 DNA ligase and cross-linking reversed using Proteinase K, removed from the beads and the DNA fragments were purified again on SPRI beads. Sequencing library was constructed using the NEB Ultra library preparation kit (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 instrument.

The genome was assembled using meraculous (v.2.2.2.5) with a k-mer size of 41 and diploid mode set to ‘1' to enable haplotypes merging67. Primary contigs were screened for contamination using Blobtools (v.1.0.1) and three contaminant contigs were removed at this stage. Pacbio long-reads were then incorporated in the assembly using PBJelly with blasr alignment performed with the parameters ‘-minMatch 8 -sdpTupleSize 8 -minPctIdentity 75 -bestn 1 -nCandidates 10 -maxScore -500'. The resulting assembly was scaffolded using HiRise with the Hi-C data68 as previously described69. The assembly was evaluated with BUSCO (v.5.4.1) with a final score of C:94.3% [S:91.3%, D:3.0%], F:1.3%, M:4.4% (n:954, metazoa_odb10). Examination of coverage and k-mer distribution using Merqury (v.1.3)70 and BUSCO statistics71 indicate that a minimal fraction of residual haplotypes has been retained (Extended Data Fig. 1). This is possibly due to the loss of polymorphisms during the inbreeding procedure.

Illumina RNA-seq and Pacbio Isoseq reads were generated using RNA extracted from pooled adult individuals. RNA-seq was aligned to the genome using STAR (v.2.5.2b), assembled using stringtie (v.1.3.3b) and also assembled as de novo transcripts using Trinity (v.2.5.1)72. For Isoseq reads, full length transcripts were obtained after circular consensus, detection of SMART adaptors, and polishing, as recommended by the manufacturer (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq). These transcripts, as well as the trinity contigs, were aligned to the genome using GMAP (v.2017-09-05) and processed according to the Mikado pipeline (v.1.2.1) that leverages distinct transcriptomes, detects putative gene fusions by similarity search against Swissprot, enforces adequate splice-junctions from a curated set inferred using Portcullis (v.1.0.2) and inferred coding sequence using Trans-decoder73. High-quality transcripts derived from Mikado were used as a training set to generate a species-specific profile in the Augustus de novo prediction tool74. Intron and exon positions were subsequently used as hints to perform a gene prediction with Augustus, together with proteins of Lottia gigantea aligned using Exonerate (v.2.2.0). Gene models were further refined using PASA adding untranslated region (UTR) regions and isoforms by relying on the Mikado transcriptomes. We obtained a total of 22,082 genes (Supplementary Table 1). Repeat families were reconstructed using RepeatModeller (2.0.1) and subsequently used to annotate repetitive regions and compute repeat divergence in the genome with RepeatMasker (4.1.0) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Rideogram was used for karyotype representation of gene and transposable elements contents (Fig. 1c). Functional annotation was performed using Eggnog-mapper (v.2.1.5)75 and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments were performed using the goatools Python package76. For GO enrichment associated with family losses, we assigned non-redundant GO terms for each family from the emapper annotation obtained for selected species specified in Supplementary Table 2 and computed enrichment at the family level.

Gene families were first reconstructed using Broccoli (v.1.1)77 using the proteomes from the species listed in Supplementary Table 2. We constructed sequence alignments for all families including more than 6 genes, more than 3 species and fewer than 400 sequences in total using MAFFT (v.7.471)78 filtered with CLIPKIT (v.1.1.6, -m gappy)79 and an initial tree reconstructed with IQ-TREE (v.2.1.1) assuming the LG + R model80. These alignments and trees were then used as input for GeneRax (v.2.1.3)63 with duplication and loss model (UndatedDL) and a per family rate. Reconciled trees in XML format were subsequently parsed to infer gene loss and gene duplication events for each node of the species tree (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Gene gains and losses were inferred following parsimony principles and using the ete3 Python library to process phylogenetic trees. For relevant lost families, we assessed whether the best blastp match in relevant species belonged to another gene family to disclose potential gene fragmentation related to evolutionary acceleration. Gene absence was also corroborated by tblastn against the genome of P. gotoi. For complementary phylostratigraphic analyses, we used GenEra (v.1.0.2)81 with default options using the NCBI NR database. To compute FDTvs, we performed a self-alignment of the chaetognath proteome using a MMSeqs2 (r12-113e3)82, and then reverse translated the alignments and computed the corresponding substitutions using custom code. For the CAFé analysis, a dated tree was obtained by extracted phylogenetic markers described in ref. 5 for the selected proteomes included in the analyses. An ultrametric dated tree was reconstructed using Phylobayes (v.4.1e) assuming a CAT + GTR model, a CIR relaxed clock model, birth-death priors on divergence times (0.5) and the following calibrations83,84,85 (lower–upper bounds in million years): euarthropods (531–514), ecdysozoans (636–519), Gnathifera (636–518.5), bilaterians (636–521) and deuterostomes (635–516). CAFE (v.5.1) was then applied using gene families previously defined from Broccoli assuming a gamma model with one rate category (k = 1) and no error model86.

For synteny comparisons, orthologous pairs were inferred by mutual best hit using MMSeqs2 (r12-113e3)82. Joint orthologue genome coordinates in chromosomal location were used for ‘Oxford grid' plots (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3) and Fisher's exact test was used to determine mutual enrichment of orthologues between chromosomes. Ribbon plots connecting orthologues in multiple species (Fig. 1d) were generated using Rideogram (v.0.2.2).

Hox genes were annotated based on similarity search toward previously annotated chaetognath Hox genes19,87, inspection of diagnostic residues and phylogenetic analysis of selected bilaterian homeodomain genes (Supplementary Fig. 3) using IQ-TREE with a LG4X model and 1000 ultra-fast bootstraps.

Hi-C reads were mapped using bwa mem (v.0.7.17) with parameters -5SP -T0. Ligation events in the aligned sequences were then identified with pairtools (v.1.0.2)88. In brief, we first used pairtools parse with parameters --min-mapq 30 --max-inter-align-gap 30 --no-flip --add-columns mapq --walks-policy 5unique, sorted resulting contact pairs with pairtools sort and removed duplicates with pairtools dedup to obtain the final filtered contact pairs file. Using juicer_tools (v.1.22.01)89, filtered contact pairs were exported to a multi-resolution Hi-C matrix (2.5 Mb, 1 Mb, 500 kb, 250 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 25 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 5 kb) and normalized with the Knight-Ruiz (KR) procedure90. Contact map resolution was estimated using the approach proposed in ref. 66. In brief, for each bin size stored in the multi-resolution Hi-C matrix, we count the number of bins with >1,000 contacts. The map resolution is given as the smallest bin size where >80% of bins have >1,000 contacts (5 kb here). All downstream analyses were performed using the fanc Python package (v.0.9.23)91.

Putative centromere positions were inferred from Hi-C (Extended Data Fig. 4f): for each chromosome, we: (1) computed Pearson contact correlation matrices; (2) visually selected for each chromosome the eigenvector that best captured centromere information; and (3) identified centromere as the most insulating region (highest eigenvector value differential). We tested for the enrichment of specific repeats at inferred centromere location using a permutation procedure. Specifically, for each repeat family or subfamily ‘r' overlapping at least 1 predicted centromere, and for each chromosome ‘c', we: (1) generated n = 1,000 randomizations of ‘r' over ‘c' and (2) computed empirical permutation-based P values based on the random background overlap of repeats at centromere.

To assess the organization of the P. gotoi genome into TADs, we computed insulation scores on the Hi-C matrix at 25 kb resolution using a window size of 250 kb. Putative TAD boundaries were called from insulation scores and TADs with boundary strength >0.5 (that is, discarding the first peak of weak boundary scores) were retained for the aggregated TAD and Hox cluster plots. Finally, organization into A/B compartments was assessed by: (1) selecting, for each chromosome, eigenvectors that best separate active and inactive regions on the basis of ATAC peak number; (2) orienting eigenvectors with ATAC peaks so that entries >0 correspond to active regions and <0 inactive; (3) representing interactions strength across active and inactive regions as a saddle plot (Extended Data Fig. 4e) using 50 eigenvector value categories.

ATAC–seq was performed as previously described92 following the Omni-ATAC protocol including digitonin (Promega)93. Tn5 tagmentase (Illumina) was applied to 50k nucleus and library subsequently constructed by PCR. ATAC–seq reads were aligned to the genome using bowtie2 (v.2.4.2)94 with the parameters –very-sensitive and -k 10. Open chromatin regions (OCR or peaks) were called using Generich (v.0.6) (https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich) using ATAC model (-j), keeping unpaired alignments (-y), removing PCR duplicates (-r) and excluding reads mapped to mitochondria (-e MT). Unified OCRs were computed using pyBEDtools (github) as well as their relative location toward genes and 42,810 peaks in total were identified (Supplementary Table 11) and compared with their distribution in other species7,21,92. Mapping statistics and fraction of reads in peaks, calculated using bedtools (v.2.30.0), are provided in Supplementary Table 12. Motif enrichment was performed using HOMER (v.5) for both known and de novo motifs and plant derived motifs were excluded from results relying on known motifs95.

Low-input RNA-seq libraries were generated from gastrula, hatchling and 3 days post-hatchling juveniles using low-input protocol (NEBNext Low Input RNA). We used SLIDR to perform a de novo annotation of splice leaders from RNA-seq data using default parameters96 and compared the identified list with previously identified splice leaders in other chaetognath species10. We found that P. gotoi uses three major splice leaders of which two are shared with other chaetognath species. We performed a BLAST similarity search on Isoseq full length transcripts to annotate trans-spliced genes. To quantify trans-splicing in RNA-seq data, we aligned each set of RNA-seq reads to the genome using STAR (v.2.7.8a), detected splice leaders in reads using BBDuk from BBTools to with k = 25 and hdist=3 and set them aside as separate BAM (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/). We then quantified reads for our gene models using featureCount97. We considered a gene trans-spliced if at least five reads including a splice leader aligned to it. We annotated operons in the genome as sets of two or more genes separated by less than 250 bp, which yielded 2,151 candidate operons containing 5,061 genes. Of those, 1,470 validated operons include at least 1 gene with annotated splice leader involving 3,565 genes.

Adults and 3 dpf juveniles of P. gotoi were dissociated in filtered natural sea water in presence of 1% Pronase with gentle trituration, cells were washed, debris removed using 40-µm and 70-µm cell strainers (Flowmi) and resuspended in 50% Leibowitz L15 medium. Single-cell suspension quality and cell concentration was evaluated using C-Chip Disposable haemocytometer (NanoEntek) and viability was assessed using Trypan blue (Thermo Fisher). Around 15,000 cells were loaded into a 10x chip (10x Genomics, v.2) and 3 libraries (2 for adults and 1 for 3 dpf juveniles) were prepared and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 and NovaSeq X instrument (Illumina). Reads were mapped onto the P. gotoi genome using Cell Ranger (v.7.0.1) after extending the 3′ UTR of the genome annotation by 900 bp with the script utr_extension.py. Library saturation is 59.8% for adult 1, 74.2% for adult 2, and 89.5% for 3 dpf juveniles, and read depth is 24,583 mean reads per cell for adult 1, 37,173 for adult 2 and 58,191 for juveniles. Counts were analysed using Seurat (v.5)98 and all cells with fewer than 500 or more than 20,000 unique molecular identifiers, fewer than 200 genes and mitochondrial content higher than 20% were filtered out. Our final dataset contains 29,513 cells (21,777 adult cells and 7,736 juvenile cells) expressing 19,367 genes. These datasets were merged, normalized, scaled and subjected to principal components analysis (using the top 50 principal components) followed by canonical correlation analysis integration were performed on the object layers. Our final resolution for clustering was set to 1, resulting in a total of 33 cell clusters (Rscript in Supplementary Information). Gene expression specificity such as the tau metrics or the coefficient of variation were computed as described99.

SAMap (v.1.0.2) was applied between the P. gotoi datasets and the following species: the polyclad flatworm Prostheceraeus crozieri39, the flatworm S. mediterranea100, the oyster Crassostrea gigas (larval stages39), the earthworm Eisenia andrei40, the annelid worm Pristina leidyi38and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster40. Cell-type annotation for all species can be found in Supplementary Table 8; for a list of genes shared between dataset per cell type, see Supplementary Table 9.

Synthetic probes were designed for selected genes (Supplementary Table 7) flanked by T7 or SP6 adaptor (IDT). Riboprobes were then synthesized using the DIG labelling kit (Roche). In situ hybridization was performed as described7,101,102 with a shortened Proteinase K digestion (2–3 min). Stained embryos and juveniles were imaged with a Zeiss AxioImager M1 using bright field Nomarski optics. Unfortunately, surveying the expression of other Hox genes than the one we investigate here in P. gotoi proved challenging as the high AT percentage and low-complexity stretches in their transcripts made it impossible to synthesize or clone a probe.

Using the same genomic DNA obtained for genome sequencing, 100 ng of P. gotoi gDNA were spiked in with unmethylated lambda phage and CpG methylated pUC19 control before fragmenting it to about 300 bp with a BioRuptor (Covaris). The resulting sheared DNA was then used to prepare an Enzymatic Methyl-seq library according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit). The library was sequenced with a NovaSeq instrument using 150 paired-end reads to an average coverage of ~14× per CpG site. Reads were mapped to the reference genome, including also a phage lambda and pUC19 sequences, using BS-Seeker2 (v.2.1.8) with bowtie2 as back-end. Duplicate reads were removed with Sambamba (v.1.0.1), and methylation calls were obtained using CGmapTools (v.0.1.3). The lambda genome showed a non-conversion rate of 0.11%, and the pUC19 methylated control showed 97.88% global methylation at CpG methylation sites, as expected for this technology and validating the quality of the library. The rest of the data were read into R using the bsseq Bioconductor package, which was used to obtain methylation average per gene and genomic windows used for chromosome-level methylation. Bigwig files were constructed from the CGmapTools output, and were used as input for DeepTools2 to detect methylation levels on top of protein-coding genes and the repeat annotation (Extended Data Fig. 10). Methylation genes were obtained using human DNMT1, DNMT3A, TET1 and UHRF1 sequences as input for a BLASTP search against the predicted proteome of P. gotoi, and were subsequently analysed in the InterProScan web server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro). The top hits were manually inspected and contrasted with the phylogenetic trees obtained from the GeneRax search.

The reductive functionalization of inert substrates such as chloroarenes is a critical yet challenging transformation relevant to both environmental remediation and organic synthesis. Combining electricity and light is an emerging strategy to access the deeply reducing potentials required for single electron transfer to chloroarenes, yet this approach is limited by poor stability and mechanistic ambiguity. Here we demonstrate heterogeneous electrophotocatalysis using redox-active rylene diimide polymers for the reduction of chloroarenes. We find that the electrophotocatalytic activity varies dramatically as a function of the rylene diimide and the redox-inactive polymer backbone. In particular, a flexible, non-conjugated perylenediimide polymer outperforms all other tested electrophotocatalysts. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that precomplexation between the doubly reduced perylenediimide and the haloarene substrate is key to productive catalysis. Overall, this work highlights heterogeneous electrophotocatalysis using insoluble redox-active organic materials and provides critical structure–property insights into solid-state electrophotocatalytic activity, informing the development of next-generation materials for sustainable synthesis.

Since the all-new ChatGPT launched on Thursday, some users have mourned the disappearance of a peppy and encouraging personality in favor of a colder, more businesslike one (a move seemingly designed to reduce unhealthy user behavior.) The backlash shows the challenge of building artificial intelligence systems that exhibit anything like real emotional intelligence.

Researchers at MIT have proposed a new kind of AI benchmark to measure how AI systems can manipulate and influence their users—in both positive and negative ways—in a move that could perhaps help AI builders avoid similar backlashes in the future while also keeping vulnerable users safe.

Most benchmarks try to gauge intelligence by testing a model's ability to answer exam questions, solve logical puzzles, or come up with novel answers to knotty math problems. As the psychological impact of AI use becomes more apparent, we may see MIT propose more benchmarks aimed at measuring more subtle aspects of intelligence as well as machine-to-human interactions.

An MIT paper shared with WIRED outlines several measures that the new benchmark will look for, including encouraging healthy social habits in users; spurring them to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills; fostering creativity; and stimulating a sense of purpose. The idea is to encourage the development of AI systems that understand how to discourage users from becoming overly reliant on their outputs or that recognize when someone is addicted to artificial romantic relationships and help them build real ones.

ChatGPT and other chatbots are adept at mimicking engaging human communication, but this can also have surprising and undesirable results. In April, OpenAI tweaked its models to make them less sycophantic, or inclined to go along with everything a user says. Some users appear to spiral into harmful delusional thinking after conversing with chatbots that role play fantastic scenarios. Anthropic has also updated Claude to avoid reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation or loss of attachment with reality.”

The MIT researchers led by Pattie Maes, a professor at the institute's Media Lab, say they hope that the new benchmark could help AI developers build systems that better understand how to inspire healthier behavior among users. The researchers previously worked with OpenAI on a study that showed users who view ChatGPT as a friend could experience higher emotional dependence and experience “problematic use”.

Valdemar Danry, a researcher at MIT's Media Lab who worked on this study and helped devise the new benchmark, notes that AI models can sometimes provide valuable emotional support to users. “You can have the smartest reasoning model in the world, but if it's incapable of delivering this emotional support, which is what many users are likely using these LLMs for, then more reasoning is not necessarily a good thing for that specific task,” he says.

Danry says that a sufficiently smart model should ideally recognize if it is having a negative psychological effect and be optimized for healthier results. “What you want is a model that says ‘I'm here to listen, but maybe you should go and talk to your dad about these issues.'”

The researchers' benchmark would involve using an AI model to simulate human-challenging interactions with a chatbot and then having real humans score the model's performance using a sample of interactions. Some popular benchmarks, such as LM Arena, already put humans in the loop gauging the performance of different models.

The researchers give the example of a chatbot tasked with helping students. A model would be given prompts designed to simulate different kinds of interactions to see how the chatbot handles, say, a disinterested student. The model that best encourages its user to think for themselves and seems to spur a genuine interest in learning would be scored highly.

“This is not about being smart, per se, but about knowing the psychological nuance, and how to support people in a respectful and non-addictive way,” says Pat Pataranutaporn, another researcher in the MIT lab.

OpenAI is clearly already thinking about these issues. Last week the company released a blog post explaining that it hoped to optimize future models to help detect signs of mental or emotional distress and respond appropriately.

The model card released with OpenAI's GPT-5 shows that the company is developing its own benchmarks for psychological intelligence.

“We have post-trained the GPT-5 models to be less sycophantic, and we are actively researching related areas of concern, such as situations that may involve emotional dependency or other forms of mental or emotional distress,” it reads. “We are working to mature our evaluations in order to set and share reliable benchmarks which can in turn be used to make our models safer in these domains.”

Part of the reason GPT-5 seems such a disappointment may simply be that it reveals an aspect of human intelligence that remains alien to AI: the ability to maintain healthy relationships. And of course humans are incredibly good at knowing how to interact with different people—something that ChatGPT still needs to figure out.

“We are working on an update to GPT-5's personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman posted in another update on X yesterday. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”

I don't mean to be dramatic when I say coffee grinders are both the biggest mystery in coffee, and also coffee's biggest hive of technological invention.

If you find yourself in the online rabbit holes of the coffee world these days, you'll almost certainly encounter a bean geek eager to tell you a secret. The secret is that your coffee grinder is more important to how your coffee tastes than your drip brewer, and also more important than your espresso maker.

This idea makes some sense. Just like temperature and time and pressure, the size of your coffee grounds will determine how fast your brewer can extract flavor—and maybe even which flavors get pulled out. Uneven coffee grinds, with lots of ultrafine particles or giant boulders, will cause uneven extraction. This in turn will result in bitter or muddy coffee, or a failed shot of espresso.

But until pretty recently, grinder tech had been ignored by all but the nerdly few, says Jordan Michelman, cofounder of coffee website Sprudge, which for 15 years has been the coffee industry's home page. (Michelman is also a contributor to WIRED.)

“It's really just in the last decade that a lot more attention has been paid to grinder minutiae, grinder results, grinder tech,” Michelman said, noting it's now become a frenzy. “There's been quite a lot more advancement, technological innovation, new tools, and new stuff in the world of grinding than there has been in espresso [machines].""

Now, it's rare to find anyone who cares about coffee using a cheap, old-fashioned blade grinder—basically a blender for coffee—which roughly chops coffee beans with spinning steel. The new wisdom is that only burr grinders will do. Conical burrs are like a many-angled drill bit, crushing and funneling and finally cutting each bean. Flat burrs, meanwhile, are like spinning wheels of death that rotate against each other at a set separation.

But even if you buy the expensive grinder, it's hard to know how well a coffee grinder is actually working, or even the basic rules behind what types of grinders create what flavors. Do conical burrs make coffee taste more like chocolate? Does a flat burr love fruit? Maybe. Technical-minded coffee influencers like Lance Hedrick have been pretty open about throwing up their hands when it comes to broad generalizations about how different types of grinders perform. The science, quite frankly, isn't in. Grinders are lore. Each burr set is quite specific. It's a shared culture of subjectivity.

When I test grinders, much of the hard work is often done simply by taste test, comparing flavors yielded by different grinders with the same beans. I've used magnifying lenses to look at the evenness of grinds, scratched my head over static and clumping, and spent untold hours comparing notes with other coffee obsessives online.

But up to now, about the best objective home tool for assessing grind precision was to pour coffee grounds through a set of sieves, and see how much coffee you still had left. Not a Leibovitz-caliber portrait, but it's something.

Imagine my excitement, then, to finally have a piece of equipment that could potentially depict how well a coffee grinder works in granular detail. Specifically, I've got a DiFluid Omni ($900), a new device that promises something heretofore unknown: the chance for home coffee geeks to graph out the particle size distribution of a batch of coffee. (It also has a colorimeter, to assess the lightness or darkness of a roast.)

Until recently, you'd have to shell out thousands of dollars to conduct particle size analysis on a batch of coffee—or maybe know somebody in Germany who runs a university lab. The Omni comes in at about a quarter of the price of the next closest device I've found. Still a lot, but it's an amount of money that many people actually possess. And the Omni promises to graph particle size with more reliability than previous attempts at home analyzers.

And so for kinda the first time, it's possible for someone at home to assess how good a grinder is. Even a few years back, says Michelman, having tech like this at home would have seemed “unthinkable.”

Now that it's thinkable, we figured we'd put our favorite coffee grinders to the test—the grinders that the WIRED Reviews team has been recommending based on long experience. The coffee grinders we've been not just recommending but also sometimes arguing vociferously about behind the scenes. Some questions now have answers.

So who would prevail? The Fellow Opus or the equally priced Baratza Encore ESP? Are higher-end burr grinders demonstrably better than budget grinders? And does the Omni actually work as advertised? The results are a little complicated. But I've learned more about my favorite coffee grinders this month than in the entire past year.

For each grinder, among seven I tested during this first round of particle analysis, I kept it simple. I used the same coffee beans, from the same batch: A Stumptown Single Origin Colombia whose flavor I know well, with its roast date printed on the bag.

I tested a medium grind for drip or pour-over coffee. And I tested nearly the finest grind each grinder was capable of, which usually was an espresso grind. (Just in case the actual finest grind was an outlier, I moved up a notch or a few notches coarser, for each grinder.) I then ran at least five tests for each grind size, for each grinder, to get a cumulative particle distribution. To collate and visualize this data, I relied on an app that's still in beta testing as of August 2025: DiFluid's CoffeeOS app.

Each test involved using a wee sampling of coffee grounds, totaling one-64th of a teaspoon or less. To run the test, I spread the grounds across the white circular base of the Omni. This could be done using Omni's brush, or the device's vibration function. Both methods were recommended by DiFluid, but I found that vibration worked better for fine grinds, while coarse grinds were better off being dispersed by the brush.

Then I placed the Omni's top onto the base: The top of the device has a camera whose lens faces the circular base with the coffee grounds on it. The camera captures the size of each ground, assuming the grounds are dispersed appropriately.

The results weren't always perfect: It's hard to stop coffee from clumping. But they were illuminating. DiFluid's app is still in beta, so I'll wait to publish full results of particle size analysis—and in the meantime keep collecting more data. But I will offer a number of early impressions.

Spoiler: An app can't tell you what grinder is best. But it does help tell you which one's more precise, and it gives you insight into how each grinder develops flavor at different grind settings. And among all of the electric coffee grinders I tested, the Baratza Encore ESP proved itself to have the most precise results at very fine grinds.

On fine grinds, about 30 percent of the ESP's coffee grounds huddled in peak range—the most concentrated result of any electric grinder I tested. At a medium grind level, the ESP wasn't quite as tightly grouped—and there was a fair amount of coffee fines. In my experience with the ESP, these contributed more to full body than bitterness.

Meanwhile the Fellow Ode Gen 2, a flat burr grinder we've long held as our favorite for drip coffee, produced a textbook-looking normal distribution at medium grinds—a mix of precision and nuance—but a flat distribution at finer grinds.

The biggest surprise was the Technivorm Moccamaster KM5, a flat burr grinder I hadn't tested till this past month. The Moccamaster showed quite precise results across the board—rivaling the Encore ESP at fine grinds and the Ode Gen 2 at grinding for drip. Moccamaster is a much-trusted coffee brewer brand, of course, known for its analog precision. But it's not known for grinders, and without this particle analysis I might not have clocked how well it did.

In fact, multiple results were surprising. The conventional wisdom is that flat burr grinders are precise, and conical burr grinders are more likely to show a balanced blend of grind sizes—and therefore bring out sweetness, depth, and chocolate. But raw data from particle analysis showed mixed results even for the same grinder, depending on the coarseness or fineness of the grind setting.

And so the same grinder might evince austerity at one grind level, and sweetness at another. At coarser grinds, the Kingrinder K6 hand grinder behaves much like the Ode, with a nearly textbook bell-curve distribution surrounding a central peak—as if plucked from questionable studies about human ability.

But when I dialed the K6 tighter to espresso-fine grinds, the K6's curve compressed to what looked like a slender butte: Grind sizes stayed fairly even, across a tightly compressed range. This would indicate precise and aromatic pour-over, but chocolatey espresso—maybe the best of both worlds. These results were backed up by my own taste test.

And yet, precision is relative. A surprise from this testing was the extreme variability of coffee grounds within each sample, among all grinders tested. Coffee grounds aren't one size or another: Rather, they live on a continuum. The sweet spot for brewing coffee in any given style is a window of just a few hundred microns—and yet, the standard deviation for the grinders I tested was rarely less than two hundred microns.

Coffee grinders invariably spit out a range of both large and small particles. A range of coffee particle sizes isn't bad, necessarily: This can lead to balance, depth, and complicated toffee or chocolate notes. Tight particle distributions will more likely express more specific aromatics, like bright cherry or funky plum. The one universal is that you don't want too many extra tiny particles (which can lead to bitterness), or extra large boulders (which lead to muddled, muddy flavor).

I had trouble getting useful results from the Omni at first. The device doesn't always differentiate between coffee grounds when they're too close together, and its base has a quite small surface area, which makes for a small sample size. Combined with the broad variability among samples, it's tough to draw helpful conclusions from any individual test—enough so that I initially thought the DiFluid Omni was a bust.

I sent worried emails to DiFluid's customer support to this effect, and was told at first to try using smaller scoops of coffee to avoid clumping. I tried spritzing coffee beans with a tiny bit of water before grinding, to avoid static electricity. I also shook and stirred the grounds before sampling, to declump further—and tried out multiple distribution methods to spread the coffee grounds optimally across the Omni's base.

But in the end, the problem wasn't clumping: It was sample size. To mitigate this, you'll need Omni's CoffeeOS app, which is still in beta but accessible through Discord. Pair your phone to the device, and the app can collate results from multiple tests to build a more robust distribution curve. By the time you conduct five or more tests pulled from the same batch of coffee grounds, patterns begin to emerge.

If DiFluid Omni is still a bit fussy to get results from, it offers the best snapshot I've seen of how—and how well—an individual coffee grinder operates. Presumably, DiFluid will keep improving on its software and firmware. Meanwhile, competitors may also enter the market at an accessible price point. This'll all be good. Already, I have a brand new way to understand why my coffee tastes the way it does. Michelman, the cofounder of Sprudge, says tools like this weren't conceivable for home coffee drinkers even a couple years ago.

“These are tools that were once only the sort of thing you could imagine having access to in, like, a successful coffee bar with dough to spare,” he said. Particle size analysis was available only to “a fraction of a fraction” of people in the coffee industry.

On the one hand, a home particle size analyzer for your coffee grounds is so deep down the nerdhole it's hard to even find the exit. On the other, it's a future that would have once felt unimaginable.

The owner of the Carolina Hurricanes NHL team has reportedly reached an agreement to buy the Portland Trail Blazers NBA team from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

Dallas-based billionaire Tom Dundon confirmed the deal but declined to give specific details on Wednesday, according to CNBC. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that the price tag was over $4 billion.

The Oregonian reported that Dundon heads a group of investors that includes the co-president of Blue Owl Capital, Marc Zahr, as well as Portland-based Sheel Tyle, co-CEO of Collective Global. A source said the group “is passionate about basketball and intends to keep the team in Portland, where it belongs.”

Any deal will require NBA approval.

The Allen estate announced in May that it was seeking a buyer, consistent with Allen's wishes that his sports franchises be sold off, with the proceeds going to philanthropy.

The sale is part of the long process of divesting many of the assets and investments that Allen made during his lifetime. Allen died in 2018, at the age of 65, after he was diagnosed with a recurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Allen's estate, headed by his sister Jody Allen, previously said the Trail Blazers announcement does not impact its ownership of the Seattle Seahawks NFL franchise, or its 25% stake in the Seattle Sounders MLS team, which are not yet for sale.

The Trail Blazers started play during the 1970-71 NBA season. Allen bought the team in 1988 for $70 million.

Instagram is working on a feature called “Picks” that aims to help users find common interests. The Meta-owned social network confirmed to TechCrunch that Picks is an internal prototype and isn't being tested externally.

The feature was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they're still under development.

According to screenshots shared by Paluzzi, people select their favorite movies, books, TV shows, games, and music, or their “Picks.” Instagram then finds overlaps with friends who chose the same things.

While Instagram hasn't shared any details about the feature, the company likely views Picks as a way for users to connect more personally with friends and spark conversations around shared interests. 

Instagram head Adam Mosseri said earlier this year that the social network was going to focus on creativity and connection in 2025. “To help people connect with friends over the things they discover on Instagram, we're going to double down on messaging, make consuming content more interactive and social, and explore new ways to connect with friends,” Mosseri wrote in a January Instagram post.

Of course, not everyone will welcome Picks, as it adds yet another feature to an already overcrowded app. Instagram is facing backlash following the launch of Instagram Map, with many users saying they never wanted the feature in the first place.

As with any other feature in development, it's not known when or if Instagram plans to officially roll out Picks.

Anthropic has acquired the co-founders and most of the team behind Humanloop — a platform for prompt management, LLM evaluation, and observability — in a push to strengthen its enterprise strategy.

The terms of the deal were not shared, but it appears to follow the acqui-hire playbook we're increasingly seeing in the tech industry amid the war for AI talent. Humanloop's three co-founders — CEO Raza Habib, CTO Peter Hayes, and CPO Jordan Burgess — have all joined Anthropic, alongside around a dozen engineers and researchers. 

Anthropic is growing fast in the enterprise space as it leads in agentic and coding capabilities. While an Anthropic spokesperson confirmed that the AI firm did not acquire Humanloop's assets or its intellectual property, that's a moot point in an industry where IP lives in the brain. And what Humanloop's team is bringing to Anthropic is experience developing the tools that help enterprises run safe, reliable AI at scale.  

Or as Brad Abrams, API product lead at Anthropic, put it: “Their proven experience in AI tooling and evaluation will be invaluable as we continue to advance our work in AI safety and building useful AI systems.” 

In a market where model quality alone isn't enough to stay competitive, bolstering its tooling ecosystem could position Anthropic to cement its lead over OpenAI and Google DeepMind in both performance and enterprise readiness. 

Humanloop was founded in 2020 as a University College London spinout. The startup then went on to participate in Y Combinator and the Fuse Incubator before raising $7.91 million in seed funding across two rounds led by YC and Index Ventures, per PitchBook. Humanloop gained a reputation for helping enterprise customers — including Duolingo, Gusto, and Vanta — develop, evaluate, and fine-tune robust AI applications.

Last month, Humanloop told customers that it would be shutting down in preparation for an acquisition.

The timing of this acqui-hire comes as Anthropic offers features like longer context windows to enterprise clients, improving what its models are capable of and where they can be applied.

Earlier this week, Anthropic reached a deal with the U.S. government's central purchasing arm to sell its AI services to government agencies across executive, judiciary, and legislative branches for just $1 per agency for the first year — a clear move to undercut OpenAI's similarly priced offering. Both government and enterprise buyers demand the type of evaluation, monitoring, and compliance features that Humanloop specialized in. 

The acquisition is also on brand for Anthropic as it bills itself as a “safety-first” AI company. Humanloop's evaluation workflows align with that mission by providing constant performance measurement, safety guardrails, and bias mitigation.

“From our earliest days, we've been focused on creating tools that help developers build AI applications safely and effectively,” said Raza Habib, former CEO of Humanloop, in a statement. “Anthropic's commitment to AI safety research and responsible AI development perfectly aligns with our vision.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","‘Are You Surprised?': Trump Shrugs Off New Suspected Hack of Documents by Russia","https://gizmodo.com/are-you-surprised-trump-shrugs-off-new-suspected-hack-of-documents-by-russia-2000642556","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 17:52:23 GMT","

President Donald Trump was asked on Wednesday about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents. Russia is suspected to be behind the attack, as the New York Times first reported on Tuesday. But Trump doesn't seem to think it was a big deal, even as the president prepares to meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.

Trump was asked by a reporter if he would bring up the hack when he meets Putin in Alaska on Friday. “I guess I could,” Trump replied without committing to anything. “Are you surprised, you know? Are you surprised they hack in? That's what they do.”

Trump went on to say, “They're good at it. We're good at it. We're actually better at it, but, no, I have heard about it. I have heard about it.” The president has a long history of brushing off attacks on the U.S. as insignificant because America has done the same kinds of things to its adversaries. And while that's true, it's not the kind of thing U.S. presidents typically say to excuse attacks on the U.S. and subsequent inaction.

Trump recently went so far as to admit that he gave Iran permission to bomb a U.S. base in Qatar, suggesting that's just the kind of thing that should be allowed. “They said, ‘We're going to shoot them. Is one o'clock OK?' I said it's fine,” Trump said during a press conference in June. “And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn't get hurt, except for the gunners.” It's easy to imagine how Republicans would've responded if a president like Barack Obama or Joe Biden gave another country a green light to attack the U.S.

The New York Times describes the hack of the federal court records as a “yearslong effort,” and it's not clear which specific entity may have been involved. It's also not clear if any countries besides Russia or known hacking groups may have contributed to the effort. An internal memo to the U.S. Department of Justice from system administrators of the system, known as PACER, describes the hack as “persistent and sophisticated,” compromising “sealed records” that are not otherwise available to the public.

TRUMP: I guess I could. Are you surprised? They hack in — what's what they do

The compromised records come from court districts in a variety of states, including New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, and Arkansas, according to the Times. The attempts to infiltrate the federal court records system date to at least January 2021, according to a press release from that era. That release was published on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of Trump's coup attempt at the U.S. Capitol, though it's not clear if the attacks are in any way related to Russia's preference for Trump as president. Russia was not named as the entity trying to access sensitive court documents at the time, but the Times reports that federal law enforcement officials believed Russia was behind it.

Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin on Friday, though he accidentally said he was going to Russia during a press conference on Tuesday: “You know, I'm going to see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once-beautiful capital [is].”

Trump, whose mind often seems to be slipping (he referred to St. Petersburg as “Leningrad” on Wednesday), is actually meeting the Russian leader at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. The presidents will be discussing ways to end the war in Ukraine, which has been raging ever since Russia first invaded in early 2022. Trump promised to stop the war even before he was sworn into office, though that obviously didn't happen.

Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would request that Putin stop bombing civilians, to which he replied “No,” insisting that he'd already had that discussion with the Russian leader. President Trump instead insisted that he was just going to end the war, something he described as “Biden's war,” as he often does to escape accountability for his failure to bring an end to the conflict.

REPORTER: Can you convince Putin to stop targeting civilians in Ukraine?

TRUMP: I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation. I want to end the war.

Trump then pivoted to talking about what he called the “Russia hoax,” a reference to the extensive contacts his campaign had with Russian operatives in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election and subsequent investigations. By his own admission, Putin wanted Trump to become president, something Trump has denied so frequently that many apolitical observers assume it must be true. Trump had even publicly encouraged Putin to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails in July of 2016, something the Russians eventually did successfully.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, had a call with Trump and European leaders on Wednesday morning before Trump's press conference at the Kennedy Center. Zelensky has been excluded from the Friday meeting with Putin, but Trump said that he'll include Ukraine in the discussions if it goes well.

“If the first one goes okay, we'll have a quick second one,” Trump said. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky, and myself, if they'd like to have me there.”

An American teenager is currently stuck in Antarctica after allegedly illegally landing his single-engine airplane in Chilean territory.

19-year-old Ethan Guo, who was in the midst of navigating a trip around the world when he landed at the world's southernmost pole, has been stuck in the icy region since June, according to the Associated Press. Upon landing, local officials charged Guo with providing them with “false flight plan information” and landing without authorization. Since then, he has been staying at a military base while he awaits movement on the court case, AP writes.

Unlike the exploits of many other influencers, Guo's stunt does seem to have involved a noble goal: the young American wants to become the youngest person to fly to all seven continents, while also collecting donations for childhood cancer research along the way. The teen's “Flight Against Cancer” has so far raised $131,000, according to the St. Jude fundraiser page associated with the effort. Guo has said that he hopes to raise over $1 million, which will go to St. Jude's Children's Hospital.

On Monday, the charges against Guo were dropped as part of an agreement between his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors, the AP writes.  To avoid a trial, the agreement requires that Guo donate $30,000 to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days, the outlet says. He is also required to leave the country as soon as conditions allow, and he is not to return to Chile for a period of three years. Gizmodo reached out to Guo through his Instagram for comment.

At the time that he became stranded, Guo had already finished much of his journey, having traversed six of the world's continents, the BBC reports.

According to Guo's fundraiser, he originally began learning to fly when he was 13. He subsequently became interested in beating the world record for the youngest person to fly to all seven continents. “Unfortunately, my cousin, who is the same age as me, developed stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a young man, I watched the disease affect the people closest to me, such as my grandparents and aunts, little by little,” Guo wrote. “Since then, I decided to do what I could for Cancer research. In order to raise funds for research and international awareness, I decided that by breaking the record, I could get the necessary attention to influence and help as many people as possible who are suffering from the disease.”

It's unclear when Guo will be heading back to the U.S. He has said that, when he is released, he hopes to continue his trip around the world. “I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight,” the teen told the Associated Press on Monday. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.”

Update 8/13 1:30PM: Guo's legal team disputes Argentinian authorities' accusations, and they sent Gizmodo the following statement:

Recent reporting has presented a one-sided and incomplete narrative of the events in Antarctica, relying on the prosecution's initial, unfounded accusations while ignoring the substantial evidence that led to a settlement fully vindicating Mr. Guo.

To correct the record, documentary evidence and audio recordings provided to the prosecutor definitively show that Mr. Guo's original destination was Ushuaia, Argentina, as confirmed by his flight plan and fee payments. Due to bureaucratic confusion over flight rule permissions, Chilean officials suggested he circle in darkness over Tierra del Fuego before proceeding to Ushuaia at sunrise. While doing so, he encountered instrument failures and heavy, unreported icing conditions caused by high cloud cover over the Andes, creating an imminent risk of a crash.

To avert disaster, he diverted over the ocean. Once over the ocean, he experienced engine-related issues, likely to due to sudden, weather-related pressure changes. Due to these cascading failures, Mr. Guo requested and received explicit, direct permission to land at the Marsh base from a high-ranking DGAC official via WhatsApp, an authorization that was subsequently confirmed by the base's air traffic controller.

The legal ordeal was a direct result of the prosecutor's refusal to acknowledge this clear evidence. Despite his exoneration, the Chilean government has not allowed him to fly his airworthy plane off the base, resulting in his de facto confinement on the island for a month and a half. The stress of this ordeal has caused a severe deterioration in his health, including a 20 kg weight loss and a diagnosis of pericarditis (inflammation of the heart's outer membrane). While he is grateful for efforts to secure him passage on a boat, he is frustrated that there is no plan for his plane, preventing him from continuing his charitable mission to raise funds for St. Jude.

OpenAI has capitulated and reinstated older models, and promised not to kill them off again in the future.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI made a controversial move at the end of last week by replacing all of its older GPT-4 models with a single GPT-5 model, which it claimed was more accurate, more capable, and faster than ever before.

Although some users have highlighted its impressive response times and ability to pass certain technical tests, users have revolted, claiming it's lost some creative spark, frequently provides inadequate responses, deliberately avoids emotional and sensitive topics, and performs significantly worse than its predecessors.

It's been such a backlash that OpenAI quickly re-added the previous flagship 4o model, though only for paying subscribers. It has also introduced an ""auto,"" ""thinking,"" ""fast,"" and ""pro"" mode for users of the new model.

OpenAI launched GPT-5 with high hopes, describing it as the ""best AI system yet,"" capable of ""smart, efficient"" reasoning and responses. OpenAI claims that the model listens to user intent and adjusts its responses accordingly, with a built-in ""router"" that could look for errors and make it more refined, with mini versions of the model taking over if usage limits are ever too high.

It was supposed to be better for coding, better for business, better for creativity, but the user response suggests it's anything but.

A quick glance at the ChatGPT subreddit shows that it's filled with complaints about how poor GPT-5's responses are. Some highlight its limited emotional range, responding to the news of the death of a loved one with recommendations for funeral homes. In comparison, GPT-4 variants were almost overly emotional and verbose, which is perhaps something OpenAI had hoped to clear up with this new model.

The company certainly still believes it's a very capable model. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been retweeting various individuals claiming that GPT-5 just doesn't hallucinate like older models did.

Indeed, by the numbers, GPT-5 should be extremely capable. Vellum's various AI benchmarks have GPT-5 as top of the chart for Maths and Reasoning, and very competitive in a range of others (typically ahead of previous standout models like 4o and 3o).



Our sister site, Tom's Guide found GPT-5 to be impressive in its testing, highlighting that it beats Google's Gemini 2.5 in a range of text-based prompt outcomes.

But despite positive feedback from some sources, the complaints from users are very real and growing ever more numerous.

Some of GPT-5's errors, which have been widely shared online, make the model look poor. This highlights that even if it makes errors in certain tasks less frequently, GPT-5 is still very capable of falling on its face. Crucially, like older models, it also doesn't seem to realise that it's made any kind of mistake.

That makes Altman's boundless enthusiasm for this release all the more surprising. The OpenAI CEO hinted that the company was approaching the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) landmark, which many companies claim is the holy grail of AI development.

GPT-5 doesn't appear anywhere near that, and is arguably less impressive than its predecessors, since it should be more capable. For many users, that just doesn't appear to be the case. The release of GPT-5 is raising questions about whether AI development is plateauing.

For many users, though, that conversation isn't interesting. They just want their old models back. A petition quickly sprang up following the launch of GPT-5, which demanded that OpenAI keep GPT-4o available for users.

OpenAI did acquiesce to that one, though it has locked 4o behind its subscription paywall for now.

But it's not about to admit any major fault just yet. Although Altman said (via SiliconRepublic) that GPT-5 was behaving in a ""dumb"" way recently, which he claims is now fixed. He also alluded in personal posts on Twitter/X that users were potentially using the model wrongly, and were too attached to AI models and personalities.

""People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways; if a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that,"" he said in a Twitter/X post. ""Most users can keep a clear line between reality and fiction or role-play, but a small percentage cannot. We value user freedom as a core principle, but we also feel responsible in how we introduce new technology with new risks.""

However, those personal thoughts aside, OpenAI has expanded options for GPT-5 and increased messaging limits for the more capable ""Thinking"" version. OpenAI is also said to be working on a new, warmer version of GPT-5, but without dipping into the sycophantic behaviour that characterized GPT-4o at times.

Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking…August 13, 2025

It's also reinstating older models, making the drive for a singular GPT-5 feel a bit redundant, even if it is likely to please fans who have a specific attachment to the flavor of an older model.

Despite the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI has an uphill battle to fight in the weeks and months ahead. Despite managing to top the charts of several AI benchmarks, something isn't landing well with users. With updated models from big-hitters like Anthropic, Meta, and more surely on the horizon, OpenAI may be vulnerable to a loss of market share in the competitive AI thunderdome.

ChatGPT may be a household name for now, but if it can't keep public sentiment on its side, competitors could edge out the supposedly leading GPT-5 model.

I've got 3D printers and lots of low-power single board computer (SBC) and related items in my office, so what do I do with them? Of course I had the crazy idea to 3D print my own file / media server.

I'm not designing this from scratch, rather I am using the excellent Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) from Haydn Bao. Specifically the free version of the kit, but from what I have seen, I shall be paying the $27 (£20) for the premium model.

MASS is a compact and modular NAS enclosure that has been designed by Bao to print on many of the best budget 3D printers. I printed 99% of my parts using an Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and 1.5KG of Elegoo Rapid PETG filament. The remaining 1% of the 3D print process was completed on my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro. Why? Because it prints TPU (flexible filament) extremely well and I need four feet to stop the case sliding around the desk.

The brains for this project is a LattePanda Mu with an Intel N100 and a mini-ITX motherboard. Inside the Mu's module I have a quad-core Intel N100 CPU capable of up to 3.4GHz, 8GB of LPDDR5 and 64GB of eMMC. I'll be installing a Linux based operating system and to manage the drive, OpenMediaVault.



Right now, I have a plethora of 3D printed parts which have been printed over the past week. I'll have a breakdown of the times and amount of filament used over the entire build process, and I will have links to key tools and products used so you can make your own.

I know what you are going to ask. ""Why are you 3D printing a case when you can buy one?"" The simple answer is, because I can and I want to give my Elegoo Centauri Carbon a real project so it can show just how good it is. So join me in this live blog as I show you the ups and downs of 3D printing your own NAS device.

Wow, just wow. I did not expect the build to come out like this. I am truly stunned, and I can't wait to start work on the next part, the drive bays which can hold up to four 3.5 inch drives, and it even has rails to pull the drives in and out of the bays!

I'll be back tomorrow for more fun as I build this truly excellent kit!

Let me say this first, this is a great build! I'm actually enjoying it, no hype or hint of falsehood, I am having a great time.

Frist of all I inserted some M3 nylon standoffs into the top and bottom sections of the APU where my LattePanda board resides. Why nylon standoffs? Because my other brass M3 standoffs weren't long enough so I had to improvise. With the standoffs in place I lined up the screw points on the motherboard and used some nylon M3 screws to secure the motherboard to the top and bottom frame, effectively using the motherboard to provide extra strength in the central core. Don't make my mistake, get yourself a selection of screws for PC case building. Mine are on the way from Amazon.



Following the instructions, I'm using M3 20mm self tapping countersunk screws to secure the 3D printed sections together. I bought a 100 from Amazon so I have plenty of spares. When screwing into plastic, make sure that you are committed to the task, unscrewing and re-screwing will only weaken the build. Personally, I would've liked to have seen threaded inserts melted into the screw holes, but time and talent did not allow this time.

I lined up the screws, and carefully screwed them in until I felt them ""bite"". To do this I used a small Wera ratcheting screwdriver from my PC first aid tool kit, which also has a 3D printed project hidden inside it.



Once they are lined up, I bring out the big guns. The HOTO Electric Screwdriver that myself and a few other editors own. This makes short work of driving the screws into the PETG plastic, but the ratcheting screwdriver helps me ""feel"" when the screw is in correctly.



I now carry on with the build process, I have clips and case sides to add.

The LattePanda Mu's Mini ITX development board sadly does not have common ATX-style power connectors, but it does have a 5525 DC barrel jack for an external power brick. Great!

It also has a power button on the motherboard, so what is my problem? Well, the rear panel of the MASS case has a breakout for a 16mm push button, or a standard PC key switch but the LattePanda development board doesn't have a conventional breakout for power buttons, case LEDs etc. So I had to improvise.



I dug out my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter, set it to continuity, and probed the four test points with the power off! The outer most points connected when the power button was pressed, this makes a connection and triggers the board to power up. So I soldered on some wires, and tested the connection with a 16mm button from my collection.



I chose to use ferrules on the bare wires that are held in the jaws of the screw terminal. Why? Better mechanical grip and they reduce the risk of shorts. Also, I love ferrules.

I tested this setup before committing to the wiring, and all went well so I made the fix permanent using some Kapton tape and better soldering.



The Kapton tape also acts as strain relief, handy as the next part of the process sees me build the motherboard into the case, using plenty of M3 screws and nuts.

Haydn Bao's Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) project oozes quality. From the 3D printable models to the instructions, I can see that I will have a lot of fun building this kit.

First of all, the models. The MASS Instructables and project page show off both the free and premium versions of the kit and Bao is meticulous in detailing the differences, so that we have an informed choice as to what model we want to print.

I downloaded the free kit and opened the ZIP archive and found lots of parts to print and an optional section (which I used for a few parts) for parts to augment your build.



Loading these parts into a slicer, in my case Elegoo's fork of Orca Slicer, Elegoo Slicer, and I can clearly see that these parts have been designed with ease of printing in mind. They come pre-oriented for best printing and Bao has designed supports directly into the parts.



The instructions are awesome. A great mix that illustrates the build process in words and pictures. How to attach the parts together, their orientation, what screws to use and advising on optional parts for your build.



I love the instructions! Now, I have to use them to build my server, but first I need to perform a little surgery on my LattePanda Mu, specifically the power button!

Clinicians are more likely to indicate doubt or disbelief in the medical records of Black patients than in those of White patients-a pattern that could contribute to ongoing racial disparities in healthcare. That is the conclusion of a new study, analyzing more than 13 million clinical notes, publishing August 13, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Mary Catherine Beach of Johns Hopkins University, U.S.

There is mounting evidence that electronic health records (EHR) contain language reflecting the unconscious biases of clinicians, and that this language may undermine the quality of care that patients receive.

In the new study, researchers analyzed 13,065,081 EHR notes written between 2016 and 2023 about 1,537,587 patients by 12,027 clinicians at a large health system in the mid-Atlantic United States. They used artificial intelligence (AI) tools to find which notes had language suggesting the clinician doubted the sincerity or narrative competence of the patient-for example stating that the patient ""claims,"" ""insists,"" or is ""adamant about"" their symptoms, or is a ""poor historian."" 

Overall, fewer than 1% (n=106,523; 0.82%) of the medical notes contained language undermining patient credibility – about half of which undermined sincerity (n=62,480; 0.48%) and half undermined competence (n=52,243; 0.40%). However, notes written about non-Hispanic Black patients, compared to those written about White patients, had higher odds of containing terms undermining the patients' credibility (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.27–1.32), sincerity (aOR 1.16; 95% CI 1.14–1.19) or competence (aOR 1.50; 95% 1.47–1.54). Moreover, notes written about Black patients were less likely to have language supporting credibility (aOR 0.82; 95% CI 0.79–0.85) than those written about White or Asian patients.

The study was limited by the fact that it used only one health system and did not examine the influence of clinician characteristics such as race, age or gender. Additionally, as the utilized NLP models had high, but not perfect, accuracy in detecting credibility-related language, they may have misclassified some notes and thereby under- or overestimated the prevalence of credibility-related language. 

Still, the authors conclude that clinician documentation undermining patient credibility may disproportionately stigmatize Black individuals, and that the findings likely represent ""the tip of an iceberg."" They say that medical training should help future clinicians become more aware of unconscious biases, and that AI tools used to help write medical notes should be programmed to avoid biased language. 

The authors add: ""For years, many patients – particularly Black patients – have felt their concerns were dismissed by health professionals. By isolating words and phrases suggesting that a patient may not be believed or taken seriously, we hope to raise awareness of this type of credibility bias with the ultimate goal of eliminating it.""

A UK university's clever menu shuffle shows how small, invisible changes to dining options can drive big gains for both health and the planet, no new recipes required.

Study: Dish swap across a weekly menu can deliver health and sustainability gains. Image credit: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com

A weekly menu with 15 dishes across five days can be tweaked to produce hundreds of combinations that could yield healthier meals without excessively repeating foods or restricting customer preferences. The concept was tested in a UK university residence over two separate optimized weekly menus in four weeks, including about 5,000 meals. The results were published in Nature Food. 

Dietary health changes are notoriously difficult to sustain. Approaches to achieving long-term food choice shifts include educating and informing the target group, providing different food choices related to each food event, regulating some foods, like alcohol, by age of consumption, or providing positive or negative incentives for specific foods.

Education and regulation have proved more successful with habits like smoking and drinking than dietary changes, which require a more nuanced approach. Firstly, since food is key to maintaining life, interventions cannot emphasize cessation, such as smoking; instead, the goal must be to eat more healthy foods. Secondly, competition between different foods on the menu means that people choose one meal option and cannot eat alternative meals at that time.

The researchers note that this “competition structure” creates opportunities for strategic menu design to shift choices toward healthier and more sustainable options, while ensuring that everyone's most preferred dish remains available. These principles were important in the current study.

Investigators aimed to observe the benefits of shuffling foods on a limited menu so that different (healthier) choices are available and chosen more often. This could potentially benefit about 42% of workers in the UK who have their meals at a canteen and over nine million schoolchildren who can eat at school canteens.

The current study was held in a UK university residence and covered about 5,000 meals for 300 students over four weeks. The aim was to see how changing the food-choice architecture impacted dietary health and sustainability regarding saturated fat intake and carbon footprint. If successful, it could also be extended to other environmental indicators and dietary health markers.

Simply swapping around the 15 dishes would yield over 1.4 million menu combinations. One vegan meal was included daily to meet most residents' dietary requirements. This constraint removed 1,288,000 combinations from consideration, resulting in 113,400 feasible menu options. Differences in individual preferences were considered using data from 70 students, who ranked dishes in a computer-based two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task before the intervention.

Two weekly menus were optimized from the feasible set of combinations according to the preferences of a representative consumer sample. The menus contained the same 15 dishes but in different daily combinations. These were then introduced as blind interventions. Data on meal selection were collected from the whole population of consumers. Since only population-level data were gathered, an inferential statistical test could not be performed.

This allowed researchers to calculate the total weekly carbon footprint (projected) and saturated fat intake.

The current study analyzed ~5,000 meal selections, allowing for robust inferences.

Changing the food combinations around between the three daily meals, five days a week, led to inadvertent and significant reductions in the consumption of saturated fats by an average of 6.3% (week-by-week: 11.3% and 1.4%), while the carbon footprint of the food fell by an average of 30.7% (31.4% and 30.0% for the two weeks). When compared to the EAT-Lancet guidelines, the current study achieved 38% of the recommended reduction in carbon footprint by dish swapping, without requiring any changes in procurement or recipes on the producer's side, or consumer preferences.

The approach was tested for generalizability by applying the optimization procedure to assess the change in four markers of environmental performance: carbon footprint, eutrophication potential, water use, and land use, concerning the dietary content of fiber, salt, sugar, and saturated fatty acids. In 31/32 cases, both outcomes improved, some by as much as ~70%. For example, the authors report a 69.2% increase in fiber intake while reducing eutrophication potential by 31.7%.

Overall consumer satisfaction did not change significantly after dish swapping, but the method used to assess this requires further work. Most importantly, the dishes themselves do not change. This tool's simplicity lends itself to wider use in multiple sectors in the future, including canteens in educational and healthcare facilities. This plan can be used independently and alongside other strategies to ensure the dishes are novel and sustainable.

Meal swapping led to a 30.7% reduction in the carbon footprint and a 6.3% reduction in saturated fat intake. This indicates the positive effect on healthy eating and sustainability of the diet of users of this university canteen.

“This demonstrates the potential of strategic menu manipulation to benefit health and the environment, without the need for recipe changes.”

Further research could focus on maximizing profit and vegetable consumption while minimizing food waste and the distance between the producer and the table.

Scalability is a concern before this tool can be widely adopted. This would require software that allows catering staff to use it easily; training for these personnel to collect meal preference data from canteen users, and user-led quantification of their food's nutritional and environmental effects. Alternatively, future versions might integrate with existing catering sales data to bypass separate preference surveys.

This might permit such systems to be used directly with catering organizational tools that provide such data. The outcome could help population groups to eat healthier diets and promote agricultural sustainability.

A study published in Nature Biotechnology reveals a powerful new use for artificial intelligence: designing small, drug-like molecules that can stick to and break down harmful proteins in the body - even when scientists don't know what those proteins look like. The breakthrough could lead to new treatments for diseases that have long resisted traditional drug development, including certain cancers, brain disorders, and viral infections.

The study was published on August 13, 2025 by a multi-institutional team of researchers from McMaster University, Duke University, and Cornell University. The AI tool, called PepMLM, is based on an algorithm originally built to understand human language and used in chatbots, but was trained to understand the ""language"" of proteins.

In 2024, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to researchers at Google DeepMind for developing AlphaFold, an AI system that predicts the 3D structure of proteins – a major advance in drug discovery. But many disease-related proteins, including those involved in cancer and neurodegeneration, don't have stable structures. That's where PepMLM takes a different approach – instead of relying on structure, the tool uses only the protein's sequence to design peptide drugs. This makes it possible to target a much broader range of disease proteins, including those that were previously considered ""undruggable.""

""Most drug design tools rely on knowing the 3D structure of a protein, but many of the most important disease targets don't have stable structures,"" said Pranam Chatterjee, senior author of the study who led the work at Duke and is now a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. ""PepMLM changes the game by designing peptide binders using only the protein's amino acid sequence,"" said Chatterjee.

In lab tests, the team showed that PepMLM could design peptides – short chains of amino acids – that stick to disease-related proteins and, in some cases, help destroy them. These included proteins involved in cancer, reproductive disorders, Huntington's disease, and even live viral infections.

This is one of the first tools that can design these kinds of molecules directly from the protein's sequence. It opens the door to faster, more effective ways to develop new treatments.""

Pranam Chatterjee, senior author of the study

The study included major contributions from McMaster University, where Christina Peng, a PhD student in the Truant Lab, led the Huntington's disease experiments.

""It's exciting to see how these AI-designed peptides can actually work inside cells to break down toxic proteins,"" said Peng. ""This could be a powerful new approach for diseases like Huntington's, where traditional drugs haven't been effective.""

Other parts of the study were carried out at Cornell, where Matthew DeLisa and Hector Aguilar's labs constructed and tested the peptides on viral proteins, and at Duke, where Chatterjee's team developed the AI model and ran early validation experiments. The study also included contributions from Ray Truant at McMaster.

""This work shows we can now bind any protein to any other protein,"" said Truant, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry & Biomedical Sciences. ""We can degrade harmful proteins, stabilize beneficial ones, or control how proteins are modified – depending on the therapeutic goal.""

The team is already working on next-generation AI algorithms, like PepTune and MOG-DFM, to improve how these peptides behave in the body – making them more stable, more targeted, and easier to deliver.

""Our ultimate goal is a general-purpose, programmable peptide therapeutic platform – one that starts with a sequence and ends with a real-world drug,"" said Chatterjee.

The research was supported by the CHDI Foundation, Wallace H. Coulter Foundation, The Hartwell Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Krembil Foundation of Toronto, among others. Chatterjee and first author Tianlai Chen are co-inventors on U.S. patent applications related to PepMLM. Chatterjee and co-author DeLisa have financial interests in UbiquiTx, Inc., a biotech company developing programmable protein-based therapies.

Trio made comments in new docuseries episode

Pulisic: Critics ‘disrespected me in a lot of ways'

Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, and Mark Pulisic (Christian's father) all delivered searing takes on ex-US men's national team players who criticized the team during their recent run of bad form, with Weah deeming the pundits to be “evil.”

The trio made the comments in the latest epsiode of the Pulsic docuseries on Paramount+, the final episodes of which were released this week. The new episodes cover the national team from the 2024 Copa América, in which the US underperformed by exiting at the group stage, up through the 2025 Nations League final, where the US lost against Panama and Canada en route to a disappointing fourth-place finish in a competition they had won in each of the previous three editions. Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he announced that he would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team's last competitive tournament before next year's World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a second-straight 50-game season with Milan.

Pulisic's decision elicited strong critiques from ex-US players like Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad, Herculez Gomez and others.

“In my opinion (they) disrespected me in a lot of ways, and completely forgot about what I've done for this national team for 10 years,” Pulisic said in the widely promoted docuseries covering nearly every aspect of his still-ongoing career, including extensive time spent on his breakthrough with the US national team.

The series also includes many segments focused on Pulisic's personal life, and the role his family plays within his inner circle. His father, Mark, was a former professional soccer player, and he spoke up forcefully for his son.

“These [pundits] want clicks, social media, ‘subscribe to my channels,' ‘listen to my podcasts' or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,” he said. “It's jealousy. People want to be in his shoes, and they'll find any reason to bring him down. But Christian doesn't give a shit what anyone says.”

Christian also repeated a retort he used earlier this year, in an appearance on CBS Sports' Call it What You Want podcast, which had been heavily critical of his decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup

“I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all pundits say ‘they didn't want it,' ‘they didn't have the heart,' ‘back in our day we would fight and we would die on the field,' he said, insisting again that national team results affect him deeply.

The most scathing retort, though, came from winger Tim Weah.

“I think those guys are chasing checks, and for me I just feel like they're really evil,” he said. “They've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Those are the same guys that'll turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to. But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either … Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak negative on us.”

Pulisic finished last season as one of Milan's best players in a season when the team won the Supercoppa Italia but lost in the Coppa Italia final, lost in the knockout round of the Uefa Champions League, and finished eighth in the Serie A table. The team will not play in European competition this year, with Pulisic missing time in preseason due to an ankle injury.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Christian Pulisic, his father Mark and his U.S. teammate Tim Weah re-ignited the public spat between current and former U.S. men's national team players in an episode of the “Pulisic” docuseries released on Paramount+ Wednesday.

Pulisic, in an interview filmed earlier this summer, called criticism of the team's effort and heart “the biggest cop-out of all time.”

Weah, speaking about former players-turned-pundits, said: “I think those guys are chasing checks. And for me, I just feel like they're really evil. Honestly. Because they've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Those are the same guys that'll turn around and shake your hand, and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day.”

Mark Pulisic, Christian's dad, agreed: “These guys want clicks. It's social media, it's ‘subscribe to my channel, listen to my podcasts,' or whatever.'”

The comments rekindle a war of words between generations that picked up steam following the USMNT's losses to Panama and Canada in March. Landon Donovan (now a podcaster and Fox Sports pundit) and Clint Dempsey (now a CBS Sports and Men In Blazers pundit), the top two goalscorers in program history, were among the vocal critics.

“I'm so sick of hearing how ‘talented' this group of players is and all of the amazing clubs they play for,” Donovan wrote on X at the time. “If you aren't going to show up and actually give a s!%* about playing for your national team, decline the invite. Talent is great, pride is better.”

Weah, in an interview for the docuseries, said of the former players: “Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were the players that I looked up to. But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either.”

Weah added: “Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys who speak negative on us.”

Mark Pulisic, who previously inflamed the friction with an Instagram post implicitly responding to criticism from Donovan, said of former players: “I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking s***.

“It's jealousy. People want to be in his shoes, and they'll find any reason to bring him down. But Christian doesn't give a s*** about what anyone says.”

The criticism of Pulisic crescendoed when he opted to skip this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Donovan, in the studio for a Fox Sports broadcast of Portugal's UEFA Nations League win over Spain, said during Portugal's emotional celebrations: “I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

Pulisic, in an interview the following week with CBS Sports' “Call It What You Want” podcast, defended his decision and addressed the criticism.

“You can talk about my performances, whatever you want, but to question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line,” he said then.

Pulisic reiterated that sentiment in the docuseries: “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when especially all pundits want to say, ‘They didn't want it, they didn't have the heart. Back in our day we would fight and die on that field.'

“It's frustrating. We haven't had as much success as we would like. I think we have had some really incredible moments. But we're out here fighting. And I think if people knew what it actually meant to me and what it meant to our team and all the players, they would never question us.

“Come after whatever you want. Come after my performance, whatever you want to say, but to talk about my commitment, the commitment that I've given to this game, that I've given to my national team for 10 years – that's the only thing that starts to get on my nerves.”

With several former USMNT stars now prominent in American soccer media, the clash between them and active players could be an ongoing source of noise between now and the 2026 World Cup. Tyler Adams, speaking recently to The Athletic, called the disconnect between current and former players “the strangest thing.”

“I can't even explain it,” Adams said. “I'm not a social-media guy, so I don't follow anything, but when people bring up some of the things that are being said and some of the stories that are being created, it feels weird, because it feels like not long ago that every single one of those people were on board with, like, the direction that the federation was going and how well the players were doing. And it feels like any setback is (treated) like a disaster is happening. Do you know what I mean?

“And that happens in football. I get it. Some people have jobs where their job is to speak about the sport, and if that's their opinion, that's their opinion. My goal is to try to create an environment, especially within our team, where guys feel like they can go out, be themselves, be comfortable. We're all on the same page and want to grow the sport in America. People's opinions are people's opinions at the end of the day.”

His comments triggered former defender and Fox Sports pundit Alexi Lalas. Lalas, speaking on his podcast this week, said of Adams: “I thought that this was a strangely immature, and naive, and weak kind of take. Not that he's defending Christian Pulisic, because we're all going to do that, but the way he seemed to think that there should be no criticism and we should all be kumbaya.”

The debate had quieted since the Gold Cup. But with European seasons commencing — Pulisic, who missed recent friendlies as a precaution, is preparing for AC Milan's first competitive match this weekend — and the USMNT set to reconvene early next month, it could heat up once again. Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan will be released in two weeks.

by Martina Alcheva August 13, 2025

The U.S. Men's National Team should be basking in anticipation for the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Instead, the conversation has been hijacked by a growing rift between the current generation of players and some of the nation's most celebrated former stars. Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah have now responded directly to the criticism from figures like Landon Donovan — doing so with a pointed, eight-word reality check that's impossible to ignore. What began as post-match analysis and punditry has escalated into a public back-and-forth across interviews, podcasts, and even Instagram posts. The spark? Pulisic's absence from the 2025 Gold Cup.

Following a demanding season at Milan — 57 matches in all competitions — Christian Pulisic requested to sit out the Gold Cup. The decision, mutually agreed upon with U.S. Soccer and the coaching staff, was made to allow him to recover physically and mentally in preparation for next year's World Cup.

However, the choice didn't sit well with Landon Donovan. While on broadcast duty, Donovan stopped short of naming Pulisic but clearly aimed his remarks at him and other absent stars. Comparing them to Cristiano Ronaldo, the 43-year-old remarked that great players still “grind” and “represent their country” despite fatigue, adding: “It's pissing me off.”

The 26-year-old Rossoneri star later revealed that he had even requested to participate in two pre-Gold Cup friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, but the request was declined for the sake of roster continuity.

Pulisic himself later addressed the controversy during a CBS Sports podcast appearance. He called suggestions that he lacked commitment to the national team “way out of line,” stressing that the decision was made with the World Cup in mind. “It was about what was best for me and the team in the long run,” he said.

Inside the USMNT setup, teammates rallied behind Pulisic. Tyler Adams stated plainly that Pulisic didn't need to prove anything. Weston McKennie emphasized that player well-being comes first: avoiding unnecessary risk now means greater contributions later. Clint Dempsey, another national team legend, noted from experience the punishing toll of European soccer and long-haul travel, backing the decision to rest.

Recent episodes of PULSIC see Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah discussing the criticism they received from some USMNT luminaries, suggesting that their feud is far from finished. A brief excerpt posted by CBS Sports Golazo on X (previously Twitter) has him stating: “I would say the most annoying thing and for me the biggest cop-out of all time is when, especially, you know all pundits want to say, ‘You know, they didn't want it. They lacked the will to do it',” followed by a clip of Landon Donovan bashing the current generation.

However, the sharpest rebuttal to the older US generation's criticism came not from the 26-year-old winger, but from Tim Weah. Responding to the familiar accusations that the current national team lacks “heart,” Weah called out the hypocrisy of certain legends-turned-pundits. “I think those guys are chasing checks,” Marseille's latest arrival said, adding that such negativity from former heroes felt “really evil” considering they knew the pressures of being in the spotlight.

Then came the eight-word reality check aimed squarely at the critics: “The guys before us didn't win anything either.” It was a blunt reminder that while the current squad is under intense scrutiny and higher expectations, past generations also fell short of major tournament glory.

U.S. men's national team winger Kevin Paredes is set for another lengthy spell on the sidelines after reaggravating the same foot injury that kept him out most of the 2024–25 season.

Paredes seemed poised to break into the USMNT's squad following a string of impressive performances at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Then, he suffered a foot problem that limited him to just two appearances for Wolfsburg last campaign. 

The 22-year-old was eager for a fresh start this summer, but another setback forced him to have surgery on the same issue. Wolfsburg confirmed the American will be out for the “foreseeable future” after the operation.

Paredes took to social media to express his frustration at the recurring injury.

“It's hard to go through this again,” he wrote in a statement on Instagram. “Unfortunately, I had to undergo another operation on the same foot that put me out of action last season.” 

Paredes featured twice in April for Wolfsburg after missing eight months of action. He then  participated in two preseason friendlies ahead of the 2025–26 season, logging a total of 73 minutes this summer before once again experiencing pain in his foot.

The Athletic report Paredes is aiming for a November return. The forward is optimistic he will be fully fit and recovered with enough time to play for both club and country ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“I remain focused on my recovery and am determined to come back stronger,” Paredes wrote. “I'll be back soon, ready to give everything for my team!”

Still, Paredes will miss months worth of action for Wolfsburg and at least four USMNT fixtures. The Stars and Stripes are set to play international friendlies against South Korea and Japan in September, then take on Ecuador and Australia in October.

The winger will miss valuable time to impress new manager Mauricio Pochettino. Paredes only has three senior international caps to his name, and those came in 2023. 

The American needs more experience playing for the Stars and Stripes if he wants to make the USMNT's World Cup roster on home turf, making his latest setback all the more costly.

It's been a rocky year for the U.S. Men's National Team, with back-to-back losses at the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and controversial team omissions prior to a moderately successful Gold Cup run, creating a rift between the past and present generations.

None have been more critical of the current stars than some of the USMNT's most high-profile former stars, including Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey, and Alexi Lalas. This was never more evident than when it came to recapping Mauricio Pochettino's side's dismal Nations League title defense, which saw them lose to Panama and Canada.

Now, USMNT stars Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah have fired back in no uncertain terms, via the former's Paramount+ docuseries, Pulisic. “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when, especially, all pundits want to say, ‘They didn't want it. They didn't have the heart. Back in our day, we would fight and we would die on that field,'” AC Milan star Pulisic said.

This was played prior to a clip from Donovan and Howard's Unfiltered Soccer podcast, during which the longtime LA Galaxy star commented, “When we were on the field, there were guys on the field all over the field, who if they didn't perform well, their club team probably lost. But there's not a lot of guys who fall into that [now].”

As for Weah, who recently completed a move from Juventus to Olympique Marseille, he was unreserved in his criticism of such commentators.

“I think those guys are chasing checks and for me I just feel like they're really evil honestly because they've been players and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed and those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day,” he said.

The 25-year-old went on to note that while he respected the former players in question, adding many having been “players that I looked up to,” this didn't alter his stance. “Quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either,” Weah commented.

Arguably, no other USMNT player has faced as much criticism in recent months as Pulisic, not only for his performances at the Nations League, but especially for his decision to opt out of a summer call-up, citing a desire to rest after another busy season in Italy.

This proved exceedingly divisive among former players who questioned his commitment, with Donovan among his most vocal critics. Donovan's stance led to Pulisic's dad, Mark, coming to his son's defense as he called out the 43-year-old for what he believes to be a hypocritical position on the matter.

Subsequently, with back-to-back pre-Gold Cup losses to Turkey and Switzerland fresh in the mind, Pulisic took to CBS Sports' Call It What You Want podcast to set the record straight.

“To question of all things, you can talk about my performances, whatever you want,” he said. “But to question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line.

“But you know how it is. People forget really quickly. And I'm sure once I'm back with the national team, I hope once I'm back with the national team, I can play again and score a goal and win a game. People will forget all about this quickly.”

Pulisic's decision to take a step back may have infuriated some, but as far as USMNT teammate and AFC Bournemouth star Tyler Adams is concerned, it could pay off down the line.

“It's a topic that everyone wants to have an opinion on, of course, but what Christian did is what he had to do for himself,” he told The Athletic. “He doesn't have to earn the respect of anyone in the group. Everyone knows who Christian is as a person, and how good of a player he is as well. But everyone needs time in certain moments of their career or life to just say: ‘Let me take a step back, focus on myself for a second and then move forward.'”

In April, soccer's FIFA unveiled its official host city posters for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, set to take place in Mexico, the United States and Canada. The posters for the three Mexican host cities — Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey — were created by Mexican designer Mario Cortés, 30, also known by his artistic name, Cuemanche.

Now available for sale, the posters have been well received by both football fans and international media. The New York Times, which recently ranked all host city posters based on how well they captured the essence of each city, ranked the Mexican designs in its highest tier. 

Las 3 sedes mexicanas nos unimos en esta iniciativa para representar que somos todo un país listo para recibir a la Copa Mundial de la FIFA 26™️

A look at the posters for all three host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterey.

“I feel so proud knowing my posters had that kind of reception in an international media outlet,” Cortés said. “One day you're chilling, and suddenly it hits you: ‘Oh, wow, I'm in the New York Times!'”

Unlike FIFA's decision in the U.S. and Canada, where different artists were commissioned for each city, the Mexican host city posters were all Cortés designs, giving the posters a cohesive visual identity that reflects the country's cultural wealth and its passion for football. 

Yet, being from Mexico City and naturally biased toward his hometown, one of Cortés's biggest challenges was illustrating each city equally.

“I didn't want to make one city stand out more than the other, because all three cities are equally important,” he said. “It was essential to address them with the same level of respect and depth, as they all have so much to offer.”

Cortés had previously visited Monterrey while collaborating with FIFA in the Juego de Leyendas project — a soccer event that brought together former international and Mexican soccer players in a friendly match in Monterrey last year, as part of the preparations for the 2026 World Cup — but had never been to Guadalajara. Not having physically visited one of the host cities made the challenge even more complex.

“So I said to myself, ‘Well, I'm going to approach the city I know and that represents me the most, which is Mexico City, and build a structure that would allow me to address the same narrative elements in each of the other cities.” 

And it worked. 

All three posters tell a unified narrative story, using similar elements and graphics without being repetitive and without highlighting one city more than the other. 

With a colorful design that represents the festive essence of Mexico, the color palettes Cortés chose reinforces the visual personality of each host city: Guadalajara with festive pink and yellow. Monterrey with industrial metallic blues. Mexico City with a warm, multicolored mix.

“As Mexicans, we have a vast visual richness,” he said. “One element that I wanted to highlight, and that gradually took shape in the design of the posters, was that we are a very, very colorful country. I mean, just walking into a market, you find colors everywhere — piñatas, colorful fruits, vegetables. All that explosion of color was an element I was very interested in capturing, and that also gives personality to a poster,” he said.

Cortés also incorporated cultural landmarks.

“Some might ask, ‘What does a mariachi have to do with football? Or a carne asada?' Well, these elements precisely accompany and give personality to the passion of inhabiting a city and being a fan of their local team,” he said. 

For Cortés, these posters are a “welcome letter to the world” and a way to show Mexico's diverse and rich culture, which he says deeply inspired his creative process.  

“We're not a simple culture,” he said. “Our culture has an immense complexity that I also wanted to capture.” 

Among the many artistic influences that shaped Cortés' work were iconic Mexican artists like Juan O'Gorman and Jorge González Camarena, both part of Mexico's muralism period. Art Deco was another major influence.

“I would find myself walking in Mexico City's Juárez [neighborhood], for example, and I would look at the house structures and think, ‘Well, the poster is here, isn't it?',” he recalled.

 

“I would look at the Art Deco friezes and see how they would integrate a human figure, flowers or fruits in a very small square,” he said. “And I would look at that and think, ‘Yes, the poster is here. I just need to think about how to portray it.'”

Mexico's 1968 Olympics logo, which has had a lasting impact on graphic design and is probably one of the most iconic Olympic Games logos ever, also influenced Cortés' work. Designed by Mexican architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez and designer Lance Wyman, Cortés said it's impossible to escape the influence of such a logo. 

“It is basically embedded in the DNA of any Mexican designer,” Cortés jokes.

Cortés' design process took around three months. For him, designing official World Cup posters is the opportunity of a lifetime. 

“Designing the posters for a World Cup, well, it's a gigantic, enormous thing. Something that will probably never be repeated in my life,” he said. “But I'm seeking new challenges that I want to approach with professionalism, with a lot of creativity and with a lot of intention. And I'm very open to whatever comes next.”

MASON, OH − Rain and lightning postponed play at the Cincinnati Open Aug. 12, but it's been clear conditions wreaking the most havoc over the last 10 days at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

Over the last few days, the heat has impacted several ATP and WTA stars, with a few forced to withdraw from the Cincinnati Open.

No. 31 seed Magda Linette thanked fans for braving the heat Aug. 13 after defeating 2024 Cincinnati Open runner-up Jessica Pegula on Center Court in three sets.

Fans hoping for another deep Cincinnati run by American Frances Tiafoe were denied Aug. 13 when the Maryland native retired during the second set of his fourth-round match on Center Court against No. 7 seed Holger Rune.

Tiafoe seemed uncomfortable with the heat, frequently sporting a wet towel across his neck and face before retiring officially with a lower back injury that tightened up at the end of the first set.

Felix Auger-Aliassime advanced to the Round of 16 via a walkover Aug. 11 when his opponent, Arthur Rinderknech of France, fell to the court due to the intense heat and eventually retired.

One day later on Center Court, Francisco Comesana was preparing to serve against Reilly Opelka before taking a timeout near his courtside bench. The 24-year-old received medical attention as he battled the heat. Comesana eventually returned to the match and beat Opelka in three sets.

ATP No. 16 seed Jakub Mensik retired after just 43 minutes of his Round of 32 match against Luca Nardi Aug. 12. Mensik retired due to illness. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired from his first-round match in the sweltering heat Aug. 9, though he later cited a need to preserve his energy ahead of the U.S. Open.

""It's always hot here,"" said former Cincinnati Open champion Coco Gauff, who needed just 70 minutes to win her Center Court match Aug. 10 against Xinyu Wang.

It was Gauff's former coach, Brad Gilbert, who won the Cincinnati Open in 1989, who spoke out on social media about the need for a heat rule on the ATP Tour.

According to the WTA official rule book for 2025, there is a 10-minute heat-rule break between the second and third set.

The rule goes into effect when the Heat Stress Index meets a certain temperature relative to the humidity.

The ATP has no such rule for beating the heat.

Daniil Medvedev plunged his head into a Gatorade cooler during the third set of his second-round match. Two years ago, Medvedev bluntly stated ""one player is going to die"" into an on-court camera during a steamy U.S. Open match.

According to the Weather Channel, the temperature Aug. 13 in Mason is 85 degrees and it feels like 93 with 66% humidity.

According to the National Weather Service, the weekend temperatures reach into the mid-90s.

And that's not calculating how much hotter it is for players on the court.

The Lindner Family Tennis Center features hard courts, which are considered the hottest of any playing surface as the concrete retains the most heat. Studies show that the on-court temperature can be anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees hotter than off the court.

“Battling the heat, the hot, I think is one of the things that we have to do. Yeah, it's really tough to play with that conditions, to be honest,"" ATP star Carlos Alcaraz said in London. ""But we are tennis players. I always say, we have to get used to these conditions as soon as possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.cincinnati.com', 'title': 'Cincinnati Enquirer'}","tennis"

""Do you want me to send the child out of the stadium?,"" the umpire replied, to which Raducanu raised her tennis racket and smiled

 British tennis player Emma Raducanu stopped a match because of a crying child during the Cincinnati open.


 The incident occurred during the third round on Day 5 of the Cincinnati Open at Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio, on Monday, Aug. 11. Footage from a broadcast of the moment shows Raducanu, 22, facing off against Belarusian tennis player Aryna Sabalenka, when a baby lets out a cry in the stadium.


 Before delivering a serve, Raducanu paused the game to vent to the umpire that the baby had been crying for ""10 minutes.""


 The umpire replied, ""Do you want me to send the child out of the stadium?""


 The crowd responded with an emphatic yes, to which the 2021 U.S. Open Champ raised her tennis racket and smiled.


 The umpire offered to ""call in"" for the child's removal, but proceeded with the match.


 The crying child comes amid extremely high temperatures in Ohio during the Cincinnati Open. French tennis player Arthur Rinderknech collapsed on Monday due to high temperatures on the courts, regularly exceeding 86º Fahrenheit, per BBC.

 It is unclear whether the child was removed from the stadium. PEOPLE has reached out to the Cincinnati Open to confirm.


 The match ended with an eventual 7-6 (6), 4-6, 7-6 (7) loss for Raducanu, with the title and third-round prize money of $60,400 going to Sabalenka. Sabalenka, 27 will next face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the Round of 16 on Wednesday, Aug. 13.

 This isn't the first time a crying baby at a tennis match has sparked online discussion. Back in 2011, during the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, tennis player David Ferrer fired off a forehand ball in the direction of a crying child in the stands. He lost the match to Mardy Fish, 7-5, 6-2.

World No.97 Tristan Schoolkate and 107th-ranked Talia Gibson have received main-draw wildcards into the 2025 US Open, recognising their breakout seasons and rising international profiles.

New York, USA, 13 August 2025 | Tennis Australia

Emerging Australian talents Tristan Schoolkate and Talia Gibson have been awarded main-draw wildcards into the 2025 US Open, recognising their breakout seasons and rising international profiles.

For 24-year-old Schoolkate, the wildcard marks a significant milestone in a year of career-best performances.

The West Australian broke into the ATP top 100 for the first time last week following a string of strong results, including a standout victory over world No. 47 Joao Fonseca at the Toronto Masters – his first win over a top-50 opponent.

Ranked 173rd when he competed at Australian Open 2025, Schoolkate's impressive rise into the top 100 in just over six months came slightly too late to directly qualify in New York. He was world No.110 at the 14 July entry deadline, less than 10 spots outside the main-draw ranking cut-off.

Now ranked No.97, Schoolkate has also reached three Challenger finals this season — claiming titles in Brisbane and Ilkley, UK — to showcase his consistency and growth on the professional circuit.

“Thank you Tennis Australia for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to play the US Open main draw,” said Schoolkate. “It's such an amazing experience to play in the main draws of the Grand Slams – it's what we as players work towards, week in, week out. I'm excited and ready for the challenge in New York.”

Gibson, 21, has also enjoyed a breakthrough year, peaking at world No.107 last month.

The Perth native recently captured her 10th ITF singles title at the W75 event in Granby, Canada, winning 10 consecutive sets after dropping the opener in her first-round match.

Her Northern Hemisphere summer campaign has included quarterfinal appearances at WTA 125 events in Ilkley, UK and Newport, US, either side of a maiden Wimbledon main-draw appearance — which she achieved by winning three matches in qualifying, saving match point in the final round.

Earlier this year, Gibson secured her first Grand Slam main-draw win at the Australian Open, coming from a set down in a memorable debut at Melbourne Park.

Gibson also expressed her gratitude to Tennis Australia for the opportunity to make her US Open main-draw debut.

“This is an incredibly rewarding acknowledgment for all the hard work my team and I have been putting in and for the results I've had this year. I can't wait to get out there and give it my very best and make everyone proud,” Gibson said.

Schoolkate and Gibson will join 12 other Australians — eight men and four women — in the US Open main draw, where the action kicks off Sunday 24 August.

A further seven men and 10 women will represent Australia in qualifying, commencing Monday 18 August.","{'href': 'https://www.tennis.com.au', 'title': 'Tennis Australia'}","tennis"

 Karen Khachanov's big hitting has brought him to the brink of a Top 10 return this North American summer. 

 After reaching his second ATP Masters 1000 championship match in Toronto, the 29-year-old is now into the quarter-finals at the Cincinnati Open. where he will take on Alexander Zverev on Wednesday. Should Khachanov triumph, he will take another major step towards returning to the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since June 2023, something he told ATPTour.com has been one of his biggest goals. 

 A seven-time tour-level titlist, Khachanov also broke down his favourite tennis rivalry in history and revealed how he pushed through adversity early in his career. 



 What is your favourite ATP Tour tournament to play and why? 
I would say Monte-Carlo is one of my favourites. The site, the hotel, the event, clay courts in spring. The only thing is sometimes we miss good weather there. Then Paris-Bercy, of course. [Winning the title] there was one of the greatest memories in my career. The centre court in the old arena was one of the nicest. The atmosphere was one of the best indoors. 

 What is your favourite tennis rivalry? 
Definitely Rafa [Nadal] and Roger [Federer]. Everything started from them. Then Novak [Djokovic] stepped inside this duo and started to have crazy rivalries with both of them, but I think everything started from [Roger and Rafa]. I remember those matches in Rome and Madrid on clay, at Wimbledon and Roland Garros. Some really epic matches. 

 Who's your greatest rival? 
With Novak I've played quite a few matches and managed to beat him one time in this match in Paris when he was No. 1. I would also say [Daniil] Medvedev. We played this year a couple of times already and had good matches in the past. Always exciting, tough matches.

 What is the biggest thing you've been chasing? 
My biggest goal is to try and be back in the Top 10, where I was able to break through two years ago before getting injured. Just right at the moment I got injured, and that affected me after I couldn't go out and compete for three and a half months. But that is not an excuse, it's a reality, and I think I'm motivated, I'm pumped to achieve my goals. I keep chasing. 

 With regards to events, definitely it is a dream to win a Grand Slam. I still want to win a Masters 1000 one more time. But at the end of the day, if you put it in perspective, if you are in the Top 10 or even higher, you have definitely had good results in the bigger tournaments, so that is all connected. 

 It All Adds Up: Every moment means everything: 





 What is the greatest difficult or adversity you have overcome? 
I would say having a little bit of success early. When I was 22, I won a Masters 1000, one of the biggest titles, against Novak, and I felt like, ‘Whoa, I'm there'. Even though I'm mentally strong in a way, I felt like the following year at the beginning of the year was not what I was hoping or thinking it would be. That pushed me away a little bit and showed me that I needed to settle, to keep working towards my goals and that not everything would just come from the sky. 
 This moment was one of the toughest: to understand, to grow up, to be more mature and understand myself and tennis more. Even after that, it took me a few more years to get really good results in Grand Slams and at the Olympics. 
 What is the coolest thing you've been able to do off the court purely because you're a tennis player? 
I would say just travelling. The Tour forces us to travel, which I'm not complaining about. Tournaments in different cities and countries around the world. I would not travel as much if I wasn't doing what I am doing now.

 Frances Tiafoe suffered a setback to his U.S. hard-court summer on Wednesday at the Cincinnati Open. The home favourite was forced to retire from his fourth-round match at the ATP Masters 1000 event against Holger Rune due to a lower back injury. 

 The 10th-seeded Tiafoe at one point led 3-0 in his third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Rune, but after relinquishing that lead he received treatment on his lower back at 4-5. With Tiafoe unable to serve at full pace, Rune had moved into a 6-4, 3-1 lead when the American retired. 

Get well soon Frances 🙏@holgerrune2003 is through to the quarter-finals as Tiafoe retires due to injury.Final score: 6-4 3-1 RET.@CincyTennis | #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/cKVtZEXBSa

 Tiafoe, who reached his maiden Masters 1000 championship match in Cincinnati a year ago, will hope to recover quickly before heading to New York for his home Grand Slam at the US Open. The 27-year-old is a two-time semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows, including last year when he fell to his countryman Taylor Fritz. 

 The No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rune stepped on court Wednesday hoping to avenge his 2024 semi-final defeat to Tiafoe. The Dane will take on fourth seed Fritz or French qualifier Terence Atmane in the quarter-finals this year. 

 “From 4-4, when I got the break and at 5-4 when he had the medical timeout, that's when I felt something was not right with him and after obviously, I could see he was struggling a little bit,” said Rune. “As the game is, I tried to move him as much as possible. It's never nice to finish a match like this and I wish him the best recovery.”

The league isn't content to be a ratings juggernaut for partners. As it takes equity in ESPN and Paramount Skydance, it's muscling into Hollywood's end zone.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	This month may go down as a landscape-altering month for the National Football League. On Aug. 5, the NFL and Disney announced a major deal, trading the NFL Network, rights to RedZone and other media assets to ESPN in exchange for a 10 percent equity stake in the sports media juggernaut.


	A few days later, David Ellison's Skydance closed its $8 billion deal for Paramount Global, taking control of one of the league's biggest TV partners … and instantly giving the league an equity stake as well, owing to Skydance Sports joint venture between the league and Skydance.

	It is a shift that is simultaneously subtle (of course they are launching new streaming services) but also earth-shatteringly disruptive.


	The NFL is, by an order of magnitude, the most popular programming on TV. By the end of this month, for the first time ever, every single NFL game will be available to consumers streaming online, no pay-TV subscription required. The last holdouts of the pay-TV bundle will have been freed, and the cost to cutting the cord will go down significantly.


	But the NFL is also, by an order of magnitude, the most strategic sports league in the world when it comes to getting what it wants, leveraging every ounce of its popularity to do so, as the recent equity stakes help underscore.

	











	While the NFL has been laser-focused on reach and accessibility since its early days (consider that even today, every game, including those on Netflix and Amazon, are still available on broadcast TV, in the local markets of the teams playing), but as the TV landscape has shifted, the NFL's approach has adjusted accordingly. That's why Amazon has the Thursday night package, why Netflix has exclusive Christmas Day games, and why this season will see YouTube get a global exclusive from Brazil.


	It's a recognition that TV has been great for the NFL, but it is not enough.


	It's a topic of conversation that surely came up at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley mogul retreat last month, where NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell mingled with the league's media partners. Sitting down with CNBC on the sidelines o the retreat, with a mountain vista to his back, Goodell explained the NFL's vision: “Our whole foundation, the core of our media policies, is to reach the broadest audience. So how do we do that? We have to extend beyond our current platforms.”


	“What we're trying to do now is reach the fans where they are,” Goodell added. “I think you see a lot of these new platforms [have] different demographics that are really important for us to be able to reach, and it's part of our growth strategy.”


	Cognizant of cord-cutting and the increasing number of cord-nevers, the NFL wants to make sure its games are available to people who don't want to drop $100 per month or more for pay-TV.

	











	That's not to say that NFL fans will save all that much money. ESPN and Fox One alone will cost $39.99 a month in a bundle, and when Prime Video, Netflix, Peacock and Paramount+ are added to the equation, well, the cost savings will quickly evaporate.


	But it isn't about value, it's about strategy, as the ESPN deal underscores. The league gets equity (and a dividend) from ESPN, and ESPN gets not only additional games, RedZone and other content, but perhaps less easily valued benefits.


	“At a high level, we're bullish on the partnership, as it aligns ESPN with the most important sports league, with attendant benefits we think to future renewals, programming rights, and scheduling,” wrote JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky on Aug. 6.


	The NFL, meanwhile, also gets something else out of the deal: Four games in its back pocket. While Disney as a whole will get three additional NFL games per season, the NFL can take back four of them, potentially creating an entirely new package (maybe paired with the kickoff game that will be on YouTube this season), that could be sold to a streaming platform, either an exiting partner like Netflix or YouTube, or perhaps a new player (Apple TV+ needs more scale!).


	“This finally solves an even longer process of securing a home for its NFL media assets,” a team of MoffettNathanson analysts noted in an Aug. 6 research note. “But we think importantly for a league that plans for the long-term (in decades, not just years), strengthening an existing partner against digital bidders is something of significant value to the league, ensuring there should be continued healthy competition for future NFL rights.”

	











	And the future portends even more dealmaking. The NBA's blockbuster 11-year, $76 billion media rights deals with NBCUniversal, Amazon and Disney if anything showed how much more value the NFL has to offer, and there are signs the league may take action sooner rather than later.


	The NFL's own 11-year deals with NBCU, Disney, Amazon, Fox and Paramount end in 2032, but the league has an option to exit those deals in 2029. Already there has been chatter that the league could push for new talks even before then, perhaps offering to extend the current deals years into the future in exchange for locking in higher fees.


	And Skydance's takeover of Paramount also started a ticking clock: The league now has a window to force a renegotiation for the CBS NFL rights, an option that the league will need to decide to act on, and one that will provide visibility into the league's TV future.


	“We've had a long relationship with CBS for decades,” Goodell told CNBC when pressed on the option, adding that they have two years to decide. “But, you know, we have the option, and that's something that we'll take a look at.”


	Speaking to reporters on Aug. 7 in Paramount's New York City headquarters Ellison and his executive team projected confidence that they would remain in business with the NFL, whatever happens to the TV world writ large. Ellison added, “There is no more important partner to us than the NFL, and our viewpoint is, we want to be in business with the NFL for the foreseeable future.”

This partnership is a step in the right direction, and we look forward to continuing to work with Spotify to increase the value of songwriter royalties,"" Kobalt CEO Laurent Hubert said. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Spotify has entered into a direct licensing deal with Kobalt, the companies announced on Wednesday, the latest of several music publishing deals the streaming service has secured in 2025. 


	Spotify and Kobalt were light on details in their brief announcement, only confirming the deal is a multi-year agreement and that it would “deliver greater flexibility, efficiency, value, and protections to songwriters in the U.S.




	“As the largest independent music publisher dedicated to fighting for the rights of songwriters, this deal reaffirms our unwavering commitment to ensuring our songwriters are paid fairly for their work, and underscores the importance of progressive licensing models that reﬂect the real-world use of music across digital platforms,” Kobalt CEO Laurent Hubert said in a statement. “This partnership is a step in the right direction, and we look forward to continuing to work with Spotify to increase the value of songwriter royalties.”

	The deal with Kobalt follows Spotify's previously announced deals with Universal Music Group and its UMPG subsidiary back in January, and a subsequent deal with Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell back in February.

	The licensing deals are of note given that the music publishers and Spotify have been at odds since last year over a controversial audiobook bundling strategy from Spotify that's lead to lower songwriter royalties. The National Music Publishers Association said at its annual meeting back in June that publishers lost $230 million last year because of the bundles. Spotify said in its Loud and Clear report back in March that it's paid $4.5 billion to songwriters and publishers in the past two years. 

	











	“We've always believed that better partnerships lead to better outcomes,” Spotify's co-president and chief business officer Alex Norström said in a statement. “This agreement with Kobalt boosts our support of songwriters through a licensing model that unlocks new growth and will expand the way music is made and shared today.”

	Vampirina is taking flight from her animated Disney Jr. series to a live-action tween series premiering next month on Disney Channel.


	The first two episodes of the music-driven Vampirina: Teenage Vampire arrive Sept. 12 on Disney Channel, and all 16 episodes will hit Disney+ and Disney Channel On Demand on Oct. 15, Billboard Family can exclusively reveal. According to Disney Branded Television — which also released the first official teaser trailer and poster for the show on Tuesday (Aug. 12) — the title character “leaves the safety of Transylvania to attend a performing arts boarding school. Living amongst humans for the first time, she pursues her passion for music while keeping her vampire identity a secret, something that's made more challenging when her overprotective father charges an overzealous ghost to live with her at the school.”


	Kenzi Richardson stars as Vampirina, or “Vee,” while Jiwon Lee plays Vee's roommate Sophie; Shaun Dixon is “the intriguing and laid-back” Elijah; Milo Maharlika is 600-year-old ghost Demi; and Faith Hedley is Vee's super-talented classmate Britney. Kate Reinders and Jeff Meacham play Vee's vampire parents, while Kim Coles (Living Single) is Dean Merriweather of Wilson Hall Academy of the Arts.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Hulu has ordered Count My Lies, a limited series starring Lindsay Lohan and Shailene Woodley from former This Is Us executive producers/co-showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger.


	The project, based on the recently published novel by Sophie Stava, was set up for development at Hulu this spring with Lohan attached. She has now been joined by Woodley, with both set to executive produce in addition to starring in the series, produced by 20th Television where Aptaker, Berger and their The Walk-Up Company are under an overall deal.


	In Count My Lies, when compulsive liar Sloane Caraway (Woodley) fibs her way into a nanny position for the gorgeous and charismatic Violet (Lohan) and Jay Lockhart, it seems she's finally landed her dream job. But little does Sloane know, she's just entered a household brimming with secrets that are about to explode — with potentially catastrophic consequences for all.

	Known for her roles in The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Big Little Lies, the Divergent franchise and The Fault In Our Stars, Woodley was recently seen starring in the Starz limited series Three Women, the Amazon MGM film Killer Heat and making her Broadway debut in Leslye Headland's Cult Of Love. Upcoming, she also co-stars in Potsy Ponciroli's film Motor City, an official selection of the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals. She is repped by CAA and Range Media Partners.


	For Hulu and 20th TV, Aptaker and Berger previously developed and executive produced the HIMYM spinoff series, How I Met Your Father, and were creators and executive producers of Love, Victor. Aptaker and Berger are repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

	It looks like Jason Bourne hasn't thrown his last punch at the studio he's called home for over two decades. Following an extensive auction, NBCUniversal has acquired all rights, excluding publishing, to Robert Ludlum's revered Jason Bourne and Treadstone book series, in perpetuity, the company said Wednesday. The deal fortifies the future of the Bourne franchise across the NBCU universe, paving the way for new installments and a continued legacy for Ludlum's beloved character and the spy world he inhabits.


	“Since its debut in 2002, the iconic Bourne franchise has reshaped the spy genre with groundbreaking films that set new standards for cinematic action,” said Peter Cramer, President, Universal Pictures. “We're energized to continue expanding the Bourne universe into the future with exciting new stories for global audiences.” 

	











	Sources tell Deadline that the earlier this year, the Ludlum estate took the rights back out market after they had lapsed at the studio, with plans to hold an auction. WME ran point on the process and sources say there were seven offers in for rights, including two from streamers, one from another major studio and a few entrepreneurial ventures. After bringing the proposal back to Universal, the studio matched it with what insiders are describing as a “very large deal.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We are thrilled that the Bourne franchise will remain at Universal,” said Jeffrey Weiner, Chairman & CEO of Captivate Entertainment and the executor of Ludlum's estate. “We look forward to working with the Universal team to expand the Bourne franchise across Universal's varied platforms.”

	











	With this new agreement, longtime Universal collaborator and storied producer Frank Marshall will continue to shepherd forthcoming installments of the film series, as he has from the beginning, along with Captivate's Jeffrey Weiner and Ben Smith. Captivate has managed the rights for the Ludlum estate since 2001.


	Deadline broke the news that Ed Berger would be coming on to develop a new Bourne film with Matt Damon potentially returning to reprise his role. Insiders now say they have a script from Joe Barton, but as of now the film is not greenlit and remains in development.


	Universal has released five Bourne films in the critically acclaimed and commercially successful franchise, including four starring Damon: The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman; Paul Greengrass' The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Jason Bourne; as well as the Jeremy Renner-starring spinoff The Bourne Legacy, directed by Tony Gilroy. The films have collectively grossed more than $1.64 billion at the global box office.


	The franchise also reaches across the NBCUniversal enterprise with Bourne-themed video games and merchandise, as well as a Universal Studios Orlando theme park activation “The Bourne Stuntactular.”


	The rights deal was brokered by WME, which represents Captivate. Some of the other authors the agency reps include Tom Clancy, Dan Brown, George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson and Sarah J. Maas.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Paramount stock, newly constituted on the Nasdaq under the PSKY ticker symbol after last week's close of the Skydance merger, surged almost 37% Wednesday in a rally no one saw coming.


	The eruption came as CEO David Ellison and other executives were convening a press conference at the Paramount studio lot in L.A., a follow-up to one held last week in New York.


	Optimism about the stock appears to be based in part on the company's splashy move to acquire UFC rights in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal. While that statement transaction rallied support on Wall Street, with shares up 8% on Tuesday, the Wednesday surge has left many market watchers scratching their heads. In the first two days of trading after the long-gestating Skydance merger finally closed, shares had drifted down, reflecting investors' wariness of the company's exposure to linear TV declines, among other concerns.

	











	CNBC host Jim Cramer tweeted that Paramount resembled a “meme stock” (à la GameStop). The gains were “shocking,” he said, given the “small float.” In Wall Street parlance, the float refers to the number of shares available to the public. Ellison and backer RedBird Capital control 70% of Paramount's roughly 1 billion total shares.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Shares reached as high as $17.53 Wednesday before settling back around $15 as trading volume surged to more than five times its normal level. While there have been some rumblings about Paramount on Reddit chat groups like Wall Street Bets, there hasn't been anything like the Covid frenzy that boosted AMC Entertainment, GameStop and numerous other stocks to startling levels. 

	











	Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris, in a research note Monday, said he views the UFC deal as a “meaningful indication of the company's strategy to bolster its sports and streaming assets.” He initiated coverage of Paramount with a “buy” rating, citing what he projects to be a $300 million annual advertising opportunity in UFC rights, on top of Paramount+ subscription proceeds.


	Ellison's father, Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder and one of the world's richest people, is not a direct backer of the Paramount merger. But last week in New York, David Ellison spoke admiringly of his father, saying the two discuss the business every day, with the elder exec serving as a “mentor” to the new CEO. The presence of Larry Ellison in the background of the Paramount story certainly doesn't hurt the perception that more big swings could be coming after the UFC deal.

This is all of Larrys friends on the street that want to make his son look good.  I'm shorting right after the event!

David Ellison is better running the company than anyone else at this point tbh

When is the press conference with LA media?  I'm curious if they talk about their film and TV strategy.

I'll buy when they unload all their linear assets

I don't think that will happen atleast not right now. They already said last week that it won't.

it's 11 bucks – hardly skyrocketing

try 15 now…

you are looking at PARA old ticker, not new PSKY ticker.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Quiet, pandemic-era musings take up the majority of Olivier Assayas' Suspended Time","https://www.avclub.com/suspended-time-review","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

For those who think Ari Aster's Eddington perfectly distills the reality of early lockdown—with all of its anxiety, exasperation, and social isolation—Olivier Assayas' Suspended Time ups the ante. While Aster's cynical reflection of this particularly paranoid era is intriguing (if highly flawed), Assayas surveys this period with unvarnished accuracy, using his own experience for direct fodder. In turn, Suspended Time is a much more truthful depiction of this strange moment, rife with reflections that are at times droll, despondent, or, perhaps for some, downright dull—yet always raw.

Assayas' avatar is Paul Berger (Vincent Macaigne), who retreats to his childhood home in the verdant French countryside with his girlfriend Morgane (Nine d'Urso), a documentary filmmaker, during the early days of the pandemic. Also hunkering down is Paul's music journalist brother Etienne (Micha Lescot) and his new paramour Carole (Nora Hamzawi), whose presence is largely innocuous compared to Etienne's prickly personality. The sunny spring days are spent in general monotony: tennis is played on the estate's court, walks are taken through the unmanicured landscape, meals are eaten al fresco. Amid this collective consistency, everyone begins to develop increasingly neurotic coping mechanisms, particularly Paul and Etienne. The former becomes convinced that all items delivered to the house must be left out for four hours to ensure any traces of the virus have dissipated; Etienne, on the other hand, becomes addicted to making and eating crepes at all hours of the day. 

As these tics consume most waking moments, Paul and Etienne quarrel constantly. Though Paul is more insistent about everyone abiding by his neuroses, Etienne appears to crave conflict, as if these petty squabbles exist to inject much-needed excitement to his drab days. These moments are never truly tense, instead providing the comedic backbone of an otherwise mundane plot. This dynamic is also wholly relatable—who among us didn't pick a fight out of overwhelming anxiety (or pure boredom) while shut in with friends and family? Whether it's the use of an expensive Swedish saucepan, the ethics of ordering from Amazon, or differing opinions on proper pandemic protocol, Paul and Etienne regularly press on the same sore spots, as if allowing this metaphorical bruise to heal would mean they have one less thing to do with their infinite free time. 

Of course, the fraternal nature of their relationship means that Paul and Etienne have a lifelong rapport, but Morgane and Carole's roles in the film are cursory at best and outright neglected at worst. The women share a conversation early in the film—predictably, about their respective relationships with these brothers—but their presence rarely heightens any tangible stakes. They both state that they've never properly cohabitated with their current partners, yet it appears that there is virtually no annoyance or frustration festering between the couples themselves, an interesting detail that, perhaps, is true of Assayas' own experience during lockdown. Then again, the sprawling grounds that the quartet occupy is much more charming and accommodating than most people's; if we all spent the first three months of quarantine amid impressive personal libraries and bucolic scenery, it might've been all the easier not to get hung up on our partners' idiosyncrasies. 

Being in the house itself causes Paul to instinctively recall moments from his upbringing as well as facts about his family's history. Though both of his parents are now dead, their specters cling to the fabric of this liminal yet deeply-felt reality. Via voiceover, Paul recounts the significance of items in the home, the surrounding area, and words his parents exchanged with him years prior. These musings manifest as periodic vignettes in Suspended Time, interrupting the sparse narrative in a way that is clearly true to Assayas' experience. This creates a compelling hybridization that feels in line with the filmmaker's fascination with toying with the boundary between fact and fiction, particularly in regards to actors playing with their own personalities and personhood. 

In another self-reflexive move, the film's climax finds Paul excitedly driving to pick up his daughter Britt (Magdalena Lafont), who has been spending this precarious period with her mother and his ex-wife. Having only been able to communicate via sporadic FaceTime calls for weeks, this visit also signifies a potential restoration of normalcy in the near future. The vibe is generally friendly between Paul and Flavia (Maud Wyler), who spent 10 years together before breaking up. It doesn't take much guesswork to discern that Flavia is a stand-in for filmmaker Mia Hansen-Løve, who was in a relationship with Assayas for 15 years and with whom he has a daughter. The portrayal is perfectly amicable here, Flavia poking fun at Paul for his all-consuming fear of COVID while elegantly clutching a cigarette. 

Some may dismiss Suspended Time as an indulgent exercise in creating a time capsule of a generation-defining yet ephemeral moment, but Assayas filtering the pandemic through his own lived experience is refreshing compared to something more removed, like Eddington‘s overwrought satirical exercise. Throughout the film, Paul professes his admiration of painter David Hockney, whose work across mediums includes clever portraits of his loved ones that sought to capture their intangible likenesses. Though Assayas is best known for his incisive cultural commentary, the subdued regimes and musings in Suspended Time are just as enthralling in their own quiet way.

It may take a long time for Spotify to win back the trust of some of the biggest songwriters in the world, but it seems like the streamer is at least taking steps to win back public approval. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Spotify just signed a new direct licensing deal with Kobalt, “the largest independent music publisher dedicated to fighting for the rights of songwriters,” as its CEO Laurent Hubert characterized it in a statement. The new partners didn't provide many details on their contract, but shared that the multi-year agreement would “deliver greater flexibility, efficiency, value, and protections to songwriters in the U.S.” 

For months now, songwriters have spoken out after they claimed a change in Spotify's bundled payment strategy drastically decreased the royalties they received for their work. In April of last year, the streamer added audiobooks to its premium tier and began splitting the pot of available residuals between both music and book publishers. While Spotify claimed in March that it had paid $4.5 billion to songwriters and publishers over the past two years, the National Music Publishers Association said in June that publishers lost $230 million last year due to the controversial bundling strategy. Earlier this year, the conflict between Spotify and songwriters got so bad that several Grammy-nominated writers boycotted the company's annual award season party. 

Hubert, however, is optimistic that the new deal is “a step in the right direction.” “This deal reaffirms our unwavering commitment to ensuring our songwriters are paid fairly for their work, and underscores the importance of progressive licensing models that reﬂect the real-world use of music across digital platforms,” he continued in his statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with Spotify to increase the value of songwriter royalties.”

The Kobalt deal is one of several Spotify has made recently. The streamer also partnered with Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Warner Chappell earlier this year, per THR. “We've always believed that better partnerships lead to better outcomes,” Spotify co-president and chief business officer Alex Norström said in his own statement. “This agreement with Kobalt boosts our support of songwriters through a licensing model that unlocks new growth and will expand the way music is made and shared today.” 

Of course, royalties aren't the only reason musicians are displeased with Spotify. Over the past few months, several bands have pulled their music off the platform in protest of CEO Daniel Ek's $700 million investment in Helsing, a German company that creates military drones and AI-driven defense software. “We don't want our music killing people,” indie rockers Deerhoof wrote in a statement announcing their departure in June. Other groups including King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Xiu Xiu have followed suit. While Spotify's new deal with Kobalt may help one group of frustrated artists, the company will have to do a lot more to win these self-exiled bands back.

It's hard to believe that Jenz Sidwell has only been on the “General Hospital” scene for less than a year. The character first appeared as Lucky Spencer's captor in Somalia in September 2024 for a handful of scenes, and within a matter of weeks, he was spotted again in Port Charles. Before viewers knew it, the “importer” made his intentions to stick around known by pulling a power move; he bought Wyndemere.

The character's instant popularity, on a series filled with well-loved legacy characters, speaks to the talent of the man whose hands he has been left in, Carlo Rota. You may already know him from “24,” “Breaking Bad,” “Scandal,” and a string of other primetime hits, but you've never seen him like this.

Carlo Rota recently sat for an exclusive interview with EntertainmentNow, and he was filled with both gratitude and excitement as he dished on breathing life into Jenz Sidwell.

The actor may be brand-new to the daytime television genre, but he has quickly been turned on to the love and loyalty that comes from the generations of fans who plug in five days a week.

“Many people, when I speak to them about General Hospital, they'll always enthusiastically admit that they watch the show with a parent or a grandparent. I don't know whether or not this is a well-known fact about General Hospital (laughing), but plainly, it has brought families together. It crosses generations. The whole genre is extraordinarily comforting,” Rota says with candor.

“You are watching something that has a pedigree that spans, oh, it's now 63 years, and that's incredible. It's also incredible as a new actor on the show to be with people who have been doing it for decades. Decades,” says the actor. “I mean, it's a whole new thing for me. I've been a series regular before. I've been involved in different series where, you know, I knew that I had work the next month. But I've never been involved in a show that's been on for this long. And I've also never worked with people who've been playing the same character for 25, 30, in some cases, 40 years. That's incredible.”

Spending decades at the exact same job may not appeal to most people. Carlo explained that even in those instances, the energy is still alive and well. “What's even more incredible is that there is still a spark of excitement in all of these people. They've managed to keep that furnace burning. And to me, that really deserves applause.”

Carlo's dance with GH actually began the year before Jenz Sidwell was introduced onto the canvas.

“I originally auditioned for Frank Valentini and his talented producers, and I had never auditioned for a soap opera before that. It was also a very odd time, because it was my only in-person audition that I'd had in, oh God, two years. All auditions are pretty much self-tapes, and so when I got called to this in-person audition at General Hospital's building, I was thrilled to be in front of people (laughing). I realized how much I missed auditioning for people, the energy that you have, and the slight peril that you feel about the whole process. It's not only how you walk into the room, it's how you leave the room. And what you leave them with,” explains Rota.

Carlo didn't get that role, but a year later, his manager got a call from GH, offering him the role of Jenz Sidwell.

“The first few episodes I did were supposedly being shot in Somalia. That was my introduction to daytime. I mean, I had no idea what I was doing, had no idea what the process was. I had no idea of the speed, had no idea of anything really. I've done multiple camera work before, but this is an entirely different thing, mainly because everything is so fast.”

Rota continued, “I was lucky enough to work with Lucky (Jonathan Jackson) and Emma Samms. Jonathan particularly gave me a real rundown on what the process is, what I could expect, and that really helped. Those first few days were like a blur. I had no idea of what I'd done; all I knew is that it was just terribly exciting. Then, lo and behold, I get informed that I am going to Port Charles to commit some kind of mischief.”

These days, it feels like Sidwell has always been in Port Charles, and he is certainly committing more than mischief. Rota is just as excited as the audience is to see what will happen next.

“Every time I get scripts, it's like Christmas because I find out something new about Jenz. Like the fact that Jenz buys Wyndemere, with its fantastic pedigree, on the show. Or the fact that I have an ex-wife, the fact that I have a son. I seem to be going downhill with the number of dastardly things that I've done (laughing). I started off being shifty, and now I'm starting to become Satanic.”

“It's very much like theater. It's the most theatrical thing I've ever done on television. Also, if you treat it like theater, there's another element of excitement to it. I've learned so much over the last year. I really have and hope to learn a lot more.”

 Sidwell is a man draped in many layers, so it only seemed fitting to ask his portrayer how he would like fans to view the man that we are only beginning to understand.

“Jens is a man who's absolutely full of life. And, he has a lot more empathy for people and things than he has necessarily shown. I think that I want people, if possible (laughing), to view him as being a lot more sensitive than he might be written as. He also likes to laugh with people, but rarely gets the chance to. And, he does appreciate when someone's having a hard time, because he has had a rough go of it, too. That's the thing, who knows where he is from and what he has really seen. I'm still trying to figure that one out!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","New Eminem Movie Streaming Date Announced","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/eminem-stans-paramount-plus-date/","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:26:58 GMT","

Eminem fans won't have to wait long to watch his new documentary from home. Following a limited theatrical run earlier this month, “Stans” is making its streaming debut later this month, and it's bringing a raw in-depth look at the rap icon's relationship with his most dedicated supporters.

A post shared by Marshall Mathers (@eminem)

Directed by Steven Leckart and produced by Eminem himself, “Stans” will arrive on Paramount+ in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, and Brazil on Tuesday, August 26, according to THR. Viewers in the UK, Australia, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria can stream it beginning August 27, while fans in Japan will have to wait until October 3. The documentary previously played in select AMC Theatres from August 7–10 and premiered earlier this year at the inaugural SXSW London.

The feature-length film explores the complicated bond between one of the most private artists in music and the global audience that's grown with him over decades. It features rare archival footage, stylized recreations, and intimate interviews, offering what the filmmakers call “a raw, loud and revealing journey” through Eminem's career. The title is a nod to the rapper's 2000 hit “Stan,” which turned 25 this year and inspired the addition of the term “stan” to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017.

“Stans” began its UK-Ireland box office run with £212,163, a great start for a documentary, from 260 sites at an £860 average. The film has earned £352,326 in the region including previews.

According to Leckart, the creative approach was inspired by one key lyric from “Stan” — “I'm just like you”, with much of the documentary told from the perspective of real-life fans. Eminem's own voice and perspective are woven throughout, with the filmmaker praising how candid, sincere, and unexpectedly funny the artist was during production.

“Stans” is produced by Shady Films in collaboration with DIGA Studios, Fuqua Films, Interscope Films, and MTV Entertainment Studios. Executive producers include Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Stuart Parr, “Training Day” director Antoine Fuqua, Tony DiSanto, David Schiff, Bruce Gillmer, Amanda Culkowski, and Michael Maniaci.

To commemorate the film, during the New York City premiere of “Stans” on August 6th Eminem delivered a heartfelt surprise by reuniting with “Final Destination” actor Devon Sawa, who famously portrayed Stan in the original “Stan” music video. Sawa even brought his young son to the event, reflecting on the moment as a powerful, full-circle reunion nearly 25 years in the making.

Leonardo DiCaprio has worked on countless modern classics with many of the biggest filmmakers of the past half-century. But when he's looking to rewatch one of his films, one stands out above the rest: “The Aviator.” 

In a wide-ranging conversation with his “One Battle After Another” director Paul Thomas Anderson published in Esquire, DiCaprio was asked whether he ever revisits his filmography. The Oscar winner explained that while he seldom watches his own movies he has a soft spot for Martin Scorsese's 2004 Howard Hughes biopic. He cited his involvement in the film‘s development process as evidence that he had truly arrived in the industry and was able to actively participate in his projects, rather than just being hired to support someone else's vision.

“I rarely watch any of my films, but if I'm being honest, there's one that I have watched more than others. It's ‘The Aviator,'” DiCaprio said. “That's simply because it was such a special moment to me. I had worked with Marty [Scorsese] on ‘Gangs of New York,' and I'd been toting around a book on Howard Hughes for 10 years. I almost did it with Michael Mann, but there was a conflict and I ended up bringing it to Marty. I was 30. It was the first time as an actor I got to feel implicitly part of the production, rather than just an actor hired to play a role. I felt responsible in a whole new way. I've always felt proud and connected to that film as such a key part of my growing up in this industry and taking on a role of a real collaborator for the first time.”

 










“The Aviator” received 11 Academy Award nominations — including Best Picture, Best Actor for DiCaprio, and Best Director for Scorsese — and won five categories. It cemented the partnership between DiCaprio and Scorsese, who would go on to re-team on “The Departed,” “Shutter Island,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.” And it still counts Anderson among its fans, with the director telling DiCaprio that “I can stop and watch it any time.” 

A Warner Bros. release, “One Battle After Another” opens in theaters on Friday, September 26.

Doctors love the show for its accuracy, but the realism of “The Pitt” goes beyond integrating an unprecedented number of medical professionals into its creation. When series creator R. Scott Gemmill joined this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, he explained how he, executive producer John Wells, and star/executive producer Noah Wyle — all veterans of “ER” — set out to make “The Pitt” a medical drama that looked and felt more realistic, making bold creative choices that broke from procedural formula.

“It wasn't, ‘OK, yeah, we're going to go back [to ‘ER'] – Noah, me, John, we've done this, we know this,'” said Gemmill on the podcast. “And it's exciting because you are 40 years into your career and you're actually learning new things, and having to figure stuff out. I think that kept us really engaged.”

One of the biggest creative choices was writing “The Pitt” in real time, with each of the 15 episodes being one hour of a 15-hour shift at the fictional Pittsburgh emergency trauma center. Each character's personality, backstory, and arc would play out on the ER floor; the cameras would never follow them to their lives outside the hospital.

 










“We were very adamant about not seeing our doctors unless they were in the ER,” said Gemmill. “From a patient's point of view, when you go to the ER, you don't know what your doctor had for breakfast, you didn't see him get dressed, you didn't see him kiss his wife.”

Gemmill described the challenge for writers who couldn't rely on “spoonfeeding the audience.” Without the usual narrative shortcuts, character had to emerge through behavior and interactions with colleagues during the intensity of a shift.

“You have to constrict your storytelling, but also be very efficient with it because you still want to tell a full arc for these characters, but you only have 15 hours within to do it,” said Gemmill.

Season 1 became a series of experiments as the creators figured out where “The Pitt” fit between a network procedural and a streaming drama. Some medical cases and arcs carried over to the next episode, but Gemmill's team realized they also needed a set number of storylines to wrap each week, giving viewers the resolution expected from a self-contained hour of TV. 

“John [Wells] still teases me because there were many times where I'd [say], ‘I'm not sure this is going work, man.' And I didn't, I wasn't even sure it was going to work until I saw the first cut,” said Gemmill.

 










Gemmill and his team also wanted audiences to feel the realism of “The Pitt” beyond the medical jargon and graphic procedures, signaling that this show would demand something different from its viewers. That vision extended to a bold choice: no score, no music.

“The minute you put music on I find, subconsciously, you sit back a little bit,” said Gemmill. “You know you're watching a TV show, whereas without any music in ours, you don't have that. There's no code to tell you, ‘Ok, you can relax now,' or ‘You can feel funny now,' or ‘Be emotional.' Now you have to decide whether for yourself this scene is going to make you cry or not.”

Casting served a similar purpose. “That's why you see a lot of new faces,” Gemmill said. “What we really wanted to do was [for it to feel like] a new show. And I mean that in the purest way. A show without music, a show that's in real time, a show with new faces.”

For decades, Gemmill worked with brilliant, often recognizable character actors who elevated recurring and guest roles. But when building a cast around the very recognizable Wyle as Dr. Robby, he deliberately sought the opposite approach.

“There's great actors, and I have great friends who are great actors, but I didn't want anyone to come to [‘The Pitt'] and be like, ‘Oh, I remember them, they were so great on ‘Wings,'” said Gemmill. “We really wanted these new faces that you imprint, whatever we tell you who they are.”

 










Gemmill credits casting directors Cathy Sandrich Gelfond and Erica Berger, who were Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Casting for a Drama series, for pulling off the assignment.

“Cathy Sandrich and her team were amazing. We had people from Atlanta and Chicago and New York and Australia, and two from England.  We really threw a really wide net,” said Gemmill. “And that's difficult because what we're asking my casting people to do is find me the greatest actors that have never worked before.”

“The Pitt” was nominated for 13 Emmys, including Outstanding Drama Series, Directing, Writing, Casting, Contemporary Makeup, Prosthetic Makeup, Sound Editing and Mixing, Lead Actor (Wyle), and Supporting Actress (Katherine LaNasa).

Perhaps it's attributable to the lack of tactility of living in a digital hellscape, but a recent spate of thirtysomething filmmakers have been drawn to analogue media and textures in order to muse on a universal experience that no one ever quite processes in the same way: grief. “Aftersun” is but the most prominent example of a trend that memorably continued with Courtney Stephens' “Invention” earlier this year, in which actor/writer Callie Hernandez fictionalized the aftermath of her father's death with an assist from the VHS recordings of his many TV appearances dating back to the '90s.Seeming to pick up where that movie left off, Sophy Romvari's “Blue Heron” similarly follows a protagonist as she navigates her pre-millennial childhood memories through a sea of camcorder clips and hazy recollections. But it would be reductive to belabor the comparisons any further than that, as the Canadian-Hungarian filmmaker's extraordinary debut feature defies any clear precedent or easy categorization as it ventures down structurally exciting and unexpected paths.While “Blue Heron” is a drama that works without any knowledge of the filmmaker's history, Romvari's feature is also the culmination of a decade-long journey. An international festival favorite since the mid-2010s, her acclaimed shorts regularly fall somewhere between fiction and autobiography, the latter to varying levels of overtness. In the likes of “Still Processing”, Romvari herself is the primary onscreen presence. That particular short from 2020, which grappled with the loss of her brothers by sifting through a box of family photos that had been unseen for decades, shares the most DNA with “Blue Heron,” though Romvari is strictly behind the camera this time.For her fiction feature, she deploys an onscreen avatar. Or two. Possibly three, depending on how you interpret one specific dramatic set piece. It's a thrilling formal expansion for a filmmaker who's already so sharp in examining fragmented identities, and how they might be restored with a greater understanding of how the cracks came to be — even if restoration can be an incomplete process, and “greater” often means that a considerable amount of explanation and potential catharsis remain out of reach.The opening words from an offscreen voice (Amy Zimmer) set the mood, hint at who we should keep an eye on for much of the movie, and gesture towards whose perspective we may be sharing along the way. “It's true I spent a lot of my life angry at him,” she says. “The older I get, the less it feels like I knew him at all… Thank you for the memories. They're all I have now.”Credits play out over snapshots of a teenager's hand-drawn maps that reference such locations as “Fantasyville”. Outside of “Blue Heron,” these are maps that one of Romvari's own brothers created in his youth. Within the film, they are the work of Jeremy (Edik Beddoes), the teenage sibling of eight-year-old Sasha (Eylul Guven) — Henry (Liam Serg) and Felix (Preston Drabble) are the other brothers in the mix. In this Canada of the late 90s, their Hungarian immigrant family is moving into a new home on Vancouver Island. But there are complications within this attempt at a fresh start.For one thing, Father (Ádám Tompa), the breadwinner of the family, quickly begins spending all his time between his dark room and his bulky work computer, leaving Mother (Iringó Réti) to take the lead for entertaining their kids when they're not in school. Secondly, the new home only seems to exacerbate ongoing issues with the troubled Jeremy. Largely silent for the entire runtime despite people's attempts to address or engage with him, the lanky teen exhibits increasingly erratic, sometimes dangerous behavior: from shoplifting and vanishing from his family during a rainstorm, to stomping on the house roof and punching through a window in the middle of the night.

Despite Sasha making friends in town, Mother discourages her from inviting them to their house, lest gossip about her brother spread and cause her to become socially isolated — a growing concern for an immigrant parent who wants her child to live peacefully in suburbia. As hinted by the maps of imaginary places that he has pinned in his bedroom, Jeremy operates by the logic of an inner world that no one else can seem to access. His parents try. Medical consultants can't pinpoint what's behind his outbursts. It's getting to the point where his mysterious behavior is a safety concern for the other children, though he's not necessarily ever aiming its more physical manifestations towards them.Romvari, crucially, does include a number of little moments — mainly looks and gradual smiles — that suggest some clear affection from Jeremy towards his younger siblings. During one beach outing where Jeremy otherwise separates himself from his family during the trip, the teen briefly mock-threatens to step on a collection of stones and shells that Sasha has stacked, before gifting her a blue heron keychain to place atop it — a coveted prize from one of his many shoplifting attempts.While the film isn't exclusively told from Sasha's perspective, it's through her eyes and ears that we witness a lot of the major incidents with Jeremy, plus many of the conversations between their parents. Romvari often eschews traditional point-of-view shots, and cinematographer Maya Bankovic complements that decision by favoring a long-lens shooting style with occasional zooms. The location choices and production design work of Victoria Furuya are likewise in perfect harmony with Bankovic's framing and movements. There's an intimate tension to how the blocking sometimes makes it seem like the home has no walls, except when a specific scene calls for interaction with such a surface, like Sasha peeking through a slightly ajar door as her parents meet with a social worker or Jeremy incessantly slamming a basketball against the side of the house.We also see conversations Sasha certainly couldn't have been there to see for herself, and where she definitely isn't present somewhere in the given onscreen space. This element of imagining discussions between her parents, rather than recreating memories of overheard thoughts or explicitly recorded events (Father is regularly shown using his camera and camcorder), ties into “Blue Heron”‘s second-half change-up, which is where the film really becomes something very special. Part of what works so well about the movie's back half lies in its multiple disorientating swerves, so the specifics are best left unspoiled beyond saying that there's a time jump to twenty-ish years later, with that opening adult voice (Amy Zimmer) being more explicitly confirmed as the grown-up version of Sasha, now a filmmaker who's trying to process what happened to her big brother via her chosen artistic field.It's through Romvari and editor Kurt Walker's bold structural move that the film, already excellent as “just” an observational portrait of a family in crisis, becomes profoundly moving. Romvari's preoccupation with fractured identities ambitiously expands to reflect how our incomplete memories can be filled in over time — less through unlocking something we'd forgotten than by achieving a greater understanding of, and empathy for, the perspectives of those with whom we shared those times. If you've ever imagined how you'd try comforting your younger self or your family about the uncertain future ahead of them, “Blue Heron” may be the most emotionally devastating film of the year — and also perhaps the most comforting.

 










“Blue Heron” premiered at the 2025 Locarno Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Kiss, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait, and English actor Michael Crawford will receive the Kennedy Center Honors at a Donald Trump-hosted ceremony in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 8.


	This is the first Kennedy Center Honors since President Donald Trump took over as chairman of the prestigious Kennedy Center earlier this year. His first action was removing Biden-era appointees from the board and stacking it with loyalists. At a board meeting in March, he said that things were going to change with him in charge.


	“We'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people,” he said. “There are people out there that would not be considered that are much bigger stars than the ones that were being honored … In the past, I mean, these are radical left lunatics that have been chosen. I didn't like it. I couldn't watch it. And the host was always terrible.”


	Trump announced the 2025 honorees today as well as his plans to host the gala at a press conference where he proclaimed, “We ended the woke political programming, and we're restoring the Kennedy Center as the premier venue for performing arts anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world. We have some unbelievable plans.”

	During his first administration, Trump broke longtime tradition and didn't attend the yearly Kennedy Center Honors. The move came after Norman Lear and other honorees said they wouldn't attend if he was in the house. “As an artist and a human being, I cannot celebrate this incredible honor at a White House that has no interest in supporting the arts and humanities,” Lear told NPR.












	It's unlikely that Strait will react in the same fashion. The country icon largely keeps his political views to himself, but he broke out Trump's distinct dance move at a December 2024 show in Las Vegas to roars of approval from the audience.

The Kennedy Center is proud to announce our incredible lineup of 2025 Kennedy Center Honorees:•George Strait (@GeorgeStrait)•Michael Crawford •Sylvester Stallone (@TheSlyStallone)•Gloria Gaynor (@GloriaGaynor)•Kiss (@Kiss)Congratulations to our 48th Class! pic.twitter.com/y8iWt4U0Lq


	Stallone, meanwhile, is an avowed Trump booster. “When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world,” Stallone said in December 2024 when appearing at an event with Trump. “‘Cause without him, you can imagine what the world would look like. Guess what, we got the second George Washington … We're in the presence of a really mythical character … Nobody in the world could've pulled off what he pulled off, so I'm in awe.”

	Trump returned the love when announcing the new Kennedy Center Honors class. “[Stallone] is a very special guy,” he said today. “A real talent. Never been given the credit for the talent. There was nobody else that could have done the roles that he did like he did them. Not even close. They've tried, and they didn't work out too well … I'll never forget I was a young guy and I went to see a thing called Rambo and it had just come out. I didn't know anything about it — and I said, this movie is phenomenal. What the heck? And that turned out to be a monster.”


	As for Gaynor's inclusion, Trump said, “I will say that ‘I Will Survive' is an unbelievable song.” Trump added that he was “98 percent involved” in the selection process for this year's honorees.


	Gene Simmons of Kiss is one of rock's most famous conservative voices, and he was a cast member on The Apprentice in 2008, but he's not a Trump supporter. “I knew him before he entered politics,” he told Spin in 2022. “Look what that gentleman did to this country and the polarization — got all the cockroaches to rise to the top. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it's all out in the open because he allowed it … I don't think he's a Republican or a Democrat. He's out for himself, any way you can get there.”

	Despite this, and other critical things the members of Kiss have said about Trump over the years, all four members of the band released statements saying they were proud of the honor. “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off,” Paul Stanley said. “The prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.”Gene Simmons added: “KISS is the embodiment of the American dream. We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.”

	“Coming from my humble beginnings growing up in The Bronx, this honor is a dream come true that I never thought would materialize,” Ace Frehley said in his statement. “All I can say is it's beyond my wildest dreams, and I am very honored and grateful to be including with the rest of the honorees.” “I feel so blessed this is the greatest honor of our career,” said Peter Criss.

Timothy Gallaudet—former Chief Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy—believes the U.S. government should study “unidentified submersible objects.”

USOs are similar to UFOs, but sighted in the world's oceans.

The retired rear admiral claims that these USOs could be a threat to maritime security.

A retired U.S. Navy admiral believes that the government should look to the oceans to help solve a mystery in the skies. Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, former Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy, cited a 2019 sighting by a Navy warship as evidence that the phenomena of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified submersible objects (USOs) are linked.

The sighting, recorded off the coast of San Diego, involved a hovering spherical object that appeared to abruptly enter the water.

Gallaudet made the case for studying underwater UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), in a recent paper titled, “Beneath the Surface: We May Learn More about UAP by Looking in the Ocean.” Gallaudet writes that “transmedium” USOs and UAPs, defined as unidentified objects that appear to travel both in the atmosphere and the water, “jeopardize U.S. maritime security.” The retired rear admiral makes the case that the under-surveyed underwater realm is a threat to maritime security—the oceans form the bedrock of international trade and the American economy, and are where the U.S. Navy operates.

Gallaudet argues that the lack of knowledge about the undersea world poses hazards for submarines such as collisions with other submarines—such as the independent crashes of the submarines USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut, both of which were incidents that resulted in severe damage to the ships and one crew fatality—and undetected underwater seamounts. Further study of this realm, he believes, could shed additional light on these UFO/UAP sightings.

One incident to which Gallaudet points in particular is a July 19, 2019 encounter between the Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Omaha and a so-called transmedium UAP. In the incident, the crew of the Omaha (sailing off the coast of San Diego) used their AN/KAX-2 electro-optical sensor to record a spherical UAP hovering just over the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The AN/KAX-2 is a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder.

The video, seen here, is a recording of a screen showing the output of the AN/KAX-2. The video appears to have been taken with the night vision camera, which uses imaging infrared to record objects in darkness. The object seemingly moves, tracked by the sensor operator, and then stops to hover. The object stops and hovers a short distance above the surface of the ocean. At the end, the object disappears, with sailors remarking that it made a splash as it entered the water. Meanwhile, one sailor off camera radios the other ships in the area—the guided missile destroyers Pinckney, Kidd, and Rafael Peralta—asking for a MH-60 helicopter to be launched as soon as possible. 

The video was leaked to UFO investigator Jeremy Corbell Lockyer, and was later verified as genuine by the Navy. A search of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (the Pentagon's web site for releasing official photos and video) shows three of the warships in the encounter—Pinckney, Kidd, and Omaha—in formation in the Eastern Pacific six days later, on July 25.

Gallaudet also references another sighting from 2013, spotted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel. The sighting—which took place near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico—was filmed using a similar imaging infrared camera. The video, shown here, depicts another spherical object appearing to enter the water and then re-emerge without losing any speed. The retired admiral writes, “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.”

Other possible evidence cited by the admiral includes an incident in 2022, in which the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered an unusual series of holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles. The centimeter-sized holes were in an unusually straight line and scientists are apparently at a loss to explain their origin.

Gallaudet entered the U.S. Navy in 1989 after attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Gallaudet, according to his official biography, received “masters and doctoral degrees in oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1991 and 2001 respectively.” He served with a number of naval oceanography and meteorology commands, and was superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. He assumed command of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in 2014, and served as Oceanographer of the Navy from 2016 until retirement in 2017.

After his Navy career, Gallaudet served for two years as acting administrator in charge of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, he sits on the advisory board for Americans for Safe Aerospace, which describes itself as a “nonprofit organization dedicated to aerospace safety and national security with a focus on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).” ASA is led by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. naval aviator who reports having his own UAP sighting on active duty in 2014. In a 2023 op-ed published in The Hill, Gallaudet called UAPs the “story of the century,” and clearly did not rule out an extraterrestrial cause for them.

It's rare for a high-ranking U.S. military officer to directly address UAP issues, even in retirement, and the incidents Gallaudet calls attention to are unusual, to say the least. Barring flat-out hoaxing by military and civilian government personnel, the videos and photographic evidence are not easily explained. Whether this will result in greater research to the same extent as the UFO/UAP issue remains to be seen.

In response to the heat and humidity, some Maine communities are opening cooling centers.

The owners are Jennifer and Cory Heinzen, paranormal investigators. (Photo by Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)

TOPICS:

AUGUSTA, Maine (WGME) -- The real-life Annabelle doll that inspired the horror movie franchise is scheduled to visit Maine in September. This comes after a popular paranormal investigator died suddenly while on tour with the doll.

The Annabelle doll will be at the Maine Paranormal & Horror Convention at Augusta Civic Center on September 6th and 7th.

The Augusta Civic Center says the convention is a gathering for lovers of all things supernatural and macabre. It will feature celebrity guests, panels, eerie vendors, and immersive experiences.

The Annabelle exhibit in Maine will be held just weeks after paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died suddenly while on tour with the doll.

Rivera was a senior lead investigator with the New England Society for Psychic Research and was visiting Gettysburg, Pa., in July as part of the “Devils on the Run” tour featuring the supposedly haunted doll.

Today.com reported that Rivera died in his hotel room.

""His death was nothing suspicious,"" Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill said.



Pennewill said the doll was not in the room and that Rivera was found alone.

No cause of death has been released at this time.

The Annabelle doll, a Raggedy Ann doll, was made famous by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who investigated the doll in the 1970s and kept it locked in their occult museum. The doll is said to be possessed. 

The Warrens were the inspiration for “The Conjuring” movies, and the spin off films featuring Annabelle, as well as “The Nun.”

	LENOX, Mass.— Nue Electrolysis, located at 69 Church Street in Suite 4, is now accepting patients to help remove unwanted hair.


	Owner, Kristen Fontaine, recently opened the space around July 15th.


	What she does is use electrolysis to zap the hair out of your body. Electrolysis is the only FDA approved method for permanent hair removal.


	""Basically what you do is you take a fine probe and use it to get into a particle, and it goes down to the base of the root and use that with electricity,"" she said.


	Fontaine went to the Electrology Institute of New England becoming licensed in Massachusetts.


	""I find electrology to be very detail oriented, which I love. I like getting focused in on something and just working towards a goal and I like helping people,"" she said.


	It takes multiple sessions to help get rid of the hair, with the range varying based on hair growth. However Fontaine recommends having appointments at least once a week. 


	""You need a series of sessions to really get results with this kind of thing. It's because of the hair growth cycle. Once the hair comes out, another one's going to come in. Keep going until you keep zapping that one bulb eventually it will grow finer and finer.""


	Fontaine grew up in Pittsfield wanted to open her business in Lenox because this part of the county was lacking in the electrology field. 


	""I specifically wanted Lenox, just because there is somebody in Barrington doing electrology, somebody in Pittsfield who is also in Williamstown doing it. So, I wanted to be able to kind of serve this area of Berkshire County.""


	Fontaine hopes to help people feel better in their skin and make their life easier when it comes to their hair on their body.


	""I want people to be comfortable in their skin and I want people to not have to shave every day and tweeze and pluck or go through 'beauty is pain' even though that is the process here, but it'll end eventually,"" she said.


	Fontaine is planning to go to school for aesthetics at the Aesthetic Science Institute, where she can hopefully provide services like facials.


	""I'm going to start going to school for esthetics very soon, in a couple weeks, hopefully I can add on some basic esthetic services. I definitely want to keep my focus on hair removal,"" she said. 


	Hours are by appointment and can be made here or by calling.

As fans eagerly wait for details about The Boys Season 5, Supernatural alum Jared Padalecki has shared a major update about his role in the final installment of the Prime Video series, as well as its release pattern. In a recent discussion, the two-time Teen Choice Awards winner teased some interesting details about his character in The Boys' fifth season, while also revealing when he'll make his debut in the series.

While answering a fan question at the recently conducted Fan Expo in Boston, Jared Padalecki divulged that his character will make their first appearance in The Boys Season 5 Episode 5. Padalecki also mentioned that Prime Video plans to premiere the final season of the superhero series in two batches. (via Collider)

“It's Episode 5 of Season 5,” the 43-year-old actor stated while talking about his Boys debut. He then mentioned a new release pattern for The Boys Season 5, noting, “I think they're putting out the first four episodes and then a little bit of time and then the final four episodes.” This would be a first for the show, as the first season premiered all its episodes in one batch, while following seasons released their episodes on a weekly basis after a three-episode premiere.

Jared Padalecki also disclosed an interesting connection between his character and his Supernatural co-star, Jensen Ackles' Soldier Boy in Season 5, stating, “I'll say this much — my character is very excited to meet Soldier Boy.” He concluded by sharing a disclaimer for his Boys debut, saying, “And for those who are not yet 18, do not watch it.”

With Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins joining The Boys' cast for its final season, fans may be able to witness a significant Supernatural reunion in the show, with Jensen Ackles already playing a pivotal role in the series. While The Boys Season 5 has now wrapped filming, its official release date remains unknown at the time of writing.

The best of art, craft, and visual culture since 2010.

Since time immemorial, humans have been both awed and guided by the power of the unknown. A basis of spiritual beliefs the world over is the abiding question, why?—a probing wonderment often followed closely by, what happens when we die?

Human belief systems provide structure that help us to make sense of the world, and yet the nature of our existence—and how we fit into the context of the cosmos—comprises some of the most beguiling mysteries of all. It's no surprise that across cultures and throughout millennia, our search for meaning and connection with other worlds has inspired incredible creativity.

Spirit Worlds, forthcoming from TASCHEN on September 15, celebrates art's relationship to other realms. More than 400 works spanning thousands of years, paired with essays and interviews with scholars and practitioners, illustrate our fascination with supernatural, from angels and celestial beings to darker forces like ghosts and demons. 

The title marks the sixth installment in The Library of Esoterica series, which also includes titles like Plant Magick and Sacred Sites. Spirit Worlds clocks in at more than 500 pages, surveying death rites, altars, sacred temples, the messages of prophets, links mediums make with the other side, symbolic statuary, and more.

“In this expansive volume, we board the ferry across the storied river and enter the gloomy passages between lands, stepping across the threshold—to part the most sacred of veils,” the publisher says.

            Democrats are banking in a big way on California and its governor, Gavin Newsom, to help them fight back against Republicans in a burgeoning gerrymandering arms race.
    


            Texas Democrats are reportedly considering ending their walkout, which was intended to prevent the Texas GOP's power grab but never really stood a chance of halting new GOP-friendly maps. That puts even more focus on Newsom, who signaled late Tuesday that he's now pressing forward with his effort to redraw California's maps to retaliate against Texas Republicans' effort.
    


            But it's a risky bet – both for Democrats and for Newsom.
    


            And you could understand if Republicans are inclined to try to call their bluff.
    


            California provides Democrats' best opportunity to retaliate against Texas Republicans' extraordinary effort to gerrymander a more Republican congressional map in the middle of the decade. That's for a few reasons.
    


            One is that California could feasibly offset five new Republican districts in Texas with five new Democratic-leaning ones of their own. Another is that Democrats simply don't have many opportunities to fight back elsewhere, to the extent this arms race spreads to other states. And the third is that California provides the threat of hitting back quickly – in time for the 2026 midterm elections – unlike in a state like, say, New York.
    


            Democrats are clearly hoping this threat at least gives Republicans pause.
    


            But what if Democrats and Newsom actually follow through? That's where history suggests things could get messy.
    


            The problem for them is that, unlike Texas Republicans, they need to jump through more hoops to make this happen. California Democrats would first need to get voters to sign off on a ballot measure in November to get rid of the state's redistricting commission. Newsom is expressing confidence that it will pass.
    


            “I think the voters will approve it. I think the voters understand what's at stake,” the governor said Friday. “We live in the most un-Trump state in America.”
    


            But the trick here is somehow getting voters to back a more politicized redistricting process – to effectively vote in favor of gerrymandering. And that's something they've been reluctant to do, including in California.
    


            More than a dozen states have put redistricting commissions on the ballot in recent decades, and voters have supported them about two-thirds of the time, according to Ballotpedia. When they've rejected them, it's generally been in red states rather than blue ones like California.
    


            The most recent vote on such a commission came last year, in Ohio. And voters rejected the commission. But that seemed to owe in large part to slanted language applied to the measure by the state's Republican leaders. That language suggested the new commission was actually going to lead to more gerrymandering.
    


            (The language described the measure as an effort to “repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering” and said the new commission would be “required to gerrymander the boundaries” of the state's districts.)
    


            That language seemed to matter. A late poll that asked about the commission in a more neutral way showed voters supported the idea by 23 points, 57%-34% – right before they rejected the actual measure by 8 points, 54%-46%.
    


            Of course, California voters wouldn't be asked to install a new redistricting commission; they'd be asked to get rid of one.
    


            But history looms there, too. Indeed, California voters have already rejected such an effort by a wide margin, back in 2010.
    


            California voters had narrowly approved a redistricting commission in 2008, and the 2010 ballot featured a measure to repeal that ballot measure, Proposition 27. It failed 59%-41%.
    


            The dynamics today are clearly at least somewhat different. Newsom seems to believe left-leaning voters can be convinced that turnabout is fair play and that Texas' gambit is worth re-politicizing the process in California.
    


            But that could be a difficult trick, particularly given how tuned-out Americans generally are on redistricting. Huge majorities dislike gerrymandering, but polls also suggest they don't follow it too closely.
    


            How many California voters who like the idea of a more independent redistricting process are going to understand the situation in Texas well enough and conclude they should scrap that principle in the name of political expediency? The 2024 Ohio example suggests the prospect of voting in favor of gerrymandering is a big hurdle.
    


            And the risks here extend to Newsom.
    


            This is his big play on the national stage right now. He's making a huge show of it, including trolling President Donald Trump and Republicans with some very Trump-esque missives on social media on Tuesday night.
    


            But imagine a situation in which the voters don't go along with it and reject the ballot measure. That would be a huge setback for the perception of Newsom's political prowess as he gears up for what many believe is likely to be a 2028 presidential campaign. Such a failure would also likely embolden other Republican-controlled states to press forward in the gerrymandering arms race, knowing that Democrats can't really fight back.
    


            Newsom seems confident he can make it happen. But as mentioned, Democrats don't have a lot of great options to try to fight back against Texas Republicans' gambit. So it's understandable if they feel that they have to try something.
    


            It's just the something is very complicated – and would provide a real test for Newsom.

Donald Trump is preparing to offer Vladimir Putin access to rare earth minerals to incentivise him to end the war in Ukraine.

The US president will arrive at the much-anticipated meeting with his Russian counterpart on Friday armed with a number of money-making opportunities for Putin.

They will include opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow and lifting some of the American sanctions on Russia's aviation industry, The Telegraph can reveal.

Proposals include giving Putin access to the rare earth minerals in the Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia.

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is understood to be among administration figures briefing Mr Trump ahead of his meeting with Putin in Anchorage. 

Mr Bessent is exploring the economic trade-offs the US can make with Russia in order to expedite a ceasefire agreement.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said Putin would face “severe consequences” if he did not agree to end the war in Ukraine at their meeting on Friday.

The US leader also revealed his intention to seek an immediate second meeting with Putin, this time involving Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, after their one-on-one talks in Alaska.

Mr Trump said: “If the first one goes ok, we'll have a quick second one. I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they'd like to have me there.”

The US president had attended a virtual summit with Mr Zelensky and other European leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Freidrich Merz as part of a series of calls ahead of the Alaska meeting.

Speaking after the talks, Mr Zelensky said Mr Trump backed security guarantees for Ukraine. “There should be security guarantees,” he told a press conference alongside Mr Merz, the German chancellor. 

“President Trump said that he supports this and America's readiness to take part.”

In the past months, Washington has kept security guarantees – some kind of commitment that America would be willing to enforce the terms of any peace deal – for Ukraine off the table, despite it being a key demand from Kyiv.

The UK, France and Germany have been working towards creating a peacekeeping force without the direct involvement of the Americans but had hoped the US may offer support such as air cover.

Offering an update on the plans following Wednesday's talks, Sir Keir said his “coalition of the willing” was ready to implement a ceasefire plan as soon as a peace deal was agreed.

The plans “are now ready in a form that can be used if we get to that ceasefire”, the Prime Minister said, adding that “real progress” on security guarantees for Ukraine had been made.

European leaders including Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the calls with Mr Trump were “positive”. After the calls, Mr Zelensky said Putin was “bluffing” when he said “he does not care about the sanctions and that they're not working”.

As well as lifting sanctions, The Telegraph can now reveal that the US is preparing to offer Putin other financial incentives to end the war, including access to rare earth minerals in the areas of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia.

Ukraine is thought to hold 10 per cent of the world's reserves of lithium, used in the production of batteries. Two of its largest lithium deposits are in areas held by Russia, and Putin has staked his claim to the valuable minerals found in the regions his forces occupy.

“There are a range of incentives, in which a potential mineral/rare earth deal could be one,” a source with knowledge of the proposals told The Telegraph.

In May, the US signed a rare earth mineral deal with Kyiv, allowing it to exploit Ukraine's ample natural resources. Washington will need to establish new mining operations, which could be accelerated by Russian co-operation.

The president's America First policy has seen him strike several mineral deals since his return to the Oval Office, most notably with Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

Other incentives include lifting export bans on parts and equipment needed to service Russian planes, swathes of which have fallen into disrepair.

Western countries have restricted Moscow's access to crucial spare components and other equipment since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, forcing airlines and the military to cannibalise old aircraft for replacement parts.

Nearly 30 per cent of Russia's Western-made planes, cut off from maintenance, could be grounded within the next five years, Sergei Chemezov, the head of Rostec, Russia's state-owned defence conglomerate, suggested this year.

Lifting sanctions on Russian aircraft could prove lucrative for the American manufacturer Boeing. With a fleet of more than 700 planes dominated by Airbus and Boeing, Russian airlines could return to the American suppliers for critical parts and maintenance.

Recent major incidents highlight an urgent need to prevent the fleet degrading. In late July, a Soviet-era Antonov An-24, built in 1976, crashed in the country's far east, killing all 48 people on board. Days later, the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot grounded dozens of flights following a crippling cyber attack.

Mr Trump is also considering offering Russia opportunities to tap into the valuable natural resources in the strait that separates it from the US. Alaska, separated from Russia by just three miles of the Bering Strait, is estimated to hold significant undiscovered oil and gas reserves, including 13 per cent of the world's oil.

Developing Russia's presence in the strait would bolster Putin's strategic interests in the Arctic region, which accounted for 80 per cent of Russia's gas production in 2022.

UK government sources told The Telegraph that such incentives could be acceptable to Europe so long as it was not seen as rewarding Russia. “The sense is that it has to be presented to align with public opinion around this, it cannot be seen as a reward for Putin,” one said.

Israel's occupation of the West Bank could be used as a model for ending the war. Russia would have military and economic control of occupied Ukraine under its own governing body, similar to Israel's de facto rule of Palestinian territory.

The idea was raised in discussions between Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's special envoy and his Russian counterparts, according to The Times.

The White House is tempering expectations ahead of the summit on Friday, portraying it as a “listening exercise” for the president.

“This is really a feel-out meeting, a little bit,” Mr Trump told reporters on Monday, predicting he would know “probably in the first two minutes” if Putin was serious about peace.

European diplomats say there has been no notable change in Putin's overall war aim, which is to topple Mr Zelensky's government and replace it with a Moscow-friendly proxy.

The Russian president's aides described the tete-a-tete primarily as a discussion on “Russian-American relations”, hinting at boosting trade co-operation.

A White House official said: “We do not comment on deliberative conversations that may or may not be happening. From the beginning, the president has been clear about his commitment to ending the bloodshed and achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire.

“As the president stated, everyone agrees this war must come to a close, and that is what he is working towards.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A driver faces up to $110,000 in fines for speeding on a Swiss street. But he can afford it","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/europe/switzerland-speeding-ticket-wealthy-fines-swiss-latam-intl","Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:16:00 GMT","


            The driver was clocked going 27 kilometers per hour (17 mph) over the speed limit on a street in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and now he's facing up to 90,000 Swiss francs (over $110,000) in fines as a result. But he can afford it.
    


            Why the eye-popping penalty? Because the speedster, a repeat offender, is one of Switzerland's wealthiest people, and the Vaud canton, or region, serves up fines based on factors like income, fortune or general family financial situation.
    


This Swiss River is so clean, locals use it to commute to work



            The Swiss are not alone. Germany, France, Austria and the Nordic countries all issue punishments based on a person's wealth. The recent fine isn't even a record in Switzerland. In 2010, a millionaire Ferrari driver got a ticket equal to about $290,000 for speeding in the eastern canton of St. Gallen.
    


            Back then, the Swiss safety group Road Cross said rich drivers had been lightly punished until voters approved a penal law overhaul three years earlier that let judges hand down fines based on personal income and wealth for misdemeanors like speeding and drunk driving.
    


            Under today's rules, an indigent person might spend a night in jail instead of a fine, while the wealthiest in the rich Alpine country could be on the hook for tens of thousands.
    


            A court in the Swiss canton of Vaud recently ruled that the tycoon must pay 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,300) up front and could be forced to pay the rest – 80,000 more – if he's caught for a similar roadway infraction over the next three years.
    


Emma Watson banned from driving in the UK for six months



            Switzerland's “24 Heures” newspaper first reported the case and said the man, who was not identified, was a French citizen listed by Swiss economic weekly Bilan among the 300 richest people in Switzerland – with a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
    


            The daily reported that an automated police radar photographed the offender driving at 77 kilometers per hour (48 mph) in a 50 kph (31 mph) zone on a Lausanne street. A quick-calculating prosecutor tallied the maximum fine the driver faced under the law, the report said.
    


            Vincent Derouand, a spokesperson for the Vaud public prosecutors office, said the defendant didn't contest the decision, which was handed down in June for the infraction nearly a year ago – in August 2024.
    


            The Vaud criminal code sets a maximum financial penalty based on the “personal and economic situation of the offender at the time of the ruling” – notably taking into account issues like income, fortune, lifestyle and family financial needs.
    


Bride caught in speeding car late to her own wedding



            The newspaper reported that he had already been caught for a similar speeding infraction eight years ago, and also paid 10,000 Swiss francs in penalty and faced another 60,000 if another infraction had taken place within the following two years.
    


            In Switzerland, penalties for speeding can even catch up with the cops: One officer was fined for racing at nearly twice the speed limit through Geneva streets back in 2016 while chasing thieves who had blown up a bank teller machine.

President Donald Trump said he may declare a national emergency in Washington, D.C. if Congress doesn't renew his control over the city's police department.

For decades, Washington, D.C. has been synonymous with crime, murder, and more recently vagrancy, but this week, President Donald Trump is taking a page from an ancient political playbook and looking to finally clean up our nation's capital. 

""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Est,"" wrote Marcus Tullius Cicero over 2,000 years ago. It roughly means, ""the safety of the people should be the supreme law,"" and the safety of the ancient Roman citizen, at least for a while, was almost unquestioned.

Trump wants Americans to feel just as safe as they live in or visit the seat of our great democracy.

‘RADICAL' DC OFFICIALS TREATED OFFICERS ‘LIKE CRAP,' POLICE LEADER SAYS – 7 ATTACKS THAT LED TO TRUMP TAKEOVER

Democrats' immediate reaction to Trump's common-sense plan to fight crime in D.C. by surging federal resources and approaches was to play deaf, dumb and blind to the plight of residents, citing statistics that show a recent drop in an already sky-high crime rate.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., perhaps from his Whites only beach club, took to X to claim that this use of the Home Rule act was only triggered by an assault on a DOGE team member. He conveniently left out the two Israeli embassy staff workers recently murdered in cold blood, the congressional aide killed by mistake in a drive-by, and the rise of 15-year-old carjackers.

Meanwhile, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., taking time off from his TikTok movie productions, posted several examples of crime in D.C. this week with the insane comment, ""Trump owns it."" One of these crimes, a murder, took place on Monday, just hours after Trump's anti-crime announcement.

Setting aside the congressman's heartless glee in snarking at the president over the murder of an innocent, his ridiculous attack on Trump at least admits that, yes, crime is a big problem in Washington, D.C., one that will finally be tackled.

Nobody likes crime, and nobody likes being told they are just imagining it.

This is yet another example of Trump's incendiary common sense, by which he does something outlandish, like taking over the D.C. police department, to outrage from opponents who a day later have to admit, OK, yeah, crime is bad.

TOP DEMOCRATS RIPPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA OVER 'BONKERS' REACTIONS TO TRUMP'S DC CRIME PLAN: 'MASSIVE LIAR'

Public safety is a gut issue, and it is also the foundation of all other blessings of good government. This is why Cicero called it supreme. Everyone in D.C. either knows, or has been, a victim or witness of a crime. You can't show them statistics and pretend everything is fine.

Opponents of crime prevention display graphs that say the crime rate is down 30 percent this year, but from an already staggeringly high level that has been ignored for years.

This is like a guy who loses his entire year's salary playing blackjack. He can likely circle a few weekends when he won big, but he still needs to call Gambler's Anonymous.

The obvious model for Trump's anti-crime action in D.C. is the success of Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s in New York City, who slashed violent crime with almost impossible speed.

TRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE

He accomplished this by embracing new police tactics like Compstat crime computing, stop and frisk, and broken windows policing that focuses on smaller quality of life crimes.

And the benefits of this miraculous turnaround were not limited to Gotham. Indeed, other cities across America used these innovations to lower crime nationwide.

Trump and his administration have the chance to do the same thing with their D.C. efforts, by actually punishing juvenile crime, by seeking to end cashless bail, and by clearing out drug users and vagrants from D.C. parks, national trends could be set.

One Democrat who has taken the high road, more or less, amid this takeover by Trump is D.C.'s Mayor Muriel Bowser, who knows exactly how bad crime in D.C. is, having put in place a juvenile curfew just this week, and she has shown an open mind to the endeavor.

Traditionally, the Latin word ""salus,"" in the famous quote from Cicero above, means safety, but the word, derived from the Goddess Salus, can also mean health, well-being and prosperity, because, as the ancients knew, all of these are of a piece.

Donald Trump envisages a gleaming capital city where even at 2 am one can walk freely, admiring the moon atop the Washington monument in the big skies of D.C., and not just in D.C., but in all American cities.

So, let the Democrats hoot and holler a little more if they must. Most Americans are hopeful about this move by the president. Nobody likes crime, and nobody likes being told they are just imagining it.

Salus Populi Suprema Lex Est, the primacy of safety is as true today as when it was coined in the days before Christ, and whether he succeeds or fails, Donald Trump is going to try to provide that safety. 

It should be an effort we can all get behind and support.

In this article

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish soared Wednesday after the cryptocurrency exchange raised about $1.1 billion in an initial public offering.

The stock opened at $90 on the New York Stock Exchange, 143% above its IPO price of $37. At one point, it rose as high as $118 before closing at $68, a gain of more than 83%.

The company priced its IPO early Wednesday far above this week's expected range of $32 to $33 and an initial range last week of between $28 and $31, valuing the company at almost $5.6 billion before trading began. By day's end, Bullish had a market value of some $10.25 billion, based on its 150.684 million shares outstanding.

Bullish sold 30 million shares in the IPO, representing 19.9% of its total stock.  

Bullish, led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley and backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, focuses on institutional investors and blends decentralized finance protocols with the security of a centralized company.

""The last leg of growth in crypto, the last 10 years, was basically all retail and … the institutional wave has begun,"" Farley told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Wednesday. ""It's here, and it's a question of how big it will be. Based on the reception we've gotten thus far as part of our IPO, it feels like institutional investors feel like this could be the moment.""

Since the company's launch in 2021, total trading volume on the Bullish platform exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31. The Cayman Islands-headquartered company also owns the crypto news website CoinDesk, which includes crypto indexes, data and analytics.

Bullish joins a host of companies looking to take advantage of the Trump administration's favorable attitude toward the crypto industry. In June, stablecoin issuer Circle made a highly successful stock market debut, raising more than $1 billion. That followed the transfer of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to the Nasdaq from Toronto, and stock and crypto trading app eToro's IPO that valued it at $5.4 billion. Crypto custody startup BitGo and crypto exchange Gemini have also confidentially filed for U.S. listings. 

This is the second attempt by Bullish to go public in the four years since the company launched.

 Bitcoin and Ether look poised to hit new highs soon. Which altcoins could follow? 

Key points:

Bitcoin bulls are chasing after BTC's $123,218 all-time high as buying pressure surges.

Ether has played catch-up to Bitcoin and is close to making a new all-time high.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $122,000 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure. The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it, increasing the likelihood of a breakout above the all-time high of $123,218.

BTC is not alone. Ether (ETH) has also charged toward its all-time high of $4,868. Crypto sentiment-tracking platform Santiment said in a post on X that ETH could break out to a new all-time high as retail traders are in disbelief of the current rally. History shows the price moves in “the opposite direction of retail traders' expectations.” 

In a report shared with Cointelegraph, Standard Chartered said aggressive buying by ETH treasury companies and exchange-traded funds, along with the pace of stablecoin adoption, improves the outlook for ETH. This led the bank to boost their ETH price target to $7,500 in 2025 from $4,000 previously.

Could BTC break above the all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Buyers have again pushed BTC toward the all-time high of $123,218, indicating solid buying on every minor dip.

The flattish 20-day simple moving average (SMA) ($116,957) signals a balance between supply and demand, but the relative strength index (RSI) above 65 indicates positive momentum. That increases the likelihood of a break above $123,218. The BTC/USDT pair could then surge toward $135,000.

Time is running out for the bears. They will have to swiftly yank the price below the 50-day SMA ($114,682) to weaken the bullish momentum. If they do that, the Bitcoin price could tumble to $110,530.

ETH extended its rally above $4,700 on Wednesday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls.

Sellers will try to defend the $4,868 level, which could trigger a short-term correction or consolidation. The overbought level on the RSI also suggests the rally may cool off in the near term. If that happens, the ETH/USDT pair could descend to $4,350 and then to the breakout level of $4,094.

Instead, if buyers pierce the $4,868 level, the Ether price could skyrocket to the psychological level of $5,000 and then to $5,662. 

XRP (XRP) bounced off the 20-day SMA ($3.11) on Tuesday, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels.

The flattish 20-day SMA and the RSI just above the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price rises above $3.40, the XRP/USDT pair could climb to $3.66.

Alternatively, a drop below the 20-day SMA signals that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. The XRP price may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($2.85), which is likely to attract buyers. The short-term trend turns negative below $2.72.

BNB (BNB) has made a V-shaped recovery from $730 on Aug. 3, indicating aggressive buying at lower levels.

The BNB/USDT pair rallied close to the $861 overhead resistance, where the bears are posing a strong challenge. If the price turns down from $861, but rebounds off the 20-day SMA ($794), it suggests that dips are being purchased. That enhances the prospects of a break above $861. The BNB price may then ascend to $900 and later to $1,000.

The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day SMA. That suggests profit booking at higher levels. The BNB price could then collapse to the solid support at $732.

Solana (SOL) turned up sharply from the 20-day SMA ($176) and surged above the $185 resistance on Tuesday.

The SOL/USDT pair rose near the $209 overhead resistance on Wednesday, but the long wick on the candlestick shows the bears are defending the level. The Solana price could skid to the $185 support, where the buyers are expected to step in. 

If the price rebounds off the $185 support with strength, the bulls will again try to thrust the pair above $209. If they can pull it off, the pair could rally to $240. 

On the contrary, a break and close below $185 suggests a range formation between $209 and $155.

Dogecoin (DOGE) remains stuck inside a large range between $0.14 and $0.29 for the past several months.

The price bounced off the 20-day SMA ($0.22) on Tuesday, indicating that the buyers are trying to take charge. There is resistance at $0.25, but if the level is crossed, the DOGE/USDT pair could rise to $0.29. Sellers are expected to defend the $0.29 level with all their might because a close above it opens the doors for a potential rally to $0.44.

The first support on the downside is at the 20-day SMA and then at the 50-day SMA ($0.20). A slide below the 50-day SMA could drag the Dogecoin price to $0.18.

Cardano (ADA) turned up sharply from the 20-day SMA ($0.77) on Tuesday, signaling aggressive buying at lower levels.

The bulls are trying to sustain the price above the $0.86 resistance. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could climb to $0.94 and later to $1.02.

The first sign of weakness on the downside will be a break and close below the 20-day SMA. That could sink Cardano's price to the 50-day SMA ($0.72). This is a crucial level for the bulls to defend because a break and close below the 50-day SMA may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

Chainlink (LINK) has been marching toward the $27 level, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.

Sellers are likely to pose a substantial challenge in the $26 to $27 resistance zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the LINK/USDT pair could slump to $20.84. Buyers are expected to defend the $20.84 level because a break below it may sink the Chainlink price to $18.

Conversely, if buyers pierce the $27 resistance, the uptrend could resume and the pair may extend its up move to $31.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been stuck between the moving averages and the support line of the ascending channel pattern.

The flattish moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If buyers achieve a close above the support line, the HYPE/USDT pair could rally to $50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $50, but the rally could extend to the resistance line of the channel near $64 if the bulls prevail.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The Hyperliquid price could then descend to $36.

Stellar (XLM) has been taking support at the 20-day SMA ($0.42), indicating a positive sentiment.

The 20-day SMA is flattish, but the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the momentum favors the bulls. If buyers push the price above $0.47, the XLM/USDT pair could surge toward $0.52. The Stellar price will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on a close above $0.52.

Sellers will have to swiftly pull the price below the 20-day SMA to signal strength. The pair could then plunge to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.34.

Artificial intelligence tools have been shown to help doctors detect pre-cancerous growths in the colon—but don't even think about taking those tools away once you've introduced them. A new study published this week in The Lancet found that doctors who are given AI tools to assist with identifying potential cancer risks in patients get worse at making those same observations when they go back to doing it without AI's help.

The study looked at four endoscopy centers in Poland, tracking the success rates of detecting colon cancer for three months before AI tools were introduced and three months after. Once AI was introduced, colonoscopies were randomly assigned to either receive AI support or not. The researchers found that doctors who gave colonoscopies without AI after having its assistance available saw their detection rates drop, producing outcomes 20% worse than what they were before AI was introduced.

Making the results all the more troubling is the fact that the 19 doctors who participated in the study were all very experienced and had performed more than 2,000 colonoscopies each. If those doctors can fall prey to de-skilling, seeing their own abilities erode because of reliance on AI tools, the outcomes from inexperienced doctors could be even worse.

There is little doubt that AI tools can help in medical settings. There have been numerous studies that suggest that AI can facilitate everything from the detection of cancers to the diagnosis of illnesses based on a patient's medical history. Analyzing information based on a whole wealth of previous examples is kinda the bread and butter of AI (you know, as opposed to generating braindead content slop), and there is evidence that suggests that humans can augment their own abilities by using AI tools. Studies in medical settings have found that doctors who use these tools can produce better outcomes for their patients.

But no one, including doctors, is immune to the risk of shutting your brain off and relying on AI rather than their own skills. Earlier this year, Microsoft published a study that found knowledge workers who lean on AI stop thinking critically about the work they are doing and feel confident that the assistance from AI will be enough to get the job done. Researchers at MIT similarly found that relying on ChatGPT for essay writing resulted in less critical engagement with the material. In the long term, there's a real risk that reliance on AI will erode our ability to problem solve and reason, which is not ideal when AI continues to generate bad information.

The American Medical Association found that about two in three physicians have already adopted AI to augment their abilities. Hopefully, they're still able to identify when it does something like hallucinating a body part that doesn't exist.

Sophie Cousins

 August 13, 2025  

Japanese encephalitis virus continues to spread in Australia. It has been detected in the country's mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs, as well as in feral pigs and commercial piggeries in most states and territories. The virus has claimed two lives this year and has been detected in mosquitoes collected in Queensland's capital city, Brisbane, for the first time.

Japanese encephalitis virus was reported in regions of Australia for the first time in the summer of 2021-2022. At the time, experts described it as the “most significant local arbovirus emergency in almost 50 years.”

The outbreak, fueled by La Niña weather patterns, led Australia's acting chief medical officer to declare the outbreak a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance in March 2022. It resulted in 45 cases and 7 deaths.

“One of the most critical things now is that Australians realize that mosquitoes are not just an annoyance,” Cameron Webb, PhD, associate professor of medical sciences at the University of Sydney, Sydney, and medical entomologist at NSW Health Pathology, Newcastle, told Medscape Medical News. “In some parts of the country, they can kill you.”

Japanese encephalitis is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. It is spread through bites from mosquitoes (primarily Culex tritaeniorhynchus) that become infected after biting infected pigs and waterbirds.

Japanese encephalitis is endemic in more than 20 countries across Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Between 67,500 and 100,000 cases are reported every year.

While most cases are mild (resulting in fever and headache) or asymptomatic, about 1 in 250 infections result in severe illness. Among patients who become severely ill, the case fatality rate can be as high as 30%. Up to half of severely ill patients develop lifelong neurologic, behavioral, or cognitive problems. Most cases occur in children younger than 15 years.

Before 2021-2022, Japanese encephalitis virus was considered to be limited to the far north of Australia. It was first detected in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995 and on the mainland in 1998 in the Cape York Peninsula.

In the summer of 2021-2022, Japanese encephalitis virus was detected in commercial piggeries in southeastern Australia, highlighting the virus's changing epidemiology.

“Altered rainfall patterns and warmer temperatures affect mosquito breeding habitats and the distribution of reservoir hosts. These conditions can extend the mosquito season and expand the geographic range of mosquito vectors such as Culex species,” said Sarah McGuinness, MBBS, PhD, consultant physician in the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. McGuinness also is a senior research fellow at the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University in Melbourne.

“Urbanization also plays a role by creating peri-urban environments where humans, livestock, and wildlife interact more closely, increasing the risk of spillover.”

While experts anticipated the virus to return in the 2023-2024 summer season, it didn't return until 2024-25. Its detection in Australia's third largest city was cause for concern.

“The emergence of Japanese encephalitis in mainland Australia and its spread to the southeastern states has been extremely concerning, particularly in relation to the high number of human cases and the impacts on pig farming due to reproductive losses in sows caused by the virus,” David Williams, PhD, group leader of diagnostics and mammalian infectious disease research at The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, told Medscape Medical News.

“The finding that the virus has been circulating in Brisbane is particularly concerning, given the additional risks to more densely populated areas,” Williams added. “Is Japanese encephalitis being reintroduced into the southern states from northern Australia, or is it wintering somewhere in the ecosystem and then reemerging when mosquito numbers start increasing? I don't think we understand this yet…but unfortunately, I think we can expect further cases in Australia.”

Earlier this year, the World Health Organization released a technical brief on encephalitis (which many different pathogens can cause), stressing that it was a growing global concern “due to population density, intensive farming, climate change, vaccine hesitancy, and human-animal proximity.” It stressed the role that vaccination can play in preventing Japanese encephalitis.

Australia offers free vaccination for identified priority groups and patients living in certain local government areas deemed of concern. Risk areas are determined by state and territory health departments on the basis of surveillance data. Two vaccines are licensed in Australia. But while vaccination is available, public awareness is limited.

“There's a real opportunity for healthcare providers to help raise awareness among the general population and among travelers,” McGuinness said. “We're working to support these efforts by developing tools that facilitate conversations around Japanese encephalitis and vaccination.”

McGuinness and colleagues have developed a Japanese encephalitis vaccine decision aid, which helps individuals assess their personal risk and make informed decisions.

Continuing to raise public awareness is key, said Webb. “We're very lucky in that we are generally free of some of the serious mosquito-borne diseases that impact many countries, like malaria and dengue. But we need to remind the community that it's important to take extra measures in some parts of the country to avoid mosquito bites.”

“We need to make people aware of the cheap and effective ways to protect themselves, such as how they dress, how they spend time near bushlands, and [how they use] repellent.”

Besides providing vaccination, Australia has also strengthened its surveillance systems, which include mosquito trapping and enhanced diagnostic capacity. But as Williams explained, affected states were able to capitalize on arbovirus surveillance programs that already were in place for other diseases. They pivoted to incorporate Japanese encephalitis into their sampling and testing activities.

“There has also been extensive work to sample wild animal populations such as waterbirds and feral pigs to understand their roles in the ecology of Japanese encephalitis virus,” said Williams. While the involvement of waterbirds had been well established, it's unclear which other species are involved.

“Data and information sharing is another area that has been a focus across jurisdictions to make this more seamless,” Williams added. “[It is] inherently challenging but critical for decision-makers during outbreaks and for our broader understanding of the epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis across the nation…there's still much we don't know about Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia and much more research to do.”

Any information that can be gained will be helpful in filling in the gaps, Webb agreed. “The problem that we're facing is that everything we previously knew about these types of viruses has recently been upended,” he said. “For me, it's about thinking about how we can gather information to help professionals to make decisions by better understanding the parts of Australia at greater or lesser risk of regular activity of the virus.”

Webb, McGuinness, and Williams reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Scientists at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) have shown that 18FDG-PET, an imaging technique widely used to study other conditions, can also be used to monitor atherosclerosis by measuring cellular metabolism within arterial plaques. The findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, could improve the clinical management of this disease and accelerate the development of new treatments.

Atherosclerosis-the underlying cause of most heart attacks and strokes-is a silent disease that progresses over many years without symptoms. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of fatty deposits, cells, and other materials in the walls of arteries, where they reduce blood flow and can eventually rupture, triggering serious cardiovascular events. While treatments are available to slow disease progression, it is still difficult to determine if a treatment is working in individual patients.

18FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) is a nuclear imaging technique that uses a radioactively labeled glucose analog to detect tissue metabolic activity.

The new study demonstrates that the 18FDG-PET signal reflects the metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques, rather than merely indicating inflammation, as was previously believed.

To reach this conclusion, the research team developed an experimental model of advanced atherosclerosis in genetically modified animals and was able to partially reverse disease progression using a diet and drug-based intervention similar to strategies used in clinical care.

As the disease regressed, the 18FDG-PET signal declined in parallel with the reduced expression of genes linked to glucose metabolism in various plaque cell types, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and smooth muscle cells.

""The 18FDG-PET signal reflects the activity level of the cells within atherosclerotic lesions and can therefore serve as a sensitive tool for evaluating treatment efficacy and disease progression risk,"" explains CNIC researcher Paula Nogales, lead author of the study together with Jacob Bentzon, of Aarhus University (Denmark) and head of the Experimental Pathology of Atherosclerosis group at the CNIC.

This discovery opens the door to using a widely available hospital imaging technique to improve clinical monitoring of atherosclerosis and speed the development of new therapies for this silent but potentially deadly disease.

The study received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness (MEIC), with co-funding from the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, with FEDER/EU co-funding; the Madrid regional government; and the ""la Caixa"" Foundation (AtheroConvergence).

A new tool to understand how people imagine differently when reading could have potential implications for the treatment of mental ill health.

The ReaderBank Imagination Quiz has been developed by a team of researchers led by Durham University, UK.

The quiz identifies four ""forces"" of imagination - space and vision, voice and language, people models, and perspective.

These forces have strong and specific connections to mental imagery, immersion in a story, daydreaming, and intrusive thoughts.

This shows the complexity of people's reading minds and what the researchers say is a radical diversity of imagination skills.

The researchers add that understanding how different people respond to reading could provide a greater insight into how their imaginations work.

This could eventually allow for mental health therapies to be better adapted to the individual.

The ReaderBank findings are being presented today (Wednesday 13 August 2025) at the Edinburgh International Book Festival.

The team stressed that this is an early study and that they hope to do more research to develop the ReaderBank Imagination Quiz as a tool that could enhance and supplement mental ill health treatments.

The diversity of imagination is about multiple senses, how we engage with and understand others and how we're not always aware when we're building imaginative worlds whilst reading.

This is relevant when we start thinking about mental health, because there are lots of aspects of mental health which are all about thoughts, memories, and ideas coming to us, that we can't control.

Lots of psychotherapy methods rely on the imagination, but we never screen people for what kind of imagination they have.

This tool, which is nominally about reading, is about offering a window on that diversity of imagination.

Our end goal is thinking how can we use these sorts of tools to inform more precise, more detailed pictures of how psychotherapy is going to work?""

Ben Alderson-Day, Lead Author, Professor of the Institute for Medical Humanities and Department of Psychology, Durham University

The ReaderBank Imagination Quiz stems from ReaderBank – an ambitious attempt to use reading and book festivals to study the imagination and mental health in new ways.

The project is a collaboration between Durham University and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.

Researchers quizzed 867 people on their reading experiences across two Edinburgh International Book Festivals in 2023 and 2024. A third group took part online.

Participants were 18 or over, had read a fiction book in the last six months, and were fluent in English.

They completed questions about reading habits, including how much and how frequently they read books, preferred types of books or e-books, and most read genres.

Other questions were aimed at how people visualised what they were reading, such as faces and scenes, and how they experienced inner speech or physical and sensory feelings.

The quiz also looked at how conscious readers were of what they were reading and the impact this had on them.

They found a ""radical diversity of imagination skills"". The researchers say that understanding this range of imagination could be used to refine treatments for similar traits in mental ill health.

ReaderBank will be continuing this year at Edinburgh with a new series of studies and a focus on ""Repair"", the theme of the book festival. People can take part at www.readerbank.org.

Dr Wajid Khan, Head of Research at Southwest Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""These research findings shine new light on the role the imagination and creativity can play in helping build, maintain and change cognitive schemas and wider psychological processes. 

""ReaderBank has far-reaching implications for the way we manage recovery and resilience in clinical mental health services.""

The research team included experts from Durham University's Department of English Studies and the National Poetry Centre in Leeds. The work was supported by the Discovery Research Platform for Medical Humanities and funded by Wellcome.

Jenny Niven, Director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said: ""We are delighted be a partner on Durham University's ReaderBank project.

""The Book Festival is a site for collaboration, innovation and creativity, and working with the ReaderBank team and our audiences over the last couple of years has given us a fascinating insight into our diverse audience of curious readers, and the different ways we engage with fiction.

""The team at the Book Festival is so excited to see how this might inform festivals in years to come.""

			By Justin Kroll, Anthony D'Alessandro 


Refresh for updates…Hours after the Skydance-Paramount merger closed last Thursday, the new studio leadership group led by co-Chairs Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg ( who also serve as Vice Chair of Platforms, and Chair of Paramount Television, respectively) a loud message to the town that they meant business, closing a deal for the hot Timothee Chalamet-James Mangold package High Side, which Deadline first told you about.


	It was a bold move and a bolt of energy that told the town that Paramount 2.0 wasn't looking to cut back on its upcoming feature slate, rather make on the promises made during merger talks. All of this was underscored this afternoon at an LA presser for the new Paramount. 

	











	Said Paramount's new CEO David Ellison at today's presser, “One of our biggest priorities is restoring Paramount as the No. 1 studio for filmmakers and talent in the world. Great filmmakers make great movies. For us, we're going to strategically scale the amount of content for our streaming service as well s studios.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The new entertainment conglom, which prevented a further collapsing of the motion pictures studios, even had No. 1 exhibition boss, AMC's Adam Aron, giddy on an earnings call Monday about the prospects for more movies on the big screen. Paramount in recent years has averaged 11 to 14 feature films. Greenstein at today's Paramount-Skydance presser said that the goal is for 15 movies a year asap, followed by 20 movies a year in the near future. 


	“Paramount has been cash hampered in recent years, which has caused them to greenlight fewer movies than they might have liked to. It appears to us that Skydance is cash rich, and it would be our expectation that Skydance will be releasing more movies coming out of Paramount than Paramount has been releasing in recent years,” said Aron. 


	While High Side is still a ways off, the new top feature brass, which also includes President Don Granger,  has plenty of projects to dive into as they get settled into their new office space on the Melrose lot. From high-profile franchises that have a been at the center of their release schedules for decades to new original stories featuring A-list talent, below is a list of where things stand on several properties that could help build the future slate.

	











	While it might seem like a high jump for the new administration to succeed, particularly at a studio which lost Marvel to Disney in 2009, it's only recently that Paramount saw some of its best grosses in more than a decade in 2022 when Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise's highest grossing movie ever, and technically Paramount's a global level, rallied their annual grosses to $1.29 billion domestic, and $2.6 billion global. And Ellison's Skydance had a tremendous amount to do with that success having co-financed 50% of Top Gun: Maverick. No doubt making Top Gun 3 a reality will be a prime to-do for Greenstein, Goldberg and Granger. 


	Other musts for Greenstein and Goldberg as expressed this afternoon are four quadrant family movies and R-rated comedies. 


	Speaking of co-financing, what happens now that the studio's biggest co-financer is now the owner? Sources tell us that the plan is for the new Paramount on future big tentpoles ala Star Trek and Top Gun is to keep the upside completely. Any slate co-financing is bound to happen on the mid-sized budget movies that have risk potential. 


	President Jeff Shell, who was known as being a proponent of window crunching during his run at NBCUniversal, he'll continue to look at maximizing theatrical window value at the new Paramount. However, Chair of Direct to Consumer, Cindy Holland emphasized, “Made for streaming movies aren't a priority for me.” 


	The previous Brian Robbins' led regime leaves behind a trove of high-end talent production deals for the new C-suite to tap, i.e. Ryan Reynolds, Damien Chazelle, Krasinski, the genre label 18hz led by Walter Hamada which as the movie Primate upcoming, and Smile producer Temple Hill. 


	While High Side marked the first major package the studio purchased, when it comes to the first films to go into production, sources say its too early to say given that no greenlights have been given as the top brass gets settled. That said, insiders say films like The Rescue with 1923‘s Brandon Sklenar in talks to star has a strong chance given the ties the project has to the current regime.


	Another high priority for the Skydance owned Paramount, is Star Trek which Ellison has been involved with since the 2013 sequel Star Trek Into Darkness. 


	“Star Trek is a priority across the company,” said Goldberg. 


	As for right now they are developing a film that includes brand new characters that Andor director Toby Haynes is on board to direct with Seth Grahame Smith writing and Simon Kinberg and J.J. Abrams producing. They also have another installment with Captain Kirk, Spock and the rest of usual characters returning that also has Abrams producing and Steve Yockey writing.


	The one project the studio is sure to have an eye is what to do with the next installment in the Top Gun franchise after the sequel blew box-office records. “Top Gun is a priority for us,” said Goldberg Though it has not been formally announced, news broke in 2023 that Ehren Krueger had begun working on a script for the next film. Star and producer Tom Cruise has focused on the most recent Mission: Impossible films not much has moved forward on the film. Now that Cruise is off those projects and looking for what his next film could be, don't be surprised if movement starts to pic up on this property.


	On the Transformers front, the franchise saw a rebooted live-action film, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts ($442M global box office) starring Anthony Ramos in 2023 and an animated pic, Transformers One, bow last year. Prior to sale, the studio had three separate scripts in development including one version that sources say has Michael Bay returning to the franchise. Those scripts should be ready for new leadership to take a look at shortly.

	











	The most recent high-profile franchise to get a release date for its next installment was A Quiet Place Part III, which the studio recently dated for summer 2027. John Krasinski is back to write and direct though no cast is attached at this time.


	Following the success of the animated pic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutan Mayhem, the studio had moved fast on a sequel, dating the next film for Sept. 17, 2027. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are back to produce with Jeff Rowe, Kyler Spears and Yashar Kassai directing. They also have a live-action version based on the graphic novel that has Walter Hamada producing.


	Some of the other titles include the Olympic pic, Winter Games, starring Miles Teller and Hailee Steinfeld, a Ferris Bueller spin-off and prior to the merger, the studio had been developing Sam & Victor's Day Off, most recently hiring Ben Zazove and Evan Turner for a rewrite, and What Kids Want, with Bill Holderman and Erin Simms attached to rewrite the script and direct. 


	There are also a number of Skydance development titles coming over which include The Rescue, an Untitled John Tuggle film starring Superman star David Corenswet, a film based on the Mike Hammer books starring Matthew McConaughey with Nic Pizzolatto writing and The Traveler, with Lee Isaac Chung attached to direct. While not confirmed at this time it is fair to say that these Skydance priority pics will now become priority projects at Paramount.

Roofman  – Oct. 10


Regretting You – Oct. 24

Noah Hawley stewed on an Alien spinoff years before FX even secured the rights. Now, “Alien: Earth” jumps to the small screen with all the eerie essentials of the Ridley Scott sci-fi classic: dread-soaked atmospheres, spine-tingling suspense, and, of course, those horrifying acid-blooded freaks. But this time, the Emmy-winning creator carved out a bold new nightmare that exists in parallel rather than a continuation of the film franchise. For production designer Andy Nicholson, it meant diving headfirst into the archives to craft fresh, striking motifs that didn't just nod to the past but expanded the iconic universe. The goal? To make it feel unmistakably Alien with a few surprises lurking in the shadows – all this while shooting in Thailand.

“Noah is a very experienced showrunner and has a great mind to kick ideas around with, which for someone like me is very refreshing,” Nicholson told IndieWire, who teamed with designer Jason Knox-Johnston to create the eight-episode haunt. His first question to Hawley was where, in the canon, visually and texturally, did the story take place? “What we both really liked was the vision of the future that the makers of ‘Alien' had in 1979,” the production designer said. “That gave me a lot to play with because there were three principal jobs in this show. The Maginot, Prodigy City, and Neverland.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






For the story, chaos erupts after the USCSS Maginot, a Weyland-Yutani research ship, crash-lands in Prodigy City on Neverland, a research island founded by Prodigy Corp's Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin). The two clash over the ship's not-so-friendly cargo. Team Wey-Yu is led by a terminator-like cyborg, Morrow (Babou Ceesay), while Team Kavalier features a group of hybrids (synthetics with human consciousness) led by the insatiably curious Wendy (Sydney Chandler).

With Maginot, Nicholson took note of the Wey-Yu-owned USCSS Nostromo, which first appeared in the original film and then later in “Alien: Romulus” as wreckage. “That ship remains a benchmark as a spaceship interior, and I believe at the time, elevated the art form of production design in terms of what it brought to it,” he said. “Noah and I talked about what we really liked on the inside of Nostromo that would be good for Maginot.” 

Nicholson studied the iconic ship frame by frame as few blueprints existed, working out set size and what details he should recreate and which to magnify. The result has Maginot boasting dark, industrial interiors and a peppering of futuristic flavor. Its utilitarian bridge hums with flickering monitors, exposed wires, and analog tech – tactile consoles fill the space. The most alluring: an escape room decked out with hundreds of small yellow lights and old-school monitors, a beacon of hope for those who can make it inside. 

 










“There's a lovely period of European car interior and furniture design from the late ‘70s and ‘80s, which you can feel in ‘Alien' and a little bit less in ‘Aliens.' We were inspired by that but expanded it to include Noah's ideas about the future look,” Nicholson said. Maginot's exterior took on a new shape, inspired by the USS Sulaco from “Alien” with engine details nodding to the Nostromo as Easter eggs for fans.

Creating the aftermath of Maginot's wreckage in Prodigy City was another feat. “Because of the schedule, we had to build crashed versions of some of the interiors first. Usually, you don't do this because it's inefficient, but because we were shooting the scripts in episode order, we had to build damaged versions of the bridge, cyro chamber, and parts of a corridor,” Nicholson said.  

It meant the team had to construct sets that could be easily swapped. For instance, the cryo chamber was designed with a collapsible ceiling. And one of the smashed corridors was made out of sections so it could be raised high in the air to mimic the same angle of the crashed aircraft. While most interior work, damaged or not, was constructed on soundstages, a sequence where Prodigy soldiers enter the ship through a hole in its hull was created on location. 

 










“That scene was all practically shot in Bangkok,” Nicholson said. “We found an empty shopping mall completely derelict. In the middle of it was a five-story atrium, so we built a 40-foot by 30-foot section of the Maginot on an angle and the outside of the hull on the shopping mall. Then we bridged the gap with a twisted beam. So that whole first entry into the ship had very minimal set extension, only to give it a bit of depth for low and high shots.”

Prodigy City and Neverland was inspired by Thailand's lush environment and architecture. “With an episodic, the audience needs to know on a very basic level exactly where they are when you jump from one scene to another. You need to know you're in different parts of Neverland and that it's different from the Maginot,” Nicholson explained. “So when I started to think about what Neverland should look like, the amount of concrete that was in Bangkok made it an interesting city. There's some lovely brutalist architecture which is quite remarkable, thinking this could be a good look for some of Neverland.” 

The main street of Prodigy City was found near their production offices, distinguishing itself by its abandoned stores and natural patina. Adding to the look was the work of graphic designer Neville Brody. “He did a lot of seminal pieces of the 1980s. It's that lovely period in graphic design when everything was mainly letter set and wasn't just done on a computer. I looked at his style and used that for a lot of the street signs and shop signs. It just felt like it worked for the location,” Nicholson said.

 










For Prodigy Corporation, Nicholson sought a building that had scale that didn't rely on being a massive visual effects backdrop. “If you notice shots of Prodigy airships landing, there are elements that poke out from the jungle,” Nicholson said. “The idea of that is when you're shooting on the ground, you can put a very recognizable silhouette in the background that lets you know we're somewhere outside Neverland without having to see the big buildings.”  

Interiors were designed to be multifunctional, while others, like the main lab, stood alone. Large air vents hinted at Prodigy Corp's lax security, perfect for lurking aliens. Even Boy Cavalier's sleek office wasn't spared. “Not having rooms that were safe for anybody to be in helps amplify the threat,” Nicholson said. “So we made corridors you can never quite see around the corner, and all the windows are frosted so you don't quite know what's waiting on the other side.” 

The lab holding the alien life hostage was designed with a muted color palette and tone. “We wanted the people and the creatures to stand out from the background,” Nicholson said. “There's a fiberglass finish with vinyl flooring in the corridors, so nothing was popping too much.”

 










Opposite, Wey-Yu Corp makes only a brief appearance in the series. One such instance is a sequence involving a phone call that was shot at Bangkok's Park Origin Thonglor Complex, which sustained substantial damage following a massive earthquake in March 2025. (Filming began in July 2023 with a touch over 120 shooting days, including areas of Phuket, Phang Nga, Surat Thani, Krabi, and the soundstage at The Studio Park in Samut Prakan.)

Transforming imagination into immersive nightmare fuel allowed the Thai set dressing team to flex their expertise. “They were able to bring back things that were so perfect that you wouldn't be able to find in the UK or America. Stuff you need to recreate the things used to such great effect by Michael Seymour and Roger Christian on the original film,” Nicholson said. “We weren't trying to copy what they were doing, but be inspired by that, and they should get credit for that.” The entire “Alien: Earth” production team should get credit, too, for expanding on Seymour's and Christian's work in the original, hopefully in a way that they — if not exactly Wey-Yu Corp — would approve. 

“Alien: Earth” premieres August 12 on FX with new episodes weekly.
