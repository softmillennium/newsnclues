                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are banking in a big way on California and its governor, Gavin Newsom, to help them fight back against Republicans in a burgeoning gerrymandering arms race. Texas Democrats are reportedly considering ending their walkout, which was intended to prevent the Texas GOP's power grab but never really stood a chance of halting new GOP-friendly maps. That puts even more focus on Newsom, who signaled late Tuesday that he's now pressing forward with his effort to redraw California's maps to retaliate against Texas Republicans' effort. California provides Democrats' best opportunity to retaliate against Texas Republicans' extraordinary effort to gerrymander a more Republican congressional map in the middle of the decade. One is that California could feasibly offset five new Republican districts in Texas with five new Democratic-leaning ones of their own. Democrats are clearly hoping this threat at least gives Republicans pause. But what if Democrats and Newsom actually follow through? That's where history suggests things could get messy. The problem for them is that, unlike Texas Republicans, they need to jump through more hoops to make this happen. Newsom is expressing confidence that it will pass. “I think the voters will approve it. But the trick here is somehow getting voters to back a more politicized redistricting process – to effectively vote in favor of gerrymandering. And that's something they've been reluctant to do, including in California. More than a dozen states have put redistricting commissions on the ballot in recent decades, and voters have supported them about two-thirds of the time, according to Ballotpedia. When they've rejected them, it's generally been in red states rather than blue ones like California. The most recent vote on such a commission came last year, in Ohio. A late poll that asked about the commission in a more neutral way showed voters supported the idea by 23 points, 57%-34% – right before they rejected the actual measure by 8 points, 54%-46%. Of course, California voters wouldn't be asked to install a new redistricting commission; they'd be asked to get rid of one. Indeed, California voters have already rejected such an effort by a wide margin, back in 2010. California voters had narrowly approved a redistricting commission in 2008, and the 2010 ballot featured a measure to repeal that ballot measure, Proposition 27. The dynamics today are clearly at least somewhat different. Newsom seems to believe left-leaning voters can be convinced that turnabout is fair play and that Texas' gambit is worth re-politicizing the process in California. But that could be a difficult trick, particularly given how tuned-out Americans generally are on redistricting. Huge majorities dislike gerrymandering, but polls also suggest they don't follow it too closely. How many California voters who like the idea of a more independent redistricting process are going to understand the situation in Texas well enough and conclude they should scrap that principle in the name of political expediency? This is his big play on the national stage right now. He's making a huge show of it, including trolling President Donald Trump and Republicans with some very Trump-esque missives on social media on Tuesday night. But imagine a situation in which the voters don't go along with it and reject the ballot measure. That would be a huge setback for the perception of Newsom's political prowess as he gears up for what many believe is likely to be a 2028 presidential campaign. Such a failure would also likely embolden other Republican-controlled states to press forward in the gerrymandering arms race, knowing that Democrats can't really fight back. Newsom seems confident he can make it happen. But as mentioned, Democrats don't have a lot of great options to try to fight back against Texas Republicans' gambit. It's just the something is very complicated – and would provide a real test for Newsom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. An investigation conducted by Sen. Jon Ossoff's office (D-Georgia) has revealed rampant human rights violations committed against immigrants in detention in the first six months of President Donald Trump's second term, including dozens of incidents involving the mistreatment of children and pregnant women. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. They spoke with 46 people in detention and conducted numerous site visits, although “obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees.” “For DHS to immediately issue a blanket denial without any due-diligence or investigations of these credible reports of human rights abuses in U.S. facilities, is absurd,” Ossoff said. In another case, a family was arrested and detained on their way to an emergency medical appointment for their daughter who was recovering from brain surgery. The government also deported a 4-year-old who was receiving treatment for kidney cancer. In April, immigration officers abducted the child and his sister, who are both U.S. citizens, along with their mother when they arrived for an immigration appointment. One anonymous agency official reported “seeing pregnant women sleeping on floors in overcrowded intake cells.” The woman bled for days before she was taken to the hospital, where “she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.” DHS denied reports of pregnant women sleeping on the floor without providing evidence and insisted that detention of pregnant women is “rare.” Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, told NBC News that she met with the woman, who was 23 years old and had been living in Georgia. The woman told Yoon that she had experienced and witnessed “terrible conditions,” including, NBC News reported, “overcrowding, people forced to sleep on the floor, inadequate access to nutrition and medical care, as well as abusive treatment by the guards, lack of information about their case and limited ability to contact their loved ones and legal support.” The senator's investigation also uncovered numerous allegations of physical and sexual abuse against immigrants. There were at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California “referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults,” and at least four emergency calls from the South Texas ICE Processing Center referenced sexual abuse. Victims held at Miami's Federal Detention Center, which is run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), said they were held in a “small room” for “hours on end,” with just one toilet, and no access to food or water, according to the report. Pursuant to an agreement between DHS and BOP), which runs the federal prison system, immigrants can be detained in BOP's prisons if DHS lockups are full.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High-profile Western lawyers have joined the defense team of the jailed Euroskeptic head of Moldova's autonomous Gagauzia region, Evgenia Gutsul, who was sentenced to seven years in prison for alleged financial crimes that she claims are politically motivated. Paris-based law firm WJ Avocats and prominent Spanish lawyer Gonzalo Boye have been appointed to Gutsul's international defense team, according to a statement on Wednesday by WJ Avocats' founding partner William Julie. WJ Avocats specializes in international criminal defense and human rights, while Boye has taken on high-profile cases such as efforts to charge George W. Bush officials over the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo and the defense of former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont from extradition. They will work with Gutsul's local lawyers. Boye has called the case “very worrying.” Gutsul was sentenced last week by a Chisinau court for allegedly financing the now-banned Euroskeptic SOR party – a charge she insists is part of a broader effort to silence dissent ahead of elections. Julie said Gutsul has faced political attacks since taking office, calling the case another attempt to “silence and remove” her from politics. He said her international legal team will work to defend her “fundamental rights and the rule of law.” Russia has condemned what it described as a crackdown by the Moldovan government on Gutsul, calling it an example of “European anti-values in action” and a bid to pressure the opposition ahead of the country's September parliamentary election.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some experts tee up public comment on EPA report calling fossil fuel concerns overblown, as others fast-track review Veteran climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public comment to a US Department of Energy (DOE) report that cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the climate crisis. The report, published late last month, claimed concerns about planet-warming fossil fuels are overblown, sparking widespread concern from scientists who said it was full of climate misinformation; it was an attempt to support a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to undo the “endangerment finding”, which forms the legal basis of virtually all US climate regulations. “Experts can identify technical errors, highlight overlooked data, and clarify uncertainties in ways that improve the accuracy and robustness of the final policy or report.” The response comes as part of a broader wave of experts' attempts to uphold established climate science as the Trump administration promotes contrarian and unproven viewpoints. “It is critical that federal policymaking is informed by the best available scientific evidence,” said Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, in a statement. In earlier weeks, federal officials have also deleted key climate data and reports such as the national climate assessments and the US Global Change Research Program from government websites. “Attacks on science are dangerous because they erode one of society's most effective tools for understanding the world and making decisions in the public interest,” said Dessler. Asked for comment about the Nasem review, an EPA spokesperson repeated a comment offered earlier this month: “Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.” “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous presidential administrations,” he said. The UN and the US have regularly convened top scientists to produce scientific climate reports, which warn that urgent action to curb emissions is needed. Dietderich also said officials “look forward to engaging with substantive comments” on the report. However, “the real question is whether they'll listen to us”, said Dessler.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The union issued a strike notice on Tuesday after it submitted a counter proposal on wages that Air Canada did not respond to, says CUPE spokesperson Hugh Pouliot.Arlyn McAdorey/The Canadian Press Air Canada AC-T will begin cancelling flights on Thursday ahead of a planned nationwide strike of flight attendants, after talks between the union representing them and the carrier broke down late Monday evening. The Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) issued a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday morning, meaning that more than 10,000 flight attendants at Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge could go on strike starting Saturday. Air Canada said that in order to manage the uncertainty ahead of a heavy travel period, the first flights will be cancelled on Thursday, with more on Friday, and a complete suspension of all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations on Saturday if a deal between both sides is not reached by then. Explainer: Air Canada starts cancelling flights ahead of possible flight attendant strike. Customers whose flights are cancelled will be notified, and will be eligible for a full refund, the airline said in a statement. But Ottawa has so far been reluctant to step in. In a statement issued late Tuesday evening, Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said that both parties should stay at the table until a deal is reached. CUPE spokesperson Hugh Pouliot said that the union had submitted a counterproposal on wages on Tuesday evening, but Air Canada did not respond, forcing the union to issue a strike notice. Earlier: Air Canada labour talks break down hours before strike notice deadline We are just waiting for Air Canada to respond,” Mr. Pouliot told the Globe. The compounded rate of inflation in Canada from 2015 to 2025 is almost 28 per cent. Hundreds of Air Canada flight attendants picket at Toronto Pearson Airport on Monday.Sammy Kogan/The Globe and Mail The other key point of contention between both sides is unpaid work. CUPE is demanding that Air Canada start paying flight attendants for the work they do on the ground prior to departure and after landing. “The postpandemic environment for flight attendants has become increasingly exploitative because they are not being paid for ground time,” said Steven Tufts, a labour expert at York University. Prof. Tufts said that CUPE's push to restructure the compensation system for flight attendants is part of a broader global movement among airline unions for flight attendants to start being paid for the entirety of their shift. “If Air Canada does agree to change the terms of compensation, you'll likely see Air Transat and WestJet flight attendants get paid similarly. And that will spill over into the larger American airlines,” he added. In 2022, in an attempt to dissuade flight attendants from unionizing, Delta Air Lines started paying flight attendants at half their hourly rate for 40 to 50 minutes of boarding time. Porter Airlines also started compensating flight attendants for portions of their pre-departure work this year. Shanyn Elliott, a flight attendant who has worked for Air Canada Rouge since 2017, said that her pre-departure work is crucial because it involves safety briefings with the pilot and a check of safety equipment at each seat on the plane. “We also assist passengers with disabilities, help people find their seats, grab water for passengers – the entire time we are not getting paid.” she said. Ms. Elliott also said that flight attendants vie to get assigned what they term “productive turns,” which are shifts that have longer in-air flight times because it means they are paid more on an hourly basis if the entirety of their shift is considered. “If I do a Toronto-Montreal return trip, I'm only in the air for maybe two hours, but my total time working might be six hours. How is it fair that I only get paid for two hours?” A backgrounder on Air Canada's website detailing flight attendant compensation states that the starting salary for a flight attendant hired in 2015 was $25.13 an hour. If the flight attendant continued working in the same position for a decade, their current pay would be $63.07 an hour – a 150-per-cent increase. The document also states that half of Air Canada's flight attendants earned more than $54,000 in 2024, excluding incentive rewards, and health and pension benefits.

Whale sharks have a broad, flat head and are typically brown or gray in color. Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日） https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang Whale shark reproduction has long been a mystery for scientists. However, a significant discovery in 1995 off the eastern coast of Taiwan provided valuable insights. Researchers examined a pregnant female of the species and found over 300 embryos inside her body, ranging from about 40 to 60 cm in length. This discovery revealed that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. Instead of laying eggs in the ocean, the mother carries them internally until they hatch, giving birth to fully developed live young. Since the eggs don't hatch all at once, embryos at different stages of development can all exist within The third-hottest July worldwide ended a string of record-breaking temperatures last month, but many regions were still devastated by extreme weather amplified by global warming, the European climate monitoring service said Thursday last week. “Two years after the hottest July on record, the recent streak of global temperature records is over,” Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The leadership of the European Commission is aiming to achieve regime change in Budapest, which Brussels perceives as an obstacle to a "united Europe," as follows from a statement by the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), received by TASS. "The European Commission is aiming for a change of power in Hungary," the press release reads. "The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation informs that, according to the information coming to the SVR, the European Commission perceives Hungary's current leadership as an increasingly serious obstacle to a united Europe." The press bureau noted that "Brussels is outraged by the attempts of Budapest to pursue independent policy and influence collective decision-making, primarily on Russia and Ukraine." "Hungary's recent decision to veto the new seven-year EU budget project, which Budapest believes is designed for the militarization of Europe and preparation for war with Moscow, has become the last straw that made the euro-bureaucrats lose their patience," the SVR added. According to the SVR, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is seriously studying Hungary's regime change scenarios. "The European Commission expects to bring him to power in the parliamentary elections in the spring of 2026, "if not sooner." The SVR drew attention to the fact that "significant material, administrative, media, and lobbying resources have been mobilized to support Magyar. German party funds, a number of Norwegian human rights NGOs, as well as the European People's Party (EPP) are ready to provide financial support." "Kiev, ‘offended' by Budapest's blocking of Ukraine's EU integration process, has actively joined the campaign to ‘dismantle' the Hungarian government on orders from Brussels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Berlin on Aug. 13 to meet German Chancellor Friedrich Merz before talks with U.S. and European leaders. Zelensky and Merz will hold a bilateral meeting before joining a video conference with European leaders, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and U.S. President Donald Trump, spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov has said. The German government said the call between Zelensky, Trump, and European leaders is expected to take place at 2 p.m. local time, according to Reuters. A separate call with Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and European leaders is expected an hour later, according to the news agency. He has said both Kyiv and Moscow would need to cede territory to reach a deal, a stance that has alarmed European capitals and Kyiv. An undisclosed source familiar with U.S. deliberations told Reuters that it is possible that Trump might attempt to strike a deal directly with Putin without involving Ukraine or Europe. In a press conference on Aug. 11, Trump confirmed Zelensky would not attend the Alaska meeting with Putin, saying "he wasn't part of it." Trump added that he ultimately intends to bring the Ukrainian and Russian presidents together, either with him present or not. Zelensky has rejected recognizing the Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory and ceding additional land, calling for a ceasefire as the first step toward peace negotiations, a position supported by Kyiv's European allies. According to Reuters, the sequence of talks on Aug. 13 will give Zelensky and European leaders a chance to present a united front before Trump's meeting with Putin. Zelensky said he has held over 30 consultations with international partners over the past few days to discuss perspectives on ending the war. "Pressure must be exerted on Russia for the sake of a just peace. Ukraine's and our partners' experience must be used to prevent deception by Russia," he said on X. Our coordinated efforts and joint actions – of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, and all countries that seek peace – can definitely compel Russia to make peace." Five undisclosed senior European officials told Reuters that they "see a risk" of an unfavourable deal for Europe and Ukraine's security at the Aug. 15 meeting. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. The Kremlin planned to enlist 343,000 people in 2025 and has already fulfilled over 60% of that goal, Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy head of Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR), said. Shahed-type drones, originally designed in Iran, have become a key element of Moscow's long-range strike arsenal against Ukraine, frequently used to target cities, infrastructure, and energy facilities. The Kyiv Independent's Kollen Post sits down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and political scientist, to discuss the upcoming high-level talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Aug. 15 in Alaska, as well as both sides' strategies for the meeting. "It is regrettable to watch the Georgian authorities grovel before Moscow and disregard the principles of dignity and independence that have historically characterized the Georgian nation," Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Switzerland extended its sanctions lists to align with the EU's 18th package against Russia, specifically targeting Moscow's largest budget revenue source – oil exports, the Swiss government said. "The head of state demands that we must be ready for all possible scenarios," Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said. "Russia is unlikely to abandon the use of strategic aviation or large-scale drone deployments," Mykhailo Podolyak told Corriere della Sera. "However, Ukraine is ready to discuss and consider this scenario," he added. When war rages on the front line — with trenches, tanks, drones, and rockets — it is visible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Before serving as Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology on the U.S. National Security Council in the Biden administration, she spent over a decade in various leadership roles at the U.S. National Security Agency. American companies are world leaders in technology—be it innovative software, cloud services, artificial intelligence, or cybersecurity products. The attack, dubbed “Salt Typhoon,” constituted a large part of a global campaign against telecoms, and it penetrated systems at many U.S. carriers so thoroughly that officials will almost certainly never know the full scope of the capabilities China achieved to spy on Americans' communications. Salt Typhoon was more than a one-off intelligence success for China. Every hospital, power grid, pipeline, water treatment plant, and telecommunications system is on the frontlines, and most of the United States' critical infrastructure is unready for battle. Chinese malware has been discovered embedded in U.S. energy, water, pipeline, and transportation systems. During a future crisis, China could use these pre-positioned capacities to delay military mobilizations, impede air traffic control systems, or cause cascading power outages. American values forbid the kind of comprehensive monitoring that undergirds China's cyberdefense and frees Beijing to pursue offensive operations with less fear of retaliation. And myriad private actors manage the United States' critical infrastructure, with minimal government oversight or hands-on assistance. Their levels of investment in cybersecurity are variable, driven by commercial bottom lines. Even when their removal appears certain, it is likely they will return. In the past several years, Russia and Iran have disrupted the operations of U.S. water systems in multiple states, and hackers mostly based in Russia have played havoc with the workings of hundreds of American hospitals. Washington can—and must—do much more to protect the United States' critical infrastructure and deter Chinese attacks. Washington must establish a new cyber-deterrence policy built on the principle that robust cyberdefense enables credible cyberoffense. Artificial intelligence offers the key to making this new deterrence policy feasible. The United States should leverage its AI expertise by mounting a national effort to use AI to model its sprawling network of critical infrastructure, identify the most important vulnerabilities, and fix them. Washington must also ensure that it has the offensive cyber-capabilities to deter China. And it must make its messaging about cyberattacks more coherent, clarifying that pre-positioning in specific kinds of infrastructure constitutes a redline and carefully signaling its capacity to retaliate. By developing AI-powered defenses and investing more tactically in offensive capabilities, the United States can transform an inadequate cyber strategy into proactive deterrence. The attackers then used computers, servers, routers, and other devices they had compromised to move across different companies' networks and find the most rewarding spying positions. The Chinese government feared the Internet's potential to enable free expression and, as is natural for an authoritarian regime, opted to restrict it. Outside observers still often describe this so-called Great Firewall as a domestic censorship project. As well as screening for subversive speech, the Great Firewall's technologies can identify malicious code before it reaches critical systems, providing Beijing with tools to defend against cyberattacks. As a consequence, Chinese water treatment plants, power grids, telecommunications networks, and other critical systems operate with layers of protection that most U.S. systems lack. If foreign hackers attempt to penetrate Chinese infrastructure, they may encounter not only their target's specific defenses but the Chinese government's integrated monitoring capabilities. Unlike in China, where critical infrastructure operates under direct state control, American systems are owned by thousands of private companies with varying cybersecurity capabilities and threat awareness. A small-town water treatment plant in Ohio, for example, operates with the cyber-protections it can afford—which often means vulnerable software, default passwords, and outdated systems that are easily hacked. And the U.S. government is legally prohibited from monitoring many of these companies' networks for threats without their explicit consent, to avoid transgressing the constitutional ban on governmental “search and seizure” of private communications. So the United States came to rely on a patchwork approach to digitally securing its most crucial infrastructure: companies that own and operate America's most sensitive systems, such as power grids, are responsible for securing them with limited government oversight. This gap in defense enabled China to develop offensive capabilities with less fear of retaliation. China has integrated these capabilities into its broader military doctrine of “active defense,” or the principle that the best defense involves striking first to prevent enemy action. China and the United States first engaged diplomatically on cyber-espionage in 2015, when U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping brokered an agreement proscribing the theft of intellectual property by hackers for commercial gain, but China soon breached the agreement. The first Trump administration, which took over in 2017, favored taking enforcement actions over engaging diplomatically: for instance, in March 2018, it released indictments and sanctions against hackers linked to Beijing who had stolen proprietary data from U.S. companies and government agencies. After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, his administration initiated regular high-level diplomatic engagement with China to manage the strategic competition between the two great powers, including in cyberspace. For instance, Biden extracted a promise from Xi that China would not interfere in the 2024 U.S. elections. But the Biden administration also realized that China's offensive cyber-campaigns were intensifying. China's cyber-operations have become a clear threat to U.S. national security. Intrusions have been discovered in water infrastructure, power grids, and other critical systems across the American mainland. These attacks follow a consistent pattern: the intruders gain administrative access to supervisory control systems, establish the capacity to maintain that access over time, and then remain dormant while keeping the ability to activate malicious code on command. Water treatment plants serve essential civilian needs while also supporting military installations. Power grids enable everything from hospital operations to ammunition production. Telecommunications networks support both civilian communications and military command systems. By pre-positioning cyber­attack tools in these dual-use systems, China is readying itself to impose significant civilian costs while degrading the U.S. military's effectiveness. During a crisis over Taiwan, for instance, these capabilities could prove decisive. Imagine the dilemma facing American leaders if China could credibly threaten to delay military mobilization by disrupting U.S. rail networks or to trigger power failures across the Eastern Seaboard. U.S. military bases depend on surrounding civilian infrastructure for power, water, and communications. Chinese military theorists explicitly embrace this logic, describing offensive cyber-operations as a form of “strategic deterrence.” More than most conventional forms of deterrence, cyber-­operations offer plausible deniability. China can threaten civilian infrastructure while maintaining that any disruptions might result from the targeted country's own system failures rather than a deliberate attack. That deniability has made traditional diplomacy a weak tool to manage cyberwarfare. The Biden administration used emergency authorities to impose new minimum cybersecurity requirements on pipelines, rail systems, airports, and water utilities, overcoming decades of bipartisan resistance to mandating private-sector security standards. And they allowed government regulators such as the Transportation Security Administration, which regulates pipelines, to periodically inspect infrastructure owners' cyberdefenses and offer guidance. Although this represented an important step, even these enhanced requirements cannot match Beijing's direct monitoring of equivalent networks in China. Biden mandated that U.S. pipelines, water systems, rail networks, and health-care industry firms report cyber-incidents to the government, but only after they occur; Chinese authorities can monitor their systems in real time to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. New cybersecurity mandates on U.S. water utilities, meanwhile, were paused after several states challenged their legality, leaving this sector exposed. Cyber-operations do resemble conventional warfare—airstrikes, naval battles, or ground combat—in that they involve both offense and defense. The United States deters conventional threats through superior military power, but it completely lacks that dominance in cyberspace, where defense and offense are inextricably linked. Currently, U.S. presidents face an impossible problem: they cannot make persuasive deterrent threats because they lack enough confidence that U.S. defenses could withstand a potentially escalatory tit-for-tat battle in cyberspace. First and foremost, Washington must understand the vulnerabilities in its cyberdefenses. In conventional warfare, force-on-force comparisons guide strategy: for instance, the U.S. military runs regular tests and simulations to see whether its defenses can protect against Russia's missile-launch capacities. But the government cannot assess how the United States' critical infrastructure could withstand Chinese cyberattacks because it cannot even see what defenses secure its thousands of privately owned systems. Artificial intelligence, with its rapidly growing abilities to synthesize a vast amount of data, offers a new opportunity to take on this sprawling problem. Indeed, it can be the key to a new U.S. cyber-deterrence policy—specifically, so-called AI-generated digital twins. These dynamic digital models allow organizations to monitor, analyze, and optimize their physical assets remotely. Recent advances in AI have turbocharged digital twins' usefulness by dramatically improving their ability to model ever-larger and more complex entities. Industry is rapidly adopting digital twins to advance product safety—Rolls-Royce, for instance, now operates digital twins of its jet engines to monitor safety and performance. Ford and BMW have created digital twins of manufacturing processes to improve efficiency. And governments are exploring their potential: Singapore, for instance, has created a digital twin as well as test beds for its water and power plants. NATO has used these systems in its annual, large-scale cyberdefense exercise, during which security teams simulated attacking and defending Singaporean infrastructure. In the United States, a national effort to create digital twins for several hundred of the most sensitive critical infrastructure systems—done with private-sector owners' cooperation and consent—would allow these systems' security teams to safely test dangerous attack scenarios without risking the actual provision of core services. The teams could simulate cyberattacks against various system components within the digital twin to understand which vulnerabilities, if exploited, would cause major disruptions. This information would allow companies to focus their limited resources on fixing the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat rather than attempting to address every security flaw equally. When a water system's digital twin, for instance, suddenly shows unusual valve operations or pressure fluctuations, its security team could quickly identify potential intrusions before they cause physical damage. Virtual replicas of regional power grids could be used to simulate cascading failure scenarios, identifying nodes whose protection would prevent widespread outages. Digital twins of urban water systems could model contamination attacks, suggesting potential technical countermeasures and emergency response procedures. A digital twin of the Hoover Dam's control systems, for example, could simulate attack scenarios, helping its operators develop more precise and sophisticated defenses, as well as ways to recover more quickly if an attack does occur. A national effort to create digital twins of critical national infrastructure could be piloted quickly for the U.S. energy grid by the Department of Energy. The lessons learned while establishing that pilot could then be used to build digital twins for other critical sectors. It requires a detailed knowledge of infrastructure systems and network data that owners may consider proprietary. But the United States needs a bridge between its physical and digital worlds. Digital twins, however, would give U.S. national security officials a continuous picture of American cyberdefenses and provide decision-makers with real-time assessments of the country's readiness to foil cyberattacks. A future president contemplating a response to Chinese aggression could access complex modeling of how U.S. infrastructure would perform under sustained attack nearly immediately—the kind of tactical intelligence that is sorely lacking today. Even AI-enhanced defenses cannot entirely overcome the cyberdefense gap that gives China its structural advantage. Current U.S. law gives infrastructure operators full authority to monitor their networks, and federal legislation adopted in 2015 ensures that these operators are able to share information with their peers and with the federal government to facilitate collaborative defense. Still lacking in some key sectors, however, is any requirement that owners and operators actually monitor their networks. In sectors that have these requirements, regulators need to conduct more consistent oversight to ensure that operators are maintaining their cyberdefenses and collaborating with peers and the federal government. And defense alone, however sophisticated, cannot fully address China's advantages. Instead of attempting tit-for-tat intrusions into Chinese civilian infrastructure, the United States could focus on targeting military assets that China depends on during crises, which would conform with international law and may have a greater effect on the Chinese government's strategy. It must clarify that targeting specific critical civilian infrastructure whose disruption would cause major societal impact, even with pre-positioning attacks, is unacceptable. This would build on the Biden administration's message to China that cyberattacks with physical impacts would be treated as an act of war. The United States should communicate three core principles: We will attribute attacks to their perpetrators. The message must be credible and persistent, including enough detail to prove that the United States' offensive capabilities are real but not enough to let an adversary fix its vulnerabilities. Congress has shown little appetite for extending the legal authority and sustained investment that comprehensive cyberdefense requires. If Washington does not move fast, artificial intelligence will only accelerate China's advantages. If the United States succeeds, it can serve as an example of how to achieve the benefits of digitization and a free Internet without compromising its national security. If it fails, the world will also take away a lesson: that democracies are less capable of defending against cyberthreats. And China's strategy of “active deterrence” will only gain more global power.
