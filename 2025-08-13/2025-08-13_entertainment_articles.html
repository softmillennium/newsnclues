                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for updates…Hours after the Skydance-Paramount merger closed last Thursday, the new studio leadership group led by co-Chairs Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg ( who also serve as Vice Chair of Platforms, and Chair of Paramount Television, respectively) a loud message to the town that they meant business, closing a deal for the hot Timothee Chalamet-James Mangold package High Side, which Deadline first told you about. It was a bold move and a bolt of energy that told the town that Paramount 2.0 wasn't looking to cut back on its upcoming feature slate, rather make on the promises made during merger talks. Said Paramount's new CEO David Ellison at today's presser, “One of our biggest priorities is restoring Paramount as the No. 1 studio for filmmakers and talent in the world. 1 exhibition boss, AMC's Adam Aron, giddy on an earnings call Monday about the prospects for more movies on the big screen. Paramount in recent years has averaged 11 to 14 feature films. Greenstein at today's Paramount-Skydance presser said that the goal is for 15 movies a year asap, followed by 20 movies a year in the near future. “Paramount has been cash hampered in recent years, which has caused them to greenlight fewer movies than they might have liked to. It appears to us that Skydance is cash rich, and it would be our expectation that Skydance will be releasing more movies coming out of Paramount than Paramount has been releasing in recent years,” said Aron. While High Side is still a ways off, the new top feature brass, which also includes President Don Granger,  has plenty of projects to dive into as they get settled into their new office space on the Melrose lot. From high-profile franchises that have a been at the center of their release schedules for decades to new original stories featuring A-list talent, below is a list of where things stand on several properties that could help build the future slate. While it might seem like a high jump for the new administration to succeed, particularly at a studio which lost Marvel to Disney in 2009, it's only recently that Paramount saw some of its best grosses in more than a decade in 2022 when Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise's highest grossing movie ever, and technically Paramount's a global level, rallied their annual grosses to $1.29 billion domestic, and $2.6 billion global. And Ellison's Skydance had a tremendous amount to do with that success having co-financed 50% of Top Gun: Maverick. Any slate co-financing is bound to happen on the mid-sized budget movies that have risk potential. The previous Brian Robbins' led regime leaves behind a trove of high-end talent production deals for the new C-suite to tap, i.e. Ryan Reynolds, Damien Chazelle, Krasinski, the genre label 18hz led by Walter Hamada which as the movie Primate upcoming, and Smile producer Temple Hill. While High Side marked the first major package the studio purchased, when it comes to the first films to go into production, sources say its too early to say given that no greenlights have been given as the top brass gets settled. Another high priority for the Skydance owned Paramount, is Star Trek which Ellison has been involved with since the 2013 sequel Star Trek Into Darkness. “Star Trek is a priority across the company,” said Goldberg. As for right now they are developing a film that includes brand new characters that Andor director Toby Haynes is on board to direct with Seth Grahame Smith writing and Simon Kinberg and J.J. Abrams producing. They also have another installment with Captain Kirk, Spock and the rest of usual characters returning that also has Abrams producing and Steve Yockey writing. “Top Gun is a priority for us,” said Goldberg Though it has not been formally announced, news broke in 2023 that Ehren Krueger had begun working on a script for the next film. Star and producer Tom Cruise has focused on the most recent Mission: Impossible films not much has moved forward on the film. Now that Cruise is off those projects and looking for what his next film could be, don't be surprised if movement starts to pic up on this property. On the Transformers front, the franchise saw a rebooted live-action film, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts ($442M global box office) starring Anthony Ramos in 2023 and an animated pic, Transformers One, bow last year. Prior to sale, the studio had three separate scripts in development including one version that sources say has Michael Bay returning to the franchise. Those scripts should be ready for new leadership to take a look at shortly. The most recent high-profile franchise to get a release date for its next installment was A Quiet Place Part III, which the studio recently dated for summer 2027. They also have a live-action version based on the graphic novel that has Walter Hamada producing. There are also a number of Skydance development titles coming over which include The Rescue, an Untitled John Tuggle film starring Superman star David Corenswet, a film based on the Mike Hammer books starring Matthew McConaughey with Nic Pizzolatto writing and The Traveler, with Lee Isaac Chung attached to direct. While not confirmed at this time it is fair to say that these Skydance priority pics will now become priority projects at Paramount. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount stock, newly constituted on the Nasdaq under the PSKY ticker symbol after last week's close of the Skydance merger, surged almost 37% Wednesday in a rally no one saw coming. The eruption came as CEO David Ellison and other executives were convening a press conference at the Paramount studio lot in L.A., a follow-up to one held last week in New York. Optimism about the stock appears to be based in part on the company's splashy move to acquire UFC rights in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal. While that statement transaction rallied support on Wall Street, with shares up 8% on Tuesday, the Wednesday surge has left many market watchers scratching their heads. In the first two days of trading after the long-gestating Skydance merger finally closed, shares had drifted down, reflecting investors' wariness of the company's exposure to linear TV declines, among other concerns. CNBC host Jim Cramer tweeted that Paramount resembled a “meme stock” (à la GameStop). Ellison and backer RedBird Capital control 70% of Paramount's roughly 1 billion total shares. While there have been some rumblings about Paramount on Reddit chat groups like Wall Street Bets, there hasn't been anything like the Covid frenzy that boosted AMC Entertainment, GameStop and numerous other stocks to startling levels. Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris, in a research note Monday, said he views the UFC deal as a “meaningful indication of the company's strategy to bolster its sports and streaming assets.” He initiated coverage of Paramount with a “buy” rating, citing what he projects to be a $300 million annual advertising opportunity in UFC rights, on top of Paramount+ subscription proceeds.

David Ellison is better running the company than anyone else at this point tbh When is the press conference with LA media? I'm curious if they talk about their film and TV strategy. I'll buy when they unload all their linear assets I don't think that will happen atleast not right now. They already said last week that it won't.

In a wide-ranging conversation with his “One Battle After Another” director Paul Thomas Anderson published in Esquire, DiCaprio was asked whether he ever revisits his filmography. The Oscar winner explained that while he seldom watches his own movies he has a soft spot for Martin Scorsese's 2004 Howard Hughes biopic. He cited his involvement in the film‘s development process as evidence that he had truly arrived in the industry and was able to actively participate in his projects, rather than just being hired to support someone else's vision.

I had worked with Marty [Scorsese] on ‘Gangs of New York,' and I'd been toting around a book on Howard Hughes for 10 years. I almost did it with Michael Mann, but there was a conflict and I ended up bringing it to Marty. It was the first time as an actor I got to feel implicitly part of the production, rather than just an actor hired to play a role. I felt responsible in a whole new way. I've always felt proud and connected to that film as such a key part of my growing up in this industry and taking on a role of a real collaborator for the first time.” A Warner Bros. release, “One Battle After Another” opens in theaters on Friday, September 26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kiss, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait, and English actor Michael Crawford will receive the Kennedy Center Honors at a Donald Trump-hosted ceremony in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 8. This is the first Kennedy Center Honors since President Donald Trump took over as chairman of the prestigious Kennedy Center earlier this year. His first action was removing Biden-era appointees from the board and stacking it with loyalists. “We'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people,” he said. During his first administration, Trump broke longtime tradition and didn't attend the yearly Kennedy Center Honors. “As an artist and a human being, I cannot celebrate this incredible honor at a White House that has no interest in supporting the arts and humanities,” Lear told NPR. It's unlikely that Strait will react in the same fashion. The country icon largely keeps his political views to himself, but he broke out Trump's distinct dance move at a December 2024 show in Las Vegas to roars of approval from the audience. The Kennedy Center is proud to announce our incredible lineup of 2025 Kennedy Center Honorees:•George Strait (@GeorgeStrait)•Michael Crawford •Sylvester Stallone (@TheSlyStallone)•Gloria Gaynor (@GloriaGaynor)•Kiss (@Kiss)Congratulations to our 48th Class! “When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world,” Stallone said in December 2024 when appearing at an event with Trump. “‘Cause without him, you can imagine what the world would look like. “[Stallone] is a very special guy,” he said today. As for Gaynor's inclusion, Trump said, “I will say that ‘I Will Survive' is an unbelievable song.” Trump added that he was “98 percent involved” in the selection process for this year's honorees. Gene Simmons of Kiss is one of rock's most famous conservative voices, and he was a cast member on The Apprentice in 2008, but he's not a Trump supporter. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it's all out in the open because he allowed it … I don't think he's a Republican or a Democrat. He's out for himself, any way you can get there.” Ben Folds Releases New Live Album with National Symphony Orchestra on Fourth of July Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Make Trump Feel Good About Himself “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off,” Paul Stanley said. We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.” Zoë Kravitz Says Her Mom, Lisa Bonet, Let a Snake Loose in Taylor Swift's House “Coming from my humble beginnings growing up in The Bronx, this honor is a dream come true that I never thought would materialize,” Ace Frehley said in his statement. “All I can say is it's beyond my wildest dreams, and I am very honored and grateful to be including with the rest of the honorees.” “I feel so blessed this is the greatest honor of our career,” said Peter Criss. If all four of them attend the ceremony in December, it'll be the first time they've appeared together since their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2014.

Perhaps it's attributable to the lack of tactility of living in a digital hellscape, but a recent spate of thirtysomething filmmakers have been drawn to analogue media and textures in order to muse on a universal experience that no one ever quite processes in the same way: grief. “Aftersun” is but the most prominent example of a trend that memorably continued with Courtney Stephens' “Invention” earlier this year, in which actor/writer Callie Hernandez fictionalized the aftermath of her father's death with an assist from the VHS recordings of his many TV appearances dating back to the '90s.Seeming to pick up where that movie left off, Sophy Romvari's “Blue Heron” similarly follows a protagonist as she navigates her pre-millennial childhood memories through a sea of camcorder clips and hazy recollections. But it would be reductive to belabor the comparisons any further than that, as the Canadian-Hungarian filmmaker's extraordinary debut feature defies any clear precedent or easy categorization as it ventures down structurally exciting and unexpected paths.While “Blue Heron” is a drama that works without any knowledge of the filmmaker's history, Romvari's feature is also the culmination of a decade-long journey. An international festival favorite since the mid-2010s, her acclaimed shorts regularly fall somewhere between fiction and autobiography, the latter to varying levels of overtness. That particular short from 2020, which grappled with the loss of her brothers by sifting through a box of family photos that had been unseen for decades, shares the most DNA with “Blue Heron,” though Romvari is strictly behind the camera this time.For her fiction feature, she deploys an onscreen avatar. Possibly three, depending on how you interpret one specific dramatic set piece. It's a thrilling formal expansion for a filmmaker who's already so sharp in examining fragmented identities, and how they might be restored with a greater understanding of how the cracks came to be — even if restoration can be an incomplete process, and “greater” often means that a considerable amount of explanation and potential catharsis remain out of reach.The opening words from an offscreen voice (Amy Zimmer) set the mood, hint at who we should keep an eye on for much of the movie, and gesture towards whose perspective we may be sharing along the way. “It's true I spent a lot of my life angry at him,” she says. They're all I have now.”Credits play out over snapshots of a teenager's hand-drawn maps that reference such locations as “Fantasyville”. In this Canada of the late 90s, their Hungarian immigrant family is moving into a new home on Vancouver Island. But there are complications within this attempt at a fresh start.For one thing, Father (Ádám Tompa), the breadwinner of the family, quickly begins spending all his time between his dark room and his bulky work computer, leaving Mother (Iringó Réti) to take the lead for entertaining their kids when they're not in school. Related Stories Leonardo DiCaprio Watches ‘The Aviator' More Than Any of His Other Films: It Was ‘Such a Key Part of My Growing Up in This Industry' Genndy Tartakovsky's ‘Fixed' Narrowly Escaped Being Shelved as Another WB Tax Write-Off As hinted by the maps of imaginary places that he has pinned in his bedroom, Jeremy operates by the logic of an inner world that no one else can seem to access. Medical consultants can't pinpoint what's behind his outbursts. It's getting to the point where his mysterious behavior is a safety concern for the other children, though he's not necessarily ever aiming its more physical manifestations towards them.Romvari, crucially, does include a number of little moments — mainly looks and gradual smiles — that suggest some clear affection from Jeremy towards his younger siblings. During one beach outing where Jeremy otherwise separates himself from his family during the trip, the teen briefly mock-threatens to step on a collection of stones and shells that Sasha has stacked, before gifting her a blue heron keychain to place atop it — a coveted prize from one of his many shoplifting attempts.While the film isn't exclusively told from Sasha's perspective, it's through her eyes and ears that we witness a lot of the major incidents with Jeremy, plus many of the conversations between their parents. Romvari often eschews traditional point-of-view shots, and cinematographer Maya Bankovic complements that decision by favoring a long-lens shooting style with occasional zooms. The location choices and production design work of Victoria Furuya are likewise in perfect harmony with Bankovic's framing and movements. There's an intimate tension to how the blocking sometimes makes it seem like the home has no walls, except when a specific scene calls for interaction with such a surface, like Sasha peeking through a slightly ajar door as her parents meet with a social worker or Jeremy incessantly slamming a basketball against the side of the house.We also see conversations Sasha certainly couldn't have been there to see for herself, and where she definitely isn't present somewhere in the given onscreen space. This element of imagining discussions between her parents, rather than recreating memories of overheard thoughts or explicitly recorded events (Father is regularly shown using his camera and camcorder), ties into “Blue Heron”‘s second-half change-up, which is where the film really becomes something very special. Part of what works so well about the movie's back half lies in its multiple disorientating swerves, so the specifics are best left unspoiled beyond saying that there's a time jump to twenty-ish years later, with that opening adult voice (Amy Zimmer) being more explicitly confirmed as the grown-up version of Sasha, now a filmmaker who's trying to process what happened to her big brother via her chosen artistic field.It's through Romvari and editor Kurt Walker's bold structural move that the film, already excellent as “just” an observational portrait of a family in crisis, becomes profoundly moving. Romvari's preoccupation with fractured identities ambitiously expands to reflect how our incomplete memories can be filled in over time — less through unlocking something we'd forgotten than by achieving a greater understanding of, and empathy for, the perspectives of those with whom we shared those times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a single joke in the Nobody films, one that the original film played earnestly enough for its middling action fare to pass muster: What if John Wick was played by Bob Odenkirk? It's not that Keanu Reeves was ever a young, spry killer in those movies—the point is that he's been dragged back into a life he left behind—but that Odenkirk, even in his most serious roles, has always seemed like a smarmy Midwestern pencil-pusher. So when he's dragged back into a life he left behind, there's an additional layer of levity in watching a dweeb who should be mowing the lawn in Crocs beat the asses of endless henchmen. But though the punches maintain their force in Nobody 2, the sole punchline they support has become a grating dad joke, one that you've heard so many times that it's lost all meaning. The conflict between his feeble family-man exterior and murderous maniac interior has disappeared. So Hutch, his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen), their kids (Gage Munroe, Paisley Cadorath), and his once-killer father (played unintelligibly by Christopher Lloyd) head to the low-rent Midwest amusement park town Plummerville. Family trips, especially ones based in tradition, often take bittersweet pit stops. But don't ask Indonesian action/horror staple Timo Tjahjanto (The Shadow Strays, The Night Comes For Us) to find any of that depth in his English-language debut. Even the idea Hutch must hope that his children will be better than him amounts to less than nothing; as soon as Hutch's son starts joining in the fights, everyone is thrilled. This makes the shallow yet over-plotted rampage read like a 90-minute excuse, reverse-engineered to lead to an R-rated Home Alone battle of booby traps and bullets at a carnival. This setpiece, filled with brutality if not imagination (most of the attraction-specific ideas can be summed as “what if it exploded?”), will be enough to satisfy action junkies attracted by Tjahjanto's name. Chunks of gore spatter the screen, fingers and legs separate from their bodies, teeth scatter like rice at a wedding. Her sweaty camp is at least preferable to the stiffness of Odenkirk and Nielsen, whose dynamic becomes so muddied that each actor simply grits their teeth through their scenes. Abandoning what little individuality its milquetoast once had to chase the formula of its more successful acquaintance only undermines the still-serviceable violence and unchallenged stars. It's like a franchise-scale version of the phenomenon where a comic actor gets so committed to training for their superhero or action role that they forget why they were cast in the first place. This slapdash sequel doesn't so much go on vacation, knowing that it will soon return to its routine, as it goes on a bender.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cheer up: Radiohead are revisiting 2003's Hail to the Thief with a new live album, out digitally today and on vinyl Oct. 31. Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 includes performances from that era in Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Buenos Aires. The release spans 12 songs, nearly matching the track list of the original album, with only “Backdrifts” and “A Punch Up at a Wedding” omitted. Hail to the Thief, Radiohead's much-awaited follow-up to the acclaimed sister albums Kid A and Amnesiac, celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. The album, which contains fan favorites like “2+2=5” and “Myxomatosis,” marked the band's final release on EMI. It's the longest Radiohead album, and the band has since expressed regrets about its length; in 2008, Thom Yorke even shared an alternative, slimmed-down track list. I barely recognised us, and it helped me find a way forward. We decided to get these live recordings mixed and released (it would have been insane to keep them for ourselves). It has all been a very cathartic process. We very much hope you enjoy them.” Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 arrives at a moment of reflection for Yorke, who is currently showing the retrospective Radiohead art exhibit This is What You Get in the band's hometown of Oxford, England. The live album follows the band's archival releases for OK Computer (2017's OKNOTOK 1997 2017) and Kid A and Amnesiac (2021's Kid A Mnesia), each pegged to their 20-year anniversaries. (Earlier this year, they commemorated the 30th anniversary of 1995's The Bends with an unearthed acoustic performance by Yorke.) It's their first-ever full-length live album, following the eight-track 2001 live release I Might Be Wrong. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time Last year, during a solo show in Auckland, New Zealand, Yorke played Hail to the Thief‘s “Sail to the Moon” for the first time in 16 years. (The most hardcore fans noted that it was his first solo rendition of the track in even longer.) Radiohead wrapped their most recent tour, pegged to 2016's A Moon Shaped Pool, in 2018. They've released three Smile albums: 2022's A Light for Attracting Attention and Wall of Eyes and Cutouts, both released in 2024. Yorke then teamed up with producer Mark Pritchard for 2025's Tall Tales. In December 2024, bassist Colin Greenwood spoke to Rolling Stone about his photo book How to Disappear: A Portrait of Radiohead — and the band's private reunion earlier that year, reports of which prompted months of speculation and rumors. “It was just basically to check in with each other, I suppose, because we hadn't done it for so long,” he told us. “I guess it was also because I think maybe Thom and Jonny were going off to do some stuff [with the Smile]…. It was just really nice just to run through stuff… We ran through, like, The Bends. The one-off LP pressing of Hail to the Thief Live Recordings 2003-2009 is available for preorder now, in both red and cyan-colored vinyl.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For months now, songwriters have spoken out after they claimed a change in Spotify's bundled payment strategy drastically decreased the royalties they received for their work. In April of last year, the streamer added audiobooks to its premium tier and began splitting the pot of available residuals between both music and book publishers. While Spotify claimed in March that it had paid $4.5 billion to songwriters and publishers over the past two years, the National Music Publishers Association said in June that publishers lost $230 million last year due to the controversial bundling strategy. Hubert, however, is optimistic that the new deal is “a step in the right direction.” “This deal reaffirms our unwavering commitment to ensuring our songwriters are paid fairly for their work, and underscores the importance of progressive licensing models that reﬂect the real-world use of music across digital platforms,” he continued in his statement. The Kobalt deal is one of several Spotify has made recently. “This agreement with Kobalt boosts our support of songwriters through a licensing model that unlocks new growth and will expand the way music is made and shared today.” Over the past few months, several bands have pulled their music off the platform in protest of CEO Daniel Ek's $700 million investment in Helsing, a German company that creates military drones and AI-driven defense software. While Spotify's new deal with Kobalt may help one group of frustrated artists, the company will have to do a lot more to win these self-exiled bands back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Sometimes it takes you a long time to sound like yourself.” That phrase is written on a sign above the bathroom at the studio of all-star vocal coach Eric Vetro. The first time Addison Rae saw it at her own lesson there, the influencer-turned-singer did what she often does when she finds something compelling: She pulled out her phone and took a picture to save for later inspiration. “That's a Miles Davis quote,” she tells me. “It is just the realest thing ever because not only does that apply as far as literal vocal warmups go — like, you could sound one way at the beginning of a lesson and another way at the end — but also just finding who you are takes a really long time.” Today, it's hard to imagine Rae ever felt lost in search of her true self. This storied place has been intertwined with showbiz's rich and famous since it opened in 1956 — films like Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood and Valley Girl were shot here; Dakota Fanning has a signature margarita on the bar menu; Jane Fonda, Marlon Brando and Cary Grant were once regulars; and, more surprisingly, The Chainsmokers have a bronze plaque nailed to the wall above our booth. She got her start on TikTok that year as a beautiful girl next door, dancing to popular songs in her bedroom. The hope was that, if she just made enough videos and got enough followers, she could break into the entertainment business and have a multihyphenate career as a singer, dancer and actor. Rae — along with many of her TikTok contemporaries like Lil Huddy, Nessa Barrett and Dixie D'Amelio — were quickly scouted by major labels, which approached them with offers of big, shiny contracts and songs to record by proven hit-makers. Rae did not grow up writing songs or playing musical instruments; all of her time was taken up by competitive dance. But she still seized her moment and, in early 2021, signed a deal with Sandlot Records, founded by chart-topping writer-producer Jacob Kash “JKash” Hindlin. By that March, she released her first single, “Obsessed.” Despite co-writing it with a who's who of the writing/producing world, including Benny Blanco and Blake Slatkin, it was widely panned. Critics sneered at the cheeky dance-pop tune, claiming it was derivative and hollow (and that was nothing compared with the comments on social media). “Initially, I was pretty let down by myself in a lot of ways because I had such high expectations,” Rae says of her early releases. “But I love music so much, and it's ingrained in my life. Rae has always prided herself on her work ethic: At her TikTok peak around 2020, she was known for pushing herself to make seven or eight clips a day. She studied performance clips from her favorite artists — Madonna, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, among others — and ramped up her own songwriting sessions. She also took more voice lessons and used Tumblr to assemble mood boards of colors, images, songs and videos. It was Rae's way of articulating what she didn't yet have the musical vocabulary for. After years of practice, releasing an EP (AR, which included “Obsessed”) and featuring on Charli xcx's “Von Dutch” remix, Rae finally knew exactly what she wanted. Now she just had to find the partners who could translate it into a hit album. Though the industry's gold rush to sign every TikToker who could carry a tune was largely over by fall 2023, Columbia saw promise in Rae's renewed vision and signed her. Then, in spring 2024, one of her many songwriting sessions brought her into contact with Los Angeles native Luka Kloser, 27, and Stockholm-born Elvira Anderfjärd, 26, a writer-producer duo reared by Swedish hit-maker Max Martin's MXM Publishing. The two women immediately clicked with Rae and understood her vision, helping her transform it within just one session into her musical proof of concept: “Diet Pepsi,” a breathy synth-pop track about the ephemerality of young romance. Prior to meeting Rae, Kloser and Anderfjärd had already racked up impressive wins. Kloser worked on Ariana Grande's “ordinary things” and Tate McRae's “grave” as well as multiple projects with her own brother, who records as Kid Bloom; Anderfjärd has become a trusted collaborator for artists like Tove Lo and Katy Perry and remixed multiple rerecordings for Taylor Swift. Still, Anderfjärd says that working with Rae was an especially “lucky” experience for herself and Kloser, who are best friends as well as creative collaborators and have joined us for lunch at Casa Vega. “It's so rare to get this kind of trust from an artist,” she says. Kloser adds: “I don't think I've ever experienced such magic in a first session, for lack of a better word. “Diet Pepsi,” released in August 2024, served as a hard reset for Rae's music career, gaining her new listeners and bringing back old ones who had counted her out. In the following months, Rae sequestered herself with Kloser and Anderfjärd, aiming to create a debut album as sonically clear and acclaimed as “Diet Pepsi.” In June 2025, Addison arrived, peaking at No. “Diet Pepsi” remains the album's biggest commercial hit, but Addison spawned plenty of other standout tracks, including “Fame Is a Gun” and “Headphones On,” which also ranked on the Hot 100 and earned Rae the respect that had once eluded her. “It's hard to flip the public perception of you and she did it effortlessly,” says Charli xcx, a staunch supporter of Rae's for years. “Her growth and evolution has been expedited because [Rae] knows herself and she's truly not worried about what people think of her.” Over chips and salsa, I ask Rae what she attributes her success to: Hard work? It doesn't really take me much to try something new and go all in, and here, I went all in.” Tell me about the process of creating it. I remember you were just on the piano, Luka. We were kind of nearing the end of the session and we were like, “OK, well, nothing happened. Had we been like, “Let's go get dinner,” there's a chance that we might have remained friendly but would never have entered this world of everything that has happened. What are your roles in the studio when you're working together? Rae: That's what happened with [Addison's] “Summer Forever.” I just knew I wanted to name a song that, and we just went from there. A lot of my songs happen that way, except “Diet Pepsi.” That one was very on the spot while we were in a flow state writing. Kloser: It's nice when you have a super comfortable environment to create in because we are all able to share just any thought with one another, even if they aren't thought out or massaged yet. That makes everyone feel a little bit more fluid in their roles. Both just came from notes on my Notes app… I think titles can be so telling about what a song is going to be. Rae: I rewatched [2006 teen rom-com] Aquamarine and wrote down the word just as a title. So I walked [into our next writing session] with “Aquamarine” as a title, and we were kind of just like, “What does this even mean? How do you write a song called ‘Aquamarine'?” But aquamarine, the stone, represents rebirth and transformation, so I ended up being like, “How can we dive into that world?” And then the track just started happening. I remember we were rewatching that one clip of those flowers. I had this YouTube video that I put on loop for us while we were making it, of these flowers blooming really quickly… Anderfjärd: Yeah, you'd put on all those little background videos. Rae: When we did “Summer Forever,” I remember there was that black-and-white old movie. How much does location affect the song that gets made? Anderfjärd: I think so, but sometimes not in a way you'd expect. The vibes weren't there, but that made us have to create our own. Rae: Personally, I kind of thrive in a space where there's no vibe because then everything naturally doesn't sound as appealing. And then when you get something really special, it's obvious. “Diet Pepsi” came out in August 2024, and Addison did not arrive for almost another year. Rae: As much as I would have loved for there to be a confirmed album date before I started putting music out, it just didn't happen that way. When “Diet Pepsi” came out, we only had three songs done. Just before writing and recording “Diet Pepsi,” you recorded the “Von Dutch” remix with Charli xcx. What did you learn from Charli or from watching the phenomenon of brat play out, and how did it inspire you in making your own music? Rae: Charli really gave me the confidence as a writer, honestly. That's why I felt so sure going into our sessions [for Addison, which happened soon after brat came out]. It's rare to see a pop album that only has three people in the liner notes — and even more rare to see liner notes that only list women. Rae: I think the perspective of having a room of only females was just a really different energy than what we're all used to. It doesn't really happen very often… I didn't expect it to happen this way, and I don't think anybody else expected that from me, which was really nice because I think it's always good to have people unsure of what you're going to do. We are all around the same age and have similar life experiences in a lot of ways, being women in this industry. Luka and Elvira, you're signed to Max Martin's MXM Publishing. What did you learn from watching Martin and other MXM-signed hit-makers? You can get very stressed in a studio environment where it's like, “Let's finish the song when the day is over.” I think they create an environment of just taking our time with it because who's going to care if it took a year to finish or a day? And I second Elvira: The song is always first. Those guys still show up worried about what song they're going to make today, and that's it. It sounds cheesy, but I think their success speaks for themselves — they've really led with their love for the craft more than anything. Why do you think Swedish pop producers have been so prominent over the past few decades? Kloser: Oftentimes, people feel like there's this mathematical approach to pop songwriting. There's definitely a toolbox that is there, but I think what sets Scandinavian people apart is that they have free music education. I just think music is so deep rooted there. Also, Elvira always says that it's dark 90% of the year, so all you can do is huddle up and jam. It was a big departure from your previous work. Rae: There were people I played it to who were like, “I don't know if this is what people want from you.” And I was like, “Well, I don't think people know what they want from me.” If I had to give any advice to anybody, it would probably just be to do what you want and don't do what people think they want from you because that's already so many steps behind. Growing up in dance, my teachers were always playing Britney [Spears]. The Fame had just come out when I was on a competition team and everybody loved Gaga's music. I remember doing an opening number to Madonna's “Hollywood” at my dance studio. I always loved these extravagant pop stars as a little girl. I was just like, “This is what it's like to be a woman, to be a pop star.” Maybe my EP felt a little bit more derivative of what I thought me as a pop star was, especially when I was growing up, but now I've become my own thing. I think the album totally took on a life of its own, and it became something that only we could have done by leaning on our instincts and our feelings. That's why it feels so rare and singular. There was so much unknown before “Diet Pepsi” came out. We didn't really know what people would think, nor did we really care, which I thought was so nice. But I think it definitely added a layer of pressure initially. Addison, your career has been very public from the beginning. How did the weight of public opinion affect you as a young musician who was still learning? Rae: Initially, I was pretty let down by myself in a lot of ways because I had such high expectations. And even though I took a kind of break over time to figure out what that meant to me, I think it was so necessary, and that led me to exactly where I needed to be, which is right here with Luka and Elvira. What other moments when making the album felt like you really coming into yourself as an artist? Rae: “High Fashion” is probably the one for me because I remember we were struggling at that time. We didn't know where else to go creatively, maybe because of the success of “Diet Pepsi” around that time, and then “High Fashion” happened. Everything we were making was for us and private. Once everything was being received in real time and we were still making the album, it felt different. And then “High Fashion” brought us back to that same feeling. It can be hard, communicating with people about your feelings and where you are in life, especially when you're going through a lot. I think those times are necessary, though, where you just sit and play and nothing happens or comes out of it. A lot of those moments are what created the groundwork of making a song because we became close enough to talk about everything. Only 18.9% of songwriters on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart in 2024 were women, according to the University of South California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. Luka and Elvira, do you think your gender made it harder to break into the industry? There are very supportive men in this industry. And we've been very lucky to be surrounded by men that believe in us. Anderfjärd: When I was younger, I didn't want to make it into a thing at all because I felt like there was a culture of, like, you have to be tough. Now, being a little older, there's actually things that are so annoying about being a young woman in production. No one ever questions like, “Oh, he's a producer. Luka and Elvira, what do you think it is that makes Addison such a standout artist? She sees a whole vision ahead of her. Kloser: Addison is so energetic, optimistic and driven. She is truly a student of pop culture, and she knows herself in a way that is infectious to watch. Are you three making any new music together right now? Kloser: Nope, this was the last time we're ever [together]. This story appears in the Aug. 16, 2025, issue of Billboard. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

South Park is so on fire right now, it even makes news for not airing an episode. Comedy Central is not airing a new episode of the animated hit series this week — the second time the show has not run a weekly episode since its season 27 premiere just a few weeks ago. Instead, the cable network has declared Aug. 13 “South Park Day” and is running a marathon of fan-favorite episodes starting at 9 a.m. ET which leads up to an airing of the show's first episode, “Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,” in the show's usual 10 p.m. TV Ratings: 'South Park' On-Air Viewers Surge With Season 27's Second Episode Kristi Noem Fires Back at 'South Park' for Mocking Her Looks The show operates on a famously tight schedule, with Parker and Stone creating entire episodes in just six days and often delivering a locked cut hours before Comedy Central's deadline. While the Administration has gamely, and repeatedly, fired back. The production's X page also changed its avatar to Noem's “melting face” from the episode after she blasted the show, saying, “It's so lazy to make fun of women for how they look. Season 27 consists of 10 episodes and is expected to continue next week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sixteen years after his show launched an industry and saved his career, the curmudgeonly conversationalist is feeling conflicted about what followed: “Things were better before everyone had a voice.” Each turn of the globe brings a fresh catastrophe, a crisis, real or imagined, that sends the comedian back into battle with his tenacious anxiety. Taylor Swift Confirmed to Make Guest Appearance on Travis Kelce's 'New Heights' Podcast NY Film Festival Adds Bruce Springsteen Biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' as Spotlight Gala At least for the moment, Maron seems to surrender to the discord between two of his three roommates, though stand-up's most famous cat guy is never not a little on edge. Right now, it's in his front yard with an audience of one. And he'll absolutely monologue about this on his podcast. He launched WTF With Marc Maron in 2009, a time of personal and professional desperation, when podcasting was still a cultural vacuum mostly populated by repurposed NPR content. Many of his peers thought that Maron, who has struggled with depression and addiction, had finally lost it. But his candor and curiosity soon had comics, actors, intellectuals and eventually a sitting president trekking to a cluttered garage studio on the east side of Los Angeles to talk and listen to a self-described failure. “Sometimes the complete artist is there — they just need to find the medium,” says Conan O'Brien, who booked his longtime friend for 42 appearances on NBC's Late Night before WTF made Maron mainstream. For 16 years, Maron has used his platform to do just that. But in June, he and his day one producer, Brendan McDonald, announced that they were burned out. WTF ends in October after more than 1,680 episodes and inspiring countless others to grab a mic and capitalize on the booming genre Maron helped popularize. As for this 62-year-old pioneer, he'll focus on an accelerating acting career (see his supporting roles on the Apple TV+ comedy Stick and the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere), his stand-up and perhaps some self-care. “Howard Stern mentioned us stopping the show,” Maron says. “He said, ‘Well, if they're burnt out, I must be dead.' I don't know if he knows the irony in that. There is something about solidifying a legacy when you stop, as opposed to just fading away.” On more than one occasion, Maron refers to WTF‘s impending conclusion as “the change” — as if it were some biological rite of passage to endure rather than a decision he made. But for a guy with loner-ish tendencies like Maron, this could herald an existential crisis. It's pretty crowded out there, if you hadn't noticed. “Things were better before everyone had a voice,” Maron says. “Now there's just hundreds of groups of two or three white guys, sitting behind mics, talking about the last time they shit their pants as adults. We live in a world of mediocre afternoon drive-time radio.” This feels worth acknowledging because almost every home with them, no matter how expensive the litter box, shares that unmistakable aroma. Oh, and when Maron returned from a trip to his home state of New Mexico days earlier, the youngest had defecated in almost every room. But when I arrive at the Glendale craftsman they all share, he lies down at my feet, belly up, as Buster and Sammy keep to themselves. This is not the property where Maron launched WTF. “Every guest had to come through that small house,” he says, coffee in hand and feet up on his wraparound porch. He'd been working as a stand-up since 1987, starting as a doorman at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles just after he graduated from Boston University. He briefly found himself in Sam Kinison's cocaine-fueled orbit until the volatile comic peed on Maron's bed. Neither coast saw his stage work bring the fame or TV opportunities that came to such contemporaries as Bob Odenkirk, Jon Stewart or Louis C.K. At this point sober for 10 years, he was still nursing the wounds inflicted by his second divorce — “the bad one” — and money was becoming a problem. Maron didn't shy away from any of it whenever he sat down to talk in that garage. Six months in, a frank exchange with Robin Williams that prophetically touched on his suicidal thoughts accelerated Maron's upward trajectory. What reservations publicists had about putting talent in a chair opposite Maron either dissipated or were merely ignored by their clients. “Marc has one hand flipping you off and one hand reaching out to you,” says Betty Gilpin, who sat down for WTF in 2019 after acting opposite him for three seasons of the Netflix dramedy GLOW. His podcast is an antidote to the forced authenticity of so much press. Comedian and actor Bobby Lee counts himself among those who took Maron's cues. “Marc became the light showing you where to go after Hollywood closed the door,” says Lee, a two-time WTF guest with two pods of his own. “Once MadTV was canceled, things weren't clicking for me. He taught me the ropes, and it reinvented my career.” This kind of reverence and credit can be lost on Maron. “Constantly, out of a persistent insecurity or spite, I just compare myself to people that are more successful than I am — or people I've decided are more successful,” cops Maron, who will list off his bona fides then immediately insist his stand-up isn't entertaining. Nobody, not any therapist, friend or ex, has probably heard more of this than Maron's producer. McDonald has been with him since they worked at the short-lived liberal radio network Air America in 2004. And after putting together every episode of WTF, McDonald speaks about his collaborator with unique insight. “He's a very capable person despite presenting himself as just holding on by his fingernails,” says McDonald. Maron describes McDonald as the longest and healthiest relationship he's had. And while neither recall any big fights, there have been disagreements. After Obama's appearance blew their booking options wide open, Maron didn't always bite when McDonald wanted him to. “‘You're the guy to do this,' ” McDonald recalls telling him. “The success rate of getting to a candid place with politicians is very small,” says Maron, who considers his Obama episode a rare exception. Their unanimous decision to end WTF came in October as they entered the final year of their distribution deal with Acast, knowing that taking the podcast further with any partner would involve concessions they weren't willing to make. More advertising and the pressure for spinoffs are among his reservations, but particularly offensive to Maron is the industry-wide expectation to put everything on camera. Maron is almost singular in his ability to talk shit. Unfortunately, he claims to be watching his mouth today. An innocuous comment about his former (and one-sided) rivalry with The Daily Show‘s Stewart is making the rounds, and Maron is kicking himself for stepping into clickbait. One and a half more Zyns and another cup of coffee later, he cannot help himself — especially as the conversation turns to his fellow podcasters. I bring up a 2019 episode of actor Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert, during which Maron posed that podcasting might be becoming a cancer, and he does not wait for my question. “That was before he sort of became me,” says Maron. I opened up a zone within this medium just before it became really viable. And it was instinctual to insert myself into the conversations. You can't open Spotify without figuratively tripping over an actor, athlete, comedian or musician who has gotten into the interview game. “There's a good chance I wouldn't be doing this if Marc hadn't put podcasting on the map,” says O'Brien, who sold his own podcast network, Team Coco, to SiriusXM in 2022 for a reported $150 million. When I ask Maron whether he envies any of the $100 million-plus mega deals his peers have gotten for going corporate, he shakes his head. “We did all right,” he says, meaning himself and McDonald, “definitely well enough for us to live the rest of our lives, but those kind of deals come with extreme responsibility. Between our July meeting and a phone call two weeks later, he'll guest on no fewer than nine pods to plug his HBO comedy special Panicked and begin WTF‘s goodbye tour. Days before the 2024 presidential election, on his blog and WTF, Maron took aim at the male comic podcasters he deemed complicit in normalizing America's far- right swing by cozying up to “self-proclaimed white supremacists and fascists.” He didn't name names, and even today he only calls them “those guys,” but there is little doubt he's nodding to Joe Rogen, Andrew Schulz and Theo Von. “This anti-woke idea around free speech with comedians is bullshit. Whether they knew it or not, they were being used by the right to push this anti-woke agenda, which is now disassembling every progressive policy. And while he admits he's concerned about the small group of corporations who greenlight these projects being spooked by voices critical of the MAGA administration — we're speaking within days of CBS' Stephen Colbert cancellation — he has not heard a peep from HBO about his own content. The filmmaker still looms large in Maron's work and life. He's processed it very publicly, first within days of her May 2020 death when he recorded a raw WTF intro before replaying their 2015 conversation. A small piece of this is included in Are We Good?, an upcoming documentary about Maron framed by Shelton's death, but he's never been able to listen back to that episode in its entirety. “There's no cultural apparatus to deal with grief,” says Maron. That's not to say Maron's handling of grief, or anything, ever gets too serious. Recounting his visit with Shelton's body after she'd been taken off of life support in From Bleak to Dark, Maron punctures the somber scene with a joke about taking a selfie. “Of course he does,” says Sarah Silverman, who's known Maron for more than 30 years. “I think life is a little bit like torture for him, yet he's still consistently, brilliantly funny about it.” There is little Maron won't share, including some fresh psychoanalysis from his girlfriend, Kit. The two started dating in late 2020 after she cold-emailed him a condolence letter. They met for a hike and bonded over mutual anxieties. “She just texted me something this morning,” he says, pulling out his phone. He'll make the call on who'll be there for his final WTF episode, even if it's just him, alone at the mic, being sad. (He wouldn't say no to a return from Obama, though.) “Marc adapts to change fairly well, even if it's done through gritted teeth,” says McDonald. “My social life has really been the podcast, mostly, and comedy clubs,” he says. “I'll probably go back to [AA] meetings for a bit of support — to not spiral out with the isms, as they call it. Does that mean Marc Maron wants to be invited out more? I think that some people like to have me around… But maybe this is all of the change talking. Maybe I am just an old man yelling at the burning sky.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leonardo DiCaprio stepped out for a night in Ibiza, but even without his regular face mask, he went completely unnoticed. The 50-year-old Oscar winner mixed up so well with the party crowd that police didn't seem to realize one of Hollywood's biggest stars was right in front of them. A woman nearby could be heard saying, “They are searching me full-on right now.” It's unclear if she was model Vittoria Ceretti, DiCaprio's 27-year-old girlfriend who accompanied him on the trip. A source told Page Six that DiCaprio wasn't singled out for special treatment. “Every single person was patted down and ID'd,” they said, adding that the Spanish police didn't initially recognize him. “It's funny, they did a double-take and then he went in!” While DiCaprio got through security, Travis Scott was reportedly denied entry to the private villa party hosted by Patron and Spanish actor-singer Aron Piper. DiCaprio is no stranger to Ibiza, having vacationed there many times over the years. The couple also attended Bezos and Sánchez's lavish June wedding in Venice, where Ceretti royally handled a wardrobe mishap, after her vintage Dolce & Gabbana dress was visibly torn off. Linked since summer 2023, Ceretti has said she doesn't like being known solely as “Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend,” telling Vogue France in March that labels can be “extremely annoying.” The group's double date came just weeks after Bezos and Sánchez's $40 million wedding in Venice, which was attended by A-list names like Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans are fondly looking back on the comedy career of Danielle Spencer, who played Dee Thomas on '70s sitcom “What's Happening!” after her death was announced by several news outlets on Tuesday, August 12, 2025. They say Nelson told them, “She suffered for a very long time but did it with a great deal of courage.” He also called his friend loving, positive, and a “pragmatic warrior.” Nelson also praised the actress for being an animal rights proponent. The New York Amsterdam News says she built a career as a veterinarian and “dedicated her life to caring for animals” after retiring from Hollywood. The New York Post says Spencer famously survived a serious car crash during production of “What's Happening! The accident left Spencer in a three-week coma and killed her stepfather, Tim Pelt. Although Spencer's precise cause of death has not yet been announced, a GoFundMe campaign to help with her medical bills which was started in 2019 left some clues. The page declared, “Losing is not an option” and called Spencer “an entertainer who kept many of us with smiles on our faces.” The page went on to reveal that Spencer's childhood car crash left her with a broken leg arm and pelvis, and caused a bleeding hematoma to form that caused Spencer to start suffering debilitating headaches 42 years later. The page went on to explain, “The surgery was a success and she must now heal and recover. As of today it is not known how long she will be in recovery because of her recent bout with cancer and spinal cord injury.” Spencer is a heroine in her own right. She made a great life of her own after acting. She was an outstanding veterinarian and advocate much to animal welfare. She will be missed,” wrote one fan, after declaring the news “heartbreaking.” Another person said, “Very funny actress and had successful post-acting career as a veterinarian.</p>
