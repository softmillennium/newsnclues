                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Court has a special set of rules for Trump. The Supreme Court handed down a very brief order on Thursday, which allows a Mississippi law restricting children's access to social media to remain in place — for now. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is ideologically at the center of this very conservative Supreme Court, wrote a concurring opinion explaining that he thinks the law “would likely violate [social media companies'] First Amendment rights under this Court's precedents.” But he joined the Court's decision nonetheless because the plaintiff in this case, a trade group that represents internet companies, “has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.” Typically, when the Court grants shadow docket relief, it issues a temporary order that blocks a lower court decision until the case is fully litigated in federal appeals courts and, in some cases, the Supreme Court. In Nken v. Holder (2009), the Court held that, when a litigant asks an appellate court to block a lower court's decision while the case is still ongoing, it is not enough for that litigant to show they are likely to prevail on appeal. To receive shadow docket relief, the litigant must also show that they “will be irreparably injured absent a stay.” Often, appeals courts must also ask whether blocking the lower court's decision would “substantially injure” any third parties, or otherwise harm “the public interest.” Kavanaugh is probably right that the Mississippi law at issue in Netchoice does not irreparably injure anyone. Though the law purports to prevent minors from signing up for social media accounts without their parents' permission, it is fairly toothless. And it is far from clear whether any actual child or teenager has not been able to use a social media site because of the law. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson explained in a pair of dissenting opinions earlier this year, when President Donald Trump seeks a shadow docket order, the Court typically ignores Nken and rules in favor of Trump, regardless of whether he or his administration would be irreparably injured. In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME (2025), for example, the Republican justices ruled that DOGE, the White House office once led by billionaire Elon Musk, may have immediate access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration. That brief devoted only one paragraph to the question of irreparable harm, and it did not identify any injury to the government that could not be unraveled by a future court order. Last June, the Supreme Court slightly rolled back First Amendment rights, holding that states may require pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18. It was unclear after that decision, known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, whether the Court planned to further weaken the First Amendment, or whether Free Speech Coalition was a one-off decision applying solely to porn. Kavanaugh's Fitch concurrence suggests that the First Amendment is safe. To his credit, Kavanaugh has generally voted in favor of free speech, including in cases where Republican lawmakers sought to restrict it. Additionally, Kavanaugh's Fitch opinion also seems to clarify that, for most litigants, Nken remains good law. A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever. ﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act. The justice has one half of a really good idea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Border Patrol agent David Maland is recognized with military honors before his burial at Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis, on Feb. 22, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department said Thursday it will seek the death penalty against a member of the cultlike Zizians group accused of killing a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont in the latest Trump administration push for more federal executions. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Seattle, is among a group of radical computer scientists focused on veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence who have been linked to six killings in three states. She's accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions. In this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. (Department of Homeland Security via AP, File) But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming, and a new indictment released Thursday charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses. “We will not stand for such attacks on the men and women who protect our communities and borders,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti said in a press release. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi mentioned Maland as an example when saying she expects federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of law enforcement officers. And Youngblut's attorneys recently said they had been given a July 28 deadline to offer preliminary evidence about why she should be spared such a punishment. Her attorneys, who declined to comment Thursday, asked a judge last month to delay that deadline until January, but the judge declined. At the time of the shooting, authorities had been watching Youngblut and her companion, Felix Bauckholt, for several days after a Vermont hotel employee reported seeing them carrying guns and wearing black tactical gear. An agent fired back, killing Bauckholt and wounding Youngblut. The pair were among the followers of Jack LaSota, a transgender woman also known as Ziz whose online writing attracted young, highly intelligent computer scientists who shared anarchist beliefs. LaSota and two others face weapons and drug charges in Maryland, where they were arrested in February, while LaSota faces additional federal charges of being an armed fugitive. Another member of the group who is charged with killing the landlord in California had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut. Vermont abolished its state death penalty in 1972. The last person sentenced to death in the state on federal charges was Donald Fell, who was convicted in 2005 of abducting and killing a supermarket worker five years earlier.</p>

CNN host Abby Phillip compared President Donald Trump to Batman on Monday night while criticizing his efforts to clean up crime in Washington, D.C. FIRST ON FOX — A pro-Trump legal group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller filed a FOIA request Thursday seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics that senior adminis tration officials allege have been "manipulated." The request by the America First Legal Foundation (AFL) includes demands for a wide range of documents from D.C.'s police force, including all email communications or internal guidance reflecting any changes in the department's tracking or reporting of crimes in the city, as well as any records "reflecting the falsification or non-publication" of crime data and statistics, among other things. It is part of a broader investigation AFL launched on Thursday, just four days after President Donald Trump issued his order to temporarily federalize D.C. both by deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force to crack down on crime. In the FOIA request, AFL also asked for records of "all communications" related to Michael Pulliam, the D.C. police officer who was placed on administrative leave in May, after he was accused of changing crime statistics to minimize crimes. White House deputy chief of staff for policy and US homeland security advisor Stephen Miller (R) speaks as US President Donald Trump delivers his 100th Day in office achievement speech at Macomb County Community College Sports Expo Center in Warren, Michigan, on April 29, 2025. Pulliam formerly served as a police commander for the Metropolitan Police Department's Third District, which includes Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights. The Pulliam investigation has become something of a political lightning rod in recent days, as Trump officials have pointed to the investigation and his leave as evidence that MPD has sought to manipulate or massage crime statistics in the nation's capital. News of the AFL probe comes as President Donald Trump and White House officials have blasted what they describe as a "ridiculous" amount of crime in D.C., and claimed repeatedly that the crime statistics in question might not be an accurate portrayal of the situation on the ground — something critics argue is simply justification for the administration to push through its executive order. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., "is more violent than Baghdad." "As each day passes, new horrific examples of violent crime are reported across the district," AFL's lead attorney, Will Scolinos, told Fox News Digital in a statement. "AFL is investigating whether, as described by recent reports, official D.C. crime statistics may have been deliberately falsified to make the city seem safer than it is." "President Trump has stepped up to make Washington D.C. safer for all residents and visitors to the nation's capital—but the Left is lockstep in defending D.C. as ‘safe enough.'" That order invokes Section 740 of D.C.'s Home Rule Act, saying that federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order in D.C to protect the nation's capital — including federal buildings, property, and monuments— and to ensure "conditions necessary" for the orderly functioning of the federal government. US President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (L) and Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), speaks during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on August 11, 2025. In announcing their investigation Thursday, the AFL also cited a report published Thursday morning by the Washington Free Beacon involving a D.C. settlement agreement with a former police sergeant, Charlotte Djossou, who allegedly sued MPD leaders in 2020 for "misclassifying offenses" to deflate D.C. crime statistics. The administration has sought to undermine preliminary federal statistics published in January 2025 that said violent crime in the nation's capital had dropped to its lowest point in more than 30 years. D.C. officials, for their part, have conceded that the drop in violent crime might be overstated (data on the MPD website now shows a 26% drop between 2023 and 2024). But they've pushed back on the notion that artificially deflated crime data is to blame. In an interview with NBC News earlier this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that a recent review of all MPD crime data found 552 fewer victims of violent crime in the first eight months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. Crime is down across all seven districts, with anomalies in just one, she told NBC. Miller stepped down from AFL before rejoining the White House in 2025 as Trump's deputy chief of staff.

Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, gives an update on Tropical Storm Erin at the National Hurricane Center, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Miami. Senior hurricane specialist Jack Bevin prepares an advisory on Tropical Storm Erin at the National Hurricane Center, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Miami. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Officials in the northern Caribbean warned Thursday of heavy rains and dangerous swells as Tropical Storm Erin approached the region. Erin was located about 890 miles (1,435 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. Erin is forecast to become a hurricane by Friday and strengthen into a Category 3 storm by late Saturday, which would mark the first major storm this season. In an AP interview, National Weather Service senior hurricane specialist Jack Beven says Erin is currently a tropical storm, and is expected to strengthen as it moves closer to the Leeward Islands and possibly the Virgin Islands. “Erin is moving into an area of the Atlantic primed for rapid intensification. The waters are incredibly warm,” said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather. Tropical-storm force winds could occur in parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend, forecasters said. Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said nearly all models have Erin turning “safely east of the broader U.S. next week.” Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Forecasters are expecting another unusually busy season for the Atlantic, with predictions calling for six to 10 hurricanes, with up to half reaching major status.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Last month, the popular plant-based meat company announced a new product — Beyond Ground — that, unlike its signature plant-based burger, sausage links, and chicken nuggets, isn't meant to directly imitate meat. Instead, it has a neutral flavor that “serves as a blank canvas,” according to the company, for customers to season however they like. Beyond Ground contains only four ingredients — fava beans, potato protein, water, and psyllium husk — and has a macronutrient profile similar to chicken (high in protein, low in fat). It's an “effort to step outside of the confines of mimicking a particular species and just provide something that is capable of confidently standing on its own as a center-of-the-plate protein,” Ethan Brown, Beyond Meat's founder and CEO, told me. The product represents an attempt to meet our current cultural moment, in which wellness has moved beyond mere exercise and nutrition optimization to broader, and dubious, appeals to “natural” living — think the rise of raw milk, the Make America Healthy Again movement, regenerative farming, and homesteading influencers. There's a reason Beyond's advertisements have increasingly featured the bean farmers who supply its ingredients. The recent moves follow similar changes the company made last year, like when it launched the Sun Sausage — a product that's closer to an old-school veggie dog than a high-tech meat imitation — and reformulated its burger to contain less sodium and saturated fat with a simpler and cleaner ingredient list. Moving forward, the industry's success, he said, will depend on making products with “really strong macronutrient content and ratios and then really simple, clean ingredients.” Meanwhile, Impossible Foods — one of Beyond's main competitors — has taken a decidedly different tack. Over the last couple years, Impossible Foods changed its green packaging to a “bold red” design in what it called a “meatier brand identity,” launched an “indulgent” burger (higher in calories, fat, sodium, and protein), recruited the world's top competitive hot dog eater as a spokesperson, and is considering making a “blended” burger composed of half cattle beef, half plant-based beef. It has also stuck by its key ingredient, soy leghemoglobin, which replicates the heme — an iron-rich molecule — found in beef and is made with genetically engineered yeast to give its burgers an especially meaty flavor. Call it a tale of two plant-based meat companies. Both Impossible and Beyond are placing bets on what will retain current customers and attract new ones to the stagnant industry. But the stakes are much higher than just increasing quarterly sales or annual revenue: Plant-based products hold potential to help Americans move away from their high levels of meat consumption, which annually condemns billions of animals to terrible suffering  and fuels environmental crises. That this newer generation of products were developed with advanced food technology was often a selling point. Meat industry interests, progressive foodies, social media influencers, conspiracy theorists, and food researchers slammed plant-based meat as fake, high-tech, ultra-processed, and unhealthy. Sales have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, though these attacks have proven less effective in many European countries, where sales are still growing. It's not controversial to say that Americans would benefit from cutting back on highly processed foods, especially snacks and beverages loaded with added salt and sugar. But the classification system used to determine which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't casts such a wide net that many foods that are more or less healthy get caught in it. They also contain zero cholesterol and offer some fiber, whereas meat does not. “These foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini of the Physicians Association for Nutrition recently told CNN. Each year, billions of genetically manipulated animals are confined indoors, fed unnatural diets of genetically modified corn and soy, given a chemical cocktail of antibiotics and vaccines to stay alive, and after slaughter, their carcasses are doused with chemical disinfectants. But consumers hold plant-based meat to a different standard. Operating in that cultural reality, it makes sense for Beyond to address its criticisms head-on by reformulating its existing products and launching new ones. Beyond's bet largely rests on the idea that a significant share of the US population is seeking to meaningfully cut processed foods from their diets. The company is right, in part: Polls show that many consumers aspire to eat a more minimally processed diet. A recent consumer survey from Purdue University agricultural researchers found that most Americans say they're concerned about processed and ultra-processed foods, but most also believe that they can be part of a healthy diet and value many of their traits: affordability, taste, shelf life, and most of all, their capacity to save them time in the kitchen. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. “Taste is absolutely the #1 purchase driver for consumers considering plant-based meat,” an Impossible Foods spokesperson wrote in an email to Vox. “They're specifically looking for products that most closely resemble conventional meat. In fact, industry data shows that 9 of the top 10 most purchased plant-based burgers in grocery stores are of the ‘meaty' variety rather than the ‘veggie' variety, which is right where our products play.” In a recent blind taste test, many consumers rated several Impossible Meat products as better than or equal to animal meat. 2 spot for US plant-based meat retail sales (50-year-old MorningStar Farms, owned by food giant Kellanova — formerly Kellogg's — is in first place). More recent data shows the two companies are almost tied for US retail sales, with Impossible slightly ahead. It would be a great understatement to say that despite Impossible Foods' impressive standing in blind taste tests and supermarket sales, it hasn't come anywhere within striking distance of its ambition to take over the meat market by 2035, a goal its founder once said was doable. A decade of whiplash, from meteoric rise to slow decline, has left plant-based meat firms trapped: damned if they do, and damned if they don't. They're damned if they do a great job of imitating meat with plants, which requires more food processing and ingredients than the vegetarian products of the 1990s, but puts these newer products at risk of unfair health critiques. (Meanwhile, the protein bar company David and the high-protein milk brand Fairlife, each of whose products are highly processed with ingredients unrecognizable to the average person, are printing money and largely evading criticism.) But plant-based meat companies are also damned if they don't try to imitate meat, risking being relegated to the “for vegetarians only” category of healthier but less appetizing protein offerings. “The tension is real,” Chris Dubois, an executive vice president at Circana, told me. Beyond Meat, he said, has done a great job listening to its customers and reformulating its products to meet the demand for simpler ingredient lists, but “the hard part is, I don't know that that's the path to win long-term.” The animal meat industry has benefited from more than a century of generous government subsidies and favorable policy regimes, while the plant-based meat industry has not, which has created a large price gap between the two. Closing that price gap, Dubois said, could help plant-based meat “creep into people's purchases more.” That might become possible this year, as beef and chicken prices are on the rise. Making plant-based meat products more convenient by, say, having different varieties that are pre-seasoned and easy to cook, should help too, Dubois said. I think he's right on all of these fronts. But ultimately, as I've written about before, plant-based meat faces challenges that are harder to pin down, but are likely more consequential than price, taste, convenience, and macronutrient profiles. In a country where extremely popular meat products like chicken nuggets and hot dogs are highly processed, it's hard to believe that “processing” is really plant-based meat's problem in the eyes of many consumers, rather than a convenient justification for maintaining the status quo. As demonstrated by a number of psychological studies, many people go to great lengths to justify high levels of meat consumption. Making products that are delicious, widely available, easy to cook, and as close as possible in price to animal meat are just the minimum bar plant-based meat companies must meet. Beyond, Impossible, and some of their peers have made strides on all these fronts over the past decade. But to really put a dent in meat sales, they — and their allies in the animal protection, public health, and environmental sustainability movements — will need to redeem plant-based meat in consumers' eyes and clarify what they really are: moderately processed foods with similar or better nutrition to conventional meat, and with a far lighter environmental footprint that doesn't require the confinement and slaughter of animals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The grand irony of the day I was sexually assaulted in Washington, D.C., is that my skirt really was rather short, not that you could actually see it. It was November 2019, and exactly one incriminating inch of skin was visible from my chin to my toes. I was wearing a turtleneck dress, my then-boyfriend's old peacoat, and a pair of thigh-high boots that covered my entire leg up to the bottom of the coat — unless you were searing for a sliver of skin in between my legs for a fraction of a second in between my steps. I was not in a bad area. With permission, I was leaving the Washington Examiner office a little early, just after 3 p.m., to prepare for a joint birthday party I was hosting, walking east on L St. Northwest toward 13th St. toward my Chinatown apartment when I felt the jolt of pressure, then pain, of a stranger's fingers inside of me. I whipped around in a frenzy to see a tall man smiling at me as his hand wove under my coat and between my legs, flashing his ultra white teeth and almost a wink at his little stolen moment, and then he ran down the alley going north. I screamed and stumbled into the street. Later, a detective would tell me that there were multiple private security cameras on the block. The last thing the police told me was that if I ever saw him again, I could make a citizen's arrest. My husband was the victim of a hit and run while he was on a jog, which the police saw but refused to pursue. And my fellow On Deadline cohost has had a gun pulled on him and his car stolen more than once. Glenn Youngkin's (R) 2021 victory liberated Virginia from COVID-19-era tyranny, Mr. Doescher's proposal of a move across the Potomac that came with one of marriage elicited more of a “Hell yes” than an “Oh well.” I still take the metro into D.C. every week to work. So, naturally, it should surprise me that the Democrats who dominate the district evidently do not agree. The ostensibly objective New York Times reporter Peter Baker insinuated that Trump, “citing a nonexistent crime crisis,” was a hypocrite for cracking down on violent crime because he “himself has been convicted of 34 felonies and is the first criminal elected president.” CNN's Dana Bash proclaimed that “the most violent moment in recent history in D.C. was Jan. 6,” and MSNBC's Ken Dilanian declared that crime in D.C. “is actually at historical lows.” The 174 law enforcement officers assaulted that day indeed outnumbered the 60 injured during D.C.'s race riots in May 2020, though nobody was murdered during either event. But crime in D.C. is nowhere near historic lows. In their effort to triple down on opposing everything Trump even suggests, Democrats have deluded themselves into defying the cold, data-driven reality that D.C.'s violent crime rate is a national disgrace. It is true that D.C.'s homicide rate has fallen from its 20-year high in 2023. It is also true that the lower homicide rate in 2024 — 26.6 per 100,000 people — was the fourth highest of the nation's cities and more than twice as high as the murder rates of Bogota, Baghdad, Mexico City, and Nairobi. The city's liberal elite may be subject to carjackings or sex crimes, but they can mostly ignore the worst of violent crime because it simply doesn't affect them. Nearly half of all violent crime victims in D.C. and more than half of its homicide victims are residents of Wards 7 and 8, where nine in 10 residents are black and a quarter are impoverished. D.C.'s dark indigo electorate may not necessarily agree with Trump's solution, but they agree that violent crime is a crisis. Just last year, the Washington Post found that two-thirds of the district's residents consider local crime to be “extremely” or “very” serious, with fewer than a quarter considering themselves “very” safe from crime. For example, officers widely attribute the 5% increase in juvenile crime in 2024 and the fact that juveniles are responsible for two-thirds of carjackings to the more than doubling of truancy at D.C.'s public schools. The 30% of middle schoolers and the majority of high schoolers who are truant have to be doing something all day, and the police suspect that said something is often violent crime. One of the 15-year-old Maryland girls who stabbed a DOGE employee over the weekend had “major truancy issues,” according to Judge Kendra Briggs. All of this is why Republicans are considering bringing the half-century experiment of D.C. home rule to an overdue end. The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform estimates just 200 to 500 people are responsible for D.C.'s thousands of gun crimes, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that convicted sexual predators in general are three times as likely to be rearrested for repeat offenses as other criminals who serve their time. Presumably, the man who attacked me is still out there. Hollywood starlets can flee Studio City for Cannes, and big bankers can trade Manhattan for Miami.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in a New Mexico county riddled with violent crime and drug trafficking, two days after President Donald Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and temporarily took over the local police department. Grisham's order authorizes up to $750,000 in emergency funding for New Mexico's Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to address the crime surge in Rio Arriba, which is located in the northern part of the state, about 25 miles from Santa Fe. “When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,” Grisham said in a statement. “We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.” “The Adjutant General shall order into service any elements of the New Mexico National Guard as are or may be needed to provide military support to civil authorities as needed for this emergency,” the order states. In April, Grisham deployed about 70 New Mexico National Guard members to Albuquerque at the request of the city's police department to combat juvenile crime and fentanyl. The National Guard was used to secure perimeters around crime scenes and manage traffic control in order to free up local law enforcement's resources. Over 100 people have been arrested in the district so far this week. Trump has hinted he will send federal law enforcement to other blue, crime-ridden cities, naming Baltimore and Oakland as examples. While Trump did not name any city in New Mexico, Grisham appears to be getting ahead of the president with her own crime response.</p>

Fox News Digital spotted federal agents patrolling the streets of downtown Washington, D.C. on Wednesday night as the Trump-led crime crackdown ramps up. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy from Fox News Digital) All 800 National Guard members have now been mobilized in Washington, D.C. as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown, according to the Defense Department. The Guard members are not armed, according to Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson. They're supporting other federal law enforcement agencies and are serving duties that include "monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities and officers, traffic control posts and area beautification." "The scope of support may be adjusted based on the needs of our partners," Wilson said. "This would be very similar to the [Los Angeles] mission, where we can temporarily detain someone and then turn them over to the law enforcement." Members of DEA and police patrol streets near the Wharf in Washington, D.C. (Reuters/Evelyn Hockstein) Personnel from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secret Service were spotted patrolling the streets of D.C. Wednesday night, largely in groups, around the city in central downtown locations: Metro Center, 14th Street, Logan Circle and Chinatown. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told "Fox and Friends" that 45 arrests were made overnight, bringing the total to around 100 since the operations formally began on Monday. At least 400 National Guardsmen have reported for duty as of Wednesday, and a total of 800 will be at the ready by the end of the week. They will patrol the city in rotations, with about 200 out at a time. An additional 500 federal agents are a part of the White House's task force to crack down on crime in the district. In addition, D.C. police will extend a juvenile curfew zone in the Navy Yard through Aug. 31, police Chief Pamela Smith announced Thursday. The zone was established after police say a juvenile opened fire in the direction of other minors with a stolen gun, though no one was injured. Police say as many as 100 teens have gathered at night and caused trouble in the Navy Yard throughout the summer. "He thought it was funny," Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jeannine Pirro said of the incident. A police checkpoint stopping vehicles was set up on 14th Street on Wednesday night, and protesters surrounded the checkpoint and shouted, "Go home fascists!" Eight hundred National Guard members willl deploy in Washington, D.C., to crack down on crime. "Look at these 45 victims, all 19 and under, all killed by gunfire in the last 18 months in DC and tell me that crime is down and we don't need an emergency focus on crimes of violence," Pirro wrote on X, alongside a picture of the under-20 victims of gun violence. The D.C. police union chief, Gregg Pemberton, cast doubt on the statistics showing a massive drop in crime over a two-year period. "There's potentially a drop from where we were in 2023. But the department is reporting that in 2024, crime went down 35% – violent crime – and another 25% through August of this year. MPD's 3rd District commander was suspended after MPD said he was changing crime statistics to minimize serious crimes.

Significant resources have been deployed amid the search effort for Grant Gardner, according to an Aug. 11 post on the Big Horn County Wyoming Sheriff's Office Facebook page about the Minnesota man who went missing while hiking in Wyoming and has not been heard from in more than two weeks. "Since our last update considerable resources and man power have been deployed in the search for Grant Gardner," Sheriff Ken Blackburn noted in the post, noting that the effort "has been very active." "To illustrate what is being done to search, the following is a partial list of assets and personnel who are currently, or have been working directly on this search," the post notes, before going on to list various resources, such as "Drones with cameras, capable of identifying colors and minute disturbances," "Drones, helicopters, and planes with FLIR capabilities," "Multiple dog tracking teams," "Horse and foot teams," "Wyoming National Guard," "Private pilots," and more. Grant Gardner was last heard from on July 29 after reaching the top of Cloud Peak, according to the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office. Very thorough searches of these areas have been performed. Mr. Gardner could plausibly be in several areas and routes, all of which have been extensively searched." Grant Gardner's wife Lauren told Cowboy State Daily "he's been hiking for over a decade." The last contact from Gardner was more than two weeks ago, on July 29, when he informed his wife that he had reached the summit of Cloud Peak, according to an Aug. 4 Facebook post from the sheriff's office. "On August 1, 2025 the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office received information regarding an over due hiker in the Cloud Peak Wilderness area, and immediately began a search and rescue operation," the post noted. "Grant Gardner of Minnesota had planned on an approximate three day hike through the Misty Moon Lake area, eventually summiting Cloud Peak, and returning to his vehicle completing his journey. Gardner made contact with his wife on the evening of July 29, 2025 letting her know he'd made it to the summit. Since that time there has not been any contact with Gardner," the post stated. "A text sent to his wife at the summit indicated the climb was more taxing than he expected and he was tired." Gardner and his wife Lauren have two children, according to Cowboy State Daily. "He solo hikes, and he's been hiking for over a decade," she told the outlet. A GoFundMe fundraiser to benefit the family has raised more than $34,000 so far.

San Diego makeup artist Janis Luize Rocha Leites switched to an all-meat carnivore diet for 30 days—eating only meat, salt and water—and says she experienced 20 pounds of weight loss, clear skin and regulated periods. A new study suggests that lean beef may be slightly less disruptive to gut microbiota than white-meat chicken, though the differences were modest and require further research. While it's well-established that foods like fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fermented dairy products can promote beneficial gut bacteria, diets high in meat, fat and sugar are often associated with reduced microbial diversity. However, many previous studies compared meat-inclusive diets to vegetarian ones — and rarely differentiated between types of meat. Researchers looked at how the two protein sources impacted gut microbial diversity, which is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption and immune function. While there were no statistically significant differences in overall microbial diversity between the chicken and beef diets, the chicken-based meals were associated with a decline in diversity, as well as reductions in certain beneficial bacterial groups. By contrast, the beef-based diet showed a slightly smaller impact on microbial diversity, with only one notable reduction in the abundance of a bacterial group known as Chloroflexota. It also appeared to increase the presence of Blautia, a genus of bacteria that can help protect the intestinal mucus barrier and reduce inflammation. Lower microbial diversity has been observed in various chronic health conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. "These findings suggest that the integration of lean red meat from beef (Pirenaica breed) into a healthy dietary pattern could positively influence not only the gut microbiota but also some health indicators," the researchers wrote. The study looked at 16 healthy individuals, most of whom were between 18 and 22 years old, who ate lean beef and white-meat chicken at lunchtime three times a week for eight weeks. After a five-week "washout period," during which participants resumed their normal diets to reset their gut microbiota, they switched to the other meat diet. The two meats were stewed, roasted, grilled and breaded. Stool samples were collected at the beginning and end of each diet period. The researchers highlighted that Pirenaica beef is naturally rich in potassium, zinc and B vitamins, which may have contributed to its relatively gentler impact on gut health. The results, they said, may not apply to other types of beef or to meats prepared or consumed differently. The study also relied on self-reported dietary intake; participants' full diets weren't strictly controlled. Sixteen participants ate lean beef and white-meat chicken three times a week for eight weeks. Additionally, with just 16 participants, the findings should be viewed as preliminary and not broadly generalizable. The researchers called for larger and more diverse studies to explore the complex relationship between different meat types and gut health. Fox News Digital reached out to the study's authors for comment. The findings are consistent with previous research showing that lean beef can be part of a healthy, balanced diet, said one nutritionist. "The shifts in microbiota composition seen may hold promise, but this was a small study and the authors explicitly state that no significant differences were found in overall microbial diversity," Baroukis told Fox News Digital. "The findings are better viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than clinically actionable." Shalene McNeill, a registered dietitian nutritionist and executive director of nutrition research for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), told Fox News Digital the findings are consistent with previous research showing that lean beef can be part of a healthy, balanced diet. Federal law requires cattle producers to contribute $1 per head of cattle sold to the Beef Checkoff program, which funds beef-related marketing and research initiatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration NEW YORK (AP) — As National Guard troops deploy across her city as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is responding with relative restraint. She's called Trump's takeover of the city's police department and his decision to activate 800 members of the guard “ unsettling and unprecedented ” and gone as far as to cast his efforts as part of an “authoritarian push.” But Bowser has so far avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders, despite the unprecedented incursion into her city. “My tenor will be appropriate for what I think is important for the District,” said Bowser, who is in her third term as mayor. “And what's important for the District is that we can take care of our citizens.” Trump has repeatedly threatened an outright takeover of the overwhelmingly Democratic city, which is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 that could be repealed by Congress. Republicans, who control both chambers, have already frozen more than a $1 billion in local spending, slashing the city's budget. That puts her in a very different position from figures such as California Gov. Those efforts come amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that their party has not been nearly aggressive enough in its efforts to counter Trump's actions. “Unfortunately she is in a very vulnerable position,” said Democratic strategist Nina Smith. So that's what we're seeing right now, the mayor trying to navigate a very tough administration. Because this administration has shown no restraint when it comes to any kind of constitutional barriers or norms.” Bowser's approach marks a departure from Trump's first term, when she was far more antagonistic toward the president. This time around, Bowser took a different tact from the start. The change reflects the new political dynamics at play, with Republicans in control of Congress and an emboldened Trump who has made clear he is willing to exert maximum power and push boundaries in unprecedented ways. D.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson said she understands Bowser's position, and largely agrees with her conclusion that a legal challenge to Trump's moves would be a long shot. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in his executive order, declaring a “crime emergency” so his administration could take over the city's police force. The statue limits that control to 30 days unless he gets approval from Congress. Trump told reporters Wednesday that he believes he can extend the 30-day deadline by declaring a national emergency, but said “we expect to be before Congress very quickly.” As mayor of the District of Columbia, Bowser has a very different relationship with the president and federal government than other mayors or governors. For now, Bowser appears set to stick with her approach, saying Wednesday that she is focused on “making sure the federal surge is useful to us.” During a morning interview with Fox 5, she and the city's police chief argued an influx of federal agents linked to Trump's takeover would improve public safety, with more officers on patrol. But Nina Smith, the Democratic strategist, said she believes Bowser needs a course correction. “How many times is it going to take before she realizes this is not someone who has got the best interests of the city at heart?” she asked. A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, reaching its lowest rate in 30 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dahl Memorial's three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors. A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common. Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn't without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians' extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them. The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation. Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can't afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors. “In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs. “I'm not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said. Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn't unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup. The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments. But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state's northeast. Adelman said he supports such laws only where it's feasible, like in Virginia. Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn't possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren't refraining just to save money. He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state's hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians. Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night. Haddock said ACEP wouldn't want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded. Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms. She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said. She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn't enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways. Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn't had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there's a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. People eating at Ekalaka's sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital's clinic all told KFF Health News that they've been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers. Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who've been treated for more serious problems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The peak of the hurricane season is upon us and forecasters are still anticipating higher than normal levels of activity, despite a relatively calm season so far. As of Wednesday afternoon, Tropical Storm Erin is churning in the Atlantic Ocean and moving toward the Caribbean, likely to become the season's first hurricane, a storm with sustained winds above 74 miles per hour. The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30 and typically has 14 storms strong enough to be named, meaning with wind speeds above 39 mph. That's due in part to the El Niño cycle, which is currently in its neutral phase, creating atmospheric conditions more favorable to tropical storms. “As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a news release. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry last month stalled over Texas, where they converged with another weather system and caused a massive downpour that led to deadly flooding in the state's hill country. A key step to saving lives from tropical storms and hurricanes is to anticipate where they might go and get people out of the way. On this front, scientists have made tremendous strides in building longer lead times ahead of a storm's landfall, and new tools are continuing to extend that lead. But the Trump administration's recent cuts to departments that study and forecast weather are undermining this progress, while cuts to emergency agencies are slowing disaster responses. Meteorologists often describe hurricanes as heat engines, meaning that they use a temperature difference to generate wind and rain. This is why the apex of hurricane activity tends to be in September, after the Atlantic Ocean has had all summer to heat up. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, the potential for more powerful hurricanes is increasing. A warmer planet also means rising sea levels as ice caps melt, adding more liquid to the seas. The ocean itself also expands as it gets hotter. Warmer air can also hold onto more moisture, increasing the rainfall during a hurricane. The combined effects of storm surge and more intense rainfall can lead to more flooding, often the deadliest and most destructive aspect of a hurricane. And as the floods in Texas this year showed, even areas that are far inland can suffer severely from hurricane storm systems. So when a hurricane makes landfall, it threatens more lives and takes a bigger bite out of the economy. The good news is that scientists have made huge strides in anticipating hurricanes and can now predict where they are going days in advance. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed a new prediction model called the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. It proved to be better than previous models at predicting a storm's path and intensity. It makes storms harder to predict, and makes evacuating people in their path more hasty and chaotic, as hurricanes surge in strength. Scientists are still trying to tease out the mechanisms behind rapid intensification, but the new model was able to see the rapid intensification coming in Hurricanes Helene and Milton from their earliest advisories, days before landfall. But while NOAA has made improvements in its forecasts, the agency itself has faced big cuts from the Trump administration, including staff who work on hurricane modeling. The White House has proposed cutting its budget by a quarter, eliminating research divisions like the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which studies hurricanes. Several field offices for the National Weather Service under NOAA currently lack lead meteorologists, and key forecasting tools like weather balloon launches have seen a decline. The National Weather Service is now scrambling to hire back hundreds of employees. The true scope of these vulnerabilities won't be revealed until after a major hurricane. And even if the US dodges the worst of Erin, there are still more than two months left in the hurricane season, which has yet to reach its peak. Herds in North America will likely be hit the hardest. Rising temperatures are rewriting the earliest stages of life. It probably has nothing to do with saving birds. America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most. A growing number of thinkers say factory farming can help save the planet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighty years ago, as the sea swayed him from side to side on an attack vessel heading towards Iwo Jima, Thomas Begay started to feel afraid. “On the ship, they said: ‘get your last scrap of steak and eggs,'” he recalled. “That gave (me) some kind of feeling in my stomach. “It's a scary thing,” the veteran told CNN from his home in Window Rock, Arizona. Begay landed on the island as a member of the 5th Marine Division, but his role was unique: He was a Navajo Code Talker, deployed into battle to help the US military send encrypted messages that enemy forces were unable to decipher. More than 400 Navajo Code Talkers were sent to the Pacific during World War II, operating alongside the Marines at pivotal battles including those at Saipan, Guam, Tinian and Iwo Jima. Their code proved vital: it was never cracked by the Japanese, and allowed US troops to organize their movements without the enemy's knowledge. Thursday is National Navajo Code Talker Day – an annual celebration created by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. It is also the 80th anniversary of Japan's initial surrender in World War II, which effectively ended the costliest war in human history. The documents codifying their surrender were signed a few weeks later. CNN spoke to both – Peter MacDonald, 96, and Begay, who is now 100 – about their recollections from the war and how their contributions are recognized across the US. But while their service is recorded in history books, how they are remembered remains a live issue. For MacDonald, they are trends with troubling historical echoes. “Over 100 years, we lived through all of that discrimination.” “At what America has done to Native Americans, and maybe other minorities.” “We cannot go on this way.” The secretive and dangerous journey that led MacDonald into America's history books began when he saw another member of his clan in a Marines uniform. MacDonald was told he'd need to enlist with the Marines. MacDonald lied about his age and enlisted. “This is our land and we're going to protect it.” Native people had been full American citizens for just two decades, but they still didn't have the right to vote. Many Native children, including a significant portion of the Code Talker cohort, were still being taken from their families and forced to enroll in boarding schools, where they were stripped of their language and other traditions. With the Marines MacDonald was summoned to a meeting, where he found dozens of fellow Navajo. And in that room, he discovered a secret: The same Navajo language that many of his peers were forced to abandon was now being used to win a war. The Code Talkers developed an extensive and complicated code based on their own language, which substituted key military and geographical terms for related images. “Tank” became “chay-da-gahi,” which means “turtle.” “Fighter plane” “was da-he-tih-hi,” or “hummingbird.” In many cases, they were forced to invent new words altogether, because Navajo didn't contain direct translations. When Code Talkers were deployed in battle they were assigned Marine escorts for protection after multiple Code Talkers were mistaken for Japanese soldiers and confronted by US troops. “A lot of times we were mistaken for Japanese,” Chester Nez, a Code Talker who died in 2014, said in an oral history interview for the Library of Congress. Nez recalled being stopped by a Marine while walking back to camp with a fellow Code Talker on the island of Guadalcanal in 1942. Nez, barred from disclosing any information about the Code Talker program even to fellow Marines, said the pair were telephone operators. “He didn't believe us,” Nez said “This guy took a .45 and stuck it in my head and my body … that was the most scary thing that happened to me.” Code Talkers spoke into their hefty radios when an instruction needed relaying. In all, more than 800 messages were sent between Code Talkers at Iwo Jima. It had been hoisted by six Marines days earlier, a moment captured in an iconic photograph by the Associated Press photojournalist Joe Rosenthal. “We had really gotten used to being treated as a second-class citizen,” MacDonald said, adding his experience was “no different” after his return. “We were not rich at all,” he continued. “Right away I started asking him questions at the dinner table,” said Ronald Begay, himself a veteran of the Army. “I didn't know that, because it was never in the history books. Begay retired in 1984 after 40 years of federal service as a superintendent at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Chinle, Arizona. But he was sentenced to jail time in 1990 on federal and tribal charges, including bribery and racketeering; his earlier refusal to step down when placed on administrative leave led to a lengthy standoff and ultimately a riot in which two of his supporters died. President Bill Clinton would ultimately commute his sentence to time served. At a White House reception hosted by President Donald Trump in 2017, MacDonald said he and his then-12 fellow surviving Code Talkers had one last mission: to ensure the memory of their accomplishments was kept alive. It is not a memory that has always been respected. But the production was critically panned and criticized for its historical inaccuracies. About 20% of the movie was Navajo Code Talkers. 80% of the movie was about Nicolas Cage and whatever problem he was having with his girlfriend,” he said. For several years, one of the best collections of artifacts relating to the Code Talkers was found in an unlikely place: a Burger King in Kayenta, Arizona. Earlier this year, the surviving Code Talkers experienced an unexpected new assault on their legacy. Amid a sweeping purge of webpages that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, the Pentagon wiped a number of pages honoring the contribution of MacDonald, Begay and their peers. It was part of a hurried crackdown that also saw the deletion of information completely unrelated to DEI issues – like Holocaust remembrance, suicide prevention and the Enola Gay aircraft – or pages that commemorated other war heroes like World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves and historically significant service members such as baseball great Jackie Robinson. “The new administration came in, and I guess they want to change a lot of things,” MacDonald told CNN. “They wanted nothing, no words, about Navajo Code Talkers.” Multiple defense officials told CNN at the time that military units were instructed to simply use keyword searches like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “history” and “first” when searching for articles and photos to remove. Ronald Begay, who champions his father's efforts to preserve the Code Talkers' legacy, said he was “appalled” by the saga. “I immediately started texting the Navajo Code Talker descendants, as well as some prominent veterans – we support each other in various ways,” he said. “Why would they do that?” he asked. “After all, that's why we are free … our language was historic.” But for the Code Talkers and their descendants, it struck at the heart of a deep-rooted fear: that their legacy will be sidelined once MacDonald and Begay are not longer around to tell their stories. “We need a good ‘thank you' from the people who have become wealthy in America,” MacDonald said. MacDonald and other Code Talkers have campaigned for years to make the museum project a reality, but it remains tens of millions of dollars out of reach, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported in 2023. CNN has contacted organizers of the project for an update on its progress. “I don't believe (people) understand this tremendous contribution to the battle in the Pacific War,” he said. The next time a post-war milestone is met, it is possible that no Code Talkers will be alive to greet it. But MacDonald and Begay hope their contribution to American history is remembered once they are no longer present to tell their stories. “And we need to keep it that way.” “We need to get back to serious thinking (about) how we're gonna live into the next century,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three sheriff's deputies injured in gunfire while executing warrants in southern Virginia were “shaken up” but doing well, officials said Wednesday. In this screenshot taken from video, law enforcement responds to an active shooting situation in Pittslyvania County, Va., Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025. GRETNA, Virginia (AP) — Three sheriff's deputies injured in gunfire while executing warrants in southern Virginia on Wednesday were “shaken up” but doing well, officials said. The warrants were for brandishing a firearm and trespassing, said Pittsylvania County Sheriff Michael W. Taylor. They were also serving a protective order, he said. There was an hourslong standoff but it ended peacefully and with the suspected shooter in custody, Taylor told reporters afterward. And they're going through the process now of trying to heal,” Taylor said, adding: “They're OK.” The officers all appear to have been wounded by shrapnel and none was directly hit, Taylor said. Rick Garletts, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said agents would likely be at the scene all night collecting evidence. “We're very happy that there were no further injuries tonight. This could have ended much worse than it did,” Garletts said. “I'm glad he gave himself up and came on out.” Photos and video from the scene showed a large number of parked police and emergency response vehicles. U.S. Rep. John McGuire, who represents Virginia's 5th congressional district, had earlier said in a post on X that his thoughts and prayers were with deputies and their families. “We are closely following the situation and keeping everyone affected in our hearts during this difficult time,” McGuire wrote. Pittsylvania County is located along the state's southern border with North Carolina, about 98 miles (158 kilometers) northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our street!” and “Go home!” at federal and local law enforcement officers conducting a vehicle checkpoint stop across 14th Street NW on Wednesday night. Dozens of Department of Homeland Security and Metropolitan Police Department officers stood on the block between V and W streets to question passing drivers while several protesters directed traffic away from the scene. Officers at the traffic safety compliance checkpoint issued 38 notices of infractions and made one arrest, according to an MPD spokesperson. “During the checkpoint, 344 vehicles passed through, 28 were stopped, 38 [Notice of Infractions] were issued, and MPD made one arrest for No Permit and Counterfeit Tags,” the MPD spokesperson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Since 2023, the Metropolitan Police Department has conducted weekly traffic safety compliance checkpoints. Kenneth, a 28-year-old resident of the U Street Corridor who lives close to Wednesday's checkpoint, ran into a nearby drugstore to purchase materials to make a sign directing traffic away from it once he saw the officers stopping drivers. “This is a dark period for our city,” Kenneth said. “Obviously, we don't want federal control over our police department. I just knew that during these times, you've got to do your part. So I was just trying to redirect traffic so people were not stopped for something that they were not expecting. Kenneth said he found the 14th Street checkpoint to be “a huge drain on local resources when there's actually areas of our city that might need assistance.” “Between V and W on 14th street, you're not going to find anything,” Kenneth said. Another protester in her mid-20s, Meera, also helped direct traffic away from the block as soon as she saw the checkpoint assembling from her nearby apartment complex. She said she felt empowered by the neighborhood's resistance but also saddened to see federal officers in her own neighborhood. “Especially as this area was so rapidly gentrified within the past 10 years. Them pulling people here feels much more horrible.” Trump posted images of several homeless encampments in the district on Truth Social Sunday, writing, “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” The Washington Examiner spoke with several homeless people living in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood about the administration's plans to crack down on homeless encampments. Meghann Abraham, 34, said she just completed her associate's degree in homeland security at the College of Southern Maryland and plans to pursue her bachelor's degree soon. She said the MPD served her an eviction notice last week, saying she needs to remove her property from the area. “The Metropolitan Police Department came by with a little sticker that said if your property is still here on this date at this time — for us it's the 29th of August at 10 a.m. — you have to be out or they will throw it out,” Abraham said. “At Martin Luther King Library, they came with a dumpster truck and asked, ‘Does anyone know whose this is? I will say, they were trying to get in touch with people.” Abraham said she has a few options for where to move her belongings. She said a lot of people who walk past her in the district gawk and stare, giving her smug looks. She noted a driver the other day yelled, “Where's your house at?” when driving past her. “When you get treated the same way over and over again, you do start to internalize it,” Abraham said. Abraham's friend and fellow homeless person, Mr. Spann, 37, also noted what he sees as a misconception that all homeless people are not hard-working. He addressed his thoughts on the Trump administration's push to clean up homeless encampments throughout the district as part of its effort to combat crime. He and Abraham have received paper warnings from various advocacy groups detailing the federal law enforcement presence and the Trump administration's rhetoric toward homeless people. “Where are we supposed to go?” Mr. Spann said. From this hour to this hour, just be locked in the room with whatever random person off the street that we decide you get to live with.” Abraham pointed to her tent and said, “This is easier.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler touted that her agency guarantees approximately 2,000 small business loans every week, Laura Pager, a small business contractor who says she has lost out on millions of dollars in work this year in the wake of the Department of Government Efficiency's slashing of the federal government, wrote it down in disbelief. Pager, the president of an Illinois-based contracting firm that contracts with agencies across the federal government, was sitting in the third row at an event hosted by GOP Sen. Joni Ernst with Loeffler and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs learn more about federal and state contracting opportunities in the Trump administration. “I don't know who the 2,000 small businesses are that were approved every week,” said Pager, the president of Gale Construction Company. This equates to nearly 2,500 loans per week,” SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons told CNN. The small businesses event hosted this week by Ernst at Iowa State University comes as her party has been tasked with using Congress' month away from Washington to sell President Donald Trump's massive agenda. In her nearly three decades of experience, Pager says she has not seen anything like the current environment for small businesses. She's lost out, she said, on approximately $6 million in work this year after DOGE pulled contracts as part of its federal cost-cutting efforts — one to secure a federal building in Pittsburgh that houses the Internal Revenue Service and Army Corps of Engineers and the other to fix the HVAC at an airport control tower in Maine. She said that a go-to contact for her at the SBA, a region-based business opportunity specialist who helps small businesses navigate the federal government, retired with no one appearing to replace her “We don't have the number of resources and the people to go to anymore,” said Pager, who said she voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and works mostly with Republicans. “Agencies we work with generally have a much more limited staff now. While Trump and his Cabinet are seeking to promote business in the United States and tout the president's signature legislative achievement so far, their push to downsize the federal government has left some business owners and entrepreneurs with questions as they try to navigate a changing environment. It's requiring a threading of the needle for agency heads and GOP lawmakers —Republicans, who have broadly called for slashing federal spending, now find themselves having to make the case for why small businesses should find their agencies a worthy investment partner. In Iowa this week, they looked to frame the debate. On top of Loeffler and Zeldin's visits, Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins visited the Iowa State Fair over the weekend to announce new rural development investments and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright is expected to visit the state later this week. Ernst, who's facing reelection in 2026 and wouldn't comment to CNN Tuesday whether she plans to defend her seat, says her third annual “Made in America Expo” was designed to help businesses in her state develop direct relationships with the decisionmakers in the federal government. Many small business directors for their respective agencies were in attendance. To hear Loeffler, Zeldin and Ernst describe it, the Biden administration was completely wrong in how it tackled small business development. Part of their pitch in how they are making opportunities better for small businesses was highlighting the extensive cuts they've made to their agencies to eliminate what they saw as waste and emphasizing their desire to get government out of the way to encourage more manufacturing and investments in the US. The administrators and Ernst pointed to wins from Trump's tax and spending law, which will create several tax breaks that benefit small businesses, such as allowing businesses to fully and immediately deduct the cost of building new manufacturing facilities. The trio also credited Trump with keeping overall inflation tame in July and pointed to investments like the more than $90 billion from private companies across tech, energy and finance to turn Pennsylvania into an artificial intelligence hub. Ernst, who chairs the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, promoted her new, bipartisan legislation that would increase the maximum loan limit for small businesses in an aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Meanwhile at the event, Iowa GOP Rep. Randy Feenstra stood in front of a crowd of small business leaders and entrepreneurs to make his case for why they should support Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts law. “Maybe some of you don't always think it's beautiful. I do,” Feenstra quipped, before ticking through a list of tax breaks that are geared toward helping small businesses specifically. Feenstra, who has launched an exploratory committee for governor, is not facing a tough reelection battle should he remain in the House. But two of his Republican Iowan colleagues, GOP Rep. Zach Nunn and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, are running in some of the most competitive House races in the country for next year's midterms and are having to be even more delicate in their pitch. Majority Leader Steve Scalise was in Iowa this week making public appearances with Nunn and Miller-Meeks and fundraising on their behalf. Speaking with CNN at the Iowa State Fair, Scalise and Nunn laid out their perspective to voters and provided a window into how Republicans are trying to sell Trump's landmark legislation – instead of getting pulled into discussing the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files. But businesses in Iowa, a Republican stronghold that uses more clean energy than many blue states, must also contend with Republicans' rollback of clean energy tax credits. Scalise and Nunn argued the elimination of those credits doesn't mean they don't support renewable energy, but argued the elimination was designed to create an even playing field and ween the US off of foreign energy. “We've got a great opportunity here in Iowa with wind. We are the number one producer and consumer of wind. “It's most important that we're not dependent on foreign energy anymore. “By putting in place responsible work requirements, now it's going to help the truly needy be able to get better care in programs like Medicaid. And then the folks that are going to go get work, which is a good thing by the way, are going to be able to get work and get a job and get health care in the private sector, which is going to be even better than Medicaid,” he said. But for some in attendance at Ernst's event on Tuesday, what the officials were selling wasn't the full picture. Victor Santana, who owns a Chicago-based company that helps hundreds of small businesses nationwide secure federal contracts, said he spent most of the event introducing small business owners to representatives from federal agencies. Santana, who said he has been in the business for 24 years and prides himself on his government contacts, said he's gotten few answers about replacements or a path forward after the slashing of the federal workforce. “That's scary because a lot of these small businesses need to know. It's very hard to work with government and get those answers.” Jordi Quevedo-Valls, who co-founded a startup marketplace designed to facilitate the buying and selling of small businesses, said the EPA's rollback of environmental protections is concerning and has a real impact on how businesses move forward. I mean, the science is there,” Quevedo-Valls, who said he “reluctantly” voted for Harris in 2024, told CNN. “I'm glad that they're pro-business, but I think that they're pushing creation of business and not worrying as much about existing businesses, especially in the labor force that we're in,” said Heikens, who works at an Iowa-based food manufacturing company that feeds between 50,000-70,000 people a week in the restaurant and health care industries. “In the manufacturing world it is tough already, and if you're putting a bunch of money into new businesses, that's just thinning the herd already.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five years ago, I was violently attacked and sexually assaulted in broad daylight in Washington, D.C., by a homeless man. But if you look for evidence that the attack happened in the city's crime statistics, you won't find it. The truth of what happened to me and the D.C. government's role in it is as much a public scandal as it is a personal trauma. Even though a judge sentenced my attacker to hard time in prison, D.C. police leadership would rather deceive the public and appear less dangerous than list mine and countless other sexual assaults on their website. The extent of crime in D.C. has been debated by the Left and Right since President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he would take federal action to crack down on problems in the District of Columbia. But if the public wants to have an honest conversation about crime in D.C., the MPD will first have to be honest about how prevalent crime is. Without MPD's honesty about the crimes that it has chosen to hide from its public-facing stats page, the White House cannot get an accurate picture of how bad the problem actually is and adequately fix it. For me, the story began long before that attack. I was saving up money to buy a condo and planned to spend the next few decades in Washington, the intersection of politics and media. You took Ubers and Lyfts, told others if you were walking after dark so they knew when you were home, and knew to be aware of your surroundings, almost to the point of paranoia. I never made it to the post office.Just one block from my apartment building's entrance, I was attacked by a large man well over six feet tall. He charged at me for a reason that I still do not understand. In broad daylight and on well-traveled 2nd Street NE next to Union Station, I fought to get away as he sexually assaulted me. If it had not been for others in the vicinity, including a construction worker named Donny who heard my screaming and ran to my rescue, I don't know if I would be here today. Despite my background working with federal law enforcement, it was only through my experience as a victim that I learned personally of two ways that D.C. police and the courts fail the public. I share those now with the hope that they inform the public and leaders to improve how crime is handled and prevented. My attacker was arrested on the street months later, charged, and pleaded guilty to a sex abuse charge nearly two years later. MPD's “Crime Cards” online statistics page omits mentioning it, though. Do you know what that communicates to a victim? When I asked MPD in 2020 why my incident was not on its crime map, an MPD spokesman said the city only includes 1st degree felonies under its crime stats. That would mean that for every person robbed, assaulted, or sexually abused in anything less than egregious ways, you have not been counted into the total tally. The pain you suffered was not severe enough, according to MPD's standards. In a follow-up email to the MPD this week, an MPD spokesperson stated after a back-and-forth exchange that the map includes some sex abuse charges, but not all of them. The Left and out-of-touch elite reporters have purported this week that things are fine in Washington because crime is trending down, while the Right has maintained that the Metropolitan Police Department's statistics have been manipulated to paint a rosier picture of the situation. Turns out, it is actually worse than they knew. Police arrested him, but he was immediately released from jail by the judge who presided over the case. Not jailing him until trial felt like a death sentence. How could I leave my home with him out on the streets, living in a tunnel a few blocks from where I lived? Trial proceedings were set to begin in the fall of 2020, but amid the George Floyd riots in downtown Washington, it was delayed until early 2021. The U.S. Attorney's office assured me it was not because the federal prosecutors were busy bringing hundreds of cases against January 6th offenders. The U.S. Attorney's office would inform me through mail notifications and phone calls of updates to my case. He was arrested in five separate incidents after being released, and after each arrest, the judge permitted his immediate release, even when he was caught in public with a machete. I have thought about these failures by the police and courts for the past five years, but I have not been sure how to bring attention to them. Right now, we have a rare chance to bring meaningful change. Anna Giaritelli is a homeland security reporter for the Washington Examiner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Sam Altman, the artificial intelligence hype master, is in damage-control mode. OpenAI's latest version of its vaunted ChatGPT bot was supposed to be “PhD-level” smart. It was supposed to be the next great leap forward for a company that investors have poured billions of dollars into. Instead, ChatGPT got a flatter, more terse personality that can't reliably answer basic questions. It highlighted the many existing shortcomings of generative AI that critics were quick to seize on (more on that in a moment, because they were quite funny). It raised serious doubts about OpenAI's ability to build and market consumer products that human beings are willing to pay for. That should be particularly concerning for investors, given OpenAI, which has never turned a profit, is reportedly worth $500 billion. During a livestream ahead of the launch last Thursday, Altman said talking to GPT-5 would be like talking to “a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything, any area you need.” In his typically lofty style, Altman said GPT-5 reminds him of “when the iPhone went from those giant-pixel old ones to the retina display.” The new model, he said, is “significantly better in obvious ways and subtle ways, and it feels like something I don't want to ever have to go back from,” Altman said in a press briefing. Users had a field day testing GPT-5 and mocking its wildly incorrect answers. 500 billion dollars and the robot can't even count to twelve[image or embed] The bot returned an image of nine people instead, with rather creative spellings of America's early leaders, like “Gearge Washingion” and “William Henry Harrtson.” A similar prompt for the last 12 presidents returned an image that included two separate versions of George W. Bush. Except the second time, George Jr. looked like just some random guy. At first I thought GPT 5 had got this right then I saw things like  "Tonnessee," "Mississipo" and my personal favourite "West Wigina." Please do not respond just saying the different typos to me we can all read the joke, we all know about "Distrricke"[image or embed] Labeling basic maps of the United States also proved tricky for GPT-5 (but again, pretty funny, as tech writer Ed Zitron's post on Bluesky showed). GPT-5 did slightly better when I asked it on Wednesday for a map of the US. Some people can, in fact, label the great state of Vermont correctly without a PhD, but not GPT-5. And this is the first I'm hearing of states named “Yirginia.” But some regular fans of ChatGPT weren't laughing. Especially because users have been particularly alarmed by the new version's personality – or rather, lack thereof. “I'm so done with ChatGPT 5,” one user wrote on Reddit, explaining how they tried to use the new model to run “a simple system” of tasks that an earlier ChatGPT model used to handle. The user said GPT-5 “went rogue,” deleting tasks and moving deadlines. And while OpenAI's defenders could chalk that up to an isolated or even made-up incident, within 24 hours of the GPT-5 launch Altman was doing damage control, seemingly caught of guard by the bad reception. “But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!” The CEO's failure to anticipate the outrage suggests he doesn't have a firm grasp on how an estimated 700 million weekly active users are engaging with his product. Perhaps Altman missed all the coverage — from CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal — of people forming deep emotional attachments to ChatGPT or rival chatbots, having endless conversations with them as if they were real people. Basic market research should have shown OpenAI that a mass update sunsetting the tools people rely on would be more than just a bit bumpy. When asked about the backlash to GPT-5, an OpenAI representative pointed CNN to Altman's public statements on social media announcing the return of older models, as well as a blog post about how the company is optimizing GPT-5. The messy rollout speaks to how the AI industry as a whole is struggling to prove themselves as producers of consumer goods rather than “labs” — as they love to call themselves, because it sounds more scientific and distracts people from the fact that they are backed by people who are trying to make unfathomable amounts of cash for themselves. AI companies often base their fanfare around how a model performs in various behind-the-scenes benchmark tests that show how well a bot can do complex math. “I honestly didn't think OpenAI would burn the brand name on something so mid,” wrote prominent researcher and AI critic Gary Marcus. “In a rational world, their valuation would take a hit,” he added, noting OpenAI still hasn't turned a profit, is slashing prices to keep its user numbers up, and is hemorrhaging talent as competition heats up. For critics like Marcus, the GPT-5 flop was a kind of vindication. As he noted in a blog post, other models like Elon Musk's Grok aren't faring much better, and the backlash from even AI proponents feels like a turning point. When people talk about AI, they're talking about one of two things: the AI we have now — chatbots with limited, defined utility — and the AI that companies like Altman's claim they can build — machines that can outsmart humans and tell us how to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our crops, all while entertaining and delighting us along the way.
