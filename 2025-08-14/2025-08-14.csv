    EDITOR'S NOTE Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.



            With Taylor Swift, a new album unveils a new “era,” and a new era dictates a new costume. This time, she embodies the dazzling spirit of a Las Vegas dancer for her upcoming album “The Life of a Showgirl.”
    


            It's a far cry from the woolen overcoats and broderie-anglais dresses of “Folklore” (2020), or the copper baker boy hats of “Red” (2012). But on this record, Swift is interrogating an increasingly large part of her life — her experience as a world-famous pop star and lacquered performer. In 2024, her “Era's Tour,” which took place in 51 cities across 5 continents, became the highest-grossing tour of all time. On “New Heights,” the podcast her boyfriend Travis Kelce runs with his older brother Jason, Swift said she wrote the album during the tour's European leg. “Literally living the life of a showgirl,” said Travis Kelce. “It's the life behind it all, it's the life beyond the show,” said Swift.
    


            On the cover of the record, the singer is dressed in a crystal embellished demi-bra with webs of jewels trailing down her torso and submerged in what appears to be a bathtub. In another image, she poses with her arms wide in another showgirl-inspired outfit covered in sparkling gems. But the sexed-up, glamorous costumes are juxtaposed with empty theatres and cold, green light, perhaps a nod to the quiet, lonelier moments after everybody has gone home.
    


            While the decision to expose more skin in this way is a new direction for Swift as an artist, she isn't the first performer to embrace the sartorial codes of this type of entertainer. In fact, she is in excellent company.
    


            Modern-day pop stars have long referenced the image of the showgirl. Typically dating back to late 19th century Parisian music halls, chorus girls, burlesque or fan dancers were defined by their glamorous, often revealing, matching outfits. The Las Vegas showgirl, which later became its own brand entirely, is now more closely associated with crystalline cage bras, diamanté panties and tall feather headdresses.
    


            Stars such as Beyoncé, Katy Perry and Mariah Carey have all taken turns dressing up in the iconic garb. Carey for her 2009 music video “I Stay in Love,” Perry for “Waking up in Vegas” the same year and Beyoncé while performing at an entertainment resort in Atlantic City in 2012. Christina Aguilera's scene-stealing performance of “Lady Marmalade” in Moulin Rouge means she is now inextricably linked with showgirl styling. (She is also an executive producer on the theater show “Burlesque: The Musical” currently on show in London's West End). For her 2005 tour, Kylie Minogue performed at least four songs in a leotard dripping in crystals, a giant feather bustle and an enormous feather headdress. More recently Addison Rae, whose 2025 self-titled album made the charts in both the US and UK, donned a gem-encrusted cage bra for her “High Fashion” music video.
    


            Why have these pop stars been so drawn to the glittering facade of a showgirl? It could be the feminine styling, the makeup, the intricate costuming designed to captivate audiences and make the most of stage lighting. Or perhaps they feel an affinity to these hard-working dancers, outside of the obvious glitz and glamour: Their dedication, talent and grit.
    


            Last year, night after night, Swift performed for stadiums of people in high-octane outfits, drawing on a seemingly bottomless reserve of energy. It was a grueling schedule, perhaps rivalled only by that of a Vegas showgirl. Of the album's contents, Swift said: “It's what I was going through off-stage.” No matter what happens in private, both understand the show must go on.

             In ancient Celtic folklore, Tír na nÓg is the land of eternal youth, where time stands still and people don't age.
    


            Today, in the west of Ireland, they've come close to bottling it.
    


            Westport, a small coastal town in picturesque County Mayo, is the unlikely nerve center of the world's Botox supply. A facility operated by the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company AbbVie employs at least 1,300  local people and about 500 additional contractors  – an economic backbone to a town of barely 7,000 people.
    


            Therapeutic Botox – used for conditions that include muscle spasticity, migraines, overactive bladders, certain eye conditions and excessive sweating  – brought in $3.3 billion for AbbVie last year, with sales of cosmetic Botox, often used to smooth facial wrinkles, generating $2.72 billion.
    


            But last week, US President Donald Trump took a step toward his goal of bringing that multi-billion-dollar industry home, announcing 15% tariffs on all pharmaceutical exports from the European Union.
    


            It's a move that some fear could devastate towns like Westport, which has been transformed by the plant, from its opening by Allergan in 1977 to its acquisition and expansion in 2020 by AbbVie.
    


            Inside the sprawling 61-acre campus – a sleek industrial presence nestled below Croagh Patrick, one of the country's most storied pilgrimage sites – vials of Botox are processed and packaged in powder form, before export to some 70 countries, according to industry estimates.
    


            The US tops the list, accounting for 70% of total turnover at the Westport plant, which also makes eyecare products, according to the company's 2023 filings.
    


            Uncertainty about how the tariffs will impact the company has created anxiety for some in Westport, a community where the long-term benefits of the plant's presence cannot be overstated. It's embedded in the community, powering everything from infrastructure to sports teams and local charities.
    


            At AbbVie United Park, the home ground for the Westport United soccer club, where many of the company's workers and their families gather to train or cheer from the sidelines, locals said the tariffs could have a significant impact.
    


            No employee of AbbVie would speak on the record with CNN. But daycare center owner Anne-Marie, who chose not to give her surname for privacy reasons, said she had heard many parents who work at the plant – and leave their children in her care – voice anxiety about what could lie ahead.
    


            “They are worried about their jobs, they just don't know how it's going to go. Is it going to affect them? Are they going to have a job this time next year? Is the company going to be able to keep going?” she said.
    


            “And it'll have a knock-on effect for me, you know,” she said, adding: “If they don't have a job, I won't have a job.”
    


            Brian Cusack, from the soccer club's development committee, was generally more upbeat about the future but believes “a lot of change is going to happen, and maybe not change for the good.”
    


            “Westport doesn't know what it's like without an American pharmaceutical treatment place. And I don't think we'd like to find out what it looks like without it,” said Cusack, whose 25-year-old daughter also works at the plant.
    


            Last month, after weeks of uncertainty, the US-EU trade deal was finally agreed upon. While some in Ireland and the wider bloc welcomed the agreement, other European leaders considered it an exercise in damage limitation. The calm after its announcement was to be short-lived.
    


            Singling out Ireland – the world's third-largest pharma exporter and home to pharma giants Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer – Trump said last Tuesday that upcoming tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could reach 250% over the next 18 months. The threat comes as the US is currently conducting a Section 232 investigation into whether foreign drugs threaten national security, a process whose outcome could override the current US-EU trade deal.
    


            “We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” he said.
    


            But tariffs alone aren't likely to spark a mass move. While the idea of bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US resonates with Trump's base, putting it into practice is fraught with challenges.
    


            Experts say that while some drug production may shift to existing US facilities, full-scale reshoring is unlikely due to high costs, regulatory hurdles, supply chain challenges, and the long timelines for building or relocating high-tech plants – delays that could outlast any political changes.
    


            Anne-Marie suggested that the US president's moves could be purely political but said they have still managed to sow widespread concern.
    


            Still, she pointed to the resilience of the town – and Ireland – expressing the belief that Westport's industry will be able to outlast his administration.
    


            “When he goes out of power, it's just gonna all change again  – like it did the last time,” she said, referring to Trump's first term in office and noting that people's lives can't be dictated by what she characterized as the whims of one man.
    


            It's an attitude that is felt around the town.
    


            As traffic buzzed through the area, Mayo councillor Peter Flynn told CNN that while the tariffs have created “a real headache,” people there are “getting on with their lives.”
    


            Flynn, who worked at Allergan for nearly three decades, said that Trump's push to quickly bring manufacturing to the US was unrealistic.
    


            “This kind of ‘lift and shift' approach that Donald Trump is talking about – it's nonsensical,” he said. He argues that moving operations is extremely difficult, even domestically—let alone overseas—because of the gross logistical challenges it brings, let alone the skilled workers it requires, many of whom he says are now leaving the US “at speed.”
    


            Plus, he added, “anyone that's considering a location to move to – be it India or some of these other locations where a lot of graduates come from – are now taking the US off their map.”
    


            AbbVie, which declined to speak with CNN for this story, has not signaled any plans to move its Botox production hub.
    


            Addressing the tariffs in a recent public earnings call, AbbVie president Robert A. Michael said that the company was “having constructive discussions with the administration on sectoral tariffs,” and noted that it will “obviously continue to invest in the US.” On Tuesday, the company announced a $195 million investment in its Chicago manufacturing plant, in what it said was part of a broader commitment to invest more than $10 billion in US projects over the next decade.
    


            Other major drugmakers have also announced that they'll be scaling up American investment in response to the new tariffs.
    


            What these investments might mean for Ireland is unclear.
    


            But it's possibly not great news. Last year, pharmaceuticals made up €44 billion ($51.2 billion) of Ireland's total €72.6 billion ($84.5 billion) of exports to the US.
    


            Ahead of the tariff deal, Ireland appeared to proactively fast-track exports: €20 billion ($23 billion) worth of pharma goods were shipped to the US in the first two months of this year, according to official trade data.
    


            And while a trade war appears to have been averted for now, American consumers could be at the receiving end of soaring drug costs.
    


            ING analyst Diederik Stadig told CNN that a 15% tariff could increase US drug prices by 7% to 10%, adding up to $13 billion annually to health care costs. Consumers could shoulder the burden over time through higher health insurance premiums and increased drug prices at pharmacies.
    


            For products like cosmetic Botox, which isn't covered by US health insurance, the costs of procedures already considered a luxury could also rise, analysts say, putting a further strain on wallets.
    


            That's of concern to Westport hotelier Michael Lennon, whose US clientele are key to the tourism industry.
    


            Driving to pick up his American guests, who were horse riding at a nearby beach on Clew Bay, where he runs an equestrian trekking outfit, Lennon said he wasn't so worried about the Westport plant taking a hit.
    


            “There's innovative thinking in every one of our businesses… and I think we'll adapt,” Lennon said, as his jeep rattled along the Wild Atlantic Way, a scenic route along the country's rugged coast.
    


            “My worry would be that it (the increase in tariffs) could upset the American economy, and we need all these Americans coming to Ireland.”
    


            He then recalled a conversation he had with a Trump-supporting guest, who told him: “What's good for America is good for Ireland.”
    


            Lennon said he hopes that's true.
    


            “But I don't know. And neither does she,” he said.

The US Treasury Department has issued a temporary waiver for certain sanctions on Russia, allowing transactions related to the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.   

The announcement was made on Wednesday by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ahead of the summit between Trump and Putin scheduled for Friday in Anchorage, Alaska.

The sanctions waiver covers transactions that are “normally incidental to and necessary for the attendance at or support of meetings in the state of Alaska,” although it does not authorize the “unblocking or release of any property blocked or effectively immobilized.”

The pause is set to remain in effect until August 20, OFAC noted. 

The upcoming summit is expected to focus on the Ukraine conflict, as well as on a broader range of issues related to bilateral US-Russia ties.

Washington and Moscow have both been cautious about their expectations, signaling the meeting is likely to be the first top-level event in a string of talks rather than yield an immediate breakthrough. 

Trump earlier described the summit with Putin as a “feel-out meeting” that will help him determine whether the Ukraine conflict can be resolved.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Moscow views the meeting as a chance to begin mending strained ties with Washington, expressing hope that it will “give an impulse to the normalization of bilateral relations.”

British military chiefs have “given up” on plans to deploy around 30,000 troops to Ukraine's ports and cities in the event of a ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev, The Times reported on Wednesday.

Officials are now proposing what The Times described as a more “realistic mission,” with a focus on “air reassurance flights” over western Ukraine involving jets such as Typhoons or F-35s as a form of deterrence.

According to the newspaper, Kiev's backers will provide support for training the Ukrainian military and clearance of mines from the Black Sea. Most of the efforts will take place in the west of the country where the risk of attack is lower.

The role of the United States in the plan reportedly remains unclear. Moscow has repeatedly warned it would not tolerate any NATO member's presence in Ukraine under any circumstances.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky held talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and several European leaders ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, in Alaska on Friday.

Starmer said Kiev's backers have credible plans to deploy a “reassurance force” to Ukraine. He added he believes there is a “viable chance” of a ceasefire but stressed that Ukraine's “territorial integrity” must be protected.

Meanwhile, several European states have already signaled reluctance to send personnel to Ukraine under any arrangement. Poland, Spain, and Germany have ruled out contributing troops, citing fear of escalation.

Violent clashes have broken out across Serbia between anti-government protesters and ruling party supporters, leaving dozens injured. The Balkan country has been wracked by unrest for months. Activists are demanding early parliamentary elections and accountability for the deadly collapse of a railway station canopy late last year.

The fiercest standoff took place on Wednesday in the city of Novi Sad, where protesters gathered around the office of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). The party's supporters and protesters threw flares and other objects at each other, with demonstrators also smashing the building's windows.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that 64 people were injured at the premises of SNS in Novi Sad alone. He claimed that the protesters “approached from the rear with sticks, cannon shots, [and] attacked,” adding that the pro-government activists “will not retreat, they opposed the beaters and blockaders” whom he called “thugs.”

The president added that 16 police officers who intervened were also injured while accusing unnamed foreign powers of orchestrating the unrest. “Persons who violated the law will be apprehended... Tonight, we have averted a catastrophic scenario planned by someone from abroad,” he said.

The opposition Move-Change movement, however, accused pro-government activists of attacking protesters with pyrotechnic devices.

Similar scenes unfolded in the capital city of Belgrade, where riot police deployed tear gas to disperse protesters near a park by the parliament building. Demonstrators were blocked from advancing further toward the SNS offices.

Clashes were also reported in Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Nis, and Cacak, with police moving to separate opposing sides in several towns.

The protests were ignited in November after a concrete canopy at the newly renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing 16 people, with protesters – which were mainly students – accusing the government of corruption and cover-up. The demands later extended to educational reforms and holding snap parliamentary elections.

Vucic has on several occasions labeled the protesters “terrorists” who are seeking to “bring down the state,” suggesting they have been acting under foreign influence.

Several Serbian ministers, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, resigned in the wake of the unrest. The government has published documents related to the canopy collapse.

MOSCOW, August 14. /TASS/. Special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries, Chief Executive Officer of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev will take part in the Russia-US summit in Alaska on Friday, August 15 as part of the official delegation, informed sources close to the delegations told TASS.

""Kirill Dmitriev will take part in the summit of the leaders of Russia and the US on August 15, Friday, as part of the official delegation,"" sources said.

Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said on Thursday, August 7, that Russia and the United States had agreed on a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Putin confirmed that preparations were underway for such a meeting, indicating mutual interest.

This announcement followed a visit by US Presidential Special Representative Steven Witkoff to Moscow on August 6, during which he was received by Putin.

According to the US Department of State, the summit is scheduled to take place in Alaska on August 15. Putin's last visit to the United States was in 2015.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

ANCHORAGE /Alaska/, August 14. /TASS/. Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Donald Trump of the United States will meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15.

This will be the first offline meeting between the two countries' leaders since June 2021, when Putin met with US President Joe Biden in Geneva.

Putin will be the first-ever Russian leader to visit Alaska, which was sold to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million.

This summit will also be Putin's first meeting with Trump after the latter returned to the White House in January 2025. During Trump's first presidential term, they met in person six times, with the last one being on June 28, 2019 on the sidelines of the Group of Twenty summit in Japan's Osaka. Putin's last trip to the United States took place in 2015 when he attended UN events in New York.

According to the US media, the summit will be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a combined US Air Force and Army installation in Anchorage, Alaska. The sides are expected to discuss options for a lasting settlement of the Ukrainian crisis, as well as issues of bilateral relations.

The sides agreed to organize a meeting between the leaders after US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow on August 6, when he was received by the Russian president. On August 8, the deadline for a Ukraine peace deal set by the US leader, Trump said that he hoped to meet with Putin in Alaska in a week. The date and venue were later confirmed by Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, who said that the Russian and US presidents will focus on discussing options for reaching a lasting settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. The Kremlin, in his words, expects that the two leaders will meet in Russia's territory after their talks in Alaska. On August 11, White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Washington did not rule out Trump's potential visit to Russia some time in the future.

Ahead of the summit, Trump said that he hopes for a constructive meeting with his Russian counterpart and announced his intention to try to persuade Putin to end the conflict in Ukraine. However, he said that the upcoming summit cannot be called the last chance to reach an agreement on Ukraine. In his words, Russia and Ukraine may sign agreements within months, including on land swaps. According to the White House spokesperson, Trump wants to better understand Russia's position on the Ukrainian settlement. Meanwhile, the US leader has warned that if he sees no progress on Ukraine at the summit, he will abandon his diplomatic efforts.

Washington's further steps in respect to Moscow, according to Trump, will depend on Putin. On August 13, he warned that if no agreement on a peaceful settlement in Ukraine are reached in Alaska, Russia will face serious consequences. He did not say however which ones. The US administration did not rule out that 100% tariffs could be levied on Moscow and its trade partners. At the same time, Leavitt noted that Trump is interested in discussing normalization between Russia and the US.

At a high-level meeting with Russian foreign ministry officials in mid-June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined Moscow's preconditions for resolving the conflict. These included Ukraine withdrawing its forces from Donbass and Novorossia, abandoning aspirations to join NATO, and committing to a non-bloc, non-nuclear status. Moscow also demanded the removal of all Western-imposed sanctions.

Vladimir Zelensky was not invited to the Alaska talks. Trump admitted that he did not even looked at such an option. He expressed concern over Zelensky's statements regarding territorial issues.

However, the US leader said on August 13 that in case the summit in Alaska is successful, he will be hoping for a trilateral meeting involving Russia and Ukraine. According to the CBS television channel, US administration officials are choosing a potential venue for such a meeting, which can allegedly be held already next week.

The choice of the venue for the Russia-US summit has a great significance, including symbolically. As Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov noted, Russia and the United States are close neighbors and the choice of Alaska is quite logical. The Russian delegation will only have to fly across the 86-kilometer wide Bering Strait to reach Alaska.

Alaska was discovered by Russian explorers Mikhail Gvozdev and Ivan Fyodorov in 1732. The first settlement of Russian America, Three Saints Bay, was founded in 1784 by an expedition of merchant Grigory Shelikhov from Irkutsk. In 1799-1867, Alaska was governed by the Russian-American Company. The administrative center of Russian holdings in North America totaling around 1.5 million square kilometers in area was located in Novoarkhangelsk (now Sitka). Russian America's borders were fixed by the treaties with the United States (1824) and the British Empire (1825).

During World War II, land-lease aircraft were flown from the United States to the Soviet Union along the Alsib (Alaska-Siberia) air route, or the Northern Trace. Soviet pilots were trained to pilot US-made aircraft in Alaska. As many as 205 people died while piloting aircraft along the Alsib route during WWII. Nine Soviet pilots were buried at the Fort Richardson National Cemetery at the above-mentioned base. The Land-Lease Monument, a memorial honoring Soviet and American pilots, was erected in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2006.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Health secretary claimed that study, showing safety of aluminum ingredients in vaccines to be safe, was flawed

An influential US medical journal is rejecting a call from the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to retract a large Danish study that found that aluminum ingredients in vaccines do not increase health risks for children, the journal's editor told Reuters.

Kennedy has long promoted doubts about vaccines' safety and efficacy, and as health secretary has upended the federal government's process for recommending immunization. A recent media report said he has been considering whether to initiate a review of shots that contain aluminum, which he says are linked to autoimmune diseases and allergies.

The study, which was funded by the Danish government and published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed nationwide registry data for more than 1.2 million children over more than two decades. It did not find evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines had caused an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders.

The work is by far the best available evidence on the question of the safety of aluminum in vaccines, said Adam Finn, a childhood vaccination expert in the UK and pediatrician at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study.

“It's solid, [a] massive dataset and high-quality data,” he said.

Kennedy described the research as “a deceitful propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry”, and said the scientists who authored it had “meticulously designed it not to find harm” in a detailed 1 August opinion piece on TrialSite News, an independent website focused on clinical research. He called on the journal to “immediately retract” the study.

“I see no reason for retraction,” Dr Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.

The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy's piece, which was not submitted to the journal.

The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.

“I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies – especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before,” Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. “I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study.”

Kennedy had a number of criticisms, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions – including those with the highest levels of exposure – and that it did not include the raw data.

Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact, he said, its design was based on a study led by Matthew Daley, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.

There was no control group because in Denmark only 2% of children were unvaccinated, which was too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data was available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data was not released under Danish law, he said.

Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children's Health Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals of Internal Medicine site.

TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.

Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, “they do not invalidate what they found, and there's no evidence of scientific misconduct”.

An spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Second night of street violence in several cities after months of anti-government demonstrations boil over

Europe live – latest updates

Clashes between rival groups of protesters in Serbia left dozens injured overnight, police said on Thursday, as months of anti-government demonstrations boiled over into street violence for a second night.

A wave of anti-corruption protests has gripped Serbia since November, when the collapse of the Novi Sad railway station roof killed 16 people, a tragedy widely blamed on entrenched corruption.

Protesters again gathered in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas, about 160km (100 miles) north of the capital, Belgrade.

For the second night running, large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted protesters. The two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other.

Police arrested nearly 50 people across the country, and about 30 riot police were injured. The worst violence was reported in parts of Belgrade and Novi Sad, where the protest movement first began.

One man, later identified as a military police officer, fired a pistol into the air as protesters approached the ruling party's offices in Novi Sad, causing panic.

Footage also appeared to show supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive party launching fireworks at protesters gathered outside the party's headquarters there. Police intervened with teargas, and stun grenades could also be heard.

Frustrated with government inaction, protesters have demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, to call early elections.

Over the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful, student-led demonstrations have been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands. This week's violence, however, marks a significant escalation and indicates the increasing strain on Vučić's populist government, in power for 13 years.

Since 28 June, when about 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an “intensifying crackdown” on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month.

Protesters and those linked to the movement had faced a “troubling pattern of repression” including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said.

Vučić has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him.

After the Novi Sad shooting incident, officials confirmed the man was a member of a special military police unit usually tasked with protecting government ministers. He had fired his weapon while “on a routine assignment when attacked by about 100 people”, officials said.

The officer told journalists on Thursday: “I used my firearm and fired a shot into the air in a safe direction. At that moment, the attackers scattered.”

Footage widely shared online showed a man wearing a black T-shirt and no clear military insignia pointing a pistol into the air near protesters.

Military officials said that seven members of the same military police unit had been injured, while on duty to “protect a specific person”, but gave no further details.

Student protesters accused the police of protecting pro-government supporters while doing little to stop the attacks on their own gatherings.

“The authorities tried to provoke a civil war last night,” the students wrote on their official Instagram page. They announced further protests for Thursday night.

Vučić, who visited pro-government encampments overnight, denied his supporters had started the violence.

“No one attacked them anywhere,” he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference. “They went everywhere to attack those who think differently.”

While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vučić remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Participants have asked or agreed to be removed from show after controversy over conduct of sacked presenters

Another MasterChef contestant has been edited out of the latest series after the controversy over the conduct of its sacked presenters, raising further questions about the BBC's decision to broadcast the show.

Banijay, the production company behind the cooking contest, confirmed to the BBC that a second contestant had asked to be edited out of the programme.

It comes two weeks after the Guardian revealed that Sarah Shafi had agreed to be removed from the show, having said that it should not be aired. She said that after allegations were made against Gregg Wallace and John Torode its broadcast would send the wrong message about the treatment of women and inappropriate behaviour by prominent figures.

Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” but said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.

Torode was also dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over the use of racist language, which he believes never happened.

A spokesperson for Banijay said: “One other contributor decided that given recent events they would like not to be included. We have of course accepted their wishes and edited them out of the show.”

The series, which began airing last week, was filmed before Wallace and Torode were sacked. The BBC claimed it was “the right thing” to broadcast it, for the amateur chefs that took part.

It had already been forced to edit the programme to reduce the prominence of Wallace and Torode and remove Shafi's appearance. It has now been edited further to remove another contestant, who has asked not to be identified, according to the BBC.

The BBC is facing fresh criticism on social media about its decision to broadcast the series amid speculation about whether it would continue if more contestants asked to be removed.

In a statement last month, the BBC said: “This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.

“However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Heavy rains flooded Pakistan and northern China; Canada, Scotland and Greece struggled to tame wildfires intensified by persistent drought; and many nations in Asia and Scandinavia recorded new average highs for the month.

They aren't related to whales, but take their name due to their enormous size. At full maturity, whale sharks measure around nine or 10 meters long and can weigh from 15,000 to 40,000 kilograms. Whale sharks live in warm waters, with about 75% of them found in the Indo-Pacific region. They can migrate thousands of kilometers to different feeding grounds, but at a slow speed of 5 km/h on average.

Whale shark reproduction has long been a mystery for scientists. However, a significant discovery in 1995 off the eastern coast of Taiwan provided valuable insights. Researchers examined a pregnant female of the species and found over 300 embryos inside her body, ranging from about 40 to 60 cm in length. This discovery revealed that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. Instead of laying eggs in the ocean, the mother carries them internally until they hatch, giving birth to fully developed live young. Since the eggs don't hatch all at once, embryos at different stages of development can all exist within

HAMBURG, Germany (AP) — Watching his dad make a brand-new miniature train car look old, placing the wooden parts to weather in the sun and rain, pulled Peter Martinez into the world of miniatures. He recalls his father, who made model trains mostly for collectors or hobbyists, wondering why anyone would pay him to do what he thought was the most fun part of the hobby.

“But luckily they did, and we were able to build an industry around it,” Martinez said.

The Argentine family business, United Scale Arts, is now partnering with Germany's Miniatur Wunderland, a museum that houses the largest model train set in the world, to develop new exhibits depicting parts of South America, including the Amazon rainforest and Atacama Desert. But with miniature power comes great responsibility — and both Martinez's company and the museum are determined that the miniature world reflect both the good and bad of the real thing.

So alongside the perfectly shaded rocks and trees, they depict poverty, crime and environmental degradation. In the exhibits already running in Hamburg, built by a team that has grown over the years to hundreds of people, it means that tiny trains pull tiny coal cars into a mining town, but also, on a city bridge, a tiny semitruck hauls the tiny giant blade of a wind turbine.

And the builders say it means the new models won't shy away from illustrating real life in the Amazon: they will include scenes of illegal mining, deforestation and forest fires.

“These are social problems that exist in the real world, and we need to show them also in the models, because I think it's important not to make this kind of idealistic view of the world, but also to show reality and to use these tools as a learning experience for everyone that visits the Wunderland,” Martinez said.

Visitors have a lot to see in the multistory warehouse that is Wunderland. From Las Vegas to Miami Beach, from Rio de Janeiro to Monaco, cars zoom past tiny replicas of buildings as throngs of people, with heads smaller than your fingernail, mill about famous landmarks.

Cargo ships dominate the glasslike surface of a tiny bay as they chug in with their deliveries. Planes taxi down the runway of an airport. And of course, plenty of trains roll through every landscape to the delight of kids and adults alike.

Twin brothers Gerrit and Frederik Braun joined with business partner Stephan Hertz and took out a loan to create Miniatur Wunderland after they left the nightclub business. Frederik had visited a model railroad shop in Zurich, called his brother and suggested they create their own — but a whole lot bigger.

Gerrit laughed at first. Unlike his brother, he loved the nightclub. But he eventually agreed and now can't imagine doing anything else. “It's a dream come true that we sit here 25 years later, and playing all day,” he said, chuckling.

But he takes the work seriously. The brothers came up with most of the initial plans for the museum within two weeks, Gerrit said. It's grown in scope and ambition since then.

“Ten years ago, we were looking to the old section and saw the real world has changed in this time,” Gerrit said. They realized they needed to update the exhibits to include technologies like electric cars, wind turbines, nuclear power and more. “I have children, and I believe in global warming and I'm sure that we have done it … So if you believe in this, and you have the possibility to show the images, why not?”

NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) – An index of global equity markets rose to a record high for the second straight session on Wednesday, partly underpinned by bullish sentiment on Wall Street as investors positioned for a likely interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The MSCI All Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS rose as high as 954.21, breaking another record a day after reaching a new peak. It was last up 0.60% at 952.83.

The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Indexscored record highs for the second straight session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished stronger. Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, materials, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks led gains while communication services, consumer staples and technology shares lost ground.

The Dow .DJI gained 1%, the S&P 500 .SPX rose 0.32% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.14%.

European stocks .STOXX advanced 0.54%, almost reaching two-week highs, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose for the sixth straight day, breaking the 43,000 level for the first time and hitting a fresh high. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.54%.

“It's largely just a continuation from what we saw yesterday, with inflation obviously being the driver of the rally,” said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.

U.S. inflation readings, which on Tuesday showed the consumer price index rising slightly less than forecast in the year through July, indicated President Donald Trump's import tariffs had yet to filter down to consumer prices.

That helped Wall Street scale new heights, supported by the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.

“It's hard to really glean any sort of trends from that report other than maybe just some noise. I think on the whole, it's better than feared and that was enough to kind of spur expectations that the Fed has kind of the green light to go in September,” Melson added.

Traders are pricing in a nearly 94% chance of a Fed cut in September, up from about 57% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Also boosting market optimism was Trump's signing of an executive order pausing triple-digit levies on Chinese imports for another 90 days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thought an aggressive half-point cut was possible given recent Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions showing job growth had slowed to a crawl in May, June and July, though initial estimates had shown stronger employment growth that Fed officials used to argue that the labor market remained in good shape.

U.S. Treasury bond prices rose across the board, with the 2-year note US2YT=RR yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, dropping 5.2 basis points to 3.679%. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note yieldUS10YT=RR fell 5.5 basis points to 4.238%.

The dollar weakened 0.32% to 147.36 against the Japanese yen JPY=EBS and was down 0.12% to 0.805 against the Swiss franc CHF=EBS. The euro  was up 0.27% at $1.1704.

The dollar index =USD, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major peers, fell for a second day to its lowest in two weeks. It was last down 0.25% at 97.79.

Oil prices fell ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 0.74% to $65.63 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 fell 0.82% to settle at $62.65 a barrel.

Spot gold XAU= rose 0.34% to $3,356.49 an ounce.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

13:09 JST, August 14, 2025

Sen Genshitsu, the former head of the Urasenke tea ceremony school that carries on the legacy of 16th-century master Sen no Rikyu, has died at the age of 102.

He was known for disseminating the traditions of the tea ceremony widely across the world.

Rikyu's legacy has been preserved by the members of the San-Senke, or three tea ceremony schools of the Sen family — the Omotesenke, Urasenke and Mushakojisenke.

Sen Genshitsu was born as the eldest son of the 14th head of the Urasenke school. He joined the Japanese Imperial Navy when he was a Doshisha University student and volunteered to be a pilot in a suicide squadron. However, he ultimately returned without taking part in a mission.

In 1964, he succeeded as the 15th head of the school and inherited the name of Sen Soshitsu.

He inherited the Konnichian foundation, established by the 14th head to promote the tea ceremony and preserve cultural assets such as chashitsu tea rooms. He also took over Tankokai, an incorporated association composed of tea ceremony instructors and others, and worked to expand the organizations, while leading the largest number of disciples among tea ceremony schools.

Drawing on his wartime experiences, he advocated the idea of “peacefulness from a single cup of tea.” He made a total of over 300 trips to more than 70 countries to advocate world peace while introducing tea ceremony culture. That earned him the nickname “the flying head of the tea school.”

He performed tea ceremonies at the U.N. headquarters in New York in the presence of the U.N. secretary general and representatives from various countries in 2000, 2010, 2015 and 2023.

In 2002, he transferred the title to his eldest son and named himself Sen Genshitsu as a master of the tea ceremony.

In 2011, Sen Genshitsu invited Japanese and U.S. officials to the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu, which commemorates people killed in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and made tea in front of them.

In 1970, he established a  study abroad program for the tea ceremony. Through this program, more than 500 people from at least 40 countries visited the Urasenke school in Kyoto to study tea and Japanese culture.

In 1997, he became the first person in the tea ceremony world to receive the Order of Culture.

He continued his overseas visits after assuming the name of Sen Genshitsu. In his later years, he was vocal about the promotion of peace and defense issues based on his wartime experiences, giving lectures in Okinawa Prefecture and his hometown of Kyoto.

Editor's note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian forces struck a refinery in the Russian city of Volgograd overnight on Aug. 14, causing powerful fires at the facility, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The refinery processes over 15 million metric tons of oil every year, amounting to 5.6% of Russia's refining capacity, the military said. The Lukoil plant produces diesel, gasoline, and aviation fuel, crucial for Russian military logistics.

The attack was carried out in cooperation between the Unmanned Systems Forces, military intelligence (HUR), and other branches, the General Staff said.

Russian officials reported on an attack against the refinery earlier in the day. Volgograd Oblast Governor Andrey Bocharov said the strike caused an oil spill and fire on the premises.

""Tonight, the air defense forces of the Russian Defense Ministry repelled a massive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack on the territory of Volgograd Oblast,"" Bocharov said. 

""As a result of falling debris, oil products spilled and caught fire at the Volgograd Oil Refinery. Firefighters quickly began extinguishing the fire.""

Preliminary information indicates there are no casualties, Bocharov said. 

The Volgograd refinery, owned by Russian oil giant Lukoil, has been targeted multiple times throughout the full-scale war. Russian media and officials reported attacks on the facility in both February and March 2025. Ukraine's General Staff confirmed a drone strike against the refinery in January. 

Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military facilities in Russia. Oil refineries, which fund and fuel Moscow's war machine, are frequent targets of these strikes.

Three Russian refineries have cut or suspended operations this month due to damage sustained from Ukrainian drone attacks, according to media reports. Bloomberg reported that a Rosneft facility in Saratov Oblast halted oil intake after a strike on Aug. 10. 

Russia's Ryazan refinery also decreased its production by half while the Novokuibyshevsk refinery halted production completely on Aug. 2, Reuters reported.

The twin-engine, two-seat aircraft – designed for both air superiority and ground attack – crashed for unknown reasons, the Ukrainian Navy said.

The package includes geographical maps intended to justify Russia's territorial claims and ongoing military aggression, Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation claimed.

Ukraine has secured the return of 84 soldiers and civilians from Russian captivity in a fresh prisoner swap with Moscow, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Aug. 14.



The Russian delegation will include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, presidential aide Yuri Ushakov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, and Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev. 

""What comes after that meeting is up to President Trump,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News. ""He wants to sit down and look the Russian president in the eyes and see what progress can be made.""

This week, state companies Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. secured supplies from the United States, Brazil, and Middle Eastern producers for September-October delivery, Bloomberg reported.

According to Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, the teenager vandalized monuments of victims of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and defaced buildings with anti-Polish slogans on behalf of foreign powers. 

Planet Labs imagery showed stacks of shipping containers, cranes, and a helicopter at the launch site, as well as two radar-equipped aircraft parked at Rogachevo military airfield since mid-July, Reuters reported.

President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the latter's residence in Downing Street on Aug. 14, Sky News reported, citing Starmer's office.

""Only the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month,"" said Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine.

After months of failed peace talks and extensive diplomatic efforts seeing minerals and weapons deals reached, the eyes of the world will be on the remote shores of Alaska on Aug. 15, as U.S. President Donald Trump meets with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, supposedly to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

The announcement of the meeting came after what seemed like significant progress by Kyiv and European leaders in persuading Trump that only direct pressure on Putin could bring about a ceasefire — let alone a broader peace deal.

However, over the weekend of Aug. 9-10, Trump appeared to make an alarming U-turn on his position, calling for a ceasefire while suggesting that territory could be “swapped” between Ukraine and Russia in a final agreement.

Various media outlets reported that Moscow had proposed Ukraine's handover of the remaining part of its eastern Donetsk Oblast in exchange for a ceasefire.

The offer was reportedly made during U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow on Aug. 8.

The following days were marked by confusion and mixed messages, compounded by fresh evidence of Witkoff's well-known lack of knowledge of Ukrainian geography.

On Aug. 11, in a press conference laced with a return to anti-Ukrainian talking points and sprinkled with outright falsehoods, Trump removed all doubt by once again stressing that there would indeed be a swapping of territory.

“There'll be some land-swapping going on,” said Trump, “I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.”


""Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.""
    

In the hours after Trump's initial comments about land swapping, President Volodymyr Zelensky responded quickly and firmly, rejecting any plan that might involve handing over new territory to Russian occupation or recognizing occupied territory as Russian, citing Ukraine's constitution. 

""The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question is already in Ukraine's Constitution. No one will deviate from this — and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,"" Zelensky said.

Meanwhile, alarmed European leaders, many of whom had worked hard to charm Trump and bring the president around to backing a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, came out with a joint statement backing Ukrainian sovereignty and the necessity of Kyiv's participation in talks about its future. 

Zelensky's rebuttal drew Trump's ire, who once again began to blur the lines on which side started the full-scale war.

“I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying ‘well, I have to get constitutional approval,'” Trump said at the Aug. 11 press conference, “he's had approval to go into war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap.”

Since the semblance of a peace process to end Russia's war against Ukraine was initiated by Trump upon his inauguration in January, Russia's minimal demands have included the handover of all remaining Ukrainian-controlled territory in the four regions it illegally claimed and partially annexed in September 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

These demands — which would involve surrendering large Ukrainian cities, including two regional capitals and major urban centers in Donetsk Oblast — were unacceptable for Kyiv from the outset, both de jure and de facto, amounting to capitulation to Russia.

Now, although reports that Russia might only be demanding the remainder of Donetsk Oblast suggest a softening of those demands, such a concession would still be capitulatory and far beyond what Ukraine could call acceptable.

Beyond the legal dimension, handing over new territory to Russian occupation would also violate the core moral reasons Ukraine has defended its independence against Russian aggression so fiercely.

Moscow's track record in occupied territories has been one of imposing draconian authoritarian rule, accompanied by the systemic torture of civilians, the militarization of local populations, and the deportation of Ukrainian children.


“We are constantly deprived of the opportunity to build a future.”
    

Kateryna Seledtsova, a resident of Kramatorsk, a city in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk Oblast, told the Kyiv Independent that everyone in her circle is “panicking because of the news, some are packing their things.”

Seledstova, now owner of a successful cafe and cake shop, already moved once with her family to avoid Russian occupation in 2014, from the city of Shakhtarsk.

“We are constantly deprived of the opportunity to build a future,” she said. “We live one day at a time, all thanks to Russia.”

According to calculations by the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, as of Aug.7, 2025, about 6,500 square kilometers — roughly a quarter — of Donetsk Oblast remains under Ukrainian control. In the south, this includes the coal-mining cities of Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, which have been threatened in recent months by Russian advances.

Further northeast lies a formidable chain of four large urban areas, running from north to south: Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, and Kostiantynivka.

Sometimes known as Ukraine's “fortress belt,” these cities form the backbone of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast, the taking of which by force could take years and come at immense cost for the Russian military.

For Oleksii Ladyka, a local journalist from Kramatorsk in civilian life now serving with Ukraine's 92nd Assault Brigade, news about the proposed handover of Donetsk Oblast was met with disinterest and dismissal in his unit.“We don't even seriously consider the idea that our fate can be decided without us,” he said.


 ""I know that the Russians won't stop here.""
    

“Everything depends on us, on our resistance, whether we keep fighting, whether the cohesiveness of the Armed Forces is preserved.”

Artem Fysun, a city council member in Kharkiv Oblast and now member of the Peaky Blinders drone unit, expressed scepticism that Moscow's offer could be on the table at all.

“I don't believe that Russia will actually do it,” he told the Kyiv Independent.“Russia is acting like a real criminal, gathering strength to attack with renewed vigor, and now, with the help of various world leaders, they are also spreading fake messages about their intentions.”

Ultimately, as is often mentioned by Ukrainians in the face of deals made without their participation, more important than territories are the people living in them.

“When you talk about Donetsk Oblast like a hot cake that can be passed around,” said Ladyka, “I want them to remember that everyone here has their own family, has their loved ones, has a hope and a wish for a peaceful life and a future for their children, just like anyone anywhere in the world.”

“To discuss the fate of these people as if they are just some insects that can be picked up and handed over, is cynical at best.”

As of Aug. 5, 2025, approximately 252,000 civilians remain in Ukrainian-controlled areas of Donetsk Oblast, including around 18,500 children, according to the regional administration.

While recent Russian advances have seen cities like Dobropillia and Kostiantynivka quickly empty of their residents, the larger urban centers of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk remain lively, with new businesses regularly open amid a thriving military-based economy.

For Ladyka, despite his patriotic position, the thought of the front line coming to his home city gives him pause for thought.

“I really want the war to end, but would I exchange my Kramatorsk for peace?” he said. 

”I still don't know if I have a final answer to that question, but I know that the Russians won't stop here. If there were to be such an agreement and we just withdrew from Donetsk Oblast, they would just continue onwards.” 

This is Francis Farrell, author of this piece. For months, I have been watching the absolute circus charading as ""peace talks"" while covering the front line, especially in Donetsk Oblast. Now, with talk of this handover, it might seem like those two worlds are colliding. But Ukraine will not capitulate, Ukraine will not hand over territory — but that comes at the cost of the battles continuing. I am heading out soon to cover them, something we can only do with your help. Please consider supporting our reporting.

The Ontario government is boosting efforts to turn the province into an unlikely shipbuilding centre in the hope that its underutilized shipyards can land a multibillion-dollar contract for new Canadian navy corvettes. 

On Monday, Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, the Minister of Economic Development, met with senior executives of Algoma Steel ASTL-T of Sault Ste. Marie., Ont., Canada's second-biggest steelmaker. “We let them know that if they try to pivot into supplying the defence industry and other areas, we would be there to help them,” Mr. Fedeli told The Globe and Mail. 

Algoma, the country's only publicly listed steel producer, could make steel plate for ships and other heavy military equipment if Ontario Shipyards of Hamilton, the largest ship repair and construction company on the Great Lakes, were to win the corvette contract. 

Algoma is already listed as a potential supplier to Team Vigilance, the Canadian and international consortium assembled two years ago to bid for the next generation of Canadian naval ships, specifically corvettes. It includes Italy's Fincantieri FNCNF, the largest shipbuilder in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world. 

Opinion: The USMCA agreement may be circling the drain. Time to fill the trade sink elsewhere

Ontario pivots to European defence market with car industry under threat

Corvettes are relatively small offshore patrol vessels, or OPVs, that would replace the dozen Kingston Class ships that were built for the Royal Canadian Navy in the mid-1990s and are reaching the end of their careers. The navy announced in July that it will begin to pull eight of the ships out of service in the fall. 

Those ships are 55 metres long, carry a crew of about 50 and are used for coastal and fisheries patrol, training, minesweeping, search and rescue, law enforcement and drug interdiction. The new Vigilance ships, if built, would be somewhat larger, perhaps 100 metres long, to give them more range and capabilities, said Ted Kirkpatrick, Ontario Shipyards' director of business development and government relations.

The federal government has yet to issue a tender for the new corvettes – the navy is reportedly still setting the parameters of the project – and neither Mr. Fedeli nor Mr. Kirkpatrick know the timeline or the expected budget, though the contract could be worth several billion dollars. “We feel hopeful that this project will move forward fairly quickly,” Mr. Kirkpatrick said, noting that Prime Minister Mark Carney has made rearmament an industrial priority to meet Canada's domestic defence needs and NATO commitments. 

In an effort to kick-start an ambitious shipbuilding program in Ontario, which has not built a warship since the Second World War, the provincial government last month launched a financial program worth $215-million. 

The amount is designed to support shipbuilding capacity under the National Shipbuilding Strategy program. Mr. Fedeli said the incentives would be composed of loans and grants and tailored to each project. “We want Ontario to get back into the shipbuilding business,” he said.

Several other funds, including the new Ontario Together Trade Fund, could offer incentives to steel companies and other manufacturers to help them serve Canadian customers.

Mr. Kirkpatrick said Ontario Shipyards “hopes and expects to be a large beneficiary of the incentives programs.”

Ontario Shipyards (formerly Heddle Shipyards) was founded in 1987 and has three sites – in Hamilton, Port Weller and Thunder Bay. The company has about 250 employees, and its main business today is repairing coast guard vessels, not building new ships.

The company joined Team Vigilance to launch an unsolicited proposal to build a new corvette fleet. In addition to Fincantieri, the group includes Vard, which is Fincantieri's design arm; Thales THLEF, the French defence company that specializes in electronics; and SH Defence of Denmark, a maker of modular loading systems. 

Ontario Shipyards expects competition for the contract from the other industry players in Canada, primarily Irving Shipbuilding of Nova Scotia, which has a contract worth $8-billion to build the first three River-class destroyers for the navy; Davie Shipbuilding of Quebec, which is making icebreakers for the coast guard; and Seaspan Shipyards of British Columbia, which is building large non-combat ships for the navy and the coast guard. 

Mr. Kirkpatrick said the three rival shipbuilders have ample work at the moment, leaving only Ontario Shipyards with enough spare capacity to take on a big, new naval contract. “We have the largest amount of underutilized capacity in Canada,” he said. “If there is anyone who can put a boat in the water painted grey by 2030, it's us.”

He said the presence of Fincantieri and subsidiary Vard are key advantages for Team Vigilance. Vard would design the vessels, and Fincantieri would handle shipyard layout, procurement and project management. Mr. Kirkpatrick said a team from Fincantieri visited Ontario Shipyards last year to assess the company's capabilities and determine what equipment and training it would need to launch a competitive bid for Canadian navy warships.

Fincantieri, based in Trieste, in Italy's northeast, is controlled by the Italian government and is listed on the Milan exchange. The company has built some of world's largest ships for Cunard, Carnival, Princess and other cruise companies. It also builds combat ships, including aircraft carriers and submarines, for the Italian, U.S. and other governments. In Wisconsin, it makes the U.S. Navy's Constellation-class frigates, which are based on the Italian Navy's multipurpose frigates, known as FREMM.

The Trump administration is facing a growing backlash from across Africa as it accelerates its plan to deport migrants and convicted criminals to some of the poorest and most authoritarian countries on the continent. 

In recent weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump's government has sent flights of deportees to South Sudan and the tiny kingdom of Eswatini, while also reaching an agreement to send up to 250 migrants to Rwanda.

Each deal was negotiated secretly with governments that are far from democratic, with each regime reportedly receiving money or other benefits from Washington in exchange for accepting the deportees.

Israel is reportedly seeking similar agreements with several African countries, hoping to send Palestinians from Gaza to those countries. Most recently, Israel has been discussing a possible deal with South Sudan to send Palestinians there, according to an Associated Press report this week. South Sudan has denied the report. 

In earlier negotiations several years ago, Britain and Denmark brokered controversial deals to transfer asylum seekers to Rwanda, although the agreements were later cancelled.

As the deportation deals proliferate, many Africans are increasingly concerned that their continent is becoming a dumping ground for the unwanted people of wealthier countries. While poorer states can find it difficult to refuse the transactions, larger countries such as Nigeria and South Africa are criticizing the deals.

“The U.S. is mounting considerable pressure on African countries to accept Venezuelans to be deported from the U.S., some straight out of prison,” Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar told a local broadcaster last month.

“It would be difficult for a country like Nigeria to accept Venezuelan prisoners,” he said. “We have enough problems of our own.”

South Africa, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it was “deeply concerned” about Eswatini's decision last month to accept five U.S. deportees who had been convicted of serious crimes in the United States. 

The South African foreign ministry said it was worried about “the potential adverse impact on South Africa's national security and immigration policy” – especially because Eswatini shares a border with South Africa.

U.S. immigrants fear Trump's tightening dragnet

Some critics have used stronger language to denounce the U.S. deportation deals. “The continent must band together to stand against wealthy nations that regard Africa as nothing but a vast wasteland to be exploited and abused as they see fit,” said an editorial in The Times, a South African newspaper. 

“Over the years, Africa has borne the brunt of global dumping – mostly plastic and toxic waste. Now it has graduated to dangerous criminals.” 

Human-rights activists in Eswatini and South Africa have criticized the deportation deal as secretive and illegal. They say the detainees have been denied their rights to legal representation and consular access.

The government of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, said it has imprisoned the five U.S. deportees – citizens of Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, Yemen and Vietnam – and will eventually send them to their home countries. It has refused to disclose the compensation that it received from the Trump administration.

In the meantime, its neighbouring countries are worried that the deportees could escape. Tricia McLaughlin, a senior official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, inflamed those fears by describing the five deportees as “depraved monsters” and “uniquely barbaric.”

Trump wants to deport millions. What impact will that have on Canada?

In an earlier deal, South Sudan accepted eight U.S. deportees: One of its own citizens, along with others from Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Cuba and Vietnam. Before being flown to South Sudan, the deportees were held for weeks in a shipping container at a U.S. military base in the small African country of Djibouti, while lawyers in the U.S. made a failed attempt to block the deportations.

South Sudan has been facing heavy pressure from the Trump administration since April, when the U.S. revoked the entry visas of all South Sudanese citizens and announced a ban on future visas. There is widespread speculation that this was one of the motivations for the deportation deal.

The Trump administration has also talked to many other African countries to discuss similar deals. A potential agreement with Libya came close to fruition earlier this year, but was not finalized. The same kinds of deals were reportedly discussed last month when the White House played host to the presidents of five African countries: Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon.

Earlier this year, in the first of its deportation agreements, the Trump administration paid US$6-million to the government of El Salvador in exchange for sending hundreds of migrants to a prison in the country.

Most of the countries in the U.S. deportation deals have poor records on human rights. Some, like Rwanda and Eswatini, are run by autocratic regimes that suppress the media and civil society, leaving their citizens in the dark about the transactions that are negotiated and the benefits that their governments receive.

The deportation agreements have exposed “the stark power imbalance between the U.S. and developing countries, and raises serious concerns about security risks, human rights abuses and the denigration of international humanitarian law,” the Africa-based Institute for Security Studies said in a report last week.

Brazilian President Lula da Silva said the move is supposed to ""create new things"" out of the crisis caused by Donald Trump's tariffs. But Lula also said his country is still ready to negotiate.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced a plan on Wednesday to support exporters who have been hit by high tariffs of up to 50% imposed by US President Donald Trump on several products from the country.

The plan provides credit of 20 billion reais ($5.5 billion; €4.7 billion) to support the embattled exporters.

Other measures in the plan include postponing tax charges for businesses affected by the tariffs, while also incentivizing Brazilians to buy locally produced goods that would have otherwise been exported to the US.

""We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis,"" Lula said.

""A crisis is for us to create new things.""

Lula also said Trump has no good reasons for hitting Brazil with high tariffs.

While the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on many countries around the world, Brazil was ultimately singled out with some of the highest levies of up to 50%.

Trump said the additional tariffs were a reaction to the legal situation of his ally, the far-right populist former president, Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest over allegations that he plotted a coup after losing the 2022 presidential election.

Lula did not hold back on the grounds for the tariffs, saying every time the US decides to ""fight with someone,"" they paint their rivals as the devil.

""Now they want to talk about human rights in Brazil… We have to look at what happens in the country that is accusing Brazil,"" Lula added, hinting at Trump's domestic policies.

The US president had cited ""human rights abuses"" by the left-wing government in support of his ally Bolsonaro.

Lula responded to the claims, saying Brazil's judiciary is independent, with the country's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad saying Brazil is being ""sanctioned for being more democratic than its aggressor.""

The Brazilian leader has so far refrained from imposing higher tariffs on American imports, saying he is not interested in ""worsening our relations with the US.""

""We like to negotiate,"" Lula said.

""We don't want conflict. I don't want conflict with Uruguay, Venezuela, or even the US. The only thing we need to demand is that our sovereignty is untouchable, and that no one should have any say in what we should do.""

The report itself has been accused of political bias, with the US softening criticism of Israel and El Salvador. Germany rejected the report saying it has ""a very high level of freedom of expression.""

Human rights, such as freedom of expression, are under threat in Germany and other European countries, according to the 2024 Human Rights Report by the US State Department.

The report, which in former years has been seen as a reliable point of reference for global human rights advocacy, has been criticized by human rights groups as containing numerous omissions and mischaracterizations to fit the current US administration's political aims.

The German government rejected the report. 

""There is no censorship in Germany,"" Deputy Government Spokesman Steffen Meyer said.

""We have a very high level of freedom of expression in Germany, and we will continue to defend it in every form,"" he added.

""The human rights situation in Germany worsened during the year,"" an executive summary of the report's Germany entry said.

""Significant human rights issues included restrictions on freedom of expression and credible reports of crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism,"" the report said.

The report stated, however, that the German government ""took some credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.""

The report follows on from comments made by US Vice President JD Vance in February, in which he accused Germany and other European allies of imposing restrictions on free speech and attempting to marginalize far-right parties, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD).

His remarks have been described as ""intrusive"" by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

The report devotes a much smaller section to Israel than it did last year and fails to mention the severe humanitarian crisis and death toll in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's ongoing offensive against the Palestininian militant group Hamas.

El Salvador, which was described in the 2023 report under the Biden administration as having ""significant human rights issues,"" also got off lightly in 2024.

""There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,"" the 2024 report said about the Central American country, whose president, Nayib Bukele, is accused of overseeing unlawful and arbitrary killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.

The Trump administration's relations with El Salvador have strengthened in recent months, with Washington using a high-security mega-prison in the country to house migrants it has deported under draconian new migration policies.

Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine was referred to in the report mainly as the ""Russia-Ukraine war,"" though it did say Russia's forces and officials were reported to have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses in Ukraine.

In contrast, countries such as South Africa and Brazil, with whose governments Trump has clashed, came in for severe criticism that was not contained in the 2023 report.

The report was issued with a delay as officials appointed by US President Donald Trump altered an earlier draft to bring it into line with his administration's foreign policies and ideological slant.

It was prepared after the department underwent a major revamp during which hundreds of people were dismissed, many from the  agency's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which has a large role in writing the report.

In April, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in an opinion piece that the bureau had become a nest of ""left-wing activists"" and pledged that the Trump administration would change its focus in favor of ""Western values.""

""The report demonstrates what happens when political agendas take priority over the facts,"" said Josh Paul, a former State Department official and director of nongovernmental organization A New Policy.

""The outcome is a much-abbreviated product that is more reflective of a Soviet propaganda release than of a democratic system,"" he told Reuters news agency. 

Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also criticized the report, saying the Trump administration had mischaracterized some records of abuses and omitted others to suit its political agenda.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, however, defended the report, saying it had been restructured to improve readability and to stop it from being a list of ""politically biased demands and assertions.""

The humanitarian organization described this as the worst cholera outbreak Sudan has seen in years. The situation is especially dire in the Darfur region, where clean water is scarce amid the fighting.

Sudan's worst cholera outbreak in years has been linked to the deaths of over 2,470 people, with nearly a 100,000 suspected cases, in the past year the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organization said on Thursday.

The outbreak was first declared by Sudan's Ministry of Health a year ago.

Cholera cases are especially widespread in the western Darfur region, where MSF said it has treated over 2,300 patients and recorded 40 deaths in the past week alone.

Cholera hits those already struggling with water shortages, MSF said, as the lack of water makes it impossible to stick to essential hygiene standards.

In North Darfur state's town of Tawila, MSF reported an especially extreme situation with the disease. Some 380,000 have fled to town, escaping the ongoing fighting around the city of El-Fasher, according to United Nations figures.

Fighting in Sudan between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has been ongoing since April 2023, creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Darfur Governor Mini Arko Minawi, in an interview with DW, blamed the RSF militia for failing to care for those affected by the cholera outbreak.

""Those suffering from cholera are located outside the government's service areas, with most of them living in areas controlled by the so-called 'Rapid Support Forces' which have taken over these areas but are unable to provide services there,' Minawi told DW. ""These forces and their commanders have no knowledge of how to provide services or how to govern.""

Residents of Tawila have to make due with barely three liters of water per day. The World Health Organization stipulates that the absolute bare minimum threshold per person per day for drinking, cooking and hygiene is 7.5 liters.

Apart from the water shortages, MSF also reported a shortage of treatment facilities.

Tawila Hospital's cholera treatment center is equipped with barely 130 beds. During the first week of August, it had to accommodate 400 patients, which overwhelmed the facility, forcing staff there to treat patients on mattresses on the floor.

""In displacement and refugee camps, families often have no choice but to drink from contaminated sources and many contract cholera,"" said Sylvain Penicaud, MSF project coordinator in Tawila. ""Just two weeks ago, a body was found in a well inside one of the camps. It was removed, but within two days, people were forced to drink from that same water again.""

MSF reported that the outbreak was spreading elsewhere in Sudan, and fast. A 73-bed cholera treatment center that opened in July in Central Darfur's Golo was quickly overwhelmed, with 137 patients arriving on August 3 alone. Golo lies some 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Tawila.

In early August, the outbreak also reached more areas in Central Darfur state, Zalingei and Rokero, as well as Sortony in North Darfur state.

The organization warned that heavy rains were exacerbating the crisis, as it contaminates water and damages sewage systems.

""The health centres are full,"" MSF quoted Samia Dahab, a resident of Otash displacement camp in Nyala, as saying. ""Some areas have water, others have kiosks that are far or empty. Some water is salty, and we drink it unboiled, unsure if it's safe.""

As people flee the fighting into neighboring countries, the outbreak spreads with them. MSF reported cases were spreading to Chad and South Sudan.

""The situation is beyond urgent,"" says Tuna Turkmen, MSF's head of mission in Sudan. ""The outbreak is spreading well beyond displacement camps now, into multiple localities across Darfur states and beyond.""

Jeffrey Epstein did not introduce Donald and Melania Trump, the president has said, after the first lady threatened to sue Hunter Biden for $1bn for making the claim.

Biden, the son of the former US president, claimed last month that Mr Trump had met his wife through Epstein, the paedophile financier who died in prison in 2019.

The first lady threatened to take legal action against him if he did not retract the “disparaging and inflammatory” statement.

Mr Trump on Thursday pushed back on Biden's claim, saying he met his wife through “another person” whom he did not name.

The US president has been under pressure over his former friendship with Epstein as his administration refuses to approve a blanket release of the documents it holds on the paedophile.

Mr Trump accused Biden of making up stories to demean the first lady and said he had encouraged her to sue him.

“I said go forward. You know, I've done pretty well on these lawsuits lately… and Jeffrey Epstein had nothing to do with Melania and introducing,” he told Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade on Thursday morning.

“But they do that to demean, they make up stories. I mean I can tell you exactly how it was and it was another person actually… but it wasn't Jeffrey Epstein.

“I told her go ahead and do it. I'd rather use my lawyers – very upset about it.”

Biden claimed in an interview in July that Mr Trump had been introduced to his wife, then a model, by Epstein, citing Michael Wolff, the journalist who has written four books about the president.

Mrs Trump threatened to sue him if he did not retract his claim.

Lawyers acting for the first lady wrote to the former president's son last week, accusing him of making “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” about her, Fox News reported.

Biden has so far refused to do so, saying on Thursday: “F— that. That's not going to happen.”

“They spent an enormous time together. According to [Trump's] biographer, Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania,” Biden told Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan in an interview published on July 22.

“That's how... the first lady and the president met. Yeah, according to Michael Wolff.”

Biden, a businessman and artist, has recently embarked on a media tour, marking a contrast to his father Joe, who has maintained a low profile since leaving office in January as he battles an aggressive form of prostate cancer.

The former first son has defended his father and angrily lashed out at Democrats who forced his father to abandon his presidential bid, including George Clooney.

“F‑‑‑ him. F‑‑‑ him. F‑‑‑ him and everybody around him,” Biden said of the actor, a long-time Democratic supporter who called for his father to end his re-election campaign.

He also lashed out at Mr Trump, whom he labelled a “f---ing dictator thug”.

Donald Trump made a mistake in agreeing to meet with Vladimir Putin alone, his former top Russia adviser has warned.

Fiona Hill, who served on the national security council during Mr Trump's first term, said without his own advisers Putin will be better placed to lure the US president into a trap.

“Putin will lure you in in a moment,” she said. “He likes to do the two guys chatting routine, but what he's really doing is making you complicit in all kinds of things he wants.”

The US president is meeting with his Russian counterpart for a high-stakes summit at an Alaskan military base on Friday.

He intends to speak to Putin “one-on-one” as part of a “listening exercise”, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, announced on Tuesday.

But Ms Hill – who is one of few people both to have worked for Mr Trump and dined with Putin – said the set-up leaves the US president vulnerable to manipulation.

Having counselled Trump ahead of a joint press conference with Putin at the Helsinki Summit in 2018, few are more acutely aware of the pitfalls of preparing the president for a diplomatic summit.

“He kept saying, get away, I can do this myself,” recalled Ms Hill, who said the president's dismissive attitude and flapping hand gestures reminded her of her own daughter – a young child at the time.

“He was convinced that if he sat down with Putin, he'd sort things out, man to man, without the encumbrance of any pesky analysts or aides.”

In the end, the meeting went so badly that Ms Hill said she contemplated faking a seizure to shut it down.

Going into Friday's meeting, she advised Mr Trump to keep his guard up and take a translator with him, lest he fall for the former KGB operative's linguistic tricks.

“Trump doesn't speak a lick of Russian,” she said. “The issue there is that Putin is always going to be one step ahead, because Putin's English is certainly good enough to follow.

“You really need to be paying attention to this guy, how he holds himself when he says things, because he plays all these body language tricks as well.”

When world leaders speak behind closed doors, they conventionally bring their own interpreters.

Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's special envoy broke with convention in May when he relied on Russian translators during three high-level meetings with Putin, running the risk that some of the nuance in the Russian leader's comments was lost in translation.

Ms Hill warned that without a fluent Russian speaker in the room, the president risks being secretly mocked by his counterpart.

“He does make fun of Trump. He uses the Russian language in a way that can be quite sarcastic and ironic. It's totally lost in translation. I would have someone there telling (Trump) what this guy is saying and how he's saying it.”

Ms Hill, a British Kremlin watcher and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said solo negotiations will “limit” what progress can be made on a ceasefire deal as “Trump isn't going to have total recall”.

“Who knows what will have been discussed. Only Putin will probably have a good idea,” she said. “His team of people, they'll be sure to have someone taking notes. That's what the Russian interpreters do, they take notes at the same time.”

Mr Trump returned to the White House with a promise to end the war in Ukraine “on day one” of his presidency.

But eight months later, repeated attempts to drag Russia to the negotiating table by Mr Witkoff have yielded little progress.

After consecutive talks with Mr Witkoff failed to bear fruit, Ms Hill believes Mr Trump has now decided “he needs to see this through himself”.

“From Trump's perspective, he's the special sauce, the missing factor… I think he thinks if he sits down with Putin one-on-one, he can sort something out,” she said.

“He just thinks he can game it when he gets there, because he thinks he's very clever, and that he always has the upper hand, and things always work out well.”

Ms Hill fears Mr Trump may have overestimated his ability to get through to the Russian strongman.

“He doesn't get Putin. He thinks he does, but he says it all the time, he doesn't get why Putin wants to slaughter so many people. Putin's prepared to do that, so that's your problem,” she said.

“He has this brutality, which for Trump is unfathomable.”

While Mr Trump has said he is “not happy” with Putin in the lead up to the summit, she predicted the Russian leader will seek to flatter his counterpart in a bid to stave off further US intervention.

“If Putin wants the upper hand to just keep hammering the Ukrainians into submission, he'll probably get it,” she said.

“He'll want to reset the relationship with Trump so that Trump's not going off supporting Ukraine, and he'll want to put all the blame back on Ukraine and everyone else for a lack of success.”

She added that Putin is playing for time until “Ukraine crumbles and capitulates along the front lines and the territories he's already declared are Russia's”.

Part of the issue, Ms Hill said, is that Mr Trump has relinquished his bargaining power by repeatedly forestalling robust sanctions and weakening Europe's posture of solidarity with Ukraine.

Despite introducing 25 per cent tariffs on India, a major importer of Russian oil, the figure marks a climbdown from Mr Trump's initial proposal of 100 per cent secondary sanctions – and a drop in the ocean compared to the 500 per cent tariffs against Russia and its allies mooted by Republican Russia hawks within his party.

Russia could be forced to negotiate if “Trump were really willing to sanction Russia and Putin and to take action to really fully support Ukraine, but he's not”, said Ms Hill.

Wary of making predictions about the outcome of the Alaska talks, Ms Hill said there is a chance Mr Trump could “nudge [talks] along” in a positive direction.

Whatever the outcome, she is clear that the fate of Ukrainians will not be at the forefront of the president's mind.

“Trump is not the Ukrainians' plenipotentiary. Trump is Trump, and he's negotiating some sort of deal for a piece of property, which is Ukraine,” she said.

“People are talking about peace in Ukraine, but he's really talking about doing something with pieces of Ukraine.”

“DOGE Actions” was the number one reason cited by employers for their planned job cuts.

Companies based in the U.S. announced in July that they plan to eliminate a record number of jobs, more than double the amount announced in the same month last year, according to a new report. 

The report, from recruitment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, tracks U.S.-based employers' announcements about layoffs, which do not indicate the number of job losses that have occurred or when the positions will be eliminated. The estimates can change based on a variety of factors, including, in the case of government layoffs, litigation, explained Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 

“These are job cut announcements versus actual people losing a job,” Ajilore told Truthout.

Ajilore says the Challenger's report demonstrates companies' feelings of “uncertainty about the labor market,” which he attributes to Trump's immigration policies, tariffs, and cuts to the federal workforce. 

Economist Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that the announced layoffs, if they ultimately occur, may take place over the course of a year or longer, which is why the Challenger report does not “directly correlate with our other data about the economy.” 

“You always want to look at it in conjunction with other data that we're getting about the economy,” Baker said. “In this case, it fits very well.”

So far this year, employers have announced plans to cut more than 800,000 jobs, the highest number since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has eliminated thousands of federal jobs, was the number one reason cited by employers for their planned job cuts. Experts estimate that DOGE's actions may end up costing the United States billions of dollars.

“‘DOGE Impact' remains the leading reason for job cut announcements in 2025,” the report says. “An additional 13,056 cuts have been attributed to DOGE Downstream Impact, such as the loss of funding to private non-profits and affiliated organizations.” 

Employers' second-most cited reason was “Market and Economic Conditions,” which the report says “reflects a continued response to economic uncertainty, inflation, and shifting demand across multiple sectors.”

The industries that announced the most planned layoffs were government, technology, retail, nonprofits and automotive. Retailers, who will be hit particularly hard by Trump's tariffs, said that they plan to eliminate more than 80,000 jobs, an increase of nearly 250 percent from the same period last year. 

Despite Trump's claims that the U.S. economy is thriving, there's cause for concern. The latest data from the consumer price index (CPI) shows that prices were 2.7 percent higher in July than the same time a year ago. Earlier this month, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency published numbers that showed fewer jobs were added in May, June and July than initially projected. 

“We're definitely looking at a weakening economy, and that means slower job growth, almost certainly slower wage growth,” Baker told Truthout. 

“The path we're currently on,” he said, is “slowing growth so that we're basically growing at a crawl.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Anger is growing over Trump's decision to take over the DC police and deploy the national guard in the nation's capital.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

More than 100 protesters gathered late Wednesday at a checkpoint set up by a combination of local and federal officers on a popular street in Washington, D.C., where U.S. President Donald Trump has taken over the police force and deployed around 800 National Guard members as part of what he hopes will be a long-term occupation of the country's capital — and potentially other major cities.

The officers at the Wednesday night checkpoint reportedly included agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is also taking part in immigration raids in the city. Some agents were wearing face coverings to conceal their identities.

After law enforcement agents established the checkpoint on 14th Street, protesters gathered and jeered the officers, chanting “get off our streets” and “go home fascists.” Some demonstrators yelled at the agents standing at the checkpoint, while others warned oncoming drivers to turn to avoid the police installation.

There was no officially stated purpose for the checkpoint, but it came amid the Trump administration's lawless mass deportation campaign and its broader threats to deploy U.S. troops on the streets of American cities to crush dissent.

At least one person, a Black woman, was arrested at Wednesday's checkpoint. One D.C. resident posted to Reddit that agents were “pulling people out of cars who are ‘suspicious' or if they don't like the answers to their questions.” The Washington Post reported that a “mix of local and federal authorities pulled over drivers for seat belt violations or broken taillights.”

The National Guard troops activated by Trump this week were not seen at the checkpoint, which shut down before midnight.

Wednesday night's protests are expected to be just the start as public anger mounts over Trump's authoritarian actions in the nation's capital — where violent crime fell to a 30-year low last year — and across the country.

Radley Balko, a journalist who has documented the growing militarization of U.S. police, wrote earlier this week that “the motivation for Donald Trump's plan to ‘federalize' Washington, D.C., is same as his motivation for sending active-duty troops into Los Angeles, deporting people to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador, his politicization of the Department of Justice, and nearly every other authoritarian overreach of the last six months: He is testing the limits of his power — and, by extension, of our democracy.”

“He's feeling out what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the public will let him get away with. And so far, he's been able to do what he pleases,” Balko wrote. “We are now past the point of crisis. Trump has long dreamed of presiding over a police state. He has openly admired and been reluctant to criticize foreign leaders who helm one. He has now appointed people who have expressed their willingness to help him achieve one to the very positions with the power to make one happen. And both he and his highest-ranking advisers have both openly spoken about and written out their plans to implement one.”

“It's time to believe them,” Balko added.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

In the past 25 years, India and the United States have become closer than ever before, building strong economic and strategic ties. Their partnership has rested on shared values and shared interests: they are the two largest democracies in the world, home to vast multicultural populations, and both have been concerned about the rise of India's northern neighbor, China. But in the past four months, that carefully cultivated relationship has abruptly gone off the rails. The return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House threatens to undo the achievements of a quarter century.

Trump's actions have disregarded several of India's core foreign policy concerns, crossing sensitive redlines that previous U.S. administrations tended to respect. The United States once treated India as an important American partner in Asia. Today, India faces the highest current U.S. tariff rate, of 50 percent—an ostensible punishment for India's purchase of Russian oil after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. India finds itself dealing with a higher tariff rate than even China, the country that, at least until recently, Washington wanted New Delhi to help contain. Indeed, Trump seems far more keen to strike a deal with China than to relent on his tough stance toward India. And to make matters worse, Trump announced a deal in late July with India's frequent adversary Pakistan, under which the United States will work to develop Pakistan's oil reserves.

These tariff woes follow on the heels of another shock to the Indian system: Trump's intervention in May in a clash between India and Pakistan. After a few days of escalating strikes precipitated by a terrorist massacre in India, Trump unilaterally announced that he had brokered a cease-fire between the two countries. India vehemently denied that claim—New Delhi has long resisted any external mediation of its disputes with Islamabad, and American officials have been careful not to offend Indian sensitivities in this area—but Trump doubled down. No doubt he was offended by Indian pushback, just as he was pleased by Pakistan's immediate embrace of his claims and its eventual nomination of him for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Indian officials are seething, but they understand that anger is unlikely to work where reason has failed. For the moment, New Delhi has decided to wait out the storm, carefully wording its responses to try not to inflame the situation further while signaling to a domestic audience that it is not simply submitting to the White House. The implications of Trump's bullying for India's grand strategy are profound: Trump's foreign policy has upended New Delhi's key geopolitical assumptions and shaken the foundations of the U.S.-Indian partnership. India's favored policy of “multialignment”—seeking friends everywhere while refusing to forge clear alliances—has proved to be ineffective. And yet Trump's actions won't encourage a great revision in Indian foreign policy. Instead, New Delhi will survey the shifting geopolitical landscape and likely decide that what it needs is more productive relationships, not fewer. To protect itself from the capriciousness of the Trump administration, India will not abandon multialignment but pursue it all the more forcefully.

Since its independence, in 1947, India has mostly followed a policy of nonalignment, eschewing formal alliances and resisting being drawn into competing blocs. That posture largely defined its diplomacy during the Cold War but began to change after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when India opened its economy and pursued better relations with the United States. Now its foreign policy community stresses a commitment to multialignment, which consists of the diversification of partnerships, the refusal to join military alliances, the promotion of a multipolar world order in which no single superpower or pair of great powers is predominant, and a willingness to engage in issue-based cooperation with a wide variety of actors across geopolitical fault lines.

This policy is driven both by pragmatism and by the hope that India can serve as a pole in the order to come. Indian policymakers believed that the country's economic, strategic, and military needs could not be fulfilled by a single partner or coalition. They assumed that India could maintain its ties, for instance, with the likes of Iran and Russia while still working closely with Israel and the United States, and while building coalitions in the so-called global South with countries such as Brazil and South Africa. New Delhi imagined that Washington, in particular, would tolerate this behavior because when it came to the competition with China and the geopolitical contest in the Indo-Pacific, India was indispensable.



Trump's return to the White House has rocked the foundations of India's strategy and challenged New Delhi's closely held assumptions. As American tariffs take effect, the Indian economy will face increasing headwinds, most likely slowing economic growth. American ties with Pakistan in the wake of the May military standoff seem to only be growing stronger. And India now feels increasingly dispensable and marginalized in a geopolitical landscape it can hardly recognize.

India's strategy presumed a number of structural conditions that Trump has thrown into flux. India assumed, for good reason, that it played a crucial role in the great-power competition between the United States and its allies in one camp and China and Russia in the other. Pakistan seemed peripheral to this larger contest; Islamabad's global standing had diminished after its security establishment facilitated the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Despite its refusal to condemn Russia for attacking Ukraine, India remained a favored partner for both the United States and Europe. After all, Washington's perception of New Delhi as a potential regional counterweight to Beijing cemented India's strategic value.

Russia's war on Ukraine then provided India with a unique opportunity to demonstrate its policy of multialignment and raise its profile in global geopolitics. Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and Europe—key parties to the conflict—all courted India. In the process, India was able to maintain ties with both the United States and Europe, even as it bought Russian oil at favorable rates. And if the United States sometimes behaved in South Asia in ways that rankled India (for instance, when it did nothing to stop the ouster of a pro-India leader in Bangladesh in 2024), Indian officials still perceived American involvement in the region as largely beneficial, and confirmation that the United States saw the subcontinent as a key front in its larger competition with China. India much preferred the occasionally irritating involvement in South Asia of a faraway superpower to the aggression and ambition of the aspiring hegemon next door.

Trump's return to the White House has complicated each of the assumptions New Delhi held. Instead of girding itself for great-power competition, the White House is scouring the world for short-term gains. Through that lens, Washington has much more to gain from China than it does from India; the war in Ukraine must end because supporting Ukraine is not worth American taxpayers' money; and Europe's problems with Russia are Europe's problems, not those of the United States. In such a worldview, India's geopolitical profile invariably shrinks.

Take the issue of the hour: the soaring tariff rate that Trump has imposed on India. Indian governments have traditionally maintained a high tariff structure to protect domestic manufacturing and agriculture, generate revenue, and manage trade balances. India has long justified these tariffs as essential for its developing economy, but the United States is unhappy about the persistent trade deficit in goods with India, agricultural subsidies that limit U.S. access to the Indian market, and India's omnivorous geopolitical maneuvering, including its membership in the coalition of nonwestern countries known as BRICS and its continued reliance on Russian oil and defense equipment. Previous U.S. governments tended to overlook these infelicities, allowing India to liberalize its economy and decouple from Russia at its own pace. But this Trump administration is not so patient.

Washington's revised approach to great-power competition has not only transformed its own policy toward New Delhi but has also influenced the choices and decisions of other major players—with significant implications for India. Russia, for instance, has sensed that Trump is far less committed to supporting Ukraine than was Biden, is less interested in the systemic challenge posed by China to the U.S.-led world order, and is reluctant to provide security commitments to allies in Europe and Asia. As Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, he seeks to punish India for buying Russian oil—a policy that the United States previously encouraged. With Trump in the White House, Russia has more options and needs India less.



Indeed, Moscow feels a diminishing obligation to New Delhi and is unwilling to offer more support than it receives, which explains its lukewarm backing during India's clash with Pakistan in May. Russia's public statements at the time were vague: they neither mentioned Pakistan by name nor endorsed India's military reprisals, but simply called for settling disagreements diplomatically. In a sense, Russia echoed India's own messaging after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the statements alarmed New Delhi's Russia watchers, who expected the Kremlin to stand by India, condemn Pakistan, and affirm India's right to retaliate—much as Israel did in its full-throated support for India. Indian analysts suspect that Russia refrained from doing so because it didn't want to irritate China, which has become a close strategic partner of Pakistan and provided it with a great deal of new weaponry.

Going forward, Russia is likely to prioritize closer ties with China over its declining relationship with India. Sensing victory in Ukraine, Moscow has new priorities: it now seeks partners capable and willing to challenge the United States and Europe, not merely offering commercial relationships. China can do that, but India is only interested in trade. Russia may therefore be reluctant to support India in any future Indian-Pakistani conflict, owing to China's ties with Pakistan. If Russian support for India is doubtful during a conflict with Pakistan, it's safe to assume that Russia will do little to help India in any future conflict with China.

Trump's relative indifference to South Asia will invariably mean a free pass for China, which will attempt to tilt the regional balance of power in its favor through a combination of debt-trap diplomacy, military agreements, and growing political and diplomatic ties with South Asian states. Chinese equipment and know-how strengthened Pakistan's conventional capabilities in May and helped Pakistani forces probe Indian defenses. China is more directly involved in South Asian matters today than ever before and its defense industry will have a growing role in future military conflicts in the region. And if China can burrow even deeper into South Asia, it will have Trump to thank. The U.S. president is seeking a trade deal with China while trying to bully India into submission; he evinces little interest in the geopolitical fate of the Indo-Pacific, in general, and South Asia, in particular. This peculiar orientation in Trump's foreign policy will help Beijing consolidate its influence in the region, invariably at India's expense.

The recent months of foreign policy setbacks reveal the inherent limitations of India's commitment to multialignment. During the May clashes with Pakistan, most of India's partners were more concerned about a potential nuclear exchange in South Asia—even if that remains extraordinarily unlikely—than interested in helping India diplomatically, politically, or militarily. But beyond the nuclear concerns, the response of India's friends and partners was one of qualified neutrality. They echoed India's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India's position of not siding with either Russia or Ukraine, a stand born out of the policy of multialignment, didn't satisfy either Russia or Western governments, and so nobody stood with India when it faced a crisis.

India imagined that it would benefit from great-power competition, maneuvering between China, Russia, and the United States to its own advantage. It worked until the dynamics of that competition changed dramatically. New Delhi saw itself as a central player in Asia. Trump has disabused Indian officials of that notion. His imposition of very high tariffs this month blindsided Indian policymakers who thought that the White House, in its own interest, would always treat India with due consideration. Trump seeks deals with China and Russia, browbeats traditional allies and friends, and seems content to speed the emergence of some kind of G-2 condominium in which the United States and China carve up the world between them. In such a world, India's geopolitical importance declines dramatically.

This is not just India's plight. The story in Europe and among American treaty allies in Asia is similar. In that shared doubt about the United States, however, lies a potential salve for India's injured foreign policy. India could strengthen partnerships with European countries and major Asian powers, such as Japan and South Korea, who face their own balancing dilemmas because of the unreliability of the Trump administration. It could also seek to cultivate, or at least signal, closer ties to China and Russia; indeed, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed this month that Putin will visit India later this year.

To be sure, New Delhi views Washington's conciliatory approach to Beijing with deep alarm. It has already begun considering how to better strengthen its defenses, source its weapons platforms, and establish reliable partnerships and supply chains. India will survive this geopolitical whirlwind with some deft diplomacy and patience, but this turbulent period is likely to have several long-term consequences for New Delhi's foreign policy and strategic outlook. Bilateral relations between India and the United States will suffer acutely. Indeed, the domestic factors in the United States that appeared to guarantee good relations with India have not slowed their precipitous decline: the influential Indian diaspora in the United States seems powerless, the supposed bipartisan consensus in favor of India has not reined in Trump, and India-friendly politicians and industry leaders have remained conspicuously silent. After decades of abating, anti-Americanism is once again on the rise within the Indian foreign policy community. For an Indian foreign policy establishment that is doggedly consistent in its commitment to the status quo, Trump is a constant puzzle.

And yet, paradoxically, India's response to its current predicament is likely to be, well, more of the same. The very inadequacies of multialignment may in fact push India to become only more multialigned. If Washington is not a viable or reliable partner, New Delhi will seek and cultivate other partnerships. Trump's outreach to Beijing and Moscow will now prompt New Delhi to follow suit, reversing India's earlier policy of gradually distancing itself from China and Russia. India's policy of multialignment has just undergone a geopolitical stress test and emerged rather winded. But Indian policymakers are not concluding that they should abandon it; to the contrary, they will fortify it.

 Jacob J. Lew and David Satterfield

A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Since the March 2025 breakdown of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, conditions have worsened dramatically, and the potential for widespread starvation is real. Thousands of containers with food, medical supplies, and shelter materials remain stranded at border crossings on both sides, awaiting Israeli clearance to enter Gaza and conditions for safe passage free from seizure by desperate Gazan civilians, Hamas or gang attacks within the enclave. At least several hundred truckloads of food aid must enter daily to avert a wider catastrophe.

Many parties bear responsibility for this crisis. First and foremost, Hamas launched a war with the brutal October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel; because Hamas fighters live and fight in civilian areas and in tunnels running underneath them, Hamas invited an Israeli response that would put millions of people at risk. Gazan civilians have suffered hardships and deaths at an unfathomable scale since the start of the war, and outside organizations attempting to meet humanitarian needs are struggling to deliver aid in the midst of intense combat and disorder in a dense urban environment.

From the very beginning, U.S. President Joe Biden was steadfast in his support of Israel's right to defend itself in Gaza and defeat Hamas as a military threat. But his administration, in which we both served, also made clear that Israel was responsible for exercising care to limit civilian harm and to ensure access to food, medical care, and shelter. As the U.S. ambassador to Israel (Lew) and as the U.S. special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues (Satterfield), we communicated these dual positions in our daily engagements with Israeli leaders at all levels. And we pressed all parties to coordinate so that enough lifesaving supplies reached Gaza, even if inconsistently.

There was still too much scarcity and precarity, and for months following the October 2023 attacks on Israel, some commentators labeled the situation in Gaza a famine. But although the results of our work never satisfied us, much less our critics, in reality the efforts we led in the Biden administration to keep Gaza open for humanitarian relief prevented famine. The fact remains that through the first year and a half of relentless war, Gazans did not face mass starvation because humanitarian assistance was reaching them.

During our tenure, the United States deployed officials from multiple agencies that had the tools, leverage, and determination to improve the situation, and we were committed to doing so despite the often adverse circumstances. In March, when the cease-fire broke down, everything changed.

Under the terms of the cease-fire, which was struck in the last days of the Biden administration in January 2025, Israel had allowed a surge of supplies into Gaza. But when the cease-fire collapsed, Israel closed all humanitarian access in an effort to pressure Hamas to agree to the terms of a hostage deal. It was the first time it had blocked all aid to Gaza since late October 2023. The total blockade continued for 11 weeks, and during this critical time, the Trump administration stood back as remaining food supplies diminished and suffering increased, until it became clear to the president that the crisis had grown to politically unacceptable levels and was triggering outrage even in the MAGA base.

Then, when Israel finally did allow a limited amount of aid to enter, it changed the primary food distribution model, mostly bypassing the United Nations and other established humanitarian organizations in favor of a brand-new operation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Although the UN continued to operate, it experienced significant operational difficulties and restrictions. The nearly 20,000 tons of monthly food aid that got through from March to July was about a third of what the World Food Program deemed necessary. The scenes of acute hunger and potential starvation that have emerged from Gaza in recent weeks reveal a frightening deterioration.

When aid was flowing before the cease-fire, it did not arrive by chance. It came one border crossing and one truck convoy at a time, and it required overcoming political and battlefield challenges every step of the way. As the world watches the crisis unfolding today and demands a solution, it is important to learn from what worked and what did not, and to remember that it falls to all parties to find a solution. The stakes are too high to allow the delivery of critical assistance to be derailed by Israeli political dynamics, obstruction by Hamas or armed Gazan gangs, or infighting among aid providers. And Washington must remember that it uniquely has the tools and leverage to avert an escalating catastrophe.

After the October 7 attacks, the people of Israel were in shock, traumatized both by Hamas's brutality and by the failure of their government to protect their fellow citizens. Immediately following the attacks, Israel responded forcefully, imposing a complete blockade on Gaza that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering via land routes. The Israeli cabinet decided that, as a matter of policy, there would be no commercial or civilian contact between Israel and Gaza. In those early days, it was common to hear Israelis use the phrase “not a drop of water, not a drop of milk, and not a drop of fuel will go from Israel to Gaza.” In the raw trauma after October 7, this sentiment was understandable but unsustainable with growing needs.

From the beginning, U.S. officials made clear that Israeli leaders needed to find a way for lifesaving supplies to get in. We underscored that doing so was unquestionably a moral obligation. We also argued that it was a strategic necessity, in that it would give Israel the time to plan and accomplish its military mission of eliminating Hamas as a threat while maintaining the support it needed from its allies, in particular the United States.

On October 18, 2023, Biden visited Israel to demonstrate U.S. solidarity in the aftermath of the attacks but also to persuade the government to allow trucks to cross into the Gazan city of Rafah from Egypt. He told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet privately—and then the Israeli people publicly—that the United States “had Israel's back” and that Israel had not just a right but also an obligation to ensure that Hamas could never again act as it did on October 7. But Biden also emphasized that the military campaign against Hamas would be complex and warned explicitly that the ability of the United States to support the operation would depend on Israel's initiating and sustaining an effective “humanitarian campaign.” Without such a campaign, the president stressed, Israel would have neither the time nor the space it needed to accomplish its military goals.



At the time, Israel's wounds were raw, and its focus was on defending against further attacks. Its government needed to work to meet humanitarian needs in Gaza while Hamas kept hostages in captivity and was still showering Israel with rockets. Under any circumstances, it would have taken determined leadership to explain to the public why it was the responsibility of their government to make sure that humanitarian needs were met on the ground in Gaza. But it was even harder given the political dynamics of Israel's governing coalition. Netanyahu's coalition includes far-right parties that held what were then fringe views. The goals of the right-wing parties did not stop at defeating Hamas. They believed that Israel should never have disengaged unilaterally from Gaza and removed Israeli civilian settlements in September 2005 and that Israelis should resettle the territory after the war. This was not the position of the government, but far right-wing parties threatened to bring down the coalition if the cabinet made decisions they opposed, including opening routes for humanitarian assistance.

While some on the right opposed humanitarian assistance, others in the Israeli government chafed when we in the administration reminded them that Israel had both a right to defend itself and an obligation and a strategic imperative to ensure that aid could reach Gazans. They took umbrage at the notion that U.S. pressure was needed to persuade them to provide humanitarian assistance. Given the tensions within the government, it took active and consistent U.S. engagement to manage the internal Israeli political dynamics and maintain the adequate flow of assistance. The message to our interlocutors in the Israeli government was in essence, “If the politics are hard, blame the United States.” Allowing Netanyahu to cite a need to satisfy U.S. demands was crucial then—and remains crucial today. Because Biden never wavered in his commitment to Israel's defense, we had the space to urge its government to meet growing humanitarian needs.

Immediately after Biden's visit, Israel agreed to open the Rafah crossing for aid deliveries from Egypt. At first, just 20 trucks a day entered Gaza through Rafah—far from enough to meet humanitarian needs. Part of the challenge was that the Rafah crossing was designed for pedestrians and cars, not large truck convoys, making it inadequate in view of the extent of the demand and the logistical difficulties. But Israel also placed limits on the types of goods and the number of trucks (around 75 per day) permitted to go through Rafah. And to comply with the Israeli government's decision not to allow any direct movement of assistance into Gaza from Israel, trucks had to be inspected at an Israeli-Egyptian border crossing before proceeding to Rafah—which caused significant delays.

Watching this, we knew we needed to find ways to increase the volume of aid. U.S. cabinet members and other senior officials were making frequent visits to Israel to consult on the unfolding military operations and to repeat the message that more humanitarian aid was necessary. In November 2023, a one-on-one conversation between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Netanyahu scheduled for only a few minutes stretched to over an hour. As Israel's war cabinet and the rest of the U.S. delegation waited for Blinken and Netanyahu to conclude the meeting, we began informal discussions, including with Yoav Gallant, who was then defense minister and had declared immediately after the October 7 attacks that no aid would move from Israel to Gaza. By this point, however, he understood that Israel had to allow more humanitarian assistance into the enclave—and he had an idea about how to do it.

Gallant walked the two of us through the complex geography of the southern border crossing between Israel and Gaza at Kerem Shalom. He explained that a truck could back up in Israel and be unloaded in Gaza without technically crossing the border, and that observation towers in Israel could provide full visibility to monitor threats against such an operation. Although this plan was a bit nebulous, it offered a road map to increase entry points beyond Rafah—and to chip away at the broad Israeli prohibition against moving aid directly from Israel to Gaza.

In early December, with the international support that had swelled for Israel immediately after October 7 beginning to wane, we saw an opening to put the plan into motion. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was prepared to use a very rarely invoked authority, Article 99 of the UN Charter, to force the Security Council to vote on a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire. Washington needed to show the international community that Israel was taking steps to meet humanitarian needs. The White House and State Department debated whether to have Biden call Netanyahu to demand the opening of Kerem Shalom, but our sense was that the pressure would more likely succeed if it came from within Israel's own cabinet. We asked Washington to give us a few days to work through the Defense Ministry.



More than anyone else in government, Defense Ministry officials understood the vital importance of American supply lines and strategic and defensive capabilities to Israel's war effort. And as he had told us a few weeks earlier, Gallant was prepared to defend the position that opening Kerem Shalom could be reconciled with the official policy of no direct civilian contact between Israel and Gaza. In private, he acknowledged that civilians needed more access to essential items, and he understood the strategic importance of maintaining broad support for Israel, at least in the United States.

In a phone call in the middle of the night, one of us (Lew) put it very directly to the defense minister: “You know this is the right thing to do, and in a few days the United States will be the only country in the world prepared to block a UN Security Council resolution that hurts Israel. You need to help us and act now to open Kerem Shalom.” He said he would make that case.

The United States vetoed the UN resolution on December 8 on the grounds that it did not condemn the October 7 attack and that an immediate cease-fire would allow Hamas to retain its military power and “only plant the seeds for the next war.” On December 12, the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, visited Israel with the same message that we had delivered. On December 15, Israel announced it would open the crossing at Kerem Shalom.

Over the next several months, similar U.S. engagement, typically with Gallant playing a key role, persuaded Israel to open a series of additional crossings into Gaza. Each opening—Gate 96 in March, Erez and Zikim (Erez West) in April and May, and Kissufim in November 2024—required arduous diplomacy, including very blunt messaging to Netanyahu from Biden in April 2024 after an Israeli attack on World Central Kitchen humanitarian workers. Israeli hard-liners resisted every time, among them protesters who blocked aid trucks, which prompted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to intervene. After each decision to open a crossing, it was a struggle to counter potential violence by far-right groups and overcome logistical snafus and bureaucratic obstacles. And on the other side of each opening were desperate civilians, criminal gangs, and an ever-present Hamas.

Throughout this period, it was evident that Hamas wanted to control aid distribution to benefit its own fighters and tighten its grip on Gaza. At first, Israel tolerated this, and for a while it even refrained from attacking Hamas police officers who, in their blue cars, accompanied convoys to prevent violent tribal gangs and criminal elements from interfering with the distribution of aid. Eventually, however, Israel came to see this as allowing Hamas to strengthen its hold on governance, and in January 2024 the IDF began targeting the blue cars. With Hamas sidelined during the delivery process, the criminal gangs and looters came out in full force.

To be clear, Hamas did find ways to tax, extort, and to some extent divert aid, including assistance from Egypt handled by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. But until January 20, 2025, neither the IDF nor the UN ever shared evidence with us—or asserted to us privately—that Hamas was physically diverting U.S.-funded goods provided by the World Food Program or international nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, there was no evidence of substantial Hamas diversion of any major assistance funded by the UN or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

Theft and diversion of UN assistance was primarily the work of criminal gangs, and we engaged with Israel and the UN to take steps to mitigate the risks. Israel's solution was to turn to private contractors to secure the convoys, until it later concluded that the contractors were assisting the gangs and Hamas. At this point, maintaining orderly movement and distribution inside Gaza became even harder.



By February 2024, the situation in northern Gaza prompted Netanyahu to ask Biden to arrange for the U.S. military to build a floating pier to deliver aid directly to Gaza from the sea. The pier would offer quicker access to deliver aid to civilians in and around Gaza City and allow access to both the north and south along more protected routes, in theory avoiding looting and easing the passage of convoys through the IDF-controlled Netzarim Corridor checkpoint. By that point, Biden had been exploring the idea of the pier for weeks, wrestling with both the temporary nature and high cost of a maritime delivery option. He authorized the pier in the conviction that despite these drawbacks, the United States needed to employ all means possible to address the increasingly desperate humanitarian situation. He had another goal as well: Washington agreed to this plan on the condition that the Israelis would also allow the port of Ashdod to receive U.S. wheat deliveries destined for Gaza and that two more land crossings from Israel would open into northern Gaza. (Israel also provided significant construction assistance and perimeter security for the pier and paused some of its military operations to allow the pier to function.)

Rough waters ultimately made it impossible to sustain the pier, which broke apart a number of times and was shut down after less than a month of operation. While it was functioning, however, the pier managed to feed approximately 450,000 people. And even after the pier was removed from service, Israel kept Ashdod and the two northern crossings open. By April 2024, at our urging, it had also opened Ashdod to all humanitarian cargo, not just wheat.

Such U.S. efforts saved lives in Gaza. Many of us in the Biden administration asked one essential question every single day: How many trucks got in? This was an imperfect measure, as it did not reveal how the aid got distributed or who received it. But it was a simple, measurable, and important bellwether. Even Biden tracked the number of trucks daily. We knew by December 2023 that if fewer than about 250 trucks entered daily, the distribution system might be overwhelmed once more by desperate Gazans. We believed that Gaza needed closer to 350 or 400. Although not all the trucks were the same—some carried far less food and other aid than others—every truck counted. Every open gate mattered.

Between the U.S. presidential election in November 2024 and the transition to a new administration in January 2025, the Biden and Trump teams worked hand in hand to reach a cease-fire and hostage-release agreement. When the deal was done, 33 hostages were freed, and over 600 trucks per day began to enter Gaza. With food reserves building up, the humanitarian situation appeared to improve significantly. And contrary to concerns that Israel might never allow Gazan civilians to return to their homes, hundreds of thousands returned to the northern part of Gaza—a Hamas demand that was key to getting the hostages returned.

From there, the cease-fire agreement was designed to unfold in stages. Further negotiations to release all the hostages in exchange for a permanent cease-fire were meant to begin as the first stage was being implemented. But those end-stage negotiations never came to fruition. And in the meantime, there was a new administration in Washington that was far less involved in the details of aid delivery—and had begun dismantling the architecture of U.S. assistance worldwide.

In February, President Donald Trump dropped a rhetorical bomb: he suggested that all of Gaza's residents be relocated while the United States reconstructed the territory. “The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,” he declared in a joint press conference with Netanyahu, outlining his vision of a “Riviera of the Middle East.”

Of course, no one had asked the people of Gaza whether they wanted to leave, or other countries whether they were prepared to absorb two million refugees. At the news conference, Netanyahu seemed startled by Trump's comments. He avoided embracing or rejecting the goal, instead hailing the president's “bold vision” on Gaza. Yet it quickly became clear that Trump's remark had delighted Israelis on the far right and handed them more of a claim of political legitimacy and leverage within the cabinet than they could ever have imagined. In minutes, the fringe idea of forced mass resettlement—pragmatically unattainable, morally unconscionable, and legally unacceptable—had been legitimized by no less an authority than the American president.



Israel halted all entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in the first week of March, after the breakdown of cease-fire negotiations. The prime minister declared to the Israeli cabinet and the nation that “no assistance would be allowed to go to Hamas.” This was a pivotal decision. It reflected a genuine concern that aid was being diverted by Hamas—even though the alleged scale of that diversion was not substantiated—but also the premise that depriving Gaza of food would pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages and surrender its arms. As food reserves diminished, the consequence was a new and unparalleled humanitarian crisis: for the first time, malnutrition showed signs of becoming widespread.

Under pressure as photographs started coming out—notably from Trump and the IDF—the Israeli government had to act. In an effort to square the circle within the cabinet between the declaration that “no assistance” would go to Hamas and the demands that humanitarian relief resume, Israel abandoned the system of aid provision that had existed before the cease-fire broke down. Instead, it turned in May to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a new U.S.- and Swiss-based NGO backed by Israel and the United States.

In its original conception, which came as part of a negotiation between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, the GHF was meant to operate in a postwar Gaza in which international forces would maintain security, and governance would come from a transitional administration with Palestinian and international participation; aid was to be distributed to civilians directly in secure zones. Instead, the GHF operation started under very different wartime conditions. It established distribution points in a handful of IDF-controlled areas in the south and center of Gaza, giving it, by its own acknowledgment, the ability to distribute just some 20 percent of the total food aid needed by the territory's population. With growing desperation from civilians and reports of fatalities in crowd control efforts by the surrounding IDF units (as well as private military contractors hired to assist with distribution), the GHF launch has been plagued by problems. Scores of civilians in search of aid have been killed or injured both by stampedes and by live fire from some combination of the IDF, Hamas, and criminal gangs.

Speaking last week, Trump acknowledged the inhumanity of the situation and the reality of starvation. But it takes sustained engagement at the highest level, not just a casual remark from the Oval Office or a social media post, to ensure that Israel keeps multiple crossings open so that hundreds of trucks can enter Gaza every day. And as we learned, the massive humanitarian need for assistance can be met only if all parties find a way to work together.

The steps needed to right the situation are clear.

First, Israel must not treat humanitarian aid as a coercive means to pressure Hamas. This tactic risks civilian lives in Gaza and subjects Israel to international condemnation and isolation. Israel must keep land crossings open and ensure that its use of force adheres to rules of engagement that protect civilians. This means more training, more accountability for civilian casualties, and better coordination with aid providers.

Second, all aid providers and facilitators need to work together. In this fractured, heavily militarized landscape, aid must flow through multiple, imperfect channels. Israel has good reason to want to prevent Hamas from deriving any benefit from international aid. Conversely, UN agencies and most international aid organizations refuse to work with any organization they deem militarized and connected to a party to the conflict, and that includes the GHF. The reality, however, is that the GHF is now the main channel for bringing in food.

By its own admission, the GHF cannot be a substitute for the UN and other international agencies or meet the full needs of Gazans. Nor is it designed or staffed to distribute specialized nutrition to the most vulnerable—children, women, and the elderly. At the same time, the established UN model for aid distribution is struggling to reach people, as its convoys are being swarmed and attacked by a combination of desperate civilians, gangs, and Hamas. The UN and the IDF—through sustained operational coordination and deconfliction—must make every possible effort to “flood the zone” in a way that discourages attempts by civilians to “self-distribute” and reduces the incentive for criminal looting. Yet because of the disorder and outright chaos engulfing the convoys, the UN is struggling to reach the most vulnerable in Gaza.



Given this situation, the UN, the GHF, and other aid providers need to coordinate with one another and with the IDF—even if this requires flexibility on deeply held positions. This means bringing in and distributing assistance to all populations in need throughout Gaza, through all available means. With this as the essential guiding principle, the UN needs to accept security from the IDF, the GHF, or its own contractors. Rather than trying to sideline the GHF, the UN should work with it or at a minimum parallel to it. And the GHF needs to be open to learning from the UN, with its deep knowledge of operating in Gaza and of how professionals structure humanitarian assistance. Fragmentation and institutional bickering will not help the situation. Alleviating the acute suffering of Gazans must come first, even if that means working with or beside actors one does not agree with and in conditions one does not fully control and would not choose.

Third, Washington needs to lead. In May, Trump played a key role in getting the GHF launched and provided it with some U.S. funding. Israel has in recent days expanded the flow of assistance into Gaza by the GHF and the UN. But without assistance at scale, too little aid is getting to people in need. This cannot be a one-time engagement by the White House. The pressure must be consistent and accompanied by sustained attention from senior U.S. officials. Far too many Gazans have died in this war. Getting aid through, however messily and imperfectly, can help save thousands more who might otherwise perish. But it will take American leadership and coordination to make that happen.

Finally, and most important, Hamas must free the hostages so this war can end. As recognized by Israel's military leaders more than a year ago, to have a future free from Hamas after the war ends, there needs to be a plan for non-Hamas governance. Hamas started a war in full knowledge that it was putting its own civilians at risk, and it is now threatening aid providers and recipients. Egypt, Qatar, and other governments with influence must press Hamas and the gangs to free the hostages, lay down their arms, and end their predatory behavior, which is playing a major role in creating mass hunger.

Humanitarian assistance—not just food but also water, shelter and medical care that meets the needs of all Gazans—can and must get back on track.

In an episode released in January 2025, Senior Editor Kanishk Tharoor spoke with the political economist Nicholas Eberstadt about the global crash in fertility rates and the looming prospect of depopulation.

Over the past century, the world's population has exploded—surging from around one and a half billion people in 1900 to roughly eight billion today. But according to Eberstadt, that chapter of human history is over, and a new era, which he calls the age of depopulation, has begun. That subject has become even more prevalent in the past year. The United States, for example, recorded its lowest ever birthrate in 2024.

Eberstadt is the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute and has written extensively on demographics, economic development, and international security. In a 2024 essay for Foreign Affairs, Eberstadt argued that plummeting fertility rates everywhere from the United States and Europe to India and China point to a new demographic order—one that will transform societies, economies, and geopolitics.

“The Age of Depopulation” by Nicholas Eberstadt

This week, we're pleased to bring you some of the best conversations from our archives. Last year, we spoke with the demographer Nicholas Eberstadt about the global crash in fertility rates and the looming prospect of depopulation. That subject has become even more prevalent in the past year. The United States, for example, recorded its lowest ever birthrate in 2024. I hope you enjoy our conversation with Nicholas Eberstadt. We'll be back next week with a new episode.

Nick, it's a pleasure to have you on the podcast.

Well, thank you for inviting me.

You wrote in our recent issue what is nothing short of a monumental piece titled, “The Age of Depopulation: Surviving a World Gone Gray.” In this piece, you make the case that, due to the collapse of fertility rates around the world, the world's population is going to begin shrinking. Now, some estimates place that happening as soon as 2053, some in the 2070s or the 2080s, but whenever it might be, it seems to be inevitable. And when this does happen, it'll be the first time that the world's population has shrunk since the Black Death of the fourteenth century ravaged Eurasia.

There's a ton of ground to cover here, but let's begin by sketching some of the trend lines. In your piece, you take us on a tour of the globe to show how fertility rates are plunging pretty much everywhere. What are some of the surprising things we learn when we spin the globe in this way?

Well, Kanishk, demographers don't really have a toolkit for forecasting fertility accurately. But over the past decade, there's been an acceleration that was entirely unanticipated of the already existing, long-term decline in global fertility, more or less everywhere. Some of the things which I think are kind of jaw dropping are to learn, for example, that in Mexico City, the current birth trends imply less than one baby per woman per lifetime, and that Mexico last year had a lower birth rate than the United States of America for the first time since those numbers were ever collected. That Thailand is down to about one birth per woman per lifetime. I first went to, then called Calcutta, now Kolkata, almost 50 years ago, and it was teeming with children. Now, officials say the fertility level is down again to one birth per woman per lifetime. And even off the coast of Africa, which is the last really high fertility bastion in the world today, a place like Mauritius is down to 1.4 births per woman per lifetime. You need a little bit over two for long-term population stability, not just two, but a little over two, since not everybody survives to childbearing years.

It's not impossible that the world has already fallen, on a planetary scale, below the level of childbearing necessary for long-term population stability. We can't tell if that's actually happened yet, but if this has not happened already, it may happen much sooner than people expected.

We know that at least two-thirds of the world's population was living in sub-replacement venues before the pandemic. We may be up to three-quarters of the world's population in such places now. It's happened with staggering speed.

It is really striking. And just to underline one of the points you raised, in India, which is the world's most populous country by most estimates, India has now become a sub-replacement country. And in Calcutta, a city that you described and a city I've spent a lot of time in—I grew up there a little bit—the numbers are staggering in that now, according to West Bengal officials, women have, on average, one birth in their lifetime. The only place where fertility seems to be fairly high is sub-Saharan Africa, but even there we're seeing dips. What's going on, as far as we can tell, in sub-Saharan Africa?

Absolutely right. In the sub-Sahara, as best we can tell from the more limited statistical evidence that we have, the overall birth level is probably 100 percent above the replacement level. So on current patterns, on current trends, that would mean the doubling of each generation. That's pretty fast population growth. What we've seen, however, is that even in the sub-Sahara, there's been a pronounced and perhaps now accelerating decline. Overall fertility levels in the sub-Sahara have dropped by more than a third since the late 1970s, early 1980s. In Southern Africa, fertility surveys are all pointing towards lower fertility. So the only question really, I think, at the moment, is: Will these continue? Will these accelerate? How long is it going to take until sub-Saharan Africa is no longer the global exception?

We're only a few decades, well, let's say six, seven decades removed from a time when people around the world were worried about the explosion of population. In the middle of the twentieth century, there was this concern that human populations were growing far beyond our capacity to sustain them, and it is striking when you take a step back and look at the twentieth century. In the twentieth century, we began at around 1.6 billion people on the planet. We ended at six billion people, which is an enormous jump. And I wonder, just to think particularly about the twentieth century, that if, sometime from now, future historians or, indeed, alien historians picking over the bones of our vanished species might find that the twentieth century was incredibly anomalous in human history.

Well, it clearly was anomalous because there had never been such a jump in human numbers in so brief a timespan. There'd never been any sort of proportional increase, a tempo like that before. What was missed by many during the population explosion panic was that this surge in human numbers was generated entirely by improvements in health: by pervasive plummets in mortality, by explosive increases in life expectancy, and really by about a doubling of planetary life expectancy at birth between 1900 and the year 2000. Look at what happened, when you had this health explosion: human capabilities increased so much. Per capita income over the course of the twentieth century soared. We didn't eliminate all extreme poverty, but we made huge inroads in it. Literacy improved virtually everywhere. Skills improved virtually everywhere, and availability of food outpaced this jump in human mouths rather handily. So when we look back at the population explosion, I think one of the most fascinating aspects of it will be how badly so-called experts mis-assessed its significance and its likely consequence.

That gets us into one of the braver contentions of your piece. You do come down a little bit definitively in this piece to identify why we are seeing such widespread collapses in fertility, and you attribute that to the simple fact of what people want, of how many children they want to have. And around the world it seems that men and women just want to have fewer kids. You write, “Volition is why even in an increasingly healthy and prosperous world of over eight billion people, the extinction of every family line could be only one generation away.”

I think this topic of low fertility rates and shrinking numbers of children is much discussed these days, and when you hear familiar answers for why this is happening, a lot of material explanations are offered. It could be that it's now very expensive to have children, so some couples are reluctant to have more than one child or any children at all. It could be that we're seeing a decline in teenage pregnancies that might be also influencing the lower number of children around. Why are explanations of that sort insufficient and why should we think purely in terms of desire?

Well, I think maybe I should start by differential diagnosis, at least addressing the question of whether there may be an increase in infertility, in infecundity, which might be the constraint that we're seeing here, a sort of a precursor to P.D. James' The Children of Men or whatever. There's no reason to think that this couldn't eventually happen through estrogen in the water or microplastics or all sorts of other potential contaminants. There doesn't seem to be any evidence that the big declines in fertility we're seeing yet are due to environmental factors. They do seem for the most part to be driven by changes in human behavior and most importantly by changes in desired family size.

Why do I say that? There were a lot of things that correlate with declining fertility, including income, education, contraception, you can go through the entire modernization litany. Problem is, there are always exceptions there, and one of the exceptions that I mentioned in the Foreign Affairs piece, for example, is what we're seeing today in Myanmar, in Burma, one of the most impoverished countries in the world. Myanmar has below-replacement fertility as well, in a non-catastrophic setting. So you don't have to be an affluent society to have parents choosing very small families. Now the question of what considerations go into this choice is an inescapably human one and thus a tremendously nuanced, personal one.

And the reasons for choosing two children or less than two children, I would guess, would be rather different in rural Burma from affluent Seoul in South Korea. What I think we can be pretty confident about is that these new patterns reflect choices that parents have made.

If I may just sort of press the point a little bit on particular explanations, what about, say, declining levels of religiosity? Does that inform fertility rates? And then, I suppose, one of the bigger explanations that you hear more often is levels of female education. Isn't it broadly true that the higher the level of education a woman attains, the fewer children she's likely to have?

I tend to think that religiosity and fertility track rather closely. I don't find that a surprise since, at least in the Judeo-Christian tradition and perhaps in all of the Abrahamic faiths, there is this injunction to be fruitful and multiply, and there's this view of the hereafter where you have a connection to the hereafter through your children and your descendants. And as for education, there has generally been a correspondence between greater educational attainment and smaller family size, but that doesn't hold everywhere anymore.

We've got fascinating exceptions also to the overall patterns of modernity, such as the increase in fertility for Israeli Jewry well above replacement in an affluent, highly educated society in the Middle East. And I think that that further reinforces the importance of volition.

It does seem broadly true that having fewer kids is the price we have to pay for a world in which we have fewer teenage pregnancies, women have greater access to public life, to employment, potentially to individual fulfillment and accomplishment. And if that's the case, is that such a bad thing? Is it not good for women and for men to have greater control over their lives and pursue the forms of accomplishment that are meaningful to them, if indeed that includes not having children?

I was one of the contrarians way back when who was arguing that governments and NGOs and others didn't know better than the parents in question how many children they should be having in low-income countries. That was during the population explosion era. I feel the same way now with sub-replacement fertility. I don't think that there are outsiders or experts who know better than the parents in question how many children parents should be having. The alternative seems rather terrifying.

To talk about those outsiders, so to speak: sub-replacement fertility has been a problem in certain societies for a long time now. Think of Japan, for instance, where the phenomenon of the emptying village in the countryside is almost a cultural trope there. But what we've seen is that governments have not been able to institute policies that in any reliable fashion can encourage the birthrate to go up in a meaningful way. You would think that by offering incentives, subsidies, other kinds of welfare provisions and benefits, government policy could have an effect in encouraging people to have children, but by and large it doesn't seem to be the case. Why is that?

I think this gets back to the whole question of volition. It gets back to the whole question of human agency. I kind of find it reassuring to find out that we're not rabbits and we're not robots, and that we can't be cheerled into having different number of children from what, in general, we'd want, and we can't be bribed into having a different level of childbearing than we'd want. The record of pronatal policies around the world, as I read it, is that it's very expensive to get really marginal or tiny fractional changes in long-term childbearing.

So from my standpoint, at least from my perspective in looking at this, it seems to me there is a lot that human beings and their governments and civil institutions of all various sorts can do to adjust to shrinking and aging populations, just the way we adjusted to a growing world, when we had a population explosion. And that the emphasis should be on making the most for human flourishing, for the human beings that exist, rather than trying to count chickens that are never going to hatch.

Some people have a rather apocalyptic view of depopulation. They imagine that societies will crumble, anarchy will reign. That doesn't seem to be your view. You write, “The problems that [depopulation] raises are not necessarily tantamount to a catastrophe. Depopulation is not a grave sentence; rather, it is a difficult new context, one in which countries can still find ways to thrive.”

Just look at it in the mirror of the population explosion. Look how wrong so many of the experts were about what its consequences would be. It's quite clear that a shrinking, aging world is something that we're intuitively, almost completely unprepared to encounter, because all of our experience, in ways that we don't even think about, has been framed by a growing world population. We don't know how to cope with this yet, but human beings are very good at coping. We're very good at coping. We're very good at adapting. And given the foundations that we put into place in the twentieth century for routinizing improvements in health, routinizing improvements in education, routinizing improvements in scientific advance and technological progress and innovation, It's not as if we are in a tightly, relentlessly worsening straitjacket. We've got an awful lot of opportunity to help us deal with these inevitable social changes that we'll be confronting.

Well, let's talk a little bit about those social changes, the major one being that a depopulating world where there are fewer children is invariably going to be an aging world. You'll have more and more older people and fewer and fewer young people. What would it be like to live in such a society, and specifically in the US context, what new problems would we face that we have not yet encountered?

Well, certainly aging and shrinking societies will require very different approaches to government policy, but they're also going to require different approaches for corporations, for communities, for families, for individual behavior. One of the most obvious government policy challenges: financing of social programs. We came up in the twentieth century with this contrivance of pay-as-you-go social programs. You have current earners financing the retirement or the medical care of current retirees. When you live in a world where there are five or six current earners for every retiree, that's great. You're getting social benefits on the cheap. As soon as that population pyramid tilts, you're in a doom loop. You just can't do it.

And we know enough about how population trends are going to unfold over the next couple of decades because all of the workers for 2040 have already been born, for example. We know enough that we should already be preparing for a set of social guarantees that transcend this old-fashioned pay-as-you-go model. It's not going to be all sugar and light because some particular group, some particular birth cohort is going to be the one that kind of loses out on the musical chairs. They'll have to both start financing their own retirement and they'll have ended up paying for somebody else's.

The way that I think humane and intelligent government policy ought to be working with something like that is to help compensate that particular group, so you come as close as possible to an overall situation where there are winners without losers.

At the risk of inviting your optimism, what will be the mark of a country that's dealing with depopulation well, and then conversely, what will a country that's struggling to deal with depopulation look like?

Well, this inescapable challenge of dealing with depopulation is going to be a problem for the entire world economy. Who's going to deal with it well? The governments and the societies that have the foresight and the social trust to start thinking about how to recalibrate to be nimble and timely in this. There may well be a learning curve and the early pioneers in this may be the ones who have to take the licks on this, but certainly having a foresighted government and having enough social trust so that there can be complex cooperation in the face of a pressure that's going to require immense complex cooperation.

What sorts of policies, at the national or indeed intergovernmental level, could be put in place now to better prepare the world for a future of dwindling national populations?

Everybody will be better off with more money. When you've got more money, you've got more options. So I would say policies that encourage countries to get rich as fast as they can sustainably can't hurt. I would think of those as being efforts to improve health, efforts to improve skills, efforts to increase research horizons and knowledge production. People are going to have to pay much more attention, I think, to personal savings and to personal conduct, especially when we get towards the upside-down population pyramid, and that includes looking after one's own health.

I expect that we're going to see a world in which longer-living peoples also are longer-working peoples. And I can tell you as a very happily employed senior citizen that there are a lot of great benefits to working past the technical retirement level.

So you're a vision of the future?

Well, it's nothing to be afraid of. Let's put it that way.

We haven't talked yet about migration, which I think is often raised as a potential solution for those countries where low fertility rates mean they're going to see a great shortfall in the workers they need. Migration from countries that are growing at a faster clip is often suggested as a possible solution. What do you see as the role of migration in the coming decades?

Well, migration is going to be a great benefit for those states and countries that can, let's say, have a competitive migration policy, where they attract talent from abroad and where they can absorb and assimilate that talent into loyal and productive newcomers. I'd say that the history of the United States, of Canada, of Australia, of New Zealand have been pretty good at being able to assimilate newcomers, obviously not perfect, but been pretty good on the whole. But not every country seems to be able or willing to do that in the rich world.

In addition to migration, another potential solution that's often raised is the burgeoning areas of automation and artificial intelligence. Do you see any reason to think that those sorts of technologies might help buffer against the worst impacts of depopulation?

Well, of course robotics, of course artificial intelligence, of course all sorts of technological innovations offer a sort of productivity multiplier for aging, shrinking societies. Without getting too fancy about it, it's another form of mechanization. And for a couple of centuries, human beings have been relying more and more on mechanization to increase human productivity. The great concern, as you know, that is voiced today is whether we might see extraordinary displacement of manpower, even in shrinking societies, with radical innovations in AI and machine learning and so forth. I'm certainly not going to say that that's impossible.

I would observe that it's much less likely if we skill up in societies all around the world, because in the race between education and technology, it's the more educated that seem less likely to be displaced in these great transformations.

You are actually fairly sanguine about the prospects of the United States in the coming decades. It is true that the United States actually has, by the standards of other wealthy countries and indeed of its principal geopolitical rivals, a fairly high fertility rate—below replacement level, but still fairly high. And you've described the United States in the past as an outlier, but why does the United States remain that kind of outlier and how do you see the United States faring in the era of depopulation?

Long ago, I described the United States as an exemplar of demographic exceptionalism. That was back in the early 2000s. I think this is still the case, but less absolutely spectacularly so than we would've seen a decade and a half ago. The United States has a relatively high level of fertility for an affluent society, although now, unlike a decade and a half ago, it's below replacement. The United States also has been a magnet for immigration from all around the world, including absolutely, extraordinary, uncanny capacity to attract entrepreneurial and inventor talent from around the world, even though they're a small portion of the overall flow of migrants.

This being the case, the United States is, as an arithmetic proposition, on a trajectory to continue to increase in total headcount, although rather modestly, over the next couple of decades; its working age population to increase rather modestly over the next couple of decades; its population composition to go gray, but more modestly than in some of the other places we might be looking at. And to the extent that those sorts of trends matter, it's arguably favorable for the United States of America. If this sounds too “Yankee Doodle Dandy” for people, I should also point to the elephant in the room, which is the litany of problems we have in the United States today, ranging from health to slowdown in educational improvement, to the divisiveness in our society, to a uncanny appetite for financing current social programs on public debt.

There are plenty of headwinds to what I'm describing, but in the unforgiving world of power politics, you don't compare yourself to the ideal; you compare yourself to whatever else is in the field. And although I would like to see those problems in my own country addressed and alleviated, if we're doing the clinical comparison, we'd have to say that there are some advantages for the United States in this situation looking forward.

And I suppose in terms of those advantages, it seems that at least when we're looking at demographic trends, countries like Russia, China, even Iran and North Korea, are in a much worse state than the United States.

If we simply look at the human resources, China and Russia are both depopulating societies. China is aging very, very, very rapidly. Russia has a long-standing cough that it can't shake. It's got this health crisis that began under the Soviets that is still dogging the country. Iran is a below-replacement society, which is going to begin shrinking before people appreciate this. The mullahs, by the way, are very aware of the demographic constraints on the national power there. What goes on in North Korea stays in North Korea, except the troops on the Kursk Oblast, I guess, so we don't really know what the demographic situation is in North Korea, except that we have seen the supreme leader and living god, Kim Jong Un, declaim in alarmed terms about the low birthrate in this country.

So you've got aging and shrinking societies in the largest of these countries. So I argue in this piece that the demographic tides are running against the revisionist dictators of Eurasia. That doesn't mean that any of these countries is harmless. North Korea has a GDP of approximately zero, and it causes all sorts of trouble in the world. So if you have the second-largest economy in the world, China, run by revisionists, you can expect you're going to be in perhaps for a rather bumpy ride. But that doesn't mean that the future is going to be open for the dictatorships from the Eurasian heartland.

I've seen it said that the way that many on the left perceive climate change as a sort of framing existential crisis, that for people on the right depopulation is beginning to serve a similar kind of function. And we see this in political rhetoric, in the rhetoric of individuals like Elon Musk. What's it been like for you to see your work and the stuff of your work become such a political flashpoint?

P.J. O'Rourke, the late, great humorist, had a chapter in a book of his, a book called All the Trouble in the World. It was a chapter about overpopulation, and I think the subtitle was, “Just enough of us, way too much of you.” And there's often a temptation when people talk about population to frame it in sort of tribalistic terms like that. During the population explosion, I think there was more than a touch of eugenic talk tinge to some of this, even in seemingly enlightened climes. The prospect of extinction has a way of maybe sometimes clarifying one's thinking. Sometimes it has a way of inflaming people's thinking.

I would say that what concerns me the most in the United States about low fertility is not the birth numbers per se, but the array of attitudes that are often associated with these: demoralized, worried about the future, the anxiety, the lack of confidence, the lack of patriotism. And it's those attitudes, rather than the birth numbers, that may have a formative effect on society. And I argue in another essay that I wrote that the United States may be less prepared for low fertility today than it was in the past, given these changing attitudes that we see in the United States. But I don't think that has to do as much with the numbers as with other things that we associate with the numbers and maybe shouldn't.

Well, on that note, Nick, thanks so much for speaking with us, and thank you again for writing your wonderful essay.

It was a pleasure. Thank you.

            Eighty years ago, as the sea swayed him from side to side on an attack vessel heading towards Iwo Jima, Thomas Begay started to feel afraid.
    


            “On the ship, they said: ‘get your last scrap of steak and eggs,'” he recalled. “That gave (me) some kind of feeling in my stomach. What am I doing here? What's going to happen?”
    


            “It's a scary thing,” the veteran told CNN from his home in Window Rock, Arizona. “You don't know where the bullet or the bomb will come from.”
    


            Begay landed on the island as a member of the 5th Marine Division, but his role was unique: He was a Navajo Code Talker, deployed into battle to help the US military send encrypted messages that enemy forces were unable to decipher.
    


            More than 400 Navajo Code Talkers were sent to the Pacific during World War II, operating alongside the Marines at pivotal battles including those at Saipan, Guam, Tinian and Iwo Jima. Their code proved vital: it was never cracked by the Japanese, and allowed US troops to organize their movements without the enemy's knowledge.
    


            Thursday is National Navajo Code Talker Day – an annual celebration created by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. It is also the 80th anniversary of Japan's initial surrender in World War II, which effectively ended the costliest war in human history. The documents codifying their surrender were signed a few weeks later.
    


            Today, just two Code Talkers survive. CNN spoke to both – Peter MacDonald, 96, and Begay, who is now 100 – about their recollections from the war and how their contributions are recognized across the US.
    


            But while their service is recorded in history books, how they are remembered remains a live issue. The Code Talkers have been dragged into the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and a years-long effort to create a dedicated national museum has stalled and may stretch beyond MacDonald and Begay's lifetimes.
    


            For MacDonald, they are trends with troubling historical echoes.
    


            “It's a form of discrimination,” he told CNN of the Pentagon's deletion in March of webpages documenting their service – an act the Department of Defense reversed, but which drew fury across the Navajo Nation. “Over 100 years, we lived through all of that discrimination.”
    


            “We need to take a serious look at what we are doing here in America,” MacDonald added. “At what America has done to Native Americans, and maybe other minorities.”
    


            “We need serious discussion,” he said. “We cannot go on this way.”
    


            The secretive and dangerous journey that led MacDonald into America's history books began when he saw another member of his clan in a Marines uniform. “I asked: where can I get one of those beautiful uniforms you're wearing?” he told CNN.
    


            MacDonald was told he'd need to enlist with the Marines. But there was a problem: he was only 15, two years below the age requirement.
    


            That didn't deter him. “We've been carrying rifles since we were 7 or 8 years old,” he said, telling his fellow clan member: “We shoot rabbits, we shoot squirrels, we shoot birds, and sometimes I'm a better shot than you.”
    


            MacDonald lied about his age and enlisted. He told CNN that on his visit to the enrollment office, he said: “I don't want the Japanese to ever come here to Window Rock, Arizona.”
    


            “We had seen enough of (that) stuff before, and we don't like it,” he told CNN. “This is our land and we're going to protect it.”
    


            There was an irony to his eagerness. Native people had been full American citizens for just two decades, but they still didn't have the right to vote. Many Native children, including a significant portion of the Code Talker cohort, were still being taken from their families and forced to enroll in boarding schools, where they were stripped of their language and other traditions.
    


            With the Marines MacDonald was summoned to a meeting, where he found dozens of fellow Navajo. And in that room, he discovered a secret: The same Navajo language that many of his peers were forced to abandon was now being used to win a war.
    


            The idea had been proposed to the Marines by Philip Johnston, an engineer and the son of a missionary who had grown up alongside Navajo children. It was nearly indecipherable: virtually nobody outside the Navajo nation spoke the language.
    


            The Code Talkers developed an extensive and complicated code based on their own language, which substituted key military and geographical terms for related images.
    


            “Tank” became “chay-da-gahi,” which means “turtle.” “Fighter plane” “was da-he-tih-hi,” or “hummingbird.” In many cases, they were forced to invent new words altogether, because Navajo didn't contain direct translations.
    


            When Code Talkers were deployed in battle they were assigned Marine escorts for protection after multiple Code Talkers were mistaken for Japanese soldiers and confronted by US troops.
    


            “A lot of times we were mistaken for Japanese,” Chester Nez, a Code Talker who died in 2014, said in an oral history interview for the Library of Congress. Nez recalled being stopped by a Marine while walking back to camp with a fellow Code Talker on the island of Guadalcanal in 1942. Nez, barred from disclosing any information about the Code Talker program even to fellow Marines, said the pair were telephone operators.
    


            “He didn't believe us,” Nez said “This guy took a .45 and stuck it in my head and my body … that was the most scary thing that happened to me.”
    


            Code Talkers spoke into their hefty radios when an instruction needed relaying.
    


            For example, MacDonald explained that on Iwo Jima, a message needed to be sent to headquarters: “Send demolition team to hill 362B.”
    


            The message that was transmitted over radio was: “Sheep. Eyes. Nose. Deer. Destroyer. Tea. Mouse. Turkey. Onion. Sick horse. Three. Six. Two. Bear.”
    


            In all, more than 800 messages were sent between Code Talkers at Iwo Jima.
    


            Begay was one of those on the island, and he remembers how he felt when he saw an American flag raised on Mount Suribachi. It had been hoisted by six Marines days earlier, a moment captured in an iconic photograph by the Associated Press photojournalist Joe Rosenthal.
    


            “My God,” he said. “I was so proud.”
    


            When MacDonald and Begay returned to the US after the war, they were sworn to secrecy. The code talker program remained classified until 1968, in case the military should ever need to reactivate it.
    


            For the Navajo who powered the program, that meant returning to their pre-war lives, excluded from the heroes' welcome that many other returning soldiers received.
    


            “We had really gotten used to being treated as a second-class citizen,” MacDonald said, adding his experience was “no different” after his return. “We were very much mistreated in America.”
    


            “We were not rich at all,” he continued. “We were just trying to survive. In the meantime, when you go into town, (non-Native) people make fun of you: people tell you … ‘you don't sit there, you eat over there, you don't use this, you do that.'”
    


            Begay's son remembers the day the secret was lifted: his father came home and finally told his family what he had done during the war.
    


            “Right away I started asking him questions at the dinner table,” said Ronald Begay, himself a veteran of the Army. “I didn't know that, because it was never in the history books. I was proud of my dad.”
    


            Both men had long post-war careers. Begay retired in 1984 after 40 years of federal service as a superintendent at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Chinle, Arizona.
    


            MacDonald's legacy is more complicated. He served four terms as the Navajo Nation chairman, becoming popular for aggressively championing Navajo sovereignty. But he was sentenced to jail time in 1990 on federal and tribal charges, including bribery and racketeering; his earlier refusal to step down when placed on administrative leave led to a lengthy standoff and ultimately a riot in which two of his supporters died. President Bill Clinton would ultimately commute his sentence to time served.
    


            At a White House reception hosted by President Donald Trump in 2017, MacDonald said he and his then-12 fellow surviving Code Talkers had one last mission: to ensure the memory of their accomplishments was kept alive.
    


            It is not a memory that has always been respected. MacDonald had hoped that “Windtalkers,” a 2002 action movie based on their contributions, would serve as a cultural touchstone for a new generation. But the production was critically panned and criticized for its historical inaccuracies.
    


            “They asked us to come to their opening,” MacDonald told CNN about the movie's premiere. “And what do we see? About 20% of the movie was Navajo Code Talkers. 80% of the movie was about Nicolas Cage and whatever problem he was having with his girlfriend,” he said.
    


            For several years, one of the best collections of artifacts relating to the Code Talkers was found in an unlikely place: a Burger King in Kayenta, Arizona. Small exhibits also exist in museums in nearby Tuba City and in Gallup, New Mexico, but MacDonald has campaigned for a museum dedicated solely to the Code Talkers. That project is ongoing.
    


            Earlier this year, the surviving Code Talkers experienced an unexpected new assault on their legacy.
    


            Amid a sweeping purge of webpages that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, the Pentagon wiped a number of pages honoring the contribution of MacDonald, Begay and their peers.
    


            It was part of a hurried crackdown that also saw the deletion of information completely unrelated to DEI issues – like Holocaust remembrance, suicide prevention and the Enola Gay aircraft – or pages that commemorated other war heroes like World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves and historically significant service members such as baseball great Jackie Robinson.
    


            “The new administration came in, and I guess they want to change a lot of things,” MacDonald told CNN. “They wanted nothing, no words, about Navajo Code Talkers.”
    


            Multiple defense officials told CNN at the time that military units were instructed to simply use keyword searches like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “history” and “first” when searching for articles and photos to remove.
    


            The Pentagon subsequently restored the pages, and Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said in a statement at the time: “In the rare cases that content is removed — either deliberately or by mistake — that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content so it recognizes our heroes for their dedicated service alongside their fellow Americans, period.”
    


            The episode became a flashpoint in the national controversy over the Trump administration's targeting of DEI initiatives. Ronald Begay, who champions his father's efforts to preserve the Code Talkers' legacy, said he was “appalled” by the saga.
    


            “I immediately started texting the Navajo Code Talker descendants, as well as some prominent veterans – we support each other in various ways,” he said. “Why would they do that?” he asked. “After all, that's why we are free … our language was historic.”
    


            The episode was quickly undone. But for the Code Talkers and their descendants, it struck at the heart of a deep-rooted fear: that their legacy will be sidelined once MacDonald and Begay are not longer around to tell their stories.
    


            “We need a good ‘thank you' from the people who have become wealthy in America,” MacDonald said. He'd like a new movie to be made about their contribution, alongside a permanent, dedicated museum.
    


            MacDonald and other Code Talkers have campaigned for years to make the museum project a reality, but it remains tens of millions of dollars out of reach, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported in 2023. CNN has contacted organizers of the project for an update on its progress.
    


            “I don't believe (people) understand this tremendous contribution to the battle in the Pacific War,” he said. “It made all the difference in the world.”
    


            The next time a post-war milestone is met, it is possible that no Code Talkers will be alive to greet it. But MacDonald and Begay hope their contribution to American history is remembered once they are no longer present to tell their stories.
    


            “I believe this is the only country in the entire world blessed by the holy ones,” MacDonald said. “And we need to keep it that way.”
    


            But the Pentagon's DEI purge and the lack of progress on the long-running effort to cement the Code Talkers' legacy with a museum has angered him. “We need to get back to serious thinking (about) how we're gonna live into the next century,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Republicans pitch Trump's domestic policy agenda in Iowa, but some entrepreneurs aren't yet sold","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/politics/republicans-iowa-trump-agenda-small-businesses","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            When Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler touted that her agency guarantees approximately 2,000 small business loans every week, Laura Pager, a small business contractor who says she has lost out on millions of dollars in work this year in the wake of the Department of Government Efficiency's slashing of the federal government, wrote it down in disbelief.
    


            Pager, the president of an Illinois-based contracting firm that contracts with agencies across the federal government, was sitting in the third row at an event hosted by GOP Sen. Joni Ernst with Loeffler and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs learn more about federal and state contracting opportunities in the Trump administration.
    


            The optimism she was hearing on stage was not reflecting her reality.
    


            “I don't know who the 2,000 small businesses are that were approved every week,” said Pager, the president of Gale Construction Company. “I could tell you it's not mine.”
    


            “Since January 20, 2025, SBA has approved 46,430 504 and 7(a) loans for over $24 billion - as well as 25,032 disaster loans for $3.8 billion. This equates to nearly 2,500 loans per week,” SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons told CNN.
    


            The small businesses event hosted this week by Ernst at Iowa State University comes as her party has been tasked with using Congress' month away from Washington to sell President Donald Trump's massive agenda. That effort, on the heels of Trump's unprecedented overhaul of the federal work force and the GOP's historic cuts to the social safety net amid other provisions in his “big, beautiful bill,” has already met some resistance from members of the public.
    


            In her nearly three decades of experience, Pager says she has not seen anything like the current environment for small businesses.
    


            She's lost out, she said, on approximately $6 million in work this year after DOGE pulled contracts as part of its federal cost-cutting efforts — one to secure a federal building in Pittsburgh that houses the Internal Revenue Service and Army Corps of Engineers and the other to fix the HVAC at an airport control tower in Maine. She said that a go-to contact for her at the SBA, a region-based business opportunity specialist who helps small businesses navigate the federal government, retired with no one appearing to replace her
    


            “We don't have the number of resources and the people to go to anymore,” said Pager, who said she voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and works mostly with Republicans. “Agencies we work with generally have a much more limited staff now. And I feel like they're flustered.”
    


            The event on Tuesday laid bare the competing realities for small businesses trying to work with the Trump administration. While Trump and his Cabinet are seeking to promote business in the United States and tout the president's signature legislative achievement so far, their push to downsize the federal government has left some business owners and entrepreneurs with questions as they try to navigate a changing environment.
    


            It's requiring a threading of the needle for agency heads and GOP lawmakers —Republicans, who have broadly called for slashing federal spending, now find themselves having to make the case for why small businesses should find their agencies a worthy investment partner.  In Iowa this week, they looked to frame the debate.
    


            On top of Loeffler and Zeldin's visits, Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins visited the Iowa State Fair over the weekend to announce new rural development investments and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright is expected to visit the state later this week.
    


            “We are reshaping the federal government to be more responsive to the private sector,” Loeffler argued.
    


            Ernst, who's facing reelection in 2026 and wouldn't comment to CNN Tuesday whether she plans to defend her seat, says her third annual “Made in America Expo” was designed to help businesses in her state develop direct relationships with the decisionmakers in the federal government. But as chair of the DOGE caucus in the Senate, she argued that cutting the size of the federal government will help small businesses grow.
    


            “We know that federal government is not the answer when it comes to issues at the local level. Those that are most responsive are at the local level,” she said. “So, downsizing the federal government, pushing some of that outward, especially into the heartland where we actually have people that do want to work, provide efficient services for the federal government, that's the opportunity that we should be providing.”
    


            Ernst's event sought to bring key politicians and representatives from across the federal government to Iowa as a chance to level the playing field and create face-to-face interactions. Many small business directors for their respective agencies were in attendance.
    


            Charlie Smith, director of the Department of Energy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, complimented Ernst and the agency heads for their emphasis on creating small business partnerships, suggesting the issue of creating that connection is not necessarily new.
    


            “That's always been the struggle, is to make the opportunities known to small businesses,” he said. “And I think this administration's got a number of initiatives that are looking to do exactly that.”
    


            To hear Loeffler, Zeldin and Ernst describe it, the Biden administration was completely wrong in how it tackled small business development.
    


            “We inherited a very big mess,” Zeldin claimed.
    


            Part of their pitch in how they are making opportunities better for small businesses was highlighting the extensive cuts they've made to their agencies to eliminate what they saw as waste and emphasizing their desire to get government out of the way to encourage more manufacturing and investments in the US.
    


            The administrators and Ernst pointed to wins from Trump's tax and spending law, which will create several tax breaks that benefit small businesses, such as allowing businesses to fully and immediately deduct the cost of building new manufacturing facilities. The trio also credited Trump with keeping overall inflation tame in July and pointed to investments like the more than $90 billion from private companies across tech, energy and finance to turn Pennsylvania into an artificial intelligence hub.
    


            Ernst, who chairs the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, promoted her new, bipartisan legislation that would increase the maximum loan limit for small businesses in an aim to boost domestic manufacturing. She hopes the bill will get a final vote when the Senate returns in September.
    


            Meanwhile at the event, Iowa GOP Rep. Randy Feenstra stood in front of a crowd of small business leaders and entrepreneurs to make his case for why they should support Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts law.
    


            “Maybe some of you don't always think it's beautiful. I do,” Feenstra quipped, before ticking through a list of tax breaks that are geared toward helping small businesses specifically.
    


            Feenstra, who has launched an exploratory committee for governor, is not facing a tough reelection battle should he remain in the House. But two of his Republican Iowan colleagues, GOP Rep. Zach Nunn and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, are running in some of the most competitive House races in the country for next year's midterms and are having to be even more delicate in their pitch.
    


            Majority Leader Steve Scalise was in Iowa this week making public appearances with Nunn and Miller-Meeks and fundraising on their behalf. Speaking with CNN at the Iowa State Fair, Scalise and Nunn laid out their perspective to voters and provided a window into how Republicans are trying to sell Trump's landmark legislation – instead of getting pulled into discussing the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


            Throughout his remarks on Tuesday, Zeldin argued that the EPA can both protect the environment and grow the economy after the administration's move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health. But businesses in Iowa, a Republican stronghold that uses more clean energy than many blue states, must also contend with Republicans' rollback of clean energy tax credits.
    


            Iowa Republicans now face the challenge of having to defend the elimination of the renewable energy tax credits in Trump's trademark legislation that they sought to protect.
    


            Scalise and Nunn argued the elimination of those credits doesn't mean they don't support renewable energy, but argued the elimination was designed to create an even playing field and ween the US off of foreign energy. Nunn also pointed to the tax credit for biofuels that he worked to get in the final bill.
    


            “We've got a great opportunity here in Iowa with wind. We are the number one producer and consumer of wind. We've made this work,” Nunn told CNN. “It's most important that we're not dependent on foreign energy anymore. And this bill delivers that.”
    


            Scalise addressed the legislation's deep cuts to Medicaid and defended the work requirements Republicans put in place, which Democrats have seized on in their messaging against the law.
    


             “By putting in place responsible work requirements, now it's going to help the truly needy be able to get better care in programs like Medicaid. And then the folks that are going to go get work, which is a good thing by the way, are going to be able to get work and get a job and get health care in the private sector, which is going to be even better than Medicaid,” he said.
    


            But for some in attendance at Ernst's event on Tuesday, what the officials were selling wasn't the full picture.
    


            Victor Santana, who owns a Chicago-based company that helps hundreds of small businesses nationwide secure federal contracts, said he spent most of the event introducing small business owners to representatives from federal agencies.
    


            “They are lost,” Santana said of the business leaders he met at the event. “They can't figure out which way is up, which way is down.”
    


            Santana, who said he has been in the business for 24 years and prides himself on his government contacts, said he's gotten few answers about replacements or a path forward after the slashing of the federal workforce.
    


            “It's like, ‘Wait a minute, so and so's not there? Well, who is taking over? Who is in charge?'” Santana said of his conversations with agency contacts. “That's scary because a lot of these small businesses need to know. It's very hard to work with government and get those answers.”
    


            For some in the audience, Zeldin's message of rolling back environmental regulations is cause for concern.
    


            Jordi Quevedo-Valls, who co-founded a startup marketplace designed to facilitate the buying and selling of small businesses, said the EPA's rollback of environmental protections is concerning and has a real impact on how businesses move forward.
    


            “I mean that I completely disagree with. I mean, the science is there,” Quevedo-Valls, who said he “reluctantly” voted for Harris in 2024, told CNN.
    


            From Fairfield, Iowa, Quevedo-Valls said he is happy with some of the Trump administration rollbacks but called the decision to phase out clean energy tax credits “terrible, terrible, terrible.”
    


            The emphasis from Ernst and the Trump administration officials on creating new businesses left Tanner Heikens wanting clarification. Heikens said he voted for Trump, but has things he likes and doesn't like about the administration.
    


            “I'm glad that they're pro-business, but I think that they're pushing creation of business and not worrying as much about existing businesses, especially in the labor force that we're in,” said Heikens, who works at an Iowa-based food manufacturing company that feeds between 50,000-70,000 people a week in the restaurant and health care industries.
    


            “In the manufacturing world it is tough already, and if you're putting a bunch of money into new businesses, that's just thinning the herd already.”

            Prosecutors will take “no further action” against a Florida sheriff's deputy in the arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers during a February traffic stop.
    


            The actions of Officer D. Bowers of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office did not constitute a crime, according to an investigative report released by the State Attorney's Office for the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.
    


            A video showing officers punching and dragging William McNeil from his car sparked nationwide outrage, though Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters has said there's more to the story than the cell phone video that went viral online and that McNeil was repeatedly asked to exit his vehicle.
    


            In the investigative memo released Wednesday, prosecutors called the cell phone footage “incomplete in scope” and said Bowers made a lawful traffic stop when he pulled McNeil over and that Bowers' use of force was justified.
    


Florida police under fire as video of Black man punched, dragged by deputies during traffic stop goes viral



            “The State Attorney's Office has reviewed this matter to determine whether any of Officer Bowers' actions constitute a crime. We conclude they do not,” the report reads.
    


            According to the report, Bowers stopped McNeil for failing to turn on his headlights and buckle his seatbelt, after seeing his SUV parked outside a house the officer was surveilling for “drug activity.”
    


            Based on a review of officer body camera footage, interviews the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office conducted with the officers involved and statements by McNeil, prosecutors said Bowers gave McNeil a dozen “lawful commands,” which he disobeyed.
    


            After Bowers pulled him over, McNeil questioned the stop and declined to provide his license and registration. Though he earlier had his car door open while talking with an officer, he later closed it and appeared to keep it locked for about three minutes before the officers forcibly removed him, the video shows.
    


            “It is the officers' body-worn camera footage that provides the additional needed context of the circumstances preceding, surrounding, and following McNeil's arrest,” the report reads.
    


            A statement from McNeil's lawyers, Ben Crump and Harry Daniels, called the report clearing the deputy “little more than an attempt to justify the actions of Officer Bowers and his fellow officers after the fact.” Crump is a Black civil rights attorney who has gained national prominence representing victims of police brutality and vigilante violence.
    


            “Frankly, we expected nothing less especially after Sheriff Waters announced their conclusions more than three weeks before the report was issued,” the statement said. “Since they are unwilling to seek justice, we will have to request that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate this incident and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.”
    


            Previously, Crump has fiercely criticized prosecutors' finding that officers did not commit any criminal wrongdoing, saying his client remained calm while the officers who are trained to deescalate tense situations were the ones escalating violence. Crump said the case harkened back to the Civil Rights movement, when Black people were often attacked when they tried to assert their rights.

            Taylor Swift got candid in a nearly two-hour pre-recorded podcast with her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce that at one point brought more than a million viewers to a YouTube stream on Wednesday evening.
    


            Teasers released ahead of her inaugural appearance on “New Heights” revealed the singer would be talking about her new album, “The Life of a Showgirl” and opening up about her historic Eras Tour, which concluded in December 2024.
    


            She hit on both subjects at length in the episode, but some of the most exciting moments came from conversations that were less anticipated – like when she got emotional speaking about the moment she learned she was going to once again own her entire catalog of music or when she opened up about her parents' health struggles this summer.
    


            Here are some of the highlights from their conversation:
    


            “The Life of a Showgirl” will be released on October 3 and will include 12 tracks – a nod to this being the pop superstar's 12th studio album — including a final song featuring Sabrina Carpenter.
    


            “This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,” Swift said.
    


            The album marks a reunion between Swift and legendary producers Max Martin and Shellback, who worked with her pop-heavy hits “Red,” “1989” and “Reputation.” These albums also feature several of her top songs, including “Shake It Off,” “Delicate,” “Blank Space” and “I Knew You were Trouble.”
    


            Swift said her goal for the new album was to have “melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it” and lyrics that were “just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional.”
    


            Swift said the album's theme is “everything that was going on behind the curtain,” later saying she wanted the cover to communicate the same idea. It's “the life beyond the show,” she said.
    


            Asked of the significance behind the album's orange iconography, Swift explained that it is “energetically how my life has felt,” she said, describing it as “exuberant and electric and vibrant.”
    


            Jason Kelce, a retired center for the Philadelphia Eagles and Super Bowl champ, then asked if he'd get to hear the album ahead of time, to which Swift said no.
    


            “We don't trust you at all,” she said.
    


            He replied: “Honestly, smart.”
    


            How Travis Kelce and Swift came to be one of the most famous power couples around is now well-known lore, and Swift joked that the podcast “got me a boyfriend.” But her beau said he actually gives the Eras Tour credit for their relationship.
    


            “If I never would have gone to that show and just been mesmerized and just been captivated and then left with such a desire to want to meet you, I would have never went on here and told everybody how butthurt I was (when he didn't get a chance to give her a friendship bracelet he'd made for her). I had never been so engulfed in the curiosity of who you were,” he said.
    


            Swift made an audible “aww” and added “that's really beautiful.”
    


            His brother quipped in response: “The best part of that statement is that you didn't know what the word ‘engulfed' meant before you met Taylor.”
    


            Swift and Travis Kelce appeared incredibly comfortable with one another throughout the episode, often sitting with arms intertwined.
    


            At another point in the episode, Swift revealed the “green flag” she saw early on as she got to know Travis Kelce was his ability to maintain friendships.
    


            “Travis has had the same friends since he was probably four years old,” she said. “He's incredibly good at maintaining friendships and is so loyal and his friends are equally loyal and the funniest, most hilarious group of people.”
    


            Travis Kelce described Swift's “reclaiming” of her master recordings as one of his favorite things that happened this summer, launching Swift into a detailed account of how it came to be.
    


            Swift said she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to discuss acquiring her music catalog with the private equity company Shamrock Capital that previously owned her music.
    


            “They sat down with Shamrock Capital and they told them what this meant for me,” she recalled. “They told them the whole story of all the times we've tried to buy it, all the times it's fallen through.”
    


            Swift said she received news that she acquired her master recordings a few months after the Super Bowl.
    


            “I get a call from my mom and she's like, ‘You got your music,'” Swift said while tearing up. “It's literally been so long since this happened, and it's every time I talk about it….I just like very dramatically hit the floor for real. Honestly, just started like bawling my eyes out, and I'm just like weeping.”
    


            Travis Kelce admitted he started crying, too.
    


            “You were weeping,” she echoed.
    


            In May, Swift became the owner of her entire catalog of music, roughly six years after she protested the sale of the master recordings of her first six albums by her former record label.
    


            Swift announced the news in a letter posted to her website at the time, writing that “all of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me.”
    


            The Grammy-winner specified that she owns all her music videos, concert films, album art and photography, along with unreleased songs and that she purchased her music “outright with no strings attached, no partnership, full autonomy,” from Shamrock Capital.
    


            Her schedule might appear perpetually packed, but Swift actually does have free time and hobbies, which include painting, cooking and “a different baking obsession every six months.”
    


            Travis Kelce joked: “I'm the luckiest man in the world.”
    


            “Right now, we're very deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life,” she added.
    


            Travis Kelce says he is very grateful to be running and training as much as he is right now, because “I am getting the caloric intake.”
    


            Taylor Swift said he asked her to send him two loaves of sourdough at training camp.
    


            “I'm talking about bread 60% of the times now,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, she has been perfecting a “funfetti sourdough” for Jason Kelce's children “because they love sprinkles.”
    


            “It's gonna blow their mind,” Jason Kelce said.
    


            Work hard, recover harder – that's a principle both Travis Kelce and Swift seem to follow dutifully.
    


            Swift opened about about the grueling toll her three-hour performances would take on her.
    


            “It was a lot of physical therapy and it was a lot of being in a state of perpetual discomfort,” she said.
    


            She told Travis Kelce, “(It's) kind of like when you're in season. I'm not getting hit by huge 300-pounders, but the heels…”
    


            Travis Kelce recalled seeing what he called “the recovery station” at the hotel.
    


            “S**t, I'm telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,” Kelce said. “I was like, ‘Oh my Gosh. She does more than I do.'”
    


            He added: “We related on how much torture we put our bodies through.”

            A man who worked for the Department of Justice was charged Wednesday after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal law enforcement officer in Washington, DC, amid President Donald Trump's takeover of the city's police and increase in federal law enforcement presence.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on social media Thursday that the man has been fired. He was an international affairs specialist in the Criminal Division of the Office of International Affairs, according to a source.
    


            “If you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you,” Bondi wrote. “I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER. Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.”
    


            “This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,” Bondi said of the sandwich incident. “You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.”
    


            According to police, Sean Charles Dunn confronted a group of US Customs and Border Protection officers on 14th Street in Northwest DC on Sunday night, calling them “fascists,” according to court documents. During the incident, Dunn allegedly approached a CBP officer and shouted expletives, adding, “Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!”
    


            Dunn then crossed the street but returned and threw a “sub-style sandwich” at the officer's chest, police said. Dunn then attempted to run away but was arrested, the documents said.
    


            Dunn allegedly confessed while being processed, saying, “I did it. I threw a sandwich,” the documents stated. Dunn is charged with assaulting a federal police officer.
    


            Dunn has not entered a plea in the case and faces a felony charge of assaulting an officer. CNN has reached out to his attorney.
    


            US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro touted Dunn's arrest on Wednesday, saying in a video shared on X, “We're going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.”
    


            In a statement to CNN, Pirro said, “The police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up. They have a job to do, and they shouldn't be abused in the process. Count on me to back the blue.”
    


            The White House said in a statement to CNN, “Assaulting a law enforcement officer is a crime.”
    


            “The Trump Administration will always stand up for law enforcement officers and hold those accountable who seek to do them harm,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.
    


            The incident comes after President Donald Trump ordered additional federal law enforcement officers to the city late last week, arguing that crime in Washington, DC, is rampant. However, city statistics show violent crime has dropped over the past two years after peaking in 2023.
    


            On Monday, Trump escalated his efforts and took over control of the city's police department and deployed the National Guard. A White House official told CNN that the presence of troops is expected to expand Wednesday evening.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

NEW YORK (AP) — As National Guard troops deploy across her city as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is responding with relative restraint.

She's called Trump's takeover of the city's police department and his decision to activate 800 members of the guard “ unsettling and unprecedented ” and gone as far as to cast his efforts as part of an “authoritarian push.”

But Bowser has so far avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders, despite the unprecedented incursion into her city.

“While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,” Bowser told reporters at a press conference responding to the efforts. She even suggested the surge in resources might benefit the city and noted that limited home rule allows the federal government “to intrude on our autonomy in many ways.”

“My tenor will be appropriate for what I think is important for the District,” said Bowser, who is in her third term as mayor. “And what's important for the District is that we can take care of our citizens.”

The approach underscores the reality of Washington's precarious position under the thumb of the federal government. Trump has repeatedly threatened an outright takeover of the overwhelmingly Democratic city, which is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 that could be repealed by Congress. Republicans, who control both chambers, have already frozen more than a $1 billion in local spending, slashing the city's budget.




That puts her in a very different position from figures such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Democrats whose states depend on the federal government for disaster relief and other funding, but who have nonetheless relentlessly attacked the current administration as they lay the groundwork for potential 2028 presidential runs. Those efforts come amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that their party has not been nearly aggressive enough in its efforts to counter Trump's actions. 

“Unfortunately she is in a very vulnerable position,” said Democratic strategist Nina Smith. “This is the sort of thing that can happen when you don't have the powers that come with being a state. So that's what we're seeing right now, the mayor trying to navigate a very tough administration. Because this administration has shown no restraint when it comes to any kind of constitutional barriers or norms.”

Bowser's approach marks a departure from Trump's first term, when she was far more antagonistic toward the president.

Then she routinely clashed with the administration, including having city workers paint giant yellow letters spelling out “Black Lives Matter” on a street near the White House during the George Floyd protests in 2020.

This time around, Bowser took a different tact from the start. She flew to Florida to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago after he won the election and has worked to avoid conflict and downplay points of contention, including tearing up the “Black Lives Matter” letters after he returned to Washington in response to pressure from Republicans in Congress. 

The change reflects the new political dynamics at play, with Republicans in control of Congress and an emboldened Trump who has made clear he is willing to exert maximum power and push boundaries in unprecedented ways. 

D.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson said she understands Bowser's position, and largely agrees with her conclusion that a legal challenge to Trump's moves would be a long shot. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in his executive order, declaring a “crime emergency” so his administration could take over the city's police force. The statue limits that control to 30 days unless he gets approval from Congress.

“The challenge would be on the question of ‘Is this actually an emergency?'” said Henderson, a former congressional staffer. “That's really the only part you could challenge.”

Henderson believes the city would face dim prospects in a court fight, but thinks the D.C. government should challenge anyway, “just on the basis of precedent.”

Trump told reporters Wednesday that he believes he can extend the 30-day deadline by declaring a national emergency, but said “we expect to be before Congress very quickly.”

“We're gonna be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days,” he said. “We're gonna do this very quickly. But we're gonna want extensions. I don't want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will.”

Bowser's response is a reflection of the reality of the situation, according to a person familiar with her thinking. As mayor of the District of Columbia, Bowser has a very different relationship with the president and federal government than other mayors or governors. The city is home to thousands of federal workers, and the mass layoffs under DOGE have already had a major impact on the city's economy.

Her strategy has been to focus on finding areas where she and the new administration can work together on shared priorities. 

For now, Bowser appears set to stick with her approach, saying Wednesday that she is focused on “making sure the federal surge is useful to us.”

During a morning interview with Fox 5, she and the city's police chief argued an influx of federal agents linked to Trump's takeover would improve public safety, with more officers on patrol.

Police chief Pamela Smith said the city's police department is short almost 800 officers, so the extra police presence “is clearly going to impact us in a positive way.” 

But Nina Smith, the Democratic strategist, said she believes Bowser needs a course correction.

“How many times is it going to take before she realizes this is not someone who has got the best interests of the city at heart?” she asked. “I think there may need to be time for her to get tough and push back.”

Despite Trump's rhetoric, statistics published by Washington's Metropolitan Police show violent crime has dropped in Washington since a post-pandemic peak in 2023. A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, reaching its lowest rate in 30 years.

After President Donald Trump's announcement that his administration would take over Washington's police department for at least a month, hundreds of members of the National Guard began to arrive in the capital.

The federalization push, Trump said, includes clearing out encampments for homeless people.

Department of Homeland Security officers also began patrolling the U Street corridor, and other federal agents joined police officers on patrol.

GRETNA, Virginia (AP) — Three sheriff's deputies injured in gunfire while executing warrants in southern Virginia on Wednesday were “shaken up” but doing well, officials said.

The warrants were for brandishing a firearm and trespassing, said Pittsylvania County Sheriff Michael W. Taylor. They were also serving a protective order, he said.

There was an hourslong standoff but it ended peacefully and with the suspected shooter in custody, Taylor told reporters afterward. 

“All three are well. Of course they're shaken up. And they're going through the process now of trying to heal,” Taylor said, adding: “They're OK.” 

The officers all appear to have been wounded by shrapnel and none was directly hit, Taylor said. 

The sheriff asked the Virginia State Police to investigate the shooting. Sgt. Rick Garletts, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said agents would likely be at the scene all night collecting evidence. 

“We're very happy that there were no further injuries tonight. This could have ended much worse than it did,” Garletts said. “I'm glad he gave himself up and came on out.” 

Photos and video from the scene showed a large number of parked police and emergency response vehicles. 

U.S. Rep. John McGuire, who represents Virginia's 5th congressional district, had earlier said in a post on X that his thoughts and prayers were with deputies and their families. 

“We are closely following the situation and keeping everyone affected in our hearts during this difficult time,” McGuire wrote.

Pittsylvania County is located along the state's southern border with North Carolina, about 98 miles (158 kilometers) northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — Residents in one Washington, D.C., neighborhood lined up Wednesday to protest the increased police presence after the White House said the number of National Guard troops in the nation's capital would ramp up and federal officers would be on the streets around the clock. 

After law enforcement set up a vehicle checkpoint along the busy 14th Street Northwest corridor, hecklers shouted, “Go home, fascists” and “Get off our streets.” Some protesters stood at the intersection before the checkpoint and urged drivers to turn away from it.

The action intensified a few days after President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the city's police department for at least a month. 

The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an “authoritarian push” at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix — even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. 

For two days, small groups of federal officers had been visible in scattered areas of the city. But more were present in high-profile locations Wednesday and troops were expected to start doing more missions in Washington on Thursday, according to a National Guard spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the planning process. 

On Wednesday, agents from Homeland Security Investigations patrolled the popular U Street corridor. Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, while National Guard members were parked nearby. DEA agents also joined Metropolitan Police Department officers on patrol in the Navy Yard neighborhood, while FBI agents stood along the heavily trafficked Massachusetts Avenue.

Hundreds of federal law enforcement and city police officers who patrolled the streets Tuesday night made 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before.

D.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson downplayed the arrest reports as “a bunch of traffic stops” and said the administration was seeking to disguise how unnecessary this federal intervention is. 

“I'm looking at this list of arrests and they sound like a normal Saturday night in any big city,” said Henderson. 

Unlike in other U.S. states and cities, the law gives Trump the power to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days. Extending his power over the city for longer would require approval from Congress, and that could be tough in the face of Democratic resistance. 

Trump suggested he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. “We're gonna do this very quickly. But we're gonna want extensions. I don't want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,” he said.

Later, on his Truth Social site, Trump reiterated his claims about the capital, writing, “D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs.”

Henderson, who worked for Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York before running for the D.C. Council, said she was already in touch with “friends on the Hill” to rally opposition for any Trump extension request. She added, “It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?”

The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. Seven illegal firearms were seized. 

There have now been more than 100 arrests since Trump began beefing up the federal law enforcement presence in Washington last week, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital,” she said. 

The president has full command of the National Guard and has activated up to 800 troops to support law enforcement, though exactly what form remains to be determined.

Neither Army nor District of Columbia National Guard officials have been able to describe the training backgrounds of the troops who have so far reported for duty.

While some members are military police, others likely hold jobs that would have offered them little training in dealing with civilians or law enforcement.

The federalization push also includes clearing out encampments for people who are homeless, Trump has said. U.S. Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March, and plan to take out two more this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said. People are offered the chance to go to shelters and get addiction treatment, if needed, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, she said. 

City officials said they are making more shelter space available and increasing their outreach. 

The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. since an increase during the coronavirus pandemic. 

On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb.

Police Chief Pamela Smith said during an interview with the local Fox affiliate that the city's Metro Police Department has been down nearly 800 officers. She said the increased number of federal agents on the streets would help fill that gap, at least for now. 

Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, “I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too.” 

She had previously called Trump's moves “unsettling and unprecedented” while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state.

For some residents, the increased presence of law enforcement and National Guard troops is nerve-wracking. 

“I've seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,” Washington native Sheina Taylor said. “It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American.”

Jenn Pellegrino, chief spokesperson of the America First Policy Institute, speaks with Fox News Digital about Washington, D.C.'s crime rates compared to other cities as federal forces are deployed by President Donald Trump. 

As President Donald Trump looks to crack down on crime within Washington, D.C., by sending in federal law enforcement to patrol the city, data reveals the nation's capital is plagued by violent crime when compared to other metropolitan areas around the country. 

The crackdown comes as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is asking for the public's help in identifying a suspect involved in a stabbing on Aug. 7, according to police. 

The incident occurred as the suspect and victim became involved in a physical altercation in the 1100 block of 7th Street, Northwest, authorities said. During the fight, the suspect allegedly stabbed the victim before fleeing the scene. 

The victim was subsequently transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 

TRUMP'S FEDERAL CRIME OPERATION BRINGS 100 ARRESTS, 800 NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO WASHINGTON

In a news conference Monday, Trump announced he is planning to deploy members of the National Guard to the city's streets while taking control of the MPD in an effort to restore safety and combat violence. 

""You can be anything you want, but you want to have safety in the streets,"" Trump said. ""You want to be able to leave your apartment or your house where you live and feel safe and go into a store to buy a newspaper or buy something, and you don't have that now.""

The move comes as the nation's capital ""averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide,"" according to an executive order, ""Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia."" 

""Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 states, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents,"" the order states. 

TRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE

In 2024, Washington D.C. placed fourth among 24 of the nation's cities when comparing homicide rates per 100,000 citizens, according to a report conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).

""The recent increase of federal law enforcement officers across Washington, D.C., has already stopped vicious criminals, the distribution of deadly narcotics and the violent use of stolen handguns,"" a White House spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""President Trump's bold leadership and decisive action will make our nation's capital beautiful and safe again for its residents and visitors from all the world. The president's efforts to crack down on crime is an incredibly popular policy that everyday Americans support.""

St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit accounted for more homicides per capita, the study reported. 

When compared to other major metropolitan cities, Washington D.C.'s homicide rate remained exceptionally high when placed alongside New York City's rate of and Los Angeles' rate, according to RIT.

MPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

While Trump's ability to utilize the MPD is unique to the nation's capital, federal law enforcement could integrate into other cities with high crime rates utilizing consent decrees, according to former NYPD Lt. Darrin Porcher. 

""That's when the federal government comes in, and they review a police department,"" Porcher told Fox News Digital. ""And they'll make a series of recommendations based on what the police department is not doing.""

Porcher pointed to the ability of federal law enforcement to collaborate with local authorities in crime-ridden cities in an effort to reform a department's response to violence.  

""A lot of task force activity would be the key component,"" Porcher said. ""So, what the feds can do is send a series of FBI, DEA or ATF agents to a particular city, and they would be a part of a task force that works with the localized police departments. The resources would bridge together from both the city and the federal government to target the excessive crimes that are being committed in that particular area, whether it's homicides, robberies, burglaries.""

TRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS ‘TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL' CRIME IN WASHINGTON

Despite the higher-than-average rates, the homicide rate within Washington, D.C., dropped 35% when compared to 2023, marking the lowest violent crime rates the city has seen in 30 years, according to the Department of Justice. 

""In addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%,"" the DOJ said in a news release. ""Robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years."" 

However, residents within the nation's capital insist the move by the Trump administration is a step in the right direction.

""This is something I think that's been long overdue,"" Jenn Pellegrino, chief spokesperson of America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. ""If you walk around our nation's capital, which sees over 20 million visitors from all around the world every year, this is a lot of people's first impression of what the United States of America is like."" 

Pellegrino has been living in Washington, D.C., for 15 years and has become disheartened by the state of the city she calls home. 

""While the left is saying that there's nothing to see here, that the White House is overreacting to this situation, it's about how people feel,"" Pellegrino said. ""They can say that the crime stats are down, which some are, but some are rising, like carjacking. People don't feel safe, and something needs to be done to address that."" 

WASHINGTON, DC, IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CAPITALS OF MANY THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES, SENATOR SAYS

Although instances of violent crime within Washington, D.C. are down when compared to 2023, reports of incidents involving property remain either relatively stagnant or trending upward. 

""I think that there is a significant need for crime reduction in a lot of these large cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.,"" Porcher said.

In 2025, property crime within the city is down by 4%, according to the MPD. Additionally, there have already been 2,926 reports of motor vehicle theft logged this year, approaching last year's total of 2,940. 

""It's time to get tough on some of the smaller crimes to prevent the more violent crimes that have been going on in the city,"" Pellegrino said. ""Because, honestly, if you walk around D.C., even in the middle of the daytime [or] a weekday, you've got to have your head on a swivel.""

Pellegrino hopes the Trump administration's efforts will set a standard for other cities grappling with crime throughout the country, while ensuring the nation's capital is a safe place to visit, live and work. 

""These violent crimes can happen to anybody,"" Pellegrino told Fox News Digital. ""They don't discriminate based on your politics. And, again, whether you're a tourist coming to visit or you're somebody that's lived here, or you just work in the city, we deserve better than that. This is the United States of America. It's the greatest country on Earth. Our nation's capital should represent something better than the standard it's been held to over the last several years.""

San Diego makeup artist Janis Luize Rocha Leites switched to an all-meat carnivore diet for 30 days—eating only meat, salt and water—and says she experienced 20 pounds of weight loss, clear skin and regulated periods. 

A new study suggests that lean beef may be slightly less disruptive to gut microbiota than white-meat chicken, though the differences were modest and require further research.

While it's well-established that foods like fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fermented dairy products can promote beneficial gut bacteria, diets high in meat, fat and sugar are often associated with reduced microbial diversity. 

However, many previous studies compared meat-inclusive diets to vegetarian ones — and rarely differentiated between types of meat.

STUDY CLAIMS VEGETARIANS MORE 'AMBITIOUS' AS MEAT EATERS CALL OUT 'OVERSIMPLIFICATION'

So researchers in Spain set out to analyze how lean, white-meat chicken compared to lean, red meat from Pirenaica cattle, which are indigenous to the Pyrenees mountains. 

Researchers looked at how the two protein sources impacted gut microbial diversity, which is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption and immune function. 

Lean beef was found to have a slightly less disruptive impact on the gut microbiome, the new study found. (iStock)

Published in the journal Molecular Nutrition and Food Research in July, the research found that both diets caused modest changes to the gut microbiota.

While there were no statistically significant differences in overall microbial diversity between the chicken and beef diets, the chicken-based meals were associated with a decline in diversity, as well as reductions in certain beneficial bacterial groups.

By contrast, the beef-based diet showed a slightly smaller impact on microbial diversity, with only one notable reduction in the abundance of a bacterial group known as Chloroflexota. It also appeared to increase the presence of Blautia, a genus of bacteria that can help protect the intestinal mucus barrier and reduce inflammation.

CONTROVERSIAL SEED OILS MAY OFFER UNEXPECTED HEALTH BENEFITS, NEW RESEARCH SHOWS

Lower microbial diversity has been observed in various chronic health conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. 

""These findings suggest that the integration of lean red meat from beef (Pirenaica breed) into a healthy dietary pattern could positively influence not only the gut microbiota but also some health indicators,"" the researchers wrote.

The study looked at 16 healthy individuals, most of whom were between 18 and 22 years old, who ate lean beef and white-meat chicken at lunchtime three times a week for eight weeks. 

After a five-week ""washout period,"" during which participants resumed their normal diets to reset their gut microbiota, they switched to the other meat diet.

The two meats were stewed, roasted, grilled and breaded. Stool samples were collected at the beginning and end of each diet period.

The researchers highlighted that Pirenaica beef is naturally rich in potassium, zinc and B vitamins, which may have contributed to its relatively gentler impact on gut health. The results, they said, may not apply to other types of beef or to meats prepared or consumed differently.

The study also relied on self-reported dietary intake; participants' full diets weren't strictly controlled. 

Other foods eaten during the trial could have influenced gut microbial changes, which is a limitation the authors acknowledged.

Sixteen participants ate lean beef and white-meat chicken three times a week for eight weeks.  (iStock)

Additionally, with just 16 participants, the findings should be viewed as preliminary and not broadly generalizable. 

The researchers called for larger and more diverse studies to explore the complex relationship between different meat types and gut health.

Fox News Digital reached out to the study's authors for comment.

Hope Barkoukis, chair of Case Western Reserve University's Department of Nutrition in Ohio, said the research underscores the importance of meat quality and moderation within overall dietary patterns. Barkoukis was not involved in the study.

The findings are consistent with previous research showing that lean beef can be part of a healthy, balanced diet, said one nutritionist.

""The shifts in microbiota composition seen may hold promise, but this was a small study and the authors explicitly state that no significant differences were found in overall microbial diversity,"" Baroukis told Fox News Digital. 

""The findings are better viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than clinically actionable.""

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Democrats criticizing President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to D.C. to combat violent crime.

A former DOJ employee is facing federal assault charges after allegedly ""forcefully"" throwing a Subway sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent during a confrontation Sunday night in Washington, D.C.

Metro Transit Police said they were patrolling the U Street area, seemingly as part of the Trump administration's initiative to crackdown on crime in the nation's capital, when a man later identified as Sean Charles Dunn shouted obscenities at a CBP agent, standing inches from his face and calling him a ""fascist.""

Moments later, police said Dunn returned, wound up, and ""forcefully threw"" a sandwich at the agent, hitting him in the chest, according to court documents. He then ran away, with a trail of federal officers chasing him.

Witnesses could be heard giggling as Dunn darted from the cops, according to an Instagram video posted by a bystander. WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHES FEDERAL SECURITY BLITZ AS PRESIDENT VOWS TO END DC 'CRIME PLAGUE'

Court documents included photos of the alleged sandwich assault. (US District Court for the District of Columbia)

After being arrested and taken to the police station, Dunn allegedly told another officer, ""I did it. I threw a sandwich."" 

He is charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi on X Thursday confirmed Dunn worked at the Department of Justice and was fired.

""I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER,"" Bondi wrote in a post. ""Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony. This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ. You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""

""He thought it was funny,"" Pirro said in the video. ""Well, he doesn't think it's funny today, because we charged him with a felony assault on a police officer, and we're going to back the police to the hilt. So there. Stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.""

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C., new arrest numbers and more on ‘The Story.'

Around 400 D.C. National Guard members have reported for duty in the nation's capital as of Wednesday afternoon in response to President Donald Trump's directive to help make Washington ""safe, clean and beautiful,"" a U.S. Army official told Fox News. 

Hundreds more D.C. National Guard troops are expected to report for duty later Wednesday and Thursday, with a significantly higher presence on the ground Wednesday evening. By the end of the week, it is expected all 800 who have been activated will have reported for duty.

Law enforcement officials have made 103 arrests since Aug. 7, when Trump's order to ""federalize"" D.C. and crack down on crime was announced and more law enforcement officers took to the streets. 

INSIDE THE WASHINGTON, DC HOMELESS HOT SPOTS TRUMP HAS VOWED TO CLEAN UP

Guardsmen were spotted rolling in on military vehicles near the National Mall Wednesday evening. Troops gathered at the D.C. armory before deploying near monuments and near a U.S. Park building in the crime-ridden neighborhood of Anacostia in southeast D.C. 

In addition to sending in the Guard, Trump placed D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, using the Home Rule Act that allows him to do so for up to 30 days.

On Monday, federal and local authorities made 23 arrests, including suspects wanted for murder, gun offenses and other crimes. On Tuesday, they made 43 arrests, and 24 guns were seized.

While only 30 National Guard troops were on the ground Tuesday night, more than 1,450 participated in the operations, including 750 Metropolitan Police Department officers and federal law enforcement officers.

Beginning Wednesday night, the operations will be active around the clock rather than just evening hours.

As President Donald Trump cracks down on crime and rampant homelessness in Washington, D.C., homeless individuals weighed in on what they think of the administration's efforts to clean up the streets.

The White House says those living in homeless encampments in the nation's capital will have two choices in the coming days: accept treatment at a homeless shelter or go to jail.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the ultimatum during a Tuesday press conference as reporters prodded about President Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s law enforcement. She said many of the homeless encampments across the city have already been dismantled, and those that remain she expected to be dealt with this week.

""Seventy homeless encampments have been removed by the U.S. Park Police,"" Leavitt said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Department would be joining the Park Police in the effort. ""There are only two homeless encampments remaining in D.C. federal parks under the National Park Service's jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.""

Asked about what options are available to those in homeless encampments, Leavitt was blunt: ""Homeless shelters, for addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now.""

Fox News Digital spoke with several homeless individuals on the streets of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, some of whom voiced concern and others support for the changes.

One homeless man, who identified himself as Kenny and lives near Dupont Circle, told Fox News Digital that Trump is right to address the issues in D.C. after the city government ""failed tremendously.""

""I think the D.C. government has failed tremendously over the years,"" said Kenny. ""And it's evident that we need somebody like a big daddy Donald Trump to step in there and smack the s*** out of them liberals and kick them the f*** out.""

Another man, who did not give his name but also lives by Dupont, took a very different tone.  

""This is awful, it's like what the hell, where does he get the authority? You know what I mean?"" he said.

""We're people too,"" he went on. ""Just because I'm homeless doesn't mean I have to leave; we have a right to be here too.""

Another, named Dallas, who was sitting on a park bench near the Capitol, told Fox News Digital that though ""I'm for him,"" he was not sure about Trump's threats to federalize D.C.

Dallas said that, in his view, before the homeless can be cleared off the streets, the shelters in the area need to improve to meet some type of federal standard.

""If the homeless want to stay and make something of their life, they only have 30 days to do it. And that's not near enough time to get the job, get your own apartment, get things lined up,"" he said. ""You want a set of wheels? That's going to cost some money. So, in the long run, the shelters are falling short. So that would have to be addressed also.""

Elsewhere in the city, a man named Shahid told Fox News Digital that he believes ""time will tell that it's a bad decision or a good decision.""

""He's the president now. Ultimately, he is representing the people of the United States,"" said Shahid, adding, ""He just became president now, and he was chosen by the people.""

""So, either the election system is failing us, or he might be doing the right thing. I don't know, ultimately time will tell.""

Protesters in Washington chanted “Whose Street? Our street!” and “Go home!” at federal and local law enforcement officers conducting a vehicle checkpoint stop across 14th Street NW on Wednesday night. Dozens of Department of Homeland Security and Metropolitan Police Department officers stood on the block between V and W streets to question passing drivers while several protesters directed traffic away from the scene.

Officers at the traffic safety compliance checkpoint issued 38 notices of infractions and made one arrest, according to an MPD spokesperson.

“During the checkpoint, 344 vehicles passed through, 28 were stopped, 38 [Notice of Infractions] were issued, and MPD made one arrest for No Permit and Counterfeit Tags,” the MPD spokesperson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Since 2023, the Metropolitan Police Department has conducted weekly traffic safety compliance checkpoints. These checkpoints are an education and enforcement tool used to encourage safe driving and hold violators accountable.”

Kenneth, a 28-year-old resident of the U Street Corridor who lives close to Wednesday's checkpoint, ran into a nearby drugstore to purchase materials to make a sign directing traffic away from it once he saw the officers stopping drivers.

“This is a dark period for our city,” Kenneth said. “Obviously, we don't want federal control over our police department. I just knew that during these times, you've got to do your part. So I was just trying to redirect traffic so people were not stopped for something that they were not expecting. I've never seen this in my five-plus years of living in D.C.”

The display of law enforcement follows President Donald Trump's declaration of a “crime emergency” in Washington on Monday. He federalized the MPD and mobilized the District of Columbia National Guard for at least the next 30 days. Trump's executive order came despite recent MPD crime statistics showing violent crime down 26% from last year.

As of 9 p.m. on Wednesday, federal and local law enforcement officers had arrested over 100 people as part of the officer influx in the capital, according to the White House. The Trump administration has activated several federal partners in the region this week, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Customs and Border Protection, and the Park Police.

In the early hours of Wednesday evening, federal officers gathered at the Park Police law enforcement facility in Anacostia before they set out into other areas of the district.

Kenneth said he found the 14th Street checkpoint to be “a huge drain on local resources when there's actually areas of our city that might need assistance.”

“Between V and W on 14th street, you're not going to find anything,” Kenneth said.

Another protester in her mid-20s, Meera, also helped direct traffic away from the block as soon as she saw the checkpoint assembling from her nearby apartment complex. She said she felt empowered by the neighborhood's resistance but also saddened to see federal officers in her own neighborhood.

“You have some separation if it's across town, obviously, you feel it deeply, but it's just really hard to see them pulling people away in our area,” Meera said. “Especially as this area was so rapidly gentrified within the past 10 years. Them pulling people here feels much more horrible.”

Meera also noted how the Trump administration's rhetoric toward the district's homeless population ties into the law enforcement influx, as the administration has threatened fines or jail time for homeless people who refuse shelter or treatment.

“These people that are already systematically so oppressed, they're already shot in the foot and now they're kicking them while they're down,” Meera said.

Trump posted images of several homeless encampments in the district on Truth Social Sunday, writing, “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the administration's plans for the district's homeless population in a Tuesday press conference discussing the federalization of the MPD.

“Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment to be taken to a homeless shelter to be offered addiction or mental health services,” Leavitt said. “And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

The Washington Examiner spoke with several homeless people living in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood about the administration's plans to crack down on homeless encampments.

Meghann Abraham, 34, said she just completed her associate's degree in homeland security at the College of Southern Maryland and plans to pursue her bachelor's degree soon. In the meantime, she is applying to jobs while living in her tent in Foggy Bottom, as she cannot afford rent in the district. She said the MPD served her an eviction notice last week, saying she needs to remove her property from the area. This is the second eviction notice she has received this year — the first was from outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in March.

“The Metropolitan Police Department came by with a little sticker that said if your property is still here on this date at this time — for us it's the 29th of August at 10 a.m. — you have to be out or they will throw it out,” Abraham said. “At Martin Luther King Library, they came with a dumpster truck and asked, ‘Does anyone know whose this is? Do you know how to contact them?' I will say, they were trying to get in touch with people.”

Abraham said she has a few options for where to move her belongings. She also noted the feeling of hurt she gets when passers-by in the area act like she doesn't belong. She said a lot of people who walk past her in the district gawk and stare, giving her smug looks. She noted a driver the other day yelled, “Where's your house at?” when driving past her.

“When you get treated the same way over and over again, you do start to internalize it,” Abraham said. “It's not that I don't know who I am. It's not that I don't know I just got an associate degree. It's not that I don't know I have a good work ethic, and when I go to work, I show up 10 minutes early. I know my work ethic, I know my worth. But when everyone else starts looking at you that way, you actually do start to internalize it. It takes a lot to swallow it and keep your head forward.”

Abraham's friend and fellow homeless person, Mr. Spann, 37, also noted what he sees as a misconception that all homeless people are not hard-working.

“I got a job, but I just don't have enough money to get my own place,” Mr. Spann said.

Mr. Spann said he secured his job as a custodian at a local hospital through a temporary employment agency. He addressed his thoughts on the Trump administration's push to clean up homeless encampments throughout the district as part of its effort to combat crime. He and Abraham have received paper warnings from various advocacy groups detailing the federal law enforcement presence and the Trump administration's rhetoric toward homeless people.

“Where are we supposed to go?” Mr. Spann said. “What are we supposed to do? Are you going to lock them up? What charge do you have?”

Abraham said she does not like staying in homeless shelters because they can “feel like prison.”

“I've been in shelters before, I don't like them,” she said. “It's eat when we say you can eat, shower when we say you can shower. From this hour to this hour, just be locked in the room with whatever random person off the street that we decide you get to live with.”

TRUMP CLAIMS DC IS UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL ‘WHERE IT BELONGS'

Abraham pointed to her tent and said, “This is easier.”

DC Police crime stats show he was never arrested","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3498600/man-went-prison-assaulting-me-dc-crime-stats-show-he-was-never-arrested/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Five years ago, I was violently attacked and sexually assaulted in broad daylight in Washington, D.C., by a homeless man. He went to federal prison for what he did to me. But if you look for evidence that the attack happened in the city's crime statistics, you won't find it.

The truth of what happened to me and the D.C. government's role in it is as much a public scandal as it is a personal trauma. D.C. police covered up the unspeakable wrong that the stranger did to me. Even though a judge sentenced my attacker to hard time in prison, D.C. police leadership would rather deceive the public and appear less dangerous than list mine and countless other sexual assaults on their website.

The extent of crime in D.C. has been debated by the Left and Right since President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he would take federal action to crack down on problems in the District of Columbia. 

But if the public wants to have an honest conversation about crime in D.C., the MPD will first have to be honest about how prevalent crime is. Without MPD's honesty about the crimes that it has chosen to hide from its public-facing stats page, the White House cannot get an accurate picture of how bad the problem actually is and adequately fix it.

For me, the story began long before that attack. I was a Washingtonian for seven years. I was saving up money to buy a condo and planned to spend the next few decades in Washington, the intersection of politics and media. D.C.'s crime problem was something you lived with. You took Ubers and Lyfts, told others if you were walking after dark so they knew when you were home, and knew to be aware of your surroundings, almost to the point of paranoia. (Ladies?)

On a Saturday morning in 2020, I walked out of my apartment on Capitol Hill to mail a package at a post office several blocks from the U.S. Capitol. I put on my black sweatshirt and black sweatpants then headed out the door.

I never made it to the post office.Just one block from my apartment building's entrance, I was attacked by a large man well over six feet tall. He charged at me for a reason that I still do not understand. In broad daylight and on well-traveled 2nd Street NE next to Union Station, I fought to get away as he sexually assaulted me. If it had not been for others in the vicinity, including a construction worker named Donny who heard my screaming and ran to my rescue, I don't know if I would be here today.

Despite my background working with federal law enforcement, it was only through my experience as a victim that I learned personally of two ways that D.C. police and the courts fail the public. I share those now with the hope that they inform the public and leaders to improve how crime is handled and prevented.

My attacker was arrested on the street months later, charged, and pleaded guilty to a sex abuse charge nearly two years later. MPD's “Crime Cards” online statistics page omits mentioning it, though. Do you know what that communicates to a victim? How invalidating that is?

When I asked MPD in 2020 why my incident was not on its crime map, an MPD spokesman said the city only includes 1st degree felonies under its crime stats. That would mean that for every person robbed, assaulted, or sexually abused in anything less than egregious ways, you have not been counted into the total tally. The pain you suffered was not severe enough, according to MPD's standards.

In a follow-up email to the MPD this week, an MPD spokesperson stated after a back-and-forth exchange that the map includes some sex abuse charges, but not all of them. In my case, my attacker's crime against me, which landed him in prison, is still not listed.

“In an effort to provide more clear information about the most serious sex assaults that are most closely aligned with the public's perception of rape and attempted rape, the most serious sex abuse categories are included in the reports of DC Code Index Violent Crimes,” the MPD Crime Cards website states in the bottom right corner at the bottom of a scroll within the page.

The Left and out-of-touch elite reporters have purported this week that things are fine in Washington because crime is trending down, while the Right has maintained that the Metropolitan Police Department's statistics have been manipulated to paint a rosier picture of the situation. Turns out, it is actually worse than they knew.

The D.C. Police did do something right. The day of my attack, the police collected my clothes for DNA evidence. About two months later, they contacted me to say they had had a match to the DNA of a homeless man who had been previously arrested.

Police arrested him, but he was immediately released from jail by the judge who presided over the case. The assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted my case told me it was to keep the D.C. jail from overcrowding.

Here I was, a single woman who was attacked a block from my front door. Not jailing him until trial felt like a death sentence. How could I leave my home with him out on the streets, living in a tunnel a few blocks from where I lived?

Trial proceedings were set to begin in the fall of 2020, but amid the George Floyd riots in downtown Washington, it was delayed until early 2021. Then, the early 2021 start was delayed until the end of 2021. The U.S. Attorney's office assured me it was not because the federal prosecutors were busy bringing hundreds of cases against January 6th offenders.

But all the while, the man who attacked me in April 2020 was out there. I moved across town to try to reclaim my life in the city. 

The U.S. Attorney's office would inform me through mail notifications and phone calls of updates to my case.

He was arrested in five separate incidents after being released, and after each arrest, the judge permitted his immediate release, even when he was caught in public with a machete.

The D.C. police officers on patrol must have been as aggravated as I was. Over and over again, they arrested a man with a previous criminal history only to have him right back on the street a day later.

NATIONAL GUARD MOBILIZES IN DC FOR TRUMP'S POLICE TAKEOVER AND CRIME CRACKDOWN

I have thought about these failures by the police and courts for the past five years, but I have not been sure how to bring attention to them. Right now, we have a rare chance to bring meaningful change.

I have shared my story. Will anyone hear it and respond?

A Democratic congresswoman disparaged Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month, calling the federal agency a “terrorist organization.” 

Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL) made the comments while delivering the keynote speech at the 2025 Netroots Nation annual conference in New Orleans. Netroots Nations is a nonprofit organization “that provides trainings, resources, and connection opportunities to help progressive activists create a more progressive and just world.” During her address, Ramirez criticized many issues involving illegal immigration, including President Donald Trump, border czar Tom Homan, and ICE, claiming the federal agency continuously abuses people's rights. 

“In my own district, district 3, we've stood up rapid response efforts to defend our communities against Trump,” said Ramirez. “It's why Tom Homan hates me so much. He said, ‘We'd come to Chicago, but Chicago's too educated on their rights,' because he hopes that we don't know our rights, so they can violate them.”

“Well, Tom Homan, all over the country, we will continue to stand up for our rights,” she added. “We will continue to call out the terrorist organization that is ICE.”

The Democratic congresswoman also bemoaned the current era, categorizing it as a time of societal disarray and “fascism.”

“And in a time of chaos and fascism, we are creation people in a creation movement, building forward,” Ramirez said.

It's the second time in less than a week that Ramirez was in the news for making what many perceived to be inflammatory remarks. Previously, Ramirez came under fire for a comment she made during the second Pan-American Congress in Mexico City, Mexico, in which she allegedly said she was “a proud Guatemalan before I am American.”

Ramirez's congressional webpage describes her as “the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants and an American citizen by birthright.”

Homan rebuked Ramirez for the remarks, calling them “disgusting.”

“I think what she said was disgusting, right?” Homan said. “I mean, she's a sitting U.S congresswoman, [a] citizen of this country. She is serving at the privilege of her state. Her voters put her in there.” 

“So I think that commitment should be to her state and people who put her in that position,” Homan said. “That should be your constituency.”

TRUMP CLAIMS DC IS UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL ‘WHERE IT BELONGS'

Ramirez defended her comments, calling any criticism “weak” and an attempt to silence her opinions.

“Let's call it what it is,” Ramirez said. “Today's attacks are a weak attempt to silence my dissent and invalidate my patriotic criticism of the nativist, white supremacist, authoritarians in government.”

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner warned President Donald Trump not to send the National Guard into his city to address violent crime.

The announcement by the left-wing district attorney came after Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., to address the city's violent crime. The decision to do so has drawn criticism from Democratic politicians around the country, claiming the move was not necessary, citing a decrease in homicide and crime rates in the district. 

Krasner echoed similar comments about Philadelphia and its crime rates, which have dropped in recent years. The decrease comes after the city set a record for homicides in 2021 while Krasner was in office. Krasner has been in office since 2017, when George Soros contributed nearly $2 million to fund Krasner's initial campaign. 

“Violent crime in Philly is at a record low,” Krasner said. “This is a fact. The same is essentially true for Washington, D.C., and other major American cities Trump is targeting for military invasion.”

Krasner said Trump's claims about violent crimes in cities were dishonest. He accused the president of trying to scare people in the country and advance authoritarianism. 

“His claim that violent crime is an emergency in these cities is a flat-out lie, and a cynical ploy to scare Americans into accommodating his authoritarian ambitions,” said the district attorney. “The only public safety emergency in these cities is Trump himself.”

Krasner mentioned the city's efforts to decrease crime and then disparaged the president about the weaponized lawsuits against him that occurred between his first and second terms. 

“Communities across Philadelphia, in collaboration with law enforcement and city leaders, are working hard every day to continue decreasing this downward trend in violent crime even more,” said Krasner. “Philadelphia will not accommodate his designs. Philadelphia ‘isn't the one,' as we like to say in Philly. To be clear, Donald Trump — the 34-time convicted felon, insurrectionist, and king of the cover-up — is the national emergency.”

The Soros-funded district attorney then said that while Trump could deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C., he had less authority to do so in Philadelphia and other cities throughout the country. He reinforced the notion that Trump would be limited in using the National Guard in Philadelphia. 

TRUMP BRUSHES OFF CALLS FOR DC STATEHOOD AS ‘RIDICULOUS'

“[Trump] may think he's going to try it in another place,” Krasner said. “But the fact is, legally, he has much less of a right to do any of this in other cities.” 

“Donald Trump is the emergency, folks,” Krasner said. “If you want your democracy, you better stand up now.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Several law enforcement officers were injured in a southern Virginia shooting on Wednesday afternoon.

Rep. John McGuire (R-VA), a freshman representative who beat former Rep. Bob Good in the 2024 primary for his seat, said he's following the situation closely in Pittsylvania County.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the deputies who were shot in Pittsylvania County, as well as their families. We are closely following the situation and keeping everyone affected in our hearts during this difficult time,” he said.

Local officials clarified that the deputies were hit with shrapnel, not bullets, in the standoff.

Pittsylvania County is on Virginia's southern border with North Carolina. The incident happened in Gretna, a small town located within the county.

Local news station WDBJ reported that three officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries and that warrants were being served at a home when the shooting took place. A SWAT team assisted in evacuating the victims, they reported.

Multiple law enforcement and other agencies are present at the site of the shooting, including the Pittsylvania County Sheriff's Office, Campbell County Sheriff's Office, Amherst County Sheriff's Office, Danville Police Department, Virginia State Troopers, Gretna Fire and Rescue, Hurt Fire Department, and the U.S. Marshals Service.

Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor in the state and a former CIA officer, said she is praying for the deputies involved.

“While we await more information, Adam and I are praying for the members of law enforcement who were shot while responding to an incident in Pittsylvania County. We're so grateful for our first responders, who run towards danger to keep Virginians safe,” she wrote on social media.

Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, also offered her prayers for the injured deputies.

Law enforcement has arrested more than 100 people in Washington, D.C., since Aug. 7 as President Donald Trump federalized the city's police force and emphasized fighting crime in the area, a White House official told the Washington Examiner.

Trump federalized the Metropolitan Police Department on Monday as several other federal agencies, including the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and Park Police, among others, joined in on crime prevention efforts.

Nearly 1,500 authorities, including 700 federal agents, 30 National Guard troops, and 750 MPD personnel, assisted in enforcement efforts on Tuesday night.

Those arrested so far face charges ranging from narcotics, firearms, drunk driving, and warrant violations. At least one person has been charged with homicide, 24 guns were seized, and 23 of those arrested were in the United States illegally, an official told NewsNation.

The White House official also said a “significantly higher” National Guard presence is expected on Wednesday night. On Thursday, the National Guard will begin patrolling 24 hours a day.

MPD Chief Pamela Smith has welcomed the extra law enforcement presence. “You're talking about 500 additional personnel in the District of Columbia,” Smith said. “We're down in numbers with our D.C. police officers. So this enhanced presence is going to impact us in a positive way.”

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed mixed feelings about Trump's federal enforcement effort. She said the president's effort amounts to an “authoritarian push” in a meeting with community leaders Tuesday but expressed that she hopes the federal surge “is useful for us” on Wednesday morning.

Trump has said he wants the law enforcement presence to last longer than the 30 days it's currently slated for.

“We're going to be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days,” Trump said on Wednesday at the Kennedy Center.

Part of the effort is a directive to clear out homeless encampments and to assist homeless people off the streets. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that people in homeless encampments will be asked to leave, be placed in a shelter, or offered addiction or mental health services.

If they don't take any of the offers, they will be subject to a fine or arrest.

“If they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time,” Leavitt said. “Again, these are preexisting laws that are already on the books. They have not been enforced.”

Homeless advocates told NewsNation that district shelter space is “very limited.” One person living in one of the encampments said the process is “going to be a mess.”

Trump's influence on district law enforcement has drawn condemnation from liberals who believe he is overreaching his authority and declaring an emergency where there isn't one. Crime in the district has declined for decades.

TRUMP BRUSHES OFF CALLS FOR DC STATEHOOD AS ‘RIDICULOUS'

There is some evidence for concern in the region.

A Council on Criminal Justice report in July found that violent crime in Washington resulted in death more often than in 17 other cities from 2018 to 2024, with 2024 lethality data in the district showing a 341% increase when compared to data from 2012.

After giving ground on AI chips, which other concessions will the president make?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

After making a show of getting tough on China, President Donald Trump desperately needs a trade agreement to prove that his disruptive tactics get results. This week, the United States and China agreed to extend their negotiations, avoiding—for now—another round of tariffs that would have hurt business between the world's two largest economies. But the president's newfound willingness to allow the export of vital AI chips to China indicates that an eventual deal could imperil American interests. Eager for a pact, Trump may give up more than he receives.

In 2022, then-President Joe Biden prohibited the export of advanced AI chips to China. Just four months ago, Trump expanded those restrictions. This week, though, Trump confirmed the details of an unusual arrangement effectively reversing that move: The American companies Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices will be allowed to sell certain chips to Chinese firms if the companies give the U.S. government a 15 percent cut of the revenue from these sales. In essence, Trump sold exemptions to technology-export controls that many experts consider crucial to protecting American security. In a letter last month, Matt Pottinger, who was Trump's deputy national security adviser during the president's first term, and 19 other policy professionals urged the administration not to allow the sale of Nvidia's H20 chip to China, calling the decision a “strategic misstep that endangers the United States' economic and military edge in artificial intelligence.”

Derek Thompson: The disturbing rise of MAGA Maoism

Trump may see the arrangement not as a national-security issue but as a business deal: There's a lot of money to be made selling chips to China, and now the U.S. government will materially benefit. But Trump must also realize that he's made a concession to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Beijing has persistently demanded that Washington remove U.S. export controls on advanced chips, and Xi personally pressed Biden for relief without success. Trump justified his flip-flop by arguing that the H20 chip is not among Nvidia's most high-powered products. He's right about that, but it's far from outdated. Chinese companies crave the H20 to help them deploy AI services. Indeed, the demand for the H20 appears to have alarmed Chinese authorities, who would prefer that local companies use homemade alternatives. Even as Beijing fights the U.S. restrictions, officials have tried slowing the rush by signaling in state media that the Nvidia chip is unsafe. Although Chinese designers have developed a similar chip, they are unable to produce enough, also due to U.S. restrictions that prevent them from using the top chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Trump has left the door open to further concessions. Because China's tech industry still can't match Nvidia's AI chips, Beijing is likely to prod Trump to ease restrictions on more advanced semiconductors. Rather than firmly committing to export controls, Trump suggested on Monday that he would be open to permitting Nvidia to sell China downgraded versions of its most powerful chips.

Xi has every reason to ask for more. Trump's desire for a deal gives Chinese leaders leverage. And given Trump's pattern of sudden policy reversals, he has likely left an impression that anything could be on the table. Beijing is clearly all in on the negotiations. According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the Chinese government sent 75 officials to the most recent round of talks, in Stockholm in late July, compared with his own skeleton crew of 15.

“Xi now feels more emboldened to probe for a wider range of potential concessions, not only economic but also security concessions,” Ali Wyne, an expert on U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group, told me. Wyne fears this could lead to a “lopsided bargain” in China's favor.

Thomas Wright: Trump wasted no time derailing his own AI plan

Xi has already gained on his top-priority issue: Taiwan. He urged Trump to approach Taiwan “with prudence” during a phone conversation in June, according to the Chinese government's official summary. Washington then reportedly canceled meetings with Taiwan's defense minister, a step that surely pleased Beijing, which strives to isolate the island's government. The Trump administration also appears to have discouraged Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te from making stopovers in U.S. cities while en route to Latin America for diplomatic visits.

Xi has done little in exchange. Beijing's most significant goodwill gesture was a June decision to restrict the sale of two chemicals that are used to make the illegal fentanyl circulating on American streets, an issue of utmost importance to the Trump team. But Beijing's action on curtailing the fentanyl trade will likely remain conditional on Trump's good behavior. Trump recently called on Xi in a social-media post to buy more U.S.-grown soybeans—which would be great for some American farmers, but is hardly an even swap for China's access to high-tech chips. Meanwhile, Xi has deftly created and deployed levers of pressure. Amid the escalating trade war in April, Beijing imposed controls on the export to the U.S. of rare-earth metals—an industry that China dominates—and then used their easing as a negotiating tool.

In the end, Xi may not get all he wants. But he is winning just by talking. China's leaders have apparently learned that they can distract Trump from more strategic issues by haggling with him over tariff rates and soybean sales. The desire for a deal has so consumed the Trump team that any grander strategy to contend with China's growing power seems to have gotten lost. Last week, Trump imposed high tariffs on India in an attempt to compel New Delhi to curtail purchases of Russian oil—angering a potential partner in the global competition with China.

Friendlier relations with China are certainly better than open hostility. The question has always been: At what cost? Trump may eventually seal a trade deal with China that benefits him, but not necessarily the nation.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The move by several states to recognize Palestine will not end conflict in the Middle East—or at home.

On a prominent ridge in the center of Toronto stands a big stone castle. Built in the early 20th century, Casa Loma is now a popular venue for weddings and parties. The castle is flanked by some of the city's priciest domestic real estate. It is not, in short, the kind of site that usually goes unpoliced.

On May 27, Casa Loma was booked for a fundraiser by the Abraham Global Peace Initiative, a pro-Israel advocacy group. The gathering was to be addressed by Gilad Erdan, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and United States.

A crowd of hundreds formed opposite the castle. They temporarily overwhelmed police lines, closing the street to the castle entrance. Protesters accosted and insulted individual attendees. One attendee, a former Canadian senator now in his 90s, told me about being pushed and jostled as police looked on. Eventually, two arrests were made, one for assaulting a police officer and the other for assaulting an attendee.

Last year, the city of Toronto averaged more than one anti-Jewish incident a day, accounting for 40 percent of all reported hate crimes in Canada's largest city. Jewish neighborhoods, Jewish hospitals, and Jewish places of worship have been the scenes of demonstrations by masked persons bearing flags and chanting hostile slogans.

Gunmen fired shots at a Toronto Jewish girls' school on three nights last year. A synagogue in Montreal was attacked with firebombs in late 2024. On Saturday, an assailant beat a Jewish man in a Montreal park in front of his children.

David Frum: There is no right to bully and harass

Canadian governments—federal, provincial, municipal—of course want to stop the violence. But their inescapable (if often unsayable) dilemma is that many of those same governments depend on voters who are sympathetic to the motives of the violent. Canadian authorities of all kinds have become frightened of important elements in their own populations. Just this week, the Toronto International Film Festival withdrew its invitation to a Canadian film about the invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The festival's statement cited legal concerns, including the fear that by incorporating footage that Hamas fighters filmed of their atrocities without “legal clearance,” the film violated Hamas's copyright. (In polite Canada, it seems that even genocidal terrorists retain their intellectual-property claims.) Another and more plausible motive cited by the festival: fear of “potential threat of significant disruption.” A small group of anti-Israel protesters invaded the festival's gala opening in 2024. The legal violations have been larger and more flagrant this year. All of this forms the backdrop necessary to understand why the Canadian government has joined the British and French governments in their intention to recognize a Palestinian state.

The plan began as a French diplomatic initiative. In July, France and Saudi Arabia co-chaired a United Nations conference on the two-state solution. Days before the conference began, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that his nation would recognize a Palestinian state in September.

The French initiative was almost immediately seconded by the British government. Canada quickly followed. This week, Australia added its weight to the group. Anti-Jewish violence has been even more pervasive and aggressive in Australia than in Canada, including the torching of a Sydney day-care center in January. (Germany declined to join the French initiative but imposed a limited arms embargo on Israel.)

All four governments assert that their plan offers no concessions to Hamas. All four insist that a hypothetical Palestinian state must be disarmed, must exclude Hamas from any role in governance, must renounce terrorism and incitement, and must accept Israel's right to exist. Those conditions often got omitted in media retellings, but they are included in all the communiqués with heavy emphasis. As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters on July 30: “Canada reiterates that Hamas must immediately release all hostages taken in the horrific terrorist attack of October 7, that Hamas must disarm, and that Hamas must play no role in the future governance of Palestine.”

All those musts make these plans impossible to achieve, from the outset. How do the French, British, Canadian, and Australian governments imagine them being enforced, and by whom? Even now, after all this devastation, Hamas remains the most potent force in Palestinian politics. A May survey by a Palestinian research group, conducted in cooperation with the Netherland Representative Office in Ramallah, reported that an overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the idea that Hamas's disarmament is a path to ending the war in Gaza, and a plurality said they would vote for a Hamas-led government. Observers might question the findings from Gaza, where Hamas can still intimidate respondents, but those in the West Bank also rejected the conditions of France, Britain, Canada, and Australia.

What does recognition mean anyway? Of UN member states, 147 already recognize a state of Palestine, including the economic superpowers China and India; regional giants such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria; and the European Union member states of Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden. About half of those recognitions date back to 1988, when Yasser Arafat proclaimed Palestinian independence from his exile in Algiers after the Israeli military drove Arafat's organization out of the territory it had occupied in Lebanon. Such diplomatic niceties do not alter realities. States are defined by control of territory and population. In that technical sense, Hamas in Gaza has proved itself to be more like a state than has the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Even the mighty United States learned that lesson the hard way over the 22 years from 1949 to 1971, when Washington pretended that the Nationalist regime headquartered in Taipei constituted the legitimate government of mainland China.

Macron, Carney, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are savvy, centrist politicians. All regard themselves as strong friends of Israel. Starmer in particular has fought hard to purge his Labour Party of the anti-Semitic elements to whom the door was opened by his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. If they're investing their prestige in a seemingly futile gesture, they must have good reason.

They do.

All four men lead political coalitions that are fast turning against Israel. Pressure is building on the leaders to vent their supporters' anger, and embracing the French initiative creates a useful appearance of action.

The Canadian example is particularly stark. Prime Minister Carney has pivoted in many ways from the progressive record of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. He canceled an increase in the capital-gains tax that Trudeau had scheduled. He dropped from the cabinet a housing minister who had championed a major government-led building program. (The program remains, but under leadership less beholden to activists.) Carney has committed to a major expansion of the Canadian energy sector after almost a decade of dissension between energy producers and Ottawa. The new Carney government is also increasing military spending. Many on the Canadian left feel betrayed and frustrated. Recognizing a Palestinian state is a concession that may appease progressives irked by Carney's other moves toward the political center.

But appeasement will not work. In the Middle East, the initiative by France, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom has already pushed the region away from stability, not toward it. Cease-fire talks with Hamas “fell apart” on the day that Macron declared his intent to recognize a Palestinian state, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Hamas then released harrowing photographs of starved Israeli hostages, one shown digging his own grave. Embarrassed pro-recognition leaders had to deliver a new round of condemnations of Hamas at the very moment they were trying to pressure Israel to abandon its fight against Hamas.

Nor does the promise of Palestinian recognition seem to be buying the four leaders the domestic quiet they had hoped for. On Sunday, British police arrested more than 500 people for demonstrating in support of a pro-Palestine group proscribed because of its acts of violence against British military installations. Those arrests amounted to the largest one-day total in the U.K. in a decade.

Hours before Prime Minister Albanese's statement promising recognition, some 90,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked traffic on Sydney Harbour Bridge. Their organizers issued four demands—recognition was not one of them. “What we marched for on Sunday, and what we've been protesting for two years, is not recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state that Israel is in the process of wiping out,” a group leader told CNN. “What we are demanding is that the Australian government sanction Israel and stop the two-way arms trade with Israel.”

On August 6, 60 anti-Israel protesters mobbed the private residence of former Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, banging pots and projecting messages onto her Montreal dwelling—an action especially provocative because Canadian cabinet ministers are not normally protected by personal security detachments. The present foreign minister, Anita Anand, had to close her constituency office in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, because of threats to the staff who worked there.

From the December 2024 issue: My hope for Palestine

The issue for protesters is Israel, not Palestine. During the Syrian civil war, more than 3,000 Palestinian refugees in the country were killed by Syrian government forces, hundreds of them by torture. Nobody blocked the Sydney Harbour Bridge over that. It's Israel's standing as a Western-style state that energizes the movement against it and that is unlikely to change no matter what shifts in protocol Western governments adopt. After all, on October 6, 2023, Gaza was functionally a Palestinian state living alongside Israel. If the pro-Palestinian groups in the West had valued that status, they should have reacted to October 7 with horror, if nothing else for the existential threat that the attacks posed to any Palestinian state-building project. Instead, many in the pro-Palestinian diaspora—and even at the highest levels of Palestinian official life—applauded the terror attacks with jubilant anti-Jewish enthusiasm.

The chants of “from the river to the sea” heard at these events reveal something important about the pro-Palestinian movement in the democratic West. The slogan expresses an all-or-nothing fantasy: either the thrilling overthrow of settler colonialism in all the land of Palestine, or else the glorious martyrdom of the noble resistance. It's not at all clear that ordinary Palestinians actually living in the region feel the same way. The exact numbers fluctuate widely depending on how the question is framed, but at least a significant minority—and possibly a plurality—of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza would accept coexistence with Israel if that acceptance brought some kind of state of their own. But their supporters living in the West can disregard such trade-offs. They can exult in the purity of passion and still enjoy a comfortable life in a capitalist democracy. These are the people that Albanese, Carney, Macron, and Starmer are trying so desperately to satisfy. They are unlikely to succeed.

The Hamas terror attacks of October 7 provoked a war of fearsome scale. Almost two years later, the region is almost unrecognizable. Tens of thousands have been killed, and much of Gaza laid to ruin. Almost every known leader of Hamas is dead. Hezbollah has been broken as a military force. The Assad regime in Syria has been toppled and replaced. The United States directly struck Iran, and the Iranian nuclear program seems to have been pushed years backward, if not destroyed altogether.

In this world upended, the creative minds of Western diplomacy have concluded that the best way forward is to revert to the Oslo peace process of 30 years ago. The Oslo process ended when the Palestinian leadership walked away from President Bill Clinton's best and final offer without making a counteroffer—and gambled everything on the merciless terrorist violence of the Second Intifada. Now here we are again, after another failed Palestinian terror campaign, and there is only one idea energizing Western foreign ministries: That thing that failed before? Let's try it one more time. But this time, the hope is not to bring peace to the Middle East. They hope instead to bring peace to their own streets. The undertaking is a testament either to human perseverance, or to the eternal bureaucratic faith in peace through fog.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

There's a way to respond to Trump's brutal and reckless funding cutbacks—and it doesn't need Washington's permission.

Whatever halfway measures Congress or the courts may take to stop President Donald Trump's assault on universities, they will not change the fact that a profound agreement has been broken: Since World War II, the U.S. government has funded basic research at universities, with the understanding that the discoveries and innovations that result would benefit the U.S. economy and military, as well as the health of the nation's citizens. But under President Trump—who has already targeted more than $3 billion in research funding for termination and hopes to cut much more, while at the same time increasing the tax on endowments and threatening the ability of universities to enroll international students—the federal government has become an unreliable and brutally coercive partner.

The question for universities is, what now?

It will take time for research universities to find a new long-term financial model that allows science and medicine to continue advancing—a model much less dependent on the federal government. But right now universities don't have time. The problem with recklessly cutting billions in funds the way the Trump administration has done—not just at elite private universities such as Harvard and Columbia but also at public research universities across the country—is that “stop-start” simply doesn't work in science.

If a grant is snatched away today, researchers are let go, graduate students are turned away, and clinical trials are halted with potentially devastating consequences for patients. Unused equipment gathers dust, samples spoil, lab animals are euthanized. Top scientists move their laboratories to other countries, which are happy to welcome this talent, much as the United States welcomed German scientists in the 1930s. Meanwhile, the best students around the world enroll elsewhere, where good science is still being done and their legal status is not up in the air. The result, ultimately, is that the U.S. leaves it to other nations to discover a cure for Alzheimer's disease or diabetes, or to make fusion energy practicable.

Read: How many times can science funding be canceled?

No easy substitute exists for federal support of academic R&D—the scale of the investment is just too large. In fiscal year 2023, federal funding for university research amounted to about $60 billion nationwide. University-endowment spending, as reported by the “2024 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments,” is just half that—$30 billion, with much of the money earmarked for financial aid. Universities by themselves cannot save American science, engineering, and medicine.

However, there is also no easy substitute within the American economy for university-based research—universities are the only major institutions that do what they do. The kind of curiosity-driven rather than profit-driven research pursued by universities is too risky for private corporations. By and large, industry conducts research to achieve milestones along a well-considered road map. It is up to universities to find the new roads and educate the experts who know how to travel them. Those roads are where the real potential for growth lies. After all, the internet and the artificial neural networks that enable generative AI arose out of basic research at U.S. universities. So did the most fundamental discoveries in molecular biology, which are now enabling astonishing one-time treatments that are potential cures for painful genetic diseases such as sickle cell.

University research is particularly important in states where technology-intensive industries have grown up around the talent and ideas that universities generate—states such as Washington, California, New York, Massachusetts, Texas, Maryland, and North Carolina. Although the Trump administration may characterize federal research grants as wasteful spending, they are really an investment, one with higher returns than federal investment in infrastructure or private investment in R&D.

There is a way forward—a way to bridge the huge gap in funding. It starts with the assumption that a bridge will be needed for several years, until some measure of sanity and federal support returns. It is based on the premise that, because universities are not the sole nor even the most significant beneficiaries of the scientific research they conduct, they should not be alone in trying to save their R&D operations. And it is focused not on Washington but on the individual states that have relied most on federal research spending.

These states have the power to act unilaterally. They can set up emergency funds to replace canceled federal grants, allowing universities to keep their labs open until a shaky present gives way to a sturdier future. These states can also create incentives for corporations, investors, philanthropists, and of course universities themselves to step up in extraordinary ways at a time of emergency.

This is not merely wishful thinking. Massachusetts has already made moves in this direction. At the end of July, Governor Maura Healey introduced legislation that would put $400 million of state funds into university-based research and research partnerships. Half would go to public colleges and universities, and half to other institutions, including private research universities and academic hospitals. Obviously, with $2.6 billion of multiyear research grants threatened at Harvard alone, action by the state will cover only part of the funding deficit, but it will help.

It makes perfect sense for Massachusetts to be the first state to try to stanch the bleeding. With just 2 percent of the nation's workforce, Massachusetts is home to more than 11 percent of all R&D jobs in the country. It has the highest per capita funding from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation in the U.S. Every federal dollar invested in academic science in Massachusetts generates about $2 in economic return for the state. And that's before taking into account the economic impact of any discoveries.

In particular, Massachusetts has a powerful biomedical-research ecosystem to protect. But each state has its own strategic imperatives, and many ways to structure such emergency funds exist. Because the grants canceled by the Trump administration have already undergone the federal peer-review process, states don't need to force themselves into the challenging business of judging the worthiness of individual research proposals. They could make a large difference simply by refilling the vessels that have been abruptly emptied, possibly with grants that allow the universities to prioritize the most important projects.

States could require that, in exchange for state help, universities must raise matching funds from their donors. In addition, states could launch their own philanthropic funds, as Massachusetts is also doing. Philanthropy—which already contributes an estimated $13 billion a year to university research through foundations, individual gifts, and the income on gifts to university endowments—is particularly important at this moment. As federal-grant awards become scarcer, it is a fair bet that federal-funding agencies will become more risk averse.

Philanthropists have always played an important role in encouraging unconventional thinking because they are willing to fund the very earliest stages of discovery. For example, the philanthropists Ted and Vada Stanley funded a center at MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute specifically to explore the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. In a landmark 2016 study, researchers there found strong evidence of a molecular mechanism underlying schizophrenia, establishing the first distinct connection in the disorder between gene variants and a biological process. Foundations can also launch sweeping projects that bring together communities of scientists from different organizations to advance a field, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has mapped a third of the night sky, or the Sloan Deep Carbon Observatory, which studied the carbon cycle beneath the surface of the Earth.

Read: Inside the collapse at the NIH

States could also incentivize their business communities to be part of the rescue operation, perhaps by offering to match industry contributions to academic R&D. Some sectors, such as the biopharmaceutical industry, are particularly reliant on university discoveries. NIH-funded research contributed to more than 99 percent of all new drugs approved in the U.S. from 2010 to 2019. But China is now catching up to the U.S. in drug innovation. American biopharmaceutical companies are already dependent on China for raw materials. If they don't want to become completely reliant on China for breakthrough drugs as well—and able to access only those drugs that China is willing to share—they should do what they can to help save what has long been the world's greatest system for biomedical research.

The same is true for science-based technology companies in fields that include quantum computing, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and batteries. Academic breakthroughs underlie the products and services they sell. If they want to remain ahead of their global competition, they should help support the next generation of breakthroughs and the next generation of students who will contribute to those breakthroughs.

Among those who would benefit from keeping U.S. university labs open are the venture capitalists and other investors who profit from the commercialization of university ideas. From 1996 to 2020, academic research generated 141,000 U.S. patents, spun out 18,000 companies, supported 6.5 million jobs, and contributed $1 trillion to the GDP. One of those spinouts was named Google. In our current state of emergency, investment firms should be considering ways to provide a lifeline to the university-based science that supports a high-tech economy.

Governors and other leaders in states with major research universities will need to work quickly and decisively, bringing various parties together in order to stave off disaster. But what is the alternative? If states, corporations, donors, and other stakeholders do nothing, there will be fewer American ideas to invest in, fewer American therapies to benefit from, and fewer advanced manufacturing industries making things in the U.S.

No contributions from elsewhere can completely replace broad-based federal support for university R&D. But until that returns, states with a lot on the line economically offer the best hope of limiting the losses and salvaging U.S. science.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

How free time gets conscripted into the service of work

The shift begins when she leaves her desk at 5 p.m.

She drives home, arriving at 5:45. Five minutes later, she's starting a load of laundry; at 6 p.m. she changes into workout clothes. By 6:25 she's on the treadmill for precisely 30 minutes. At 7 o'clock she grabs a grocery delivery from her front porch and unloads it. At 7:15 she makes an electrolyte drink. Shower time is at 7:25. At 8 p.m. she cooks up some salmon and broccoli; at 8:25 she plates her dinner while tidily packing up the leftovers. Not a moment is wasted.

This is one woman on TikTok's version of the “5 to 9 after the 9 to 5.” Over the past couple of years, the vloggers of social media have taken to documenting their routines from 5 to 9 p.m. Some creators also make a morning version, the “5 to 9 before the 9 to 5,” starting at 5 a.m. These routines are highly edited, almost hypnotic, with quick cuts, each mini-scene overlaid with a time stamp. Hours pass in just a couple of minutes, and the compressed time highlights a sense of efficiency. The videos have big to-do-list energy; the satisfaction they offer is that of vicariously checking boxes.

In the past few weeks, I have lived months' worth of compressed mornings and evenings with 5-to-9 vloggers. They are a self-selecting crew, certainly. But the sheer volume of hours that I consumed allowed me to see, in a big-picture way, how the need to be productive seeps into people's leisure time—time that ideally would be free of such concerns. These videos reflect a truth that predates and will almost certainly outlive them: When life revolves around work, even leisure becomes labor.

One way to look at 5-to-9 videos is as the product of people trying to make the most of the leisure time they have. Given how many of these videos are made by people in their early 20s, I see in them a new generation entering the workforce and acclimating to the reality that time is limited. But in attempting to take control back from their jobs, many 5-to-9 video creators end up reproducing a version of the thing they are trying to distance themselves from. If you clock out, go home, and continue checking things off a list, you haven't really left the values of work behind. One woman I saw details the “five nonnegotiables” for her 5 to 9, the things she must achieve each evening: exercise; a healthy, home-cooked meal; a shower; a skin-care routine; and a clean kitchen. After she ticks all those boxes, the night is nearly over. Not much time remains for anything unplanned. Many creators also use part of their leisure time to plan for the upcoming workday, laying out outfits for the morning or writing their schedule in a planner.

Read: The religion of workism is making Americans miserable

The threat of waste looms over many nighttime-routine videos—“X Number of Things I Did to Stop Wasting My Evenings” is a common title formula. (Recommendations include multitasking so you can get more done at once, and “Whatever you do, do not sit down.”) What exactly you accomplish almost doesn't matter—a spotless house, a completed Pilates class, an “everything shower”—so long as you've been a busy little bee whom no one could accuse of wasting time. The idea that unproductive time is time squandered is not unique to the 5 to 9; it pervades much of the American approach to leisure. “In a capitalist society, we do feel like we have to prove our worth through our productivity,” Pooja Lakshmin, a psychiatrist and the author of Real Self-Care, told me. By inverting the “9 to 5” formulation of a corporate workday, these videos present free time explicitly as another shift, one you hire yourself to work.

Katlin Marisol Sweeney-Romero is an assistant professor of cinema and digital media at UC Davis who has written about other productive-vlogging trends on TikTok. In 5-to-9 videos, she told me, “the main message is not about how to rest, but: How do you operationalize rest to still be a productive part of your day?” Several evening-routine videos show the creators editing their content, and Sweeney-Romero pointed out that even the most relaxing vlog still has a whiff of labor about it—because someone had to shoot, edit, and post it.

Conspicuously missing from most of the videos I watched is any kind of socializing, which corresponds with the fact that Americans have been spending more and more time alone over the past couple of decades. After watching scores of solitary evenings, I deliriously started searching 5-to-9 friends and 5-to-9 community??? and found a handful of examples. The sight of people eating together, laughing, and walking outside in the sunlight was refreshing after hours of scrolling through videos of tasks completed alone in greige apartments with overhead lighting. But these videos were few and far between—other people can be an obstacle to running your life with the precision of a ticking watch.

In most 5-to-9 videos, we get little sense of people's actual jobs, save for the times they log back on in the evening, or the glimpses they show of their side gigs as content creators. What they highlight instead is the way a work mindset can follow you home and shape your leisure in its image. For many Americans, work is the focus of life, the place to find purpose and a sense of self. My colleague Derek Thompson has dubbed this “workism”—the religion of work. A 2023 Pew survey found that a majority of Americans—71 percent—rated “having a job or career they enjoy” as an “extremely” or “very” important ingredient for a fulfilling life. Work also gets prioritized in many people's lives out of necessity. Research shows that people in countries with high levels of economic inequality, such as the United States, tend to have worse work-life balance.

It wasn't always this way. In much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, “the view was that leisure was the place where we would find the best things in life,” Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian at the University of Iowa, told me. “This would be the place to realize our full humanity, outside of the economy.” Yet after World War II, Hunnicutt writes in his book Free Time, the workweek stagnated at the 40 hours we still know as standard today, and American culture shifted toward seeking meaning through work, rather than outside of it: “We moderns for some reason no longer expect work to ever become a subordinate part of life.”

Some 5-to-9 videos do seem to push back against hustle culture. Their creators mock the hyperproductivity of a typical morning or evening routine, instead showing themselves zoning out. One man's “5 to 9” consists of flopping on the couch and scrolling on his phone for hours. Another woman, after shutting her laptop, pauses and stares into space “to process what just happened over the past nine hours and shove any trauma coming to the surface back into the far depths of my consciousness,” then goes “straight to my cat for at least 45 minutes of emotional-support cuddling.”

The joke is that their jobs have left them too exhausted to do much of anything at all. Yet even in this willfully unproductive use of leisure time, work hovers overhead like a ghost. For these people, and many others who don't film themselves, free time may not be a reproduction of work, but it is a reaction to it. Work is still winning.

In 1948, the German philosopher Josef Pieper argued that time away from work is all too often still kind of about work. “The simple ‘break' from work—the kind that lasts an hour, or the kind that lasts a week or longer,” he wrote in his book Leisure: The Basis of Culture, “is there for the sake of work. It is supposed to provide ‘new strength' for ‘new work,' as the word ‘refreshment' indicates: one is refreshed for work through being refreshed from work.”

Read: How hobbies infiltrated American life

This is the trap of leisure in a culture fixated on work. Anything done consciously or subconsciously for the sake of recovering from or balancing out work is not entirely free from labor—even if it's genuinely relaxing and enjoyable. When you take a bath to unwind from a stressful shift or get into crafting to offset all the screen time you have at your job, when you go to bed early so you'll have energy for work the next day or wake up early to meditate and calm yourself before a commute, your rest is at least partly in service of your work. According to Pieper, that is not true leisure. “Nobody who wants leisure merely for the sake of ‘refreshment,'” he wrote, “will experience its authentic fruit.”

What would need to happen for people to experience their leisure as being in no way connected to labor? Certain policies might make work less central to people's lives: universal basic income, for example, or a four-day workweek. But the experts and philosophers of leisure would suggest that a collective mindset shift is also required.

Achievement, optimization, and escape are all approaches to leisure that Lakshmin calls “faux self-care,” as opposed to the real self-care that she titled her book after. Faux self-care, she told me, is “prescribed from the outside,” or it's a “reaction to being burnt out.” Real self-care, meanwhile, means “being engaged with your own reality,” she said. It's less about what you're doing than how and why you're doing it.

Consider a yoga class, for example. You can go to one because you feel like you should, to get some movement after a sedentary workday, and spend the whole time comparing yourself with the more flexible person two mats over, and you've “checked yoga off the list, but you didn't take in any of the medicine of yoga,” Lakshmin said.

When I think about it, many of my 5 to 9s aren't that different from the ones I've watched: leave the office, maybe go to the gym, zone out with video games or TV, make dinner, work on my side hustle (writing a book), do chores, perform my nightly ablutions, read, sleep. Sometimes my evenings, too, are an exercise in box-checking, dissociation, and faux self-care, my body piloted by a brain that has never quite switched off work mode.

Read: The bizarre relationship of a ‘work wife' and ‘work husband'

But I crave something else, something like what the artist and author Jenny Odell describes in her book Saving Time: At its most helpful, “leisure time is an interim means of questioning the bounds of the work that surrounds it. Like a stent in a culture that can't stand what looks like emptiness, it might provide that vertical crack in the horizontal scale of work and not-work,” she writes, “where the edges of something new start to become visible.” Because this is more of a felt sense than a behavior, labeling one activity leisure and another not is impossible. Odell writes that she has experienced this kind of leisure while “cooking, sorting socks, getting the mail.” But it won't be found in a packed schedule. “True leisure,” she writes, “requires the kind of emptiness in which you remember the fact of your own aliveness.”

For me, those vertical cracks seem most likely to form when I am spending time with other living things: people, mostly, but also my cats, and the natural world around me. When I go on a walk and admire the flowers in my neighbors' gardens. When I linger over a meal with a friend long after our plates have been cleared. These are moments whose worth cannot be measured in output, that do not serve anything but themselves.

A common thread in the reading I've done on leisure is the conviction that forcing gets you nowhere. “Fun is a sneak and likes to catch people unawares; it simply will not tolerate wrenching,” the drama critic Walter Kerr wrote in 1962. The ethos of work is using time for something, turning it into a tool to drill your way to some desired outcome. Worshipping that too much precludes other forms of reverence, the peace and awe that can sneak up on you when you're just existing.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Donald Trump's pick to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't have to manipulate any numbers to undermine the reliability of the government's jobs reports.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

If you have been closely following the ongoing Bureau of Labor Statistics story—in which Donald Trump fired then-Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after being displeased by the bureau's July jobs report and selected the Heritage Foundation economist E. J. Antoni to succeed her—you will have heard an unusual consensus about the airtight political independence of the agency and the people who work there. Among BLS employees, including former Commissioner William Beach, whom Trump appointed in his first term, a fierce loyalty to the data is bone deep.

Antoni does not appear to share that spirit of independence, nor does he seem to have a great deal of talent for economics or statistics, according to economists from across the political spectrum. Even so, his power to avoid future reports that embarrass Trump appears to be limited. In an interview recorded on August 4, before his nomination, Antoni proposed eliminating the monthly release of employment data, but the administration has already insisted that that won't happen. BLS data may not be completely tamper-proof, but they're pretty close. The sharpest economic minds in this country, both inside and outside the bureau, pay meticulous attention to the deepest layers of the data, many strata below the headline-unemployment rate and change-in-payroll employment. Deceiving them all would be very hard to do.

Unfortunately, that might not matter. Antoni doesn't have to manipulate any data to undermine the reliability of the government's economic statistics. That damage might already have been done.

I was a career press official at the Department of Labor who prepared a series of labor secretaries for their TV appearances early on the first Friday morning of every month. The release of the jobs report—“Jobs Day”—is a marquee event in this little corner of the federal government, when the press and the financial world's attention is fixed on the plaza of the Frances Perkins Building, in Washington. I lasted only one Jobs Day into the tenure of Trump's labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, before taking DOGE's buyout deal. I decided to leave the government in large part out of fear of precisely the kind of demands for oaths of political loyalty that were being threatened then and are now being implicitly exacted on every career civil servant at the BLS.

Brian Klaas: Will Trump get his Potemkin statistics?

Most labor secretaries, understanding the power of jobs data to create or destroy value in the financial markets, have taken a sober and restrained approach to these press appearances. Then there's Chavez-DeRemer. One of her prime talking points has been that “native-born workers have accounted for all job gains since Inauguration Day.” Every single one. Not a single Russian surgeon or Canadian blackjack dealer got a job after January 20 of this year. In fact, the BLS makes no such assertion. The claim is absurd on its face—the kind of political catnip that a Cabinet secretary in the Trump administration is expected to put forward without shame, as a kind of homage to the boss.

The existence of an independent BLS commissioner is predicated on the idea that someone needs to talk about the labor market who is never tempted to say such things. It's a public service, primarily for investors. Might a member of the Cabinet say something iffy as a result of her political loyalties? That's not ideal, but here's someone else you can listen to who doesn't have that problem. Until now, this arrangement allowed the president's representative to attempt to convince the public of the effectiveness of his priorities while reinforcing the objective, nonpartisan genesis of the underlying data. If the BLS commissioner is now every bit the political animal that the labor secretary is, then what is the purpose of the BLS commissioner?

I am not a statistician; perhaps Antoni can mandate methodological deviations that bias the numbers in Trump's preferred direction. But I don't think he needs to. Confidence in the bureau is already badly weakened. This is about more than just our trust as consumers of the jobs report, because we are also its producers. To create its reports, the BLS needs businesses and citizens to take the time to respond to surveys about changes to their payroll and about who is going to work or looking for a job in their household. Even before Trump won the election last November, the trend in survey responsiveness was declining, posing an existential threat to the robustness of the data.

The appointment of a transparent partisan to the head of the BLS is unlikely to improve matters. Why should we take the time to report our economic circumstances to the government if we believe the government isn't interested in the truth? If fewer Americans think that contributing to the creation of these reports is a valuable use of their time, the civil servants at the BLS will struggle to produce reliable numbers, regardless of what policies Antoni puts into place.

Prosecuting his enemies is turning out to be more difficult than he'd hoped—at least for now.

In November 2017, less than a year into his first term as president, Donald Trump publicly confronted a depressing reality. The traditions of Justice Department independence, he lamented in a radio interview, limited his ability to order an investigation of Hillary Clinton. It was “the saddest thing,” he said. “I'm not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing, and I am very frustrated by it.”

This time around, Trump is not similarly encumbered. During the interregnum between his terms, MAGA's would-be philosophers built out the intellectual architecture for a presidential takeover of the Justice Department. Once Trump was back in office, the new administration set about filling DOJ leadership with loyalists and firing anyone who might object to abuses of power. The president, insistent that he was the victim of persecution by federal law enforcement, now seeks to turn the same apparatus against his enemies. In a representative Truth Social post last month, he shared an AI-generated video of Barack Obama being handcuffed by FBI agents and dragged out of the Oval Office.

But Trump's plan to leverage the DOJ for his campaign of revenge is not generating the results he might have hoped for, and not just because Obama remains a free man. The Justice Department has been slow to move forward with the investigations Trump demanded, hemmed in by the constraints of the legal system. Federal prosecutors targeting protesters and Democratic politicians have been dealt embarrassing defeats. American criminal law appears to be a less flexible tool in the hands of an authoritarian than Trump hoped—at least for now.

Attorney General Pam Bondi identified herself right away as an enthusiastic participant in the president's personal-retribution project, launching a “Weaponization Working Group” in February that would examine past investigations of Trump. In recent weeks, the department appears to have moved toward a potential criminal investigation of officials involved in the 2016 probe of Russian election interference. Outside the Justice Department, the Office of Special Counsel has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who, from 2022 to 2024, oversaw the two federal criminal prosecutions of Trump for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by government employees. (Despite its name, the Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency with no relationship to Smith's old shop.)

Jonathan Chait: Trump's desperate move to quiet the Epstein scandal

This is one model of law enforcement as a weapon: specific targeting of preexisting villains. Around the country, meanwhile, federal prosecutors handpicked by Trump are experimenting with another: cracking down on dissent. Anti-ICE protesters, and even Democratic elected officials pushing for oversight of immigration enforcement, have faced criminal charges.

Attorney General Robert Jackson famously warned in 1940 that the federal prosecutor “has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America.” Still, prosecutorial authority has limits. A prosecutor has to find a crime to charge in the first place. If the offense is serious enough, the prosecutor must also be able to persuade a grand jury to issue an indictment. And if the defendant refuses to plead guilty, the prosecutor must persuade a petit jury to convict. These are far from insurmountable barriers; on the contrary, as criminal-justice reformers have long argued, the deck is stacked in favor of the prosecution. But the Trump administration keeps tripping up on them anyway.

After June protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles, the office of Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli filed more than 35 felony prosecutions, mostly for alleged assault of federal officers. But the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg report that prosecutors were unable to persuade a grand jury to indict in several cases, as is required for felony charges. Court records show that in the weeks following the protests, the office moved to dismiss at least eight cases and downgraded another five to misdemeanors. (In one instance, the office charged a case as a felony, dropped it to a misdemeanor, and then recharged it as a felony a month and a half later, this time with an indictment in hand. Prosecutors have secured indictments in at least 12 cases, though two of those were later dismissed and a third indictment originally identified the defendant by the wrong name.) For context, in 2016, the last year for which data are available, the Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded only six refusals by grand juries out of roughly 180,000 cases pursued by federal prosecutors around the country. In more ordinary times, the old saying that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich is not far off.

On the opposite coast, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey has dealt with an embarrassment of its own. The office's interim leader, Alina Habba (until recently one of Trump's personal lawyers), filed trespassing charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after he attempted to visit an ICE detention facility in his city. “NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,” Habba trumpeted on X. Two weeks later, however, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges. The magistrate judge handling the case chastened the office over its failure to “thoughtfully consider the implications of your actions before wielding your immense power.” (Baraka, sitting in the courtroom during the hearing, was overheard commenting afterward, “Jesus, he tore these people a new asshole.”)

Bondi, meanwhile, is struggling to respond to the president's demands to prosecute people involved in perpetrating what Trump calls the “Russia hoax.” The biggest challenge there is that there was no hoax; as both Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a bipartisan Senate intelligence report concluded, Russia really did try to help Trump win the 2016 election. For that matter, even if the Justice Department could somehow identify a crime, any number of legal issues could trip up a prosecution—including the fact that the conduct in question took place almost 10 years ago, well past the typical five-year window for charging an offense. According to The New York Times, the attorney general was caught unawares by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's release of documents from 2016, and displeased about the political pressure from the right to launch an investigation in response. Despite an exciting headline from Fox News—“DOJ Launching Grand Jury Investigation Into Russiagate Conspiracy Allegations”—all Bondi appears to have done is ask prosecutors to possibly present grand jurors with evidence. When a grand jury will actually convene, and indeed whether it ever will, is not clear.

Bondi's hedging on Russia hints at a broader awareness within the Justice Department that securing indictments, much less guilty verdicts, may be a problem. In May, Ed Martin, the crusading Trump supporter who is now leading the Justice Department's Weaponization Working Group, suggested that if the department were unable to charge “bad actors” with crimes, it would settle for naming and shaming them publicly. (This would be a departure from long-running department policy, which holds that “no legitimate governmental interest” is served by publicly voicing allegations against individuals without an accompanying criminal case.) Similarly, the investigation of Jack Smith might be a tacit admission of how little the administration has to go on here: The harshest penalty that the Office of Special Counsel could demand would be Smith's dismissal from government service, but he has already resigned.

Shane Harris: The ‘Russia hoax,' revisited

These challenges are similar to ones that Trump ran into during his first term. In fact, the FBI's 2016 election-interference investigation was already the subject of an investigation by Special Counsel John Durham, which began in 2019. Despite MAGA hype, Durham's probe was a flop: He brought three criminal cases concerning alleged wrongdoing around the Russia investigation, two of which ended in acquittals by juries. (A third led to a former FBI lawyer being sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to having altered an email.) And a shaky criminal probe into former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, whom Trump had seized on as a symbol of the nefarious “deep state,” quietly ground to a halt without charges being filed. It's difficult to say exactly what happened in the McCabe case because of strict rules around grand-jury secrecy, but one possibility is that jurors declined to issue an indictment.

Still, the jury system will not always act as a defense against abuses. The same day that Baraka's case was dismissed, Habba announced her intent to indict Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver for “forcibly impeding and interfering with federal officers” when attempting to shield Baraka from arrest. A grand jury returned the indictment. McIver has pleaded not guilty, but others might make different calculations: The overwhelming majority of criminal cases end with plea deals, because defendants decide against taking their chances in court. Meanwhile, the Justice Department recently sent out grand-jury subpoenas targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James over investigations by her office into Trump and the National Rifle Association. Fox News reports that another investigation may be under way into Trump's claims of supposed mortgage fraud by James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. Even if the harassment of James and Schiff goes nowhere, criminal investigations like these can be a grueling experience for the defendant, especially given the enormous cost of paying for a defense lawyer.

A jury is in essence a democratic institution, requiring citizens to exercise their judgment in a model of shared deliberation that is at odds with Trump's autocratic tendencies. In the colonial era, grand juries sometimes refused to indict protesters against the Crown; in the decades before the Civil War, both grand and petit juries nullified prosecutions under the Fugitive Slave Act. Yet although the American jury system can be a powerful tool in the fight for self-government, it has not always been a reliable one. Juries also helped build the foundations of the Jim Crow South by shielding white Southerners from legal accountability for racial terror. So far, the system has held up against Trump's encroachment. But the rapid erosion of democratic life in the United States over the past six months is a reminder of how quickly things can change.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A liberal writer explains her journey through intellectual MAGAland.

If you've been following American politics in the Trump era, there's a decent chance you've heard of “the New Right.” It's a loose movement of radical intellectuals who share a basic hostility to American liberal democracy. They all think the system is rotten, that it needs to be fundamentally overhauled, and that Donald Trump can be a vehicle for putting something better in its place.

But why do they think that? How much influence do they really have? And what would a response to their rising prominence look like?

In an upcoming episode of Vox's The Gray Area podcast, I spoke about all of this with Laura Field — a political theorist who spent a lot of time in the conservative intellectual world. Her book Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right is a fascinating taxonomy of the wild world of far-right thinking.

We talk about who these people are and how they replaced the “old” conservatism with something more aggressive and authoritarian. We also talk about how they are influencing the Trump administration, and why ordinary Americans should care what a handful of thinkers are putting out on obscure Substacks and YouTube channels.

Part of our conversation is transcribed below, edited and condensed for clarity. The full interview contains much more, and you can listen to it on Monday. We'll update this link with the embed when the episode is out.

And, if you just can't get enough of Zack and Laura content, you can come to our Vox-sponsored panel at the Liberalism in the 21st Century conference — held in DC on Friday. There's already a waitlist, so sign up soon.

You're someone who is liberal but found yourself as a professional academic and intellectual in conservative spaces — and that's pretty unusual because there tends to be a lot of self-segregation away from that world. What pulled you into it and what was it like being an insider-outsider in the conservative world of ideas?

I wanted to go into medicine and be a doctor in the developing world. I was very, very liberal and sort of a save-the-world type. I had to take some required courses in political philosophy, and one was a wonderful course on ancient political philosophy and early modern thought. It was mind-blowing.

The right today uses this language of being “red-pilled,” where you see through the lies that we are told by the regime. They use this extreme language, but something sort of parallel happened to me, just reading Plato with these really great teachers.

I fell in love with these books and the tradition of political philosophy and literature that these teachers were so good at explaining. My politics didn't change dramatically, but some of those circles were quite adjacent to the people who were the leaders of the avant-garde of defending Trumpism: the West Coast Straussians, call them the Claremont Institute people.

When that started happening, I was really quite alarmed.

You use “new right” as an umbrella term for all of these different pro-Trump factions. What makes the new Rrght a cogent grouping, not just a random smattering of people who all like Trump? What connects them and what differentiates them from the old right?

I'm talking about the MAGA new right, [in contrast] with the Reagan-Buckley right, or the establishment right, which is propped up by fiscal conservatism (free-market economics), social conservatism (conservative social values), and anti-communism.

The new right turns against a lot of that. Michael Anton, one of these Claremont Institute guys, says that Trumpism and the new right is all about economic nationalism — turning against the free market orientation of the establishment — as well as closed, secure borders. So that's the anti-immigration strain and America-first foreign policy.

I think that there's also just a hardcore social conservatism at the core of a lot of this — at least spiritually.

The new right has shared principles: preoccupation with gender, strong support for Trump, a general disinterest in the traditional norms of democratic politics, and a commitment to unremitting culture war against the left. But there are huge divisions. If you were to divide the new right into camps, what would you say the fault lines are? 

I have three main camps: the Claremonters, the post-liberals, and the national conservatives. Then I talk also about the hard right, but the hard right travels alongside all three of them ideologically. The hard right is the hardcore, manosphere-fascist types. Each of these groupings are different.

The Claremonters are the West Coast Straussians that I was speaking about before. They are really committed, at least in theory, to the American founding. They have this very grandiose vision that's beyond even your ordinary patriotism. It's that this is the best regime of all time. They're also at the very cutting edge of the culture war. So America is the best regime of all time, but we've completely lost the plot. The liberals and liberal way of thinking have taken over to such a degree that we need a counter-revolution. They're the [type] who defended January 6.

Michael Anton, who you mentioned earlier, is now a Trump administration official, a high-ranking one. He's one of the key leaders in that faction.

Yeah. And then there's the national conservatives. They're a little more vanilla, with just nationalism as their core thing. But it turns into ethno-nationalism in some cases and certainly Christian nationalism. They're a big tent.

The tensions are clearest when we are talking about the post-liberals, who are the most highbrow of the New Right. They tend to be Catholic intellectuals: people like Adrian Vermeule at Harvard, Patrick Deneen at Notre Dame, and writer Sohrab Ahmari. These are serious Catholics who are more committed to social conservatism and really want to shape the morals of the country in a much more traditional Catholic direction. But they're also interestingly much more sincere about the left-oriented [redistributive] economics.

The new right as a whole speaks as if they want to help the working class, and create new populist programs. But I think that the people who are closest to Trump haven't really followed through. They've got the tariffs, but otherwise economically, they're still doing the big tax cuts. They're still beholden to donors. So that's been a big fissure, because the post-liberals are almost open to socialism.

A lot of other fissures come in terms of how accepting they are of the hard right. Ahmari has been quite outspoken against the Proud Boys and the manosphere, Bronze Age Pervert and those guys.

I think another interesting divide, which came about just after the election, was DOGE vs. MAGA. DOGE came in and did the destructive part of getting rid of the so-called administrative state. But a big part of the new right wants to harness the state and weaponize it for their own purposes.

Why does any of this matter for our politics? 

The knee-jerk reaction to think “who cares” is a natural one, because a lot of these people are bizarre — weirdos. That's why it's alarming to see them wield so much power, to see JD Vance have that clout.

I think they have dramatically reoriented the GOP. It's not just JD Vance who's some weirdo who's gotten to the top. It also seems to matter a lot to young people. These kinds of movements can build energy, and young men are influenced by these circles.

A lot of these people I'm writing about are in the intellectual spheres. They're pretty smart. A lot of them have PhDs, which is no marker of genius, but they have a lot of education and resources available to them. They're experts in ways that would surprise many people. They know a whole lot. I wouldn't want to debate some of them on the founding or other questions.

These well-learned people shape the minds of people like Joe Rogan. Ideologically, there is a trickle-down effect. The culture war has a big impact. You see the impact of someone like Christopher Rufo.

You argue that the right operates with an “ideas first” approach, believing that ideas have a tangible, causal impact on politics. Democrats, in contrast, are putting ideas last. You contrast the “coarse brazenness of [the right's] ideologues and the tepid intellectual and cluelessness and cowardice of so many centrist and liberal leaders both within academia and beyond.”

That is a stinging indictment of the liberal intellectual class. Where are you coming from here? When you say that they've failed in contrast to the coarse brazenness of the new right, what do you mean?

Trump has been much more effective in his second term. The Democrats are in a difficult position. They had a very rocky electoral cycle with Biden staying in so long and Harris in this awful position of having to parachute in and not being very well prepared.

I don't feel like there's much of a response from the left intellectually to what's going on. It doesn't seem to me like the party has much to offer on the ideological front.

It is frustrating as an observer to see that Bernie and AOC were the people who went and toured the country. But I didn't see more centrist Democrats doing very much. And I still think that's the case. They seem very shocked and unprepared. And I think that that comes down to a failure of imagination — taking way too much for granted for a very long time. And that's part of what got us Trump in the first place.

If Amanda Knox's tale is twisted, it's worth asking who twisted it.

If ever true crime had a “household name,” that name might be Amanda Knox. Forever immortalized as an inadvertent yet infamous media darling, Knox has weathered the storm of being tried, convicted, imprisoned, freed, retried, and ultimately found innocent of the 2007 murder of her British roommate Meredith Kercher.

Knox, a Seattle native, was just 20 when she briefly lived with Kercher and two other roommates in the idyllic cliffside house in Perugia, Italy, where Kercher was murdered. Despite a glaring lack of evidence against her from the start (and overwhelming evidence against the man who actually did it), Knox became a publicly reviled figure who still generates suspicion across two continents. Since her exoneration, she's chosen to meet that suspicion head-on, participating in a documentary, writing memoirs, and speaking out about how the media demonized her and how the justice system nearly failed her.

All of this has led to her newest project, The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, an eight-episode Hulu docudrama created by K.J. Steinberg (This Is Us) and co-produced by Knox, retelling her story from her perspective. While true crime biopics are everywhere these days, there's something particularly strange about this one, which sees Grace van Patten as a wide-eyed, winsome, fourth-wall-breaking Amanda. The show's director, Michael Uppendahl, deliberately plays with tonal shifts, seesawing between the quirky, twee aesthetic of Amelie, the film Knox and her boyfriend were watching the night of the murder, and the claustrophobia of interrogation rooms and grief of tearful family meltdowns. The result is something that feels almost unholy — like The Staircase meets Fleabag, two things that should probably never meet!

As with Hulu's other recent true crime-ish docudrama about Natalia Grace, Twisted Tale takes a granular approach to its storytelling, canvassing a huge amount of detail even as the narrative spans years. It also takes on a very close point of view through Knox's perspective — which may explain why the narrative glosses over one of the most well-known aspects of this case: If this tale is twisted, who exactly twisted it?

Because we rarely shift out of Knox's viewpoint in Twisted Tale, many of the more famous aspects of the case become offstage concerns. The media's obsession with “Foxy Knoxy” — the main lens through which most Americans would have absorbed the Amanda Knox story — gets reduced to a passing remark between unnamed journalists. The public's obsession with the case is also kept firmly at arm's length; fictional Amanda doesn't even open the hordes of fan mail she receives in prison.

The elevation of so many personal details and relationships inevitably leads to the fast-tracking of many other details about the case, including years of pretty bonkers information about the investigation, prosecution, and ongoing media frenzy. The result is that casual viewers, and even viewers who think they already know where this is headed, might be left frantically Googling case facts to convince themselves they just heard that correctly.

Spoiler: You did.

Yes, in Italy, the prosecutor also runs the police investigation. Yes, the prosecutor in this case, Giuliano Mignini (Francesco Acquaroli), had an obsession with sexual morals and occult conspiracies. Yes, he decided that Knox, her eight-day boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (Giuseppe De Domenico), and a local named Rudy Guede, the man who actually murdered Kercher, had all killed her together. His theory? The group participated in a sex game (“gioco erotico”) and satanic ritual acts together that led to Kercher's murder. (Knox barely knew Guede, and Sollecito had never even met him.)

Yes, the prosecutor, Mignini, decided a woman must have killed Meredith Kercher because her body had been covered with a blanket. Yes, he, the investigators, the public, and the press all decided from the outset that Knox was guilty because she kissed her boyfriend while standing outside the crime scene.

Yes, Mignini also pursued an occult conspiracy theory in the case of the “Monster of Florence.” After accusing 20 people of being involved in occult acts related to those murders, Mignini was reprimanded by the courts and convicted of abusing his office by improperly wiretapping some of the suspects. That conviction, however, was overturned on a technicality, so Mignini continued to investigate and prosecute cases — including the murder of Meredith Kercher.

Yes, Knox claims she really was coaxed into doing yoga poses at the police station. Yes, the police really interrogated her for five days while barely allowing her to sleep, hitting her when she gave answers they disliked. This went on until she coughed up a false confession that was then successfully used to convict her of slandering the innocent man the police had pressured her to implicate.

Yes, authorities really lied to her and told her she had contracted HIV in order to get her to give them information about her sexual history. Yes, several of Knox's friends really testified about her awkward behavior at her 2009 trial. “Sometimes she had unusual attitudes, like she would start doing yoga while we were speaking, or she would play guitar while we were watching TV,” her roommate Filomena Romanelli testified.

While Mignini's occult theory was barred from trial, the Satanic Panic of it all continued to influence the media, the public, and the prosecution. Italian lawyers were allowed to refer to Knox in court as “Luciferina,” “enchanting witch,” and “she-devil.” The list of tabloid nicknames for her was much longer and just as absurd.

Fortunately for Knox and Sollecito, the actual evidence that they did it was almost nonexistent, and the prosecution's DNA evidence fell completely apart due to evidence contamination and a botched handling of the crime scene. Guede, meanwhile, left his DNA everywhere.

Because there was so much legal wrangling that happened offscreen and out of sight, you might understandably be confused about whether Knox and Sollecito actually got exonerated or not.

Yes, and no. After Knox's first trial in 2009, she was sentenced to 26 years in prison, Sollecito to 25. In 2011, they won a successful appeal — the decision that freed them both — but that appeal was overturned in 2013 and a new hearing found them guilty again. In that verdict, the court actually increased Knox's sentence to 28 years.

Neither were required to return to Italy to serve this time, however, and in 2015, the case was appealed to the Italian supreme court, which overturned this conviction and acquitted them both once and for all, citing “glaring errors” and “investigative amnesia” among other reasons.

This overturned conviction often gets framed as an exoneration. However, she still stands guilty of slandering her former boss, Patrick Lumumba, as a result of her false confession.

Guede was initially sentenced to 30 years, but ultimately served just 13 years before his release. He still claims he was innocent and that Amanda Knox was the culprit — and for years, many Italians and British citizens believed him. Even today, despite the general shift in public sentiment in the US, many people still argue fiercely that Knox was guilty, based on little more than vibes.

One side effect of this dramatization is that like many true crime dramas, it reduces real people into characters in ways that feel uneven and unsatisfying. The intermittent attempts to return to talking about Meredith feel shallow; after all, Amanda only knew her for a few weeks. This series argues unequivocally that Meredith and Amanda were both victims — but while centering the victim has become a true crime watchword, centering Meredith in Amanda's story is easier said than done.

Then there's the “character” of Amanda herself. On the one hand, the decision not to water down her tendency to be flippant, glib, or socially awkward at the worst times is a smart one, since this is exactly what the media attacked her for to begin with. On the other hand, she's a frustrating ingénue. Her knowing looks at the camera start out annoying and have diminishing returns. Her family members ultimately seem more fazed by her imprisonment than she does. By the time she finds herself on a mystical visit to the Innocence Project, where an encounter with fellow exoneree Antoine Day leads to her awakening as a justice advocate, you can be forgiven if, while wallowing in sympathy, you are just a little tired of this girl.

The decision to present Amanda directly to the viewer without the filter of a damning media lens is arguably a smart choice — but it creates a gap in Amanda's version of the story. After all, the way the press chose to cover the case at home and abroad may have played a bigger role than anything else in putting Amanda in prison.

To understand the real impact the media had on the trial of Amanda Knox, it's crucial to understand that Italian juries aren't sequestered during the trial proceedings. That means that both before and during the trial, they have access to the media's coverage of the case. Experts close to the case have argued that this media exposure was the single biggest reason for Knox and Sollecito being convicted.

We do see one such journalist in action, but only after Knox has finally been cleared of guilt — when she sits down for a 2013 CNN interview with Chris Cuomo, who proceeds to challenge her innocence and hound her about why Italian investigators were so convinced she'd been involved in sex games. Because this comes after Knox is free, it doesn't speak to the real role of the media; it fails as a clue to how we got here.

Contrast this with the 2016 Netflix documentary Amanda Knox, in which prolific Daily Mail journalist Nick Pisa proudly gave a master class in villainy. Pisa was the one who coined the nickname “Foxy Knoxy”; in the doc, he compared his front-page bylines about her to having sex. He was blithe about never fact-checking the things he wrote about her before sending articles off to his editors, and gave quotes on the record that would leave any reputable journalist open-mouthed.

“I think now, looking back, some of the information that came out was just crazy really, it's just completely made up,” Pisa stated at one point.

In one interview years after her first trial, Pisa brought up a purely innocent incident on Knox's part — she wore a Beatles T-shirt to trial — as a reason why prosecutors and “the media” painted her as suspicious. He failed to mention that he had been the one writing about the T-shirt to begin with.

By keeping all of that irresponsible scheming at bay, we miss a vital piece of the convoluted puzzle that led to Knox and Sollecito becoming such easy targets. It wasn't just that Mignini was “prey to delirium” or that the police had an anti-American bias. It was that Amanda herself was vulnerable to a media that craved a villainess. She was “creepy,” “weird,” “inappropriate.” Above all, she was the one thing an innocent girl is never allowed to be: easy.

“It wasn't the crime itself,” Frank Bruni wrote for the New York Times in 2013. “It was the supposed conspiracy of her libido, cast as proof that she was out of control, up to no good, lost, wicked, dangerous. A girl this intent on randy fun was a girl who couldn't be trusted and got what was coming to her, even if it was prison.”

It's understandable that the media might have been squarely in the periphery of Amanda's perspective as she experienced the events that unfolded in Perugia, and that this might shape her version of the story. But if she wasn't focused on them, they were certainly focused on her. Without their influence, this Twisted Tale might have untangled itself much sooner.

Forecasts are better than ever, and far more vulnerable than they should be.

The peak of the hurricane season is upon us and forecasters are still anticipating higher than normal levels of activity, despite a relatively calm season so far.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Tropical Storm Erin is churning in the Atlantic Ocean and moving toward the Caribbean, likely to become the season's first hurricane, a storm with sustained winds above 74 miles per hour.

The National Hurricane Center says it's too early to predict the storm's impacts but advises people on the East Coast of the US “to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.”

The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30 and typically has 14 storms strong enough to be named, meaning with wind speeds above 39 mph. This year is anticipated to be busier than usual, with forecasters expecting up to 18 named storms, and up to five that will turn into major hurricanes. That's due in part to the El Niño cycle, which is currently in its neutral phase, creating atmospheric conditions more favorable to tropical storms. The surface of the Atlantic Ocean remains at above-average temperatures, and since hurricanes are powered by hot water, Erin may become the first major hurricane of the year.

“As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a news release.

But a tropical storm doesn't have to reach hurricane strength to cause death and destruction. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry last month stalled over Texas, where they converged with another weather system and caused a massive downpour that led to deadly flooding in the state's hill country.

A key step to saving lives from tropical storms and hurricanes is to anticipate where they might go and get people out of the way. On this front, scientists have made tremendous strides in building longer lead times ahead of a storm's landfall, and new tools are continuing to extend that lead. But the Trump administration's recent cuts to departments that study and forecast weather are undermining this progress, while cuts to emergency agencies are slowing disaster responses.

Erin could be a major test of the results of these actions.

Meteorologists often describe hurricanes as heat engines, meaning that they use a temperature difference to generate wind and rain. But to start up, a hurricane needs sea surface temperatures to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter. This is why the apex of hurricane activity tends to be in September, after the Atlantic Ocean has had all summer to heat up.

Generally, the hotter the water, the more powerful the resulting storm. “For every degree centigrade that you raise the ocean temperature, the wind speed in the hurricane goes up between 5 and 7 percent,” Kerry Emanuel, an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, the potential for more powerful hurricanes is increasing.

A warmer planet also means rising sea levels as ice caps melt, adding more liquid to the seas. The ocean itself also expands as it gets hotter. So when a hurricane occurs, its winds create a larger storm surge as it pushes water inland. Warmer air can also hold onto more moisture, increasing the rainfall during a hurricane. The combined effects of storm surge and more intense rainfall can lead to more flooding, often the deadliest and most destructive aspect of a hurricane. And as the floods in Texas this year showed, even areas that are far inland can suffer severely from hurricane storm systems.

Since hurricanes spin counter-clockwise, these effects tend to be stronger on the right side of the storm — sometimes called the “dirty side” — where the wind is blowing in the same direction as the storm is moving.

On the other side of the equation, more people are living in the paths of hurricanes. In the US, about 40 percent of the population lives in a coastal county, and the numbers are growing. So when a hurricane makes landfall, it threatens more lives and takes a bigger bite out of the economy.

The good news is that scientists have made huge strides in anticipating hurricanes and can now predict where they are going days in advance. A modern hurricane track forecast looking 72 hours ahead is better than a 24-hour forecast in the early 90s. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed a new prediction model called the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. It proved to be better than previous models at predicting a storm's path and intensity.

In recent years, a number of hurricanes have undergone rapid intensification, where they gain more than 35 miles per hour in wind speed in less than 24 hours. It makes storms harder to predict, and makes evacuating people in their path more hasty and chaotic, as hurricanes surge in strength. Scientists are still trying to tease out the mechanisms behind rapid intensification, but the new model was able to see the rapid intensification coming in Hurricanes Helene and Milton from their earliest advisories, days before landfall.

But while NOAA has made improvements in its forecasts, the agency itself has faced big cuts from the Trump administration, including staff who work on hurricane modeling. The White House has proposed cutting its budget by a quarter, eliminating research divisions like the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which studies hurricanes. Several field offices for the National Weather Service under NOAA currently lack lead meteorologists, and key forecasting tools like weather balloon launches have seen a decline. The National Weather Service is now scrambling to hire back hundreds of employees. All of this adds an unnecessary layer of chaos to an already dangerous situation.

The true scope of these vulnerabilities won't be revealed until after a major hurricane. Already, emergency responders in some parts of the country are getting the message that help from higher up in the government isn't coming, while homeowners are getting the sense that they're on their own when facing extreme weather. And even if the US dodges the worst of Erin, there are still more than two months left in the hurricane season, which has yet to reach its peak.

The largely symbolic move has more to do with politics than supporting Palestinians' right to self-determination.

On Monday, Australia joined a growing number of Western countries that say they will soon recognize a Palestinian state. That list includes France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, while other Western nations, including Norway, Spain, and Ireland, formally recognized a Palestinian state last year.

The rhetorical shift indicates just how much Israel has isolated itself from even some of its allies as it continues its relentless assault on Gaza — a horrific military campaign that has destroyed the enclave, starved the population, and killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, with experts and leading human rights organizations deeming Israel's actions an ongoing genocide.Israel has denounced the move to recognize a Palestinian state as “shameful.” Responding to the UK's announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a post on X that such a move only “rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed similar criticisms, saying that recognitions of a Palestinian state have “emboldened Hamas and made it harder to achieve peace.”

But, if anything, the recent announcements are coming in a little late. The State of Palestine has already been recognized by 147 out of the 193 member states of the United Nations. Most notably, if France and the UK follow through and recognize Palestine, the US would be the only permanent member of the UN Security Council that doesn't recognize a Palestinian state — adding international pressure on the US to change its position in the future.

But just because there's widespread (and growing) recognition of a Palestinian state doesn't mean that Israel's occupation will suddenly end. After all, Israel still occupies the West Bank and Gaza, continues to illegally build settlements in Palestinian territories, and has full military control between the river and the sea. And Israel's recent announcement that it plans to seize Gaza City only deepens and perpetuates its occupation of Palestine.

So what does recognizing the State of Palestine actually achieve?

Even though states exist all around us, there is no universally agreed upon definition of statehood. But under international law, one treaty — the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which went into effect in 1934 — is often cited to outline the criteria that make up a state. The convention lists the following qualifications: “(a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.”

International law experts tend to agree that Palestine meets this definition. But even when states check these boxes, without widespread recognition, they would be limited in their ability to exercise their sovereignty or enter diplomatic agreements with much of the world.

So, on a technical level, recognizing Palestine as a state is important. It allows Palestine to be party to various international treaties, like the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC). That's what allowed the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity. (Since Israel is not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC would not have had jurisdiction over any of the territories had the State of Palestine not signed on.)

Recognition can also deepen diplomatic ties. States that recognize Palestine could open up full embassies in Palestine and allow Palestine to open up more embassies around the world. They would also have more obligations to stand up for Palestinian sovereignty when Israel violates international law, which means they would face more pressure (both domestically and internationally) to impose more diplomatic and economic sanctions on Israel.

Ardi Imsies, an associate professor at Queen's University Faculty of Law in Ontario, recently told The New York Times that recognizing a Palestinian state would provide a basis for “a complete revision of bilateral relations with Israel.” That means that states might have to review their agreements with Israel, both political and economic, to ensure that they do not impede on the Palestinian state's rights and sovereignty. For example, if Israel's trading partners recognize the state of Palestine and still import products manufactured in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, those states would be complicit in violating Palestine's sovereignty according to their own acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood.

Recognizing a Palestinian state should be largely uncontroversial. By granting Palestine state recognition, these Western states would be in line with the two-state solution that they have been pushing for decades. The basic idea is to have two states — one Palestinian and one Israeli — represent two peoples, but negotiations have repeatedly failed.

That's in large part because the two-state solution, as supported by the United States and its allies, has always aimed for creating two unequal states, with Israel maintaining its economic and military dominance and Palestinians having a permanent quasi-state that's not fully sovereign or independent. And that's exactly what's happening with these new recognitions of Palestine, with Western states putting strict conditions on what a Palestinian state looks like, including requirements like not having a military. (The recent plans to recognize a Palestinian state have also not articulated where its borders would be, which ultimately make it harder to establish and defend Palestinian sovereignty.)

“What does this two-state solution look like?” said Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, an international law scholar at the London School of Economics. “A demilitarized state, with Israeli control over national security in Palestinian territory, subjected to future negotiations on boundaries.”

By and large, these countries' recognition of a Palestinian state fall far short of a tangible step towards establishing a full-fledged, sovereign nation. The UK, for example, said it would recognize a Palestinian state only if Israel fails to secure a ceasefire. That means that if a ceasefire does take hold, the UK will simply go back to the status quo of not recognizing Palestine. That does not indicate any real movement toward recognizing Palestinians' right to self-determination.

If these Western states want to have a real impact and put meaningful pressure on Israel, then they have to go beyond just recognizing a vague, demilitarized Palestinian state. Their recognition of Palestine would be much more forceful if it is immediately coupled with coordinated sanctions on Israel, since it is violating another nation's sovereignty. There should also be fewer conditions that hamper Palestinians' right to self determination and stronger commitments to ensuring equal rights for Palestinians, whether they live in Israel, Palestine, or a future state that encompasses the whole territory.

The recent wave of states recognizing Palestine is doing little more than offering a gesture toward establishing two unequal states, with Israel continuing to have much more control and autonomy over territory than the Palestinians.

“So will the underlying dynamic between Israel and Palestine shift under this set up of recognition? No it won't,” Gurmendi Dunkelberg said. “The underlying problem of colonialism, the underlying problem of apartheid, the underlying problem of a supremacist ideology that sees Palestinians as an inconvenient people … that will still be there.”

Since these countries are not necessarily endorsing Palestinians' right to self-determination, several other factors might be at play in the recognition movement.

The first is geopolitics. Take the last time a major wave of states recognized Palestine in 2011. According to Gurmendi Dunkelberg, the move to recognize Palestine back then was a foreign policy maneuver by Latin American countries to create distance between them and the United States — Israel's biggest ally — on the world stage. “What can you do to signal to the United States, ‘I am angry at you' and ‘I am distancing myself from your foreign policy'?” he asked. “You recognize Palestine.”

Similarly, Gurmendi Dunkelberg argues, European countries now are angry with the Trump administration for reasons including tariffs, limited security guarantees, and its posture towards Ukraine. So, recognizing Palestine can send a similar message to the US that it is drifting away from its allies.

“I think this is a brazenly political move that has nothing to do with actual concern for [Palestinians],” Gurmendi Dunkelberg said.

The second factor is domestic politics. Throughout the Western world, major demonstrations have repeatedly cropped up over the last two years, protesting Israel's war in Gaza. There's also a growing movement of voters looking for leaders who aren't afraid to take a strong moral stance on this issue. Just as Zohran Mamdani worried establishment Democrats after winning the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City despite his pro-Palestinian views, politicians in Europe are also afraid of potential backlash for supporting Israel as it continues to turn every last corner of Gaza into rubble. So, making a largely symbolic gesture like recognizing a Palestinian state allows these governments to say they've been harsher on Israel without actually doing much to stop the ongoing bloodshed.

Ultimately, these recognitions from Western states can be viewed as a sign of some incremental progress. But they aren't, on their own, going to deliver meaningful change. Without any follow through, all that these recognitions signal is a complacency with the status quo, allowing the occupation to go on with no real end in sight.

Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are placing big, divergent bets on the future of meat. Who will win?

Beyond Meat is undergoing a makeover.

Last month, the popular plant-based meat company announced a new product — Beyond Ground — that, unlike its signature plant-based burger, sausage links, and chicken nuggets, isn't meant to directly imitate meat. Instead, it has a neutral flavor that “serves as a blank canvas,” according to the company, for customers to season however they like.

Beyond Ground contains only four ingredients — fava beans, potato protein, water, and psyllium husk — and has a macronutrient profile similar to chicken (high in protein, low in fat). It's an “effort to step outside of the confines of mimicking a particular species and just provide something that is capable of confidently standing on its own as a center-of-the-plate protein,” Ethan Brown, Beyond Meat's founder and CEO, told me.

The product represents an attempt to meet our current cultural moment, in which wellness has moved beyond mere exercise and nutrition optimization to broader, and dubious, appeals to “natural” living — think the rise of raw milk, the Make America Healthy Again movement, regenerative farming, and homesteading influencers. There's a reason Beyond's advertisements have increasingly featured the bean farmers who supply its ingredients.

“There's this desire to connect back to something authentic…something simpler,” Brown said. “Being a facsimile in that moment is challenging.”

To that end, the company is also shedding “meat” from its name to become, simply, Beyond.

The recent moves follow similar changes the company made last year, like when it launched the Sun Sausage — a product that's closer to an old-school veggie dog than a high-tech meat imitation — and reformulated its burger to contain less sodium and saturated fat with a simpler and cleaner ingredient list.

The makeover is a “direct reaction,” Brown said, to the many attacks the plant-based meat industry has weathered over the last five years, namely that its products are overly processed and unhealthy (attacks that I would argue are largely inaccurate and unfair). Moving forward, the industry's success, he said, will depend on making products with “really strong macronutrient content and ratios and then really simple, clean ingredients.”

Meanwhile, Impossible Foods — one of Beyond's main competitors — has taken a decidedly different tack.

Over the last couple years, Impossible Foods changed its green packaging to a “bold red” design in what it called a “meatier brand identity,” launched an “indulgent” burger (higher in calories, fat, sodium, and protein), recruited the world's top competitive hot dog eater as a spokesperson, and is considering making a “blended” burger composed of half cattle beef, half plant-based beef. It has also stuck by its key ingredient, soy leghemoglobin, which replicates the heme — an iron-rich molecule — found in beef and is made with genetically engineered yeast to give its burgers an especially meaty flavor.

Call it a tale of two plant-based meat companies.

Both Impossible and Beyond are placing bets on what will retain current customers and attract new ones to the stagnant industry. But the stakes are much higher than just increasing quarterly sales or annual revenue: Plant-based products hold potential to help Americans move away from their high levels of meat consumption, which annually condemns billions of animals to terrible suffering  and fuels environmental crises. How these bets shake out will shape the future of meat, and of our planet.

From the mid-2010s through around 2020, plant-based upstarts like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods revitalized the meat-free food sector with products that tasted much more like meat than veggie burgers of the past. Sales of plant-based meat accelerated, and it was widely perceived as a sustainable, humane, and healthy alternative to conventional meat. That this newer generation of products were developed with advanced food technology was often a selling point.

Then came the backlash. Meat industry interests, progressive foodies, social media influencers, conspiracy theorists, and food researchers slammed plant-based meat as fake, high-tech, ultra-processed, and unhealthy. Sales have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, though these attacks have proven less effective in many European countries, where sales are still growing.

It's not controversial to say that Americans would benefit from cutting back on highly processed foods, especially snacks and beverages loaded with added salt and sugar. But the classification system used to determine which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't casts such a wide net that many foods that are more or less healthy get caught in it. One of those foods is plant-based meat.

Compared to conventional animal meat, plant-based meats tend to have similar protein levels, less saturated fat, and fewer calories. They also contain zero cholesterol and offer some fiber, whereas meat does not. “These foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini of the Physicians Association for Nutrition recently told CNN.

Plus, the vast majority of the US meat supply comes from factory farms, which are anything but natural, minimally processed, or the pinnacle of health. Each year, billions of genetically manipulated animals are confined indoors, fed unnatural diets of genetically modified corn and soy, given a chemical cocktail of antibiotics and vaccines to stay alive, and after slaughter, their carcasses are doused with chemical disinfectants.

But consumers hold plant-based meat to a different standard. Operating in that cultural reality, it makes sense for Beyond to address its criticisms head-on by reformulating its existing products and launching new ones. But will it work?

Beyond's bet largely rests on the idea that a significant share of the US population is seeking to meaningfully cut processed foods from their diets. The company is right, in part: Polls show that many consumers aspire to eat a more minimally processed diet. But most don't act on that aspiration, and many hold more nuanced views on processed foods than the loudest voices on social media.

A recent consumer survey from Purdue University agricultural researchers found that most Americans say they're concerned about processed and ultra-processed foods, but most also believe that they can be part of a healthy diet and value many of their traits: affordability, taste, shelf life, and most of all, their capacity to save them time in the kitchen.

What's far more important to consumers than perceived health properties, according to Impossible Foods, is taste.

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

“Taste is absolutely the #1 purchase driver for consumers considering plant-based meat,” an Impossible Foods spokesperson wrote in an email to Vox. “They're specifically looking for products that most closely resemble conventional meat. In fact, industry data shows that 9 of the top 10 most purchased plant-based burgers in grocery stores are of the ‘meaty' variety rather than the ‘veggie' variety, which is right where our products play.”

The meaty approach appears to be working for the company. In a recent blind taste test, many consumers rated several Impossible Meat products as better than or equal to animal meat.

“Even during the category's downturn, we've maintained a strong position,” the Impossible spokesperson wrote. The company hasn't disclosed its revenue, but according to the market research firm Circana, last year Impossible knocked Beyond Meat out of the No. 2 spot for US plant-based meat retail sales (50-year-old MorningStar Farms, owned by food giant Kellanova — formerly Kellogg's — is in first place). More recent data shows the two companies are almost tied for US retail sales, with Impossible slightly ahead.

And yet. It would be a great understatement to say that despite Impossible Foods' impressive standing in blind taste tests and supermarket sales, it hasn't come anywhere within striking distance of its ambition to take over the meat market by 2035, a goal its founder once said was doable. Plant-based meat retail sales have stalled out at around 1 percent of overall US meat sales.

A decade of whiplash, from meteoric rise to slow decline, has left plant-based meat firms trapped: damned if they do, and damned if they don't. They're damned if they do a great job of imitating meat with plants, which requires more food processing and ingredients than the vegetarian products of the 1990s, but puts these newer products at risk of unfair health critiques. (Meanwhile, the protein bar company David and the high-protein milk brand Fairlife, each of whose products are highly processed with ingredients unrecognizable to the average person, are printing money and largely evading criticism.)

But plant-based meat companies are also damned if they don't try to imitate meat, risking being relegated to the “for vegetarians only” category of healthier but less appetizing protein offerings.

“The tension is real,” Chris Dubois, an executive vice president at Circana, told me. Beyond Meat, he said, has done a great job listening to its customers and reformulating its products to meet the demand for simpler ingredient lists, but “the hard part is, I don't know that that's the path to win long-term.”

The animal meat industry has benefited from more than a century of generous government subsidies and favorable policy regimes, while the plant-based meat industry has not, which has created a large price gap between the two. Closing that price gap, Dubois said, could help plant-based meat “creep into people's purchases more.” That might become possible this year, as beef and chicken prices are on the rise. Making plant-based meat products more convenient by, say, having different varieties that are pre-seasoned and easy to cook, should help too, Dubois said.

I think he's right on all of these fronts. But ultimately, as I've written about before, plant-based meat faces challenges that are harder to pin down, but are likely more consequential than price, taste, convenience, and macronutrient profiles. Food choices are highly influenced by familiarity, gender, and conformity with social norms and beliefs (one of those being that meat, even if factory-farmed, is natural and nutritionally necessary).

In a country where extremely popular meat products like chicken nuggets and hot dogs are highly processed, it's hard to believe that “processing” is really plant-based meat's problem in the eyes of many consumers, rather than a convenient justification for maintaining the status quo. As demonstrated by a number of psychological studies, many people go to great lengths to justify high levels of meat consumption.

Making products that are delicious, widely available, easy to cook, and as close as possible in price to animal meat are just the minimum bar plant-based meat companies must meet. Beyond, Impossible, and some of their peers have made strides on all these fronts over the past decade. But to really put a dent in meat sales, they — and their allies in the animal protection, public health, and environmental sustainability movements — will need to redeem plant-based meat in consumers' eyes and clarify what they really are: moderately processed foods with similar or better nutrition to conventional meat, and with a far lighter environmental footprint that doesn't require the confinement and slaughter of animals.

It's hard to break through all the noise with a message as nuanced as that. But in some countries, it's managed to work. I hope it can work here too.

xAI is losing one of its cofounders.

Igor Babuschkin, who founded xAI alongside Elon Musk in 2023, said he's leaving the artificial intelligence startup.

In a farewell post on X on Wednesday, Babuschkin wrote that he's leaving xAI to start Babuschkin Ventures. It will focus on AI safety research and startups developing AI and agentic systems that can ""advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.""

In his post, Babuschkin recounted his journey from a CERN particle physics Ph.D. student to helping Musk build xAI from scratch.

Babuschkin said he learned two major lessons from Musk.

""I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,"" he wrote.

The early days were grueling, Babuschkin said.

""Naysayers told us that we arrived too late to the game, so starting a top AI company from scratch would be impossible,"" he wrote.

But ""xAI executes at ludicrous speed,"" he wrote.

The team built the Memphis supercomputer cluster in just 122 days, despite industry veterans saying it was impossible.

One defining memory came late at night near the project's deadline, when ""mysterious issues"" hit the training setup.

Musk flew to the data center himself, working alongside the team until the problem was fixed.

""When the training run finally worked, Elon posted our triumph at '4:20am' causing us to laugh out loud,"" wrote Babuschkin.

The moment reflected both the intensity of the work and the camaraderie that kept the team pushing through long nights.

""I will never forget the rush of adrenaline that night, and the emotional bonds that we were all in this together. We went to bed feeling like we were living through the most exhilarating time of our lives,"" he wrote.

Musk thanked Babuschkin in a follow-up post on X: ""We wouldn't be here without you.""

Before his two and a half year run at xAI, Babuschkin worked for DeepMind and OpenAI. He is a graduate of Technical University of Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany, his LinkedIn show. 

xAI, Babuschkin, and Musk did not immediately respond to a request from Business Insider for comment sent outside regular business hours.

There's one word that strikes terror in the heart of a creative working on a MrBeast video: ""cringe.""

If the world's top YouTuber calls a video or idea ""cringe,"" it's likely dead in its tracks.

MrBeast knows better than anyone what might spark a backlash among his millions of fans, a former staffer said. ""If he doesn't buy into it, it's not going to work,"" they said.

MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is known for turning YouTube videos into eye-popping spectacles. The 27-year-old creator has buried himself alive, put hundreds of contestants through endurance challenges, and sent a train barreling into a giant pit as an ""experiment,"" all in the name of viral content. With over 400 million subscribers on his main channel, $473 million in revenue last year across his businesses, and a reality show on Amazon Prime Video, Donaldson is in a league of his own.

So, what does it take to make a MrBeast video — many of which are filmed in Donaldson's hometown of Greenville, North Carolina? To find out, BI interviewed nine former MrBeast workers and reviewed an internal production guidebook created a few years ago as the YouTuber's team began expanding. The creatives spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak about the company.

What emerged was a portrait of a large-scale content operation that, in many ways, mirrors traditional Hollywood productions — only faster-paced and occasionally more chaotic. Donaldson rejects the notion of being an old-school studio head, and he has eschewed ideas rooted in legacy media. One example: The company previously referred to workers on MrBeast sets as ""friends of friends"" rather than production assistants. In other ways, his creative instincts align with more traditional Hollywood leaders. Even after investing thousands into a video, for instance, Donaldson will sometimes kill a project if it doesn't meet his quality standards — much like major studios like Warner Bros. Discovery.

For creatives who make the journey out to Greenville, MrBeast offers competitive pay and an opportunity to move fast and break things.

""You'll see a lot of former film and TV people dropping everything in their lives in order to move out to Greenville,"" the former staffer said.

Here's BI's breakdown of what goes into making a MrBeast video, from start to finish:

MrBeast takes brainstorming seriously. The creator, who employed about 350 people as of April, has a dedicated ideation team tasked with building a pipeline of potential video ideas.

The ideation team starts by conceptualizing a video title and thumbnail. They cast a wide net and scour YouTube for trending topics and keywords to identify buzzy concepts.

The team sketches out ideas and logs them in a database, then pitches the best ones to Donaldson and a team of creative leads. Hundreds of ideas are logged, but most never make it past this phase.

Another former staffer described the ideation team as a content lab.

""If you come up with enough ideas, you're going to get those winning ones that are perfect for a viral engine,"" they said.

This approach is similar to Hollywood's traditional development process, said Paul Hardart, director of the entertainment, media, and technology program at NYU's Stern business school.

""That's sort of the top of the funnel,"" Hardart said. ""Writers and talent go and pitch ideas to network executives.""

If Donaldson greenlights an idea, it's handed to a group of creative producers for cost and feasibility planning. The company recently added a team dedicated to calculating feasibility, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider.

If the idea is too ambitious to execute, like a scheme to send MrBeast to space, it might get scrapped or put on the back burner. But creatives are careful not to kill an exciting idea prematurely. While staff members at Beast Industries — MrBeast's company — may fear the word ""cringe,"" Donaldson has his own dreaded word: ""no."" The boss does not like to be told that something can't happen.

""Don't just stop because one person told you no, stop when all conceivable options are exhausted,"" Donaldson wrote in his production guide.

""'No' was the bad word,"" the second former staffer said. ""You try to save your 'no's.'""

If an idea is greenlit and assigned a budget, a producer — or group of producers — is enlisted to manage the project and ensure tasks like building a set and casting aligns with the initial creative vision.

At any given moment, MrBeast has multiple production teams working on different videos, labeled by letters: Team A, Team B, and so on. Depending on the complexity of the project and the number of segments involved, each video can staff anywhere from one to a dozen or more producers.

Those producers wear many hats. They maintain timelines and deadlines for all relevant departments, negotiate with contractors, work with camera, lighting, and audio teams, and ensure compliance with on-set protocols, among other duties. ""At Beast, you have to be responsible for everything,"" a third former staffer said.

This is typical of YouTube productions, whereas legacy media producers are often more specialized.

""YouTube producers are probably more Swiss Army knives, but in TV, they're more scalpels,"" said Daniel Rosenberg, a writer and producer who cofounded the branded entertainment firm Piro.

When building his business, Donaldson and the MrBeast team often came up with their own terms for production roles.

""This is not Hollywood and I do not want to be Hollywood,"" Donaldson wrote in his production guide.

The company has a consistent team of workers who build sets, as well as a flurry of production assistants who initially were referred to as ""friends of friends"" because they were often locals with connections to MrBeast staffers. Friends of friends work on a variety of tasks, from on-set assistance to picking up producers from the Raleigh airport. They're now part of a team referred to as the ""task force.""

Creative staffers have been referred to as junior Tyler (or mini Tyler), referring to a worker who worked under creative lead Tyler Conklin, three former staffers said.

Depending on the production, a MrBeast video could feature hundreds of cameras on set, capturing a variety of angles (and individual contestants if it's a challenge where they are facing off against each other). Lengthy video challenges in a nuclear bunker or grocery store would require lots of cameras to film every moment. The camera setup includes DSLRs held by camera operators and strategically placed GoPros.

""If you're doing a video with 100 contestants, you need at least 100 cameras,"" the third former staffer said. ""For a really long challenge, there's a ton of angles. Jimmy is very big on quantity over quality for filming to make sure nothing is missed if anything happens.""

By the time Donaldson and other on-camera talent arrive, most of the logistical heavy lifting is already done — which makes it all the more painful for producers if he pulls the plug at that point, deciding the video is no longer a channel fit. The process of determining a fit involves others, as well, a source familiar with the matter told BI. Donaldson listens to feedback from a range of people and considers factors like budget, virality, and the company's quality standards when determining which projects move forward, they said.

Traditional media productions may similarly throw away work if they feel like it isn't up to par, Hardart said, pointing to the decision to reshoot the Game of Thrones pilot episode.

Some of MrBeast's videos involve 100-day challenges, with cameras rolling all day and night. That produces a lot of footage.

A single video generally enlists up to eight editors, with a few staffers handling daily footage cuts, four or five syncing footage and selecting the best parts of what was filmed, and a couple of lead editors compiling everything.

For videos shot over a longer timeframe, edits are managed in real time.

""If they shoot a video for a week, by the time they get home or leave that island, they already have a very rough cut that someone is doing in real time,"" a fourth former employee said.

With editing, the MrBeast team is very focused on how a video will retain viewership on YouTube, known as retention editing.

""He has very specific editing requirements for his editors, not just how much you get done or how fast, but how many seconds into a video are you showing the super funny thing that happens,"" a fifth former staffer said.

Donaldson laid out this approach in his production guide, highlighting the importance of using YouTube analytics to identify the exact second when viewership drops off and telling workers that they ""must always know what minute mark the content you are working on is.""

""Oftentimes the real storytelling happens in post"" production, Hardart said of a traditional Hollywood production. ""You can do so much in editing to shape a story.""

After a MrBeast video has a final cut that makes it to YouTube, it's formatted for multiple languages, put through thumbnail A/B testing, and carefully monitored for viewer retention and performance. It may also be cut for shorter videos on TikTok or YouTube shorts or edited down for age-appropriate content so it can appear on YouTube Kids. MrBeast generally releases one to two longform videos monthly on his main channel, as well as a few videos on other channels focused on gaming or philanthropy. The creator also has a team dedicated to making shorter videos for vertical platforms like TikTok or YouTube shorts.

Donaldson wrote in his production guide that ""the cool thing"" about YouTube is that the platform gives ""super detailed graphs for every video that show the exact second we lose a viewer on every single video.""

From setting up a team focused fully on ideas, to dissecting viewership data to plan his video strategy, Donaldson has laid out the blueprint for building a YouTube empire.

""I feel like in this day and age, so many content creators are trying to be him,"" the first former staffer said. ""But he will always be MrBeast. He has access to things that no one else does.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Taylor Swift's new album 'The Life of a Showgirl' is coming this fall — here's everything we know","https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-album-release-tracklist-details-2025-8","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:56:01 GMT","

Taylor Swift fans rejoice: The chart-topping pop star, who's been largely avoiding the spotlight since concluding the Eras Tour last December, has officially set another new era in motion.

Swift announced Tuesday that her 12th studio album is titled ""The Life of a Showgirl."" She made the big reveal in a teaser for her appearance on ""New Heights,"" the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce.

When the full episode premiered on Wednesday, Swift simultaneously revealed the album cover, tracklist, and release date — October 3 — on social media.

During the episode itself, Swift also shared more details about the album's aesthetic, explaining how the cover art was inspired by her behind-the-scenes experience of the Eras Tour.

""My day ends with me in a bathtub, not usually in a bedazzled dress,"" she said on ""New Heights."" ""I wanted to glamorize all the different aspects of how the tour felt.""

""The reason I wanted to have an offstage moment as the main album cover is because the album isn't really about what happened to me onstage, but what I was going through offstage.""

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

The singer's most attentive followers, aka ""Swifties,"" are constantly keeping an eye out for Easter eggs and hints of new music — but speculation ramped up earlier this week when Taylor Nation, the social media arm of Swift's PR team, shared a collection of 12 photos from the Eras Tour, all of Swift wearing different shades of orange.

The caption said, ""Thinking about when she said 'See you next era…'"" with a burning-heart emoji.

Even casual observers of Swift may recognize her custom of color-coding album cycles. Each color usually corresponds with the album's artwork and, in some cases, its lyrics and themes.

Such was the case for 2012's ""Red,"" named for the color Swift associates with passionate, reckless love affairs, and 2017's ""Reputation,"" an album whose black-and-white aesthetic was partially intended to evoke newsprint. Orange had yet to be associated with any other album in Swift's catalog.

Later that day, Swift's official website was updated with a countdown to 12:12 a.m. on Tuesday, August 12, set against a sparkly orange backdrop. (The numeric repetition is another of Swift's calling cards.)

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)

""The Life of a Showgirl"" will be Swift's first new album since announcing that she bought back her masters, giving her complete ownership of her musical catalog and effectively rendering her ""Taylor's Version"" project moot. Before the purchase was made public in May, Swifties had been eagerly anticipating the rerecorded version of ""Reputation,"" her fan-favorite sixth album — though Swift has since confessed she has no imminent plans to release it.

""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it,"" Swift wrote in an open letter to fans. She added that she did finish rerecording her self-titled debut album — the only other missing entry in the ""Taylor's Version"" series — though she didn't clarify when it might come to light.

""Those two albums can still have their moments to reemerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about,"" she wrote. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.""

Instead, Swifties will soon get a batch of fresh tracks from the prolific songwriter. ""The Life of a Showgirl"" is the follow-up to 2024's ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" a colossal double album that topped the Billboard 200 chart for 17 weeks — the longest reign of Swift's career thus far — and spawned the No. 1 hit single ""Fortnight.""

In the final photo that Taylor Nation shared on Monday, Swift is singing onstage with Sabrina Carpenter, her fan-turned-protégé and Eras Tour opener.

Swifties took her inclusion as a clue that Carpenter is featured on ""The Life of a Showgirl"" — a theory that was proven correct when Swift shared the official tracklist. The album's closer and titular track is a duet with Carpenter.

Other song titles include ""The Fate of Ophelia,"" possibly a reference to the tragic heroine in Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" and ""Elizabeth Taylor,"" named after the famous '50s movie star.

Among many other literary references, Swift has included nods to both Shakespeare and Elizabeth Taylor in past songs; one of her most famous hits, 2008's ""Love Story,"" is an optimistic twist on ""Romeo + Juliet."" Meanwhile, Elizabeth Taylor is name-dropped in the 2017 single ""…Ready For It?""

Also notable: Track 10 on ""The Life of a Showgirl"" is titled ""Cancelled!"" and stylized in all caps. Swift ruminated on the psychological effects of ""cancel culture"" throughout ""Reputation,"" as well as the standout track ""Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?"" from ""The Tortured Poets Department.""

Though he is famously private and media-averse, Max Martin is known as one of the music industry's most iconic hitmakers, dating back to '90s hits like ""I Want You Back"" by *NSYNC, ""I Want It That Way"" by the Backstreet Boys, and ""...Baby One More Time"" by Britney Spears.

Martin began working with Shellback, a fellow Swede, in the mid-aughts. Together, they co-produced the biggest hits from Swift's fan-favorite album ""Red"" (""22,"" ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"" and ""I Knew You Were Trouble"") and much of her subsequent pair of pop blockbusters, ""1989"" and ""Reputation.""

During the episode of ""New Heights,"" Swift described Martin as her ""mentor"" and said he and Shellback helped make some of her favorite songs in her discography, including ""Shake It Off,"" ""Blank Space,"" ""Style,"" and ""Delicate.""

""We've never actually made an album before where it's just the three of us. There's no other collaborators. It's just the three of us making a focused album,"" she explained. ""It felt like catching lightning in a bottle.""

As one might suspect from the duo's participation, Swift confirmed that she considers ""The Life of a Showgirl"" to be full of ""bangers"" and ""melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it.""

""I essentially said to him, I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour, and for the same reasons,"" Swift said of Martin. She even said she would fly to Sweden in between shows to work on music with him.

""This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. It just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life,"" she continued. ""And so that effervescence has come through on this record.""

For her previous two albums, Swift surprise-released another set of songs just a few hours after they each dropped, dubbed ""Midnights (3am Edition)"" and ""The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,"" respectively.

In the latter's case, this nearly doubled the length of ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" making it her bulkiest album to date with 31 songs — a decision that drew plenty of criticism.

Fans had already begun speculating that Swift was planning a similar surprise for ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" but she has denied that's the case.

""With 'Tortured Poets Department,' I was like, 'Here's a data dump of everything I thought, felt, and experienced in two or three years. Here's 31 songs.' This is 12. There's not a 13th, there's not other ones coming,"" Swift said on ""New Heights.""

""This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,"" she added. ""Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons, you know, and you couldn't take one out, and it'd be the same album. You couldn't add one. It's just right.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","America is barrelling toward a 'deflationary shock' as 3 forces hit consumer demand, a top economist says","https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-inflation-outlook-deflation-shock-tariffs-immigration-spending-rosenberg-2025-8","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:17:00 GMT","

Inflation-weary consumers would be forgiven for thinking falling prices are a good thing, but that's not necessarily the case. Disinflation is usually welcomed news, but deflation signals something more dire is going on in the economy. 

And deflation is exactly what may be in store for the US, according to one top economist. 

David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, thinks that America could be headed toward a ""deflationary shock,"" a situation where prices decline rather than merely increase at a slower pace. 

While consumers might perk up at the idea of lower prices, deflation is often thought to be a more difficult problem for policymakers to solve than high inflation. The Fed can raise interest rates to combat higher prices, but, in the case of deflation, central bankers can only lower interest rates until they hit 0% before needing to turn to other options to boost the economy.

That's one reason why countries like Japan and China, which have been slammed with deflation crises in the past, have seen their economists mired in long periods of anemic growth in the years that followed. 

The US could be facing a similar fate, Rosenberg said, adding that he believed America was ""following the footsteps"" of those two nations in particular.

""We are now staring down the barrel of a deflationary shock, and it amazes me how all the bond bears, inflation-phobes, and Fed policy hawks are missing this secular shift as they continue to play by the old rules,"" Rosenberg wrote in a report on Wednesday.

He sees three reasons the US is headed for an era of deflation.

Tariffs are thought by economists to be inflationary, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties by raising prices for consumers.

But there's also a deflationary aspect to tariffs: Higher prices cause consumers to spend less, which could lower prices as demand falls relative to supply, Rosenberg said.

There are already signs that consumers are beginning to tighten their belts. While inflation rose to 2.7% in July, retail sales have been pretty weak, growing 0.6% in June after a 0.9% contraction in May, according to US Census Bureau data. July is expected to show retail sales grew 0.5%. 

""GDP is, after all, only about spending,"" Rosenberg said, referring to how consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of GDP growth in the US.

Slower spending among Americans could collide with the near-term impact of President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Reduced immigration is likely to result in less consumer spending, another factor that will lower prices and hurt economic growth, Rosenberg said.

Immigration flows have already started to drop, with new entrance visas to the US plunging 20.5% in May, he said.

Meanwhile, Rosenberg added that most immigrants in the US are between the ages of 35 and 54, the age range where spending tends to peak in a lifecycle.

""In the final analysis, the demand destruction coming from the trade file, along with lower growth in future spending due to a reduced immigrant consumer base, should lead to lower inflation,"" he wrote.

""Every young immigrant household not allowed into the US accelerates the aging consumption cliff that lies around the bend,"" Rosenberg added.

Those factors are exacerbated by the fact that America's population is rapidly growing older, and people aren't having as many kids as they used to.

According to the latest projections from the US Census, the number of Americans 65 and older is expected to soar to 82 million by 2050, up 47% from 2022 levels.

An aging population can hit economic growth, given that older Americans tend to save more than they spend. The change in someone's likelihood to consume drops from 0.94 at age 35 to around 0.67 at age 65, per Rosenberg's analysis.

""The fact that this is happening in such a highly leveraged economy is only going to exacerbate the deflationary trendline in the not-too-distant future,"" Rosenberg said, referring to high debt levels in the US that could limit the government's ability to spend on other things to stimulate the economy. 

Rosenberg, who's known as a contrarian on Wall Street, has made a lot of bearish calls about the US economy in recent years. Earlier in this year, he said he still believes the US was headed for a recession, and speculated that a downturn could materialize as soon as mid-summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Taylor Swift has been saving up to buy her music masters since she was a teenager","https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-started-saving-teenager-to-buy-music-masters-2025-8","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:30:00 GMT","

How did Taylor Swift close one of the biggest deals of her career? With help from her mom and little brother.

Swift gave a behind-the-scenes look at how she was able to buy back her music masters during an episode of ""New Heights,"" the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce.

The episode aired on Wednesday and had over 1.3 million viewers on YouTube as of this writing.

Swift, who bought her masters earlier this year for a reported $360 million, said she'd been saving for that moment since she was a teenager.

""It's always been a huge thing for me. Since I was a teenager, I've been actively saving up money to buy my music back and to ever own it in the first place because it's usually the label that owns it,"" she said. ""I've always wanted this to happen.""

Swift said she signed a record deal when she was 15 and that typically, such deals are set up so the artist does not own their master recordings: ""Owning your master records means that you have complete control and power over distribution, licensing, and essentially the way your legacy is shaped,"" she said.

The masters for Swift's first six albums had several owners over the years, including Big Machine Records and Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. She said the first time they were sold, it ""really ripped my heart out of my chest.""

""I thought about not owning my music every day. It was like an intrusive thought that I had every day,"" she said.

That motivated her to rerecord the albums, releasing them one at a time with the appended title of ""Taylor's Version."" She released four of the rerecorded albums before buying back her masters this year. 

The rereleases were a huge success for Swift. They were praised by critics and loved by fans, garnering more streams than the original versions.

After the Eras Tour, Swift said her team thought it might be a good time to approach the then-owners of her masters, a private equity firm called Shamrock Capital, to see if she could buy her music outright.

""I don't want to be in a partnership. I don't want to own 30% of it. I want to own all of it,"" she said. ""But it was a long shot to think that they would do that — that they would sell that asset to me.""

Swift said she wanted to approach the purchase from a personal place because it was more than a business transaction to her. So rather than sending a team of lawyers or managers, Swift said she sent her mom and brother, who she said she also works with, to meet with Shamrock Capital. 

""They told them the whole story — of all the times we've tried to buy it, all the times it's fallen through, all the times we had gotten plans together and figured out something we thought was going to work and it didn't at the last minute,"" she said.

Eventually, some time after the meeting and a couple of months after the Super Bowl, Swift said she got the call from her mom.

""She's like, 'You got your music.' And I just very dramatically hit the floor, for real,"" Swift said. ""Like, honestly, just started bawling my eyes out, and I'm just like weeping.""

""This changed my life. I can't believe it still,"" she added.

Swift announced her coming album, ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" in a preview clip from the podcast that was shared shortly after midnight on Tuesday.

The man facing a felony federal assault charge for allegedly chucking a Subway sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in Washington, D.C., was an employee at the Department of Justice, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday.

The man, identified in court documents as Sean Charles Dunn, has been fired, she said.

Dunn worked in the DOJ criminal division's international affairs section.

""I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER,"" Bondi said in an X post.

""This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,"" she added.

""You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""

A video of the incident, which occurred Sunday night in Washington's Northwest section, shows an agitated man in a pink polo shirt and light shorts speaking to a small group of agents on a sidewalk, while holding a wrapped Subway sandwich in one hand.

He then winds up and hurls the sandwich into the chest of the officer nearest to him before sprinting away while at least three officers give chase, the 32-second clip posted by FBI Director Kash Patel shows.

Dunn was arrested Wednesday night, Patel said.

A statement of facts from a police detective says that Dunn was apprehended after attempting to flee the scene.

While being processed by the Metropolitan Police Department, Dunn said, ""I did it. I threw a sandwich,"" according to the detective.

In this article

General Motors on Thursday unveiled the Cadillac Elevated Velocity, a new concept car aimed at building up the brand's all-electric luxury crossover segment.

The electric concept car has a ""lifted yet elegant design,"" according to Cadillac, riding on 24-inch wheels. It includes multiple driving modes to enhance the electric vehicle's performance, the company said.

""The word 'elevate' serves a dual meaning – it is a reference to the lifted chassis that enables high-speed off-road capabilities, but it also refers to an elevated luxury experience,"" said Alexandra Dymowska, Cadillac senior brand designer, in a media release.

The vehicle, which is a running showcar but does not have full performance capabilities, builds on Cadillac's luxury EV portfolio, which already includes the Lyriq and the Optiq.

Automakers regularly use concept vehicles to gauge customer interest or show the future direction of a vehicle or brand, but they're not meant to be sold to consumers.

The car continues the design principles of Cadillac's ""Opulent Velocity"" concept car, which the company revealed in 2024, said Bryan Nesbitt, vice president of GM global design, in a media statement.

GM initially set a goal to exclusively offer EVs by 2035, but has since said that consumer demand, which has been slower than expected, will dictate its EV plans. Its luxury Cadillac brand set a separate goal to be all-electric by 2030, but more recently said it will offer a full lineup of EVs as well as gas-powered cars.

Cadillac has been going through a revival effort in recent years, considering that luxury cars offer higher profit margins and attract a more affluent consumer than traditional vehicles.

During a call with reporters last month, Cadillac Vice President John Roth said the brand saw its best first half in nearly 20 years. He touted that Cadillac was the bestselling luxury EV brand in the second quarter of 2025, No. 2 in calendar year-to-date terms and fifth for overall EV sales.

The concept car offers multiple user experience modes. When entering the car, ""welcome mode"" involves the gull-wing doors lifting skyward and parts of the interior lighting up.

When the driver engages ""elevate mode,"" the car becomes autonomous and the interior transforms into a ""recovery space,"" where the pedals and steering wheel retract, ambient lighting changes and a light above the steering column aids the driver in breathwork to help occupants get in the ""headspace for performance,"" according to Cadillac.

The elevate mode also triggers interior cabin filtration, fragrance, red light therapy and climatization to account for changes in air temperature and quality.

""Velocity mode,"" meanwhile, features cool white lighting to ""evoke a sense of exhilaration"" and floor lighting dims to help the driver focus on the road.

The concept car also includes different drive modes for on-road and off-road performance and improved visibility when driving in dusty or sandy conditions.

Cadillac said its exterior color is inspired by glacier ice, contrasted against the car's red interior.

The cabin includes red leather on the seat cushions and the cabin and cargo floor, while a red fabric covers the seat uppers, armrests and instrument panel.

Clair Sapilewski has dozens of rolls of camera film ready to use in her cupboard at all times.

A photography major at American University, the 21-year-old said she always keeps her film stocked to achieve that aesthetic that only film cameras can capture.

""It teaches you how to slow down, how to look at things more carefully and how to choose your shots more wisely,"" she said.

It's part of an ongoing trend as members of Generation Z have taken an interest in film cameras. Sapilewski said while her professors taught her the basics, she and her friends have used their film cameras to develop photos that their iPhones can't quite replicate.

And in her college circle, the most popular brand for camera film is Eastman Kodak, a company she calls a ""household name.""

""Pretty much everybody uses Kodak films — the average film user, when they reach for film, is going to reach for Kodak,"" Sapilewski said.

But on the other side of the lens, Kodak may be singing a different tune.

The 133-year-old photography company indicated in its second-quarter earnings report on Monday that its finances ""raise substantial doubt"" in its ability to continue operations as a going concern.

The company reported a net loss of $26 million, down 200% from net income of $26 million for the second quarter of 2024. Kodak also posted a 12% decrease in gross profit with millions in debt obligations.

""Kodak has debt coming due within 12 months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,"" the company wrote in a regulatory filing.

Shares of the company are down more than 15% year to date.

Kodak plans to terminate its retirement pension plan and a company spokesperson told CNBC that Kodak aims to use money that it will receive from the settlement to pay off its debts.

""Kodak is confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations,"" the spokesperson said.

This isn't the first time the company has faced struggles.

Founded in Rochester, New York, in the late 1800s, Kodak rode the wave of photography with a goal of simplifying the process for consumers. But as the era of digital technology took over, the company faced increasing struggles with staying relevant as cameras moved beyond film and disposables.

In the 2000s, the company tried to keep up with the growing trend of digital cameras but struggled, according to Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who said Kodak was ignoring concerns at the time about the evolving macroenvironment.

""Digital technology wasn't ready right away to cut sales of film — but common sense told us differently,"" Reitzes wrote in a March note. ""At the time, Kodak management told us that film would co-exist with digital cameras and more photos would be taken — and more would need to be printed by Kodak.""

Instead, Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012. It reemerged a year later in 2013 with four main business components: print, advanced materials and chemicals, motion picture, and consumer, which includes cameras and accessories.

In recent years, however, the retro camera trend has been seeing a resurgence.

In 2020, then-General Manager Ed Hurley told NBC News that Kodak made more than twice the number of film rolls in 2019 than it made in 2015.

And on last year's third-quarter earnings call, Kodak CEO Jim Continenza said the company was experiencing such high demand for film that it needed to upgrade its Rochester factory.

""Our film sales have increased,"" Continenza said at the time. ""As we continue to see our commitment and our customer commitment to film, still and motion picture, we are going to continue to invest in that space and continue with that growth.""

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cinema camera market size is fast growing and estimated to reach $535 million by 2032. The Global Wellness Institute named ""analog wellness"" — including pre-digital technology — its top trend for 2025.

That growth has been driven in large part by Gen Z, which has turned to old-school aesthetics in what's been a ""divorce"" from the hyperrealism of digital photography, according to Alex Cooke, the editor-in-chief of Fstoppers, a photography news site.

""I think there's this rebellion against digital perfection where film feels real in this kind of hyper-curated Instagram and TikTok world, where images are filtered and Facetuned and algorithm-tested,"" Cooke said.

For members of Gen Z, who grew up in the smartphone age, Cooke said this type of photography brings a ""nostalgia without lived experience,"" where younger people are romanticizing a slower culture and breaking the instant feedback loop.

The aesthetics of film are also at play, Cooke added, with the unique colors and grains capturing something a smartphone could not. Ironically, social media even feeds into amplifying the trend, he said.

Using film cameras and developing that film also plays into a Gen Z trend of digital minimalism, according to Digital Camera World U.S. Editor Hillary Grigonis.

As a professional photographer, Grigonis said she's seen Gen Z lean into the feeling of ""disconnecting"" when using film, which provides a more tangible photography experience than smartphones.

""Part of the rise in film photography among Gen Z is likely from that desire to disconnect and the craving for that retro aesthetic,"" Grigonis said, adding that she was surprised at Kodak's financial struggles given the overall rise in demand.

For 25-year-old Madison Stefanis, Kodak was her entry point into the camera world. A Gen Z herself, Stefanis created 35mm Co, a film camera company specifically aimed at making the photography style easy and accessible for her generation.

Stefanis said she's seen that younger people are leaning into the emotional connection created by the delayed gratification of waiting for photos to be developed, something that's become ""lost in the digital age.""

Because she's seen Gen Z driving the resurgence of film, Stefanis said she was ""shocked"" at Kodak's declaration about its ability to continue as a going concern.

""Gen Z are really craving something they can hold in their hands,"" she said. ""These days, at least for myself, most of my memories live either in my mind or in my phone, so I think having actual tangible, physical objects where we can store our keepsakes and those key moments feels really special to my generation.""

Don't mess with DJ D-Sol — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's stage name when he's rocking the clubs in his other life as a DJ.

U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon ""should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ.""

In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle.

 ""If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost,"" Mericle said.

Goldman, in fact, is not the only Wall Street bank putting forth this view.

UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that ""the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices,"" while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note that tariffs could ""add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred.""

Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. Recall how economists were all but certain a U.S. recession would happen in 2023 — only for the economy to grow 2.5% that year.

In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report

Economists agree that higher tariff inflation is coming. Despite Trump on Tuesday slamming Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer prices, the bank is standing by its research. Other Wall Street economists agree with its call.

Trump is considering 11 candidates for Fed chair. Among the list of potential nominees are Federal Reserve officials, a Bush administration economic advisor, Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder.

New records for U.S. stocks again. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite climbed Wednesday to close at fresh highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rising. Shares of Paramount Skydance popped 36.7%. However, Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Thursday.

xAI's co-founder Igor Babuschkin leaves. Babuschkin said he's starting a venture firm to support AI safety research and invest in startups. Musk wrote, in response, ""Thanks for helping build @xAI! We wouldn't be here without you.""

[PRO] The state of India's IT stocks after layoffs. Big Indian corporations, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, have either trimmed their workforce or hiring. Here's what analysts think of the sector's stocks in light of those job cuts.

In one of the world's most expensive cities, more workers are living paycheck to paycheck

The Singapore consumer's reputation for financial prudence and high savings is showing signs of strain. Dealing with rising costs and a pursuit of experiences and self-care are taking precedence over long-term financial planning, experts observed.

Some 60% of workers in Singapore were living paycheck to paycheck in 2024 — notably higher than regional peers such as China, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia, and above the Asia-Pacific average of 48%, a 2025 research from the payroll company ADP found.

India's wealthy may be emigrating, but they are keeping a firm grip on their real estate investments in the country and abroad, a choice that's fueling a property boom in the luxury market.

In a recent newsletter, I explored how wealthy Indians are seeking other residencies abroad for strategic reasons, rather than a permanent relocation. According to Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, CEO of Wrise Wealth Management Middle East, many of these high-net-worth individuals remain bullish on India and allocate around 80% of their investments domestically. A notable portion of this, he added, is going into real estate.

""Indians, by and large, have always had a cultural affinity for real estate,"" Himmat Singh, managing director of global luxury real estate agency Christie's International Real Estate, told me. ""Traditionally, post-independence, there were limited assets for people in India to invest in and only a small portion of investors played in the market.""

That legacy still shapes portfolios today, Singh said.

While definitions vary, individuals with a net-worth of 50 million to 250 million Indian rupees ($571,000 to $2,855,000) are typically considered high-net-worth, while those with more than 250 million Indian rupees are considered ultra-high-net-worth. Affluent individuals fall in the 10 million-50 million Indian rupees range.

For many, owning a property is a ""cornerstone of wealth strategy,"" Wrise's Sengupta said, adding that it serves as both a financial asset and lifestyle statement. Owning residences abroad, whether for rental income, personal stays, or commercial units in which they can operate their businesses, also provides a global footprint.

India's uber-rich — defined as the top 1% of Indian households, or individuals earning the top 40% of income — held on to $11.6 trillion or 59.1% of all assets held by Indian households, according to data from investment house Bernstein.

Of this, $7.1 trillion, or 61.2%, is parked in real estate and gold, the same report indicated.

""Rich and poor Indians have historically relied on physical assets,"" such as gold, land and real estate to park their savings, Manas Agarwal, vice president and analyst at Bernstein, said.

The lure of real estate lies in long-term appreciation. These benefits typically outweigh the higher costs and lower liquidity associated with the asset class, experts told me.

The capital appreciation on real estate has more than doubled in value over the last four years, and many have made ""a significant return,"" Christie's Singh observed.

The average wealthy Indian owns multiple types of real estate. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are becoming a popular instrument given their ability to ""generate more predictable yields without the operational burden of direct property ownership,"" Wrise's Sengupta said.

Residential and commercial properties are also popular. In the first quarter of 2025, housing prices in India rose 7.7% from the year before, outpacing the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Sales of luxury houses priced between 60 million and 500 million Indian rupees jumped 88% in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2024, while the number of launches for such apartments grew 40% from the year before, a report by real estate firm CBRE showed.

While prices vary across cities, $1 million can buy 99 square meters of prime property in Mumbai, data from Knight Frank's latest Wealth Report shows. By comparison, the same amount is worth 32 square meters in Singapore, 34 square meters in London and New York, 44 square meters in Shanghai and 78 square meters in Dubai.

Within India, the rich typically own single-family homes, or a self-contained residential building for their daily occupancy, in major metropolises like Delhi, Mumbai or Bengaluru. Such homes are typically in a gated community and can cost at least 200 million Indian rupees for a 2,500 square feet unit in some parts of Delhi, Singh said.

Beyond this, they also invest in ""palatial"" country homes spanning around 1 to 2.5 acres (43,560 to 108,900 square feet) located outside the city, Singh suggested. He named Alibaug, a coastal town that is a two-hour ferry ride away from Mumbai, and Chhatarpur, a town that is not too far from Delhi, as destinations with such homes.

Homes in India, Singh said, are increasingly held over a five to 10 year period following a change in India's income tax rules where only gains of 100 million Indian rupees are exempt from capital gains taxes. This, he added, has resulted in less speculative investing and is a good move for the long-term stability of India's property market.

For property investments outside India, the wealthy consider functionality and long term returns Singh observes.

Dubai is a popular location given its strong rental yield of 6% to 7% as more companies relocate or expand there, he said. Other popular destinations include Ras Al-Khaimah in the UAE, an up and coming city that is set to generate substantial near-term gains, Thailand's Phuket and Koh Samui, where Indians visit to relax and unwind, as well as London, where many head to out of familiarity,

But it's not just real estate. The analysts I spoke to said that India's wealthy are also investing in other assets.

They are now looking beyond physical assets to capital markets, given ""how strong they have been in the last few years,"" Bernstein's Agarwal said.

Private markets such as venture capital, private equity, and hedge funds have also emerged as a popular option with many wealthy individuals funding global start-ups to tap into the growth they will enjoy from increasing their total addressable market, Himanshu Kohli, co-founder of Indian multi-family office and private wealth manager at Client Associates, told me.

Cryptocurrency is also finding a place in portfolios, albeit at a small percentage of around 2%, as investors are betting on the bitcoin rally as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties, said Sengupta.

India's wealthy are also looking for opportunities outside the country.

""Ten years ago, wealthy Indians invested almost entirely at home. Today, it's India plus the world. India remains the growth engine, with capital flowing into companies, startups, and pre-IPO opportunities — but now, global investments in equities, private markets, and overseas property are built in early, not just at retirement,"" Sengupta noted.

CS Vigneshwar, president of India's Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, said the country's auto component manufacturers will explore markets in Asia and Europe in response to rising U.S. tariff risks.

 Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India, expected the government to announce measures to boost export-oriented sectors and reinforce its Make in India initiative.

Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Treasury Minister and Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman and chief economist, discussed his reaction to new tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration on India and much more.

Inflation in India slows to its lowest since 2017. The consumer price index for July came in at 1.55%, lower than the 1.76% estimated by a Reuters poll of economists. Food prices dropped 1.76%.

Indian IT companies have been trimming roles. Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Infosys have reportedly been laying off employees or slowing hiring in recent months. In light of that, should investors steer clear of those companies' stocks?

India and China are restarting flights. Air travel was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, and as bilateral relations deteriorated during a 2020 border dispute. The resumption of flights expected to boost not just tourism but cooperation in other areas between the two nations.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher Thursday after new U.S. data pointed to persistent wholesale inflation.

The 2-year Treasury yield climbed 6 basis points to 3.745%. The benchmark 10-year note yield added nearly 6 basis points to 4.295%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

The producer price index, a measure of wholesale U.S. inflation, climbed 0.9% in July on a month-over-month basis. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected PPI to increase by 0.2% month over month.

That report throws cold water on another inflation report that came out earlier in the week indicating some softening in consumer prices. The July consumer price index eased concerns that tariffs may be causing prices to increase rapidly.

Despite the higher inflation number, fed funds futures were still pricing in about 91% odds of a rate cut in September, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. This was only slightly lower from the day prior. The futures, however, did remove any chance of a half-point cut.

Those inflation readings come ahead of the Fed's annual gathering of the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming from Aug. 21-23, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed, which will influence future monetary policy decisions.

""Next week the Kansas City Fed are hosting their annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which has historically often been used for the Fed to signal policy shifts,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.

""It was last year that Chair Powell said that the 'time has come for policy to adjust,' just weeks before they cut rates for the first time since the pandemic. So all eyes will be on that conference for any fresh signals on the likelihood of rate cuts,"" they added.

Credit rating agency S&P Global upgraded India's long-term unsolicited sovereign credit ratings to ""BBB"" from ""BBB-"" on Thursday, citing economic resilience and sustained fiscal consolidation.

The agency had revised the outlook on India's rating in May last year to positive from stable on robust growth and improved quality of government expenditure.

""The upgrade of India reflects its buoyant economic growth, against the backdrop of an enhanced monetary policy environment that anchors inflationary expectations,"" the rating agency said in a statement. 

""Together with the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation and efforts to improve spending quality, we believe these factors have coalesced to benefit credit metrics,"" it added.

The Indian rupee strengthened to 87.58 against the dollar from 87.66, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 7 basis points to 6.38% soon after the announcement.

The rating agency also revised its transfer and convertibility assessment to 'A-' from 'BBB+', it said.

S&P may lower the country's ratings if it sees an erosion of political commitment to consolidate public finances, while downward pressure could also come from economic growth slowing materially on a structural basis such that it undermines fiscal sustainability, it said.

Ratings could be further raised if fiscal deficits narrow meaningfully such that the net change in general government debt falls below 6% of GDP on a  structural basis, it added.

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stock markets rose as investors' sentiment turned positive amid a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.5%. Regionally, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were up 0.8%. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 was higher by 0.1%.

Buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna reported AI-driven sales growth for the second quarter, enabling the company to generate revenues of $1 million per employee.

The Swedish company said it had 20% like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter, with total revenues coming in at $823 million for the period.

The firm also saw adjusted operating profits of $29 million, up significantly from the first quarter's $3 million.

""AI adoption continues to deliver significant, tangible results. As a result of this strategy, average revenue per employee reached $1.0m, up 46% [year on year in the second quarter],"" the company said in its quarterly report.

Klarna has aggressively leveraged AI to boost productivity performance. It has shed two in five jobs over the past two years as a result. ""This shift reflects the growing impact of AI and automation in eliminating manual, time-consuming work across Klarna,"" the company had said in its first-quarter results.

Industrial output in the euro zone saw a month-on-month decline of 1.3% in June, preliminary data from statistics agency Eurostat showed on Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a decline of 1%.

The decline, which marked a sharp downturn from the 1.1% monthly uptick in output seen in May, was driven by a slowdown in multiple countries, including Germany, and a fall in consumer goods production.

On a monthly basis, German industrial production was down by 2.3%, Eurostat's data showed.

""Looking ahead, we think industrial production and overall economic activity will grow at only a slow pace in the second half of the year and beyond,"" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note following the data release.

""There should be some boost from looser fiscal policy in Germany, but it will not be huge and nor is it likely to last very long.""

We're half an hour into Thursday's session, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 has so far gained 0.2%, with most sectors in positive territory.

The German DAX and France's CAC 40 are both around 0.3% higher, while London's FTSE 100 is down by 0.2%.

Danish brewer Carlsberg on Thursday reported slightly weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales on weaker volumes, but nevertheless raised its 2025 guidance towards the upper end.

The world's third-largest brewer posted revenues of 25.7 billion Danish kroner ($4 billion) in the three months to June 30, just shy of the 26.4 forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

Reported operating profit in the first half of the year meanwhile came in at 7.23 billion Danish kroner, also below the 7.35 billion Danish kroner forecast. Organic volume growth over the period dipped 1.7%, including from the company's recently exited San Miguel brand.

CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen cited a ""spending pause"" among consumers that he said was weighing on volume growth. ""The volumes do not flow in the way they did a couple of years ago,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The company nevertheless raised its full-year profit guidance to growth of between 3% to 5% — up from 1% to 5% previously — and flagged strength in its premium and alcohol-free brews.

Month on month, the U.K. economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, today's preliminary data showed.

George Brown, a senior economist at Schroders, said the slowdown reflected a drop in manufacturing following tariff frontloading in the first quarter.

""This drag should ease in the third quarter, even against a tougher global trade backdrop,"" he said.

""Still, hopes of a sharp rebound are likely to be dashed. The labour market has softened, and capacity constraints mean even tepid growth is generating inflation pressures.""

— Chloe Taylor, Holly Ellyatt

The U.K. economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics out on Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by a tepid 0.1% over the period, up from bumper growth of 0.7% in the first quarter.

Month-on-month, the economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, failing to shake off the impact of U.S. tariffs and business uncertainty.

— Holly Ellyatt

Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday.

Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are meeting to try to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, but close followers of Moscow's leadership are skeptical that any lasting resolution will be reached at the summit.

Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action and business news in European financial markets on Thursday.

Futures data from IG suggests a generally positive open for European indexes, with London's FTSE 100 seen opening 0.15% higher, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are seen opening around the flatline, and Italy's FTSE MIB slightly higher.

The pullback in sentiment among European bourses comes ahead of the latest indicator of the state of health of major regional economies, with gross domestic product readings from the U.K. and European Union on Thursday.

European markets had ended the day higher on Wednesday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising 0.55% after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied to new records yesterday. Investors are gearing up for more inflation data to assess the state of the U.S. economy.

The producer price index, due Thursday, will be significant factors in the direction interest rates take at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in September.

— Holly Ellyatt

Earnings are set to come from Adyen, Swiss Re, Hapag-Lloyd, RWE, Talanx, CVC Capital Partners, Aviva, Antofagasta and Carlsberg on Thursday.

On the data front, U.K. second-quarter preliminary gross domestic product figures are released at 7 a.m. London time, followed by the latest French inflation figures shortly after and the EU employment and GDP data at 10 a.m. London time.

Don't mess with DJ D-Sol — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's stage name when he's rocking the clubs in his other life as a DJ.

U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon ""should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ.""

In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle.

 ""If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost,"" Mericle said.

Goldman, in fact, is not the only Wall Street bank putting forth this view.

UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that ""the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices,"" while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note that tariffs could ""add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred.""

Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. Recall how economists were all but certain a U.S. recession would happen in 2023 — only for the economy to grow 2.5% that year.

In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report

Trump is considering 11 candidates for Fed chair. Among the list of potential nominees are Federal Reserve officials, a Bush administration economic advisor, Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder.

Economists agree that higher tariff inflation is coming. Despite Trump on Tuesday slamming Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer prices, the bank is standing by its research. Other Wall Street economists agree with its call.

New records for U.S. stocks again. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite climbed Wednesday to close at fresh highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rising. Shares of Paramount Skydance popped 36.7%. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.54%.

xAI's co-founder Igor Babuschkin leaves. Babuschkin said he's starting a venture firm to support AI safety research and invest in startups. Musk wrote, in response, ""Thanks for helping build @xAI! We wouldn't be here without you.""

[PRO] This software stock could jump 50%, Morgan Stanley says. The firm's shares tumbled Monday because of lackluster third-quarter guidance — but that move created ""the entry point for which we've been waiting,"" a Morgan Stanley analyst wrote.

How Big Tech is paying its way out of Trump's tariffs

Top tech executives are at the forefront of a recent swathe of unprecedented deals with U.S. President Donald Trump. In particular, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as Apple, have struck agreements with the White House.

""The flurry of deal-making is an effort to secure lighter treatment from tariffs,"" Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC by email. Big tech companies can ""ill afford to fork out on millions of dollars in additional fees that will further dent profits as underlined by recent quarterly earnings,"" Pescatore said.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets closed mixed Thursday as investors bet on a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve next month.

Here are today's highlights:

Asia-Pacific markets mostly closed lower Thursday.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.37% to close at 25,519.32, while mainland China's CSI 300 index was flat at 4,173.31.

Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index closed flat at 3,225.66, while the small-cap Kosdaq ticked up 0.14% to 815.26.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark advanced 0.53% to 8,8738.80, after hitting an intra-day high earlier in the session.

Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark declined by 1.45% to end the day at 42,649.26, while the broader Topix index lost 1.1% to 3,057.95.

Over in India, the 50-stock benchmark Nifty 50 was up 0.12%, while the BSE Sensex index ticked up 0.11% as of 1:40 p.m. Indian Standard Time (4:10 a.m. ET).

Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 1.45% lower at 42,649.26 Thursday, reversing course from the record gains it posted in its previous two sessions.

The worst performing stocks on the blue-chip index were Socionext which plunged 8.39%, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which declined 5.69% and Kawasaki Heavy Industries which lost 5.31%.

— Amala Balakrishner

Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 ended the 0.53% higher at 8,873.80, paring gains from its record intra-day high of 8,891.10 earlier in the session.

The 200-stock benchmark was buoyed by gains in the banking sector.

Shares of Westpac Banking rose 6.31%, while Suncorp Group advanced 3.64%, AMP added 2.31% and National Australia Bank increased by 1.89%.

— Amala Balakrishner

Indian stocks were little changed near midday.

The 50-stock benchmark Nifty 50 was trading near the flatline, while the BSE Sensex index was up around 0.1% as of 11:48 a.m. Indian Standard time (2:18 a.m. ET).

Australia's unemployment rate eased to 4.2% on a seasonally-adjusted basis in July, in line with estimates of economists polled by Reuters.

The reading was lower than the 4.3% recorded in June, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed.

Meanwhile, the number of employed individuals rose by 24,500 in July, from a revised increase of 1,000 the month before.

That latest reading still missed market forecasts of a 25,000 increase, according to Reuters poll data.

The Australian dollar rose as much as 0.32% to $0.6564, the highest since July 28, after the jobs data release.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks traded mixed Thursday. 

As of 9:32 a.m. local time (9:32 p.m. ET Wednesday), the Hang Seng Index rose 0.58%, while mainland's CSI 300 was flat.

— Nur Hikmah Md Ali

Shares of Tencent rose over 2% early in the session Thursday following its better-than-expected second-quarter earnings results Wednesday. 

The Chinese tech giant reported a 15% jump year on year in second-quarter revenue, boosted by strong performance in its gaming unit and AI investments.

Its second-quarter revenue totaled 184.504 billion Chinese yuan ($25.7 billion), compared with 161.117 billion yuan in the same period last year.

Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday.

Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark fell 0.31%, reversing course from its record high close in the previous session. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index lost 0.64%, as of 8:05 a.m. Singapore time (8:05 p.m. ET Wednesday).

In South Korea, the Kospi index added 0.39%, while the small-cap Kosdaq was flat.

Over in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 benchmark increased by 0.49%.

Bitcoin rose sharply early Thursday and briefly hit a record high of $123,769, following a rally in U.S. equities overnight.

As of 7:52 a.m. Singapore time (7:52 p.m. ET), Bitcoin had advanced 0.47% to $123,507.07.

Job cuts and muted earnings in India's IT sector have left some investors wondering if they should steer clear of such stocks.

Tata Consultancy Services, one of the country's biggest private sector employers, announced last month that more than 12,000 staff in mostly middle and senior management roles would be cut. That accounts for around 2% of TCS' global workforce, making it one of India's biggest IT layoffs thus far.

The company attributed the layoffs to mismatched skillsets, but others cited automation as a factor.

Elsewhere, Infosys has reportedly slowed down fresher recruitment while Wipro has trimmed roles.

CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here on how the pros are looking at the sector.

Good morning from Singapore.

Investors are awaiting the release of a slew of employment-related data from Australia.

Economists polled by Reuters expect an increase of 25,000 employed individuals in July, compared to the modest jump of 2,000 the month before. The unemployment rate in July is expected to come in at 4.2%, an improvement from 4.3% in June.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was set to start the day flat with futures tied to the benchmark at 8,825, compared with the index's Wednesday close of 8,827.10.

Japan Nikkei 225 was set to open lower, with the futures contract in Chicago at 43,135 while its counterpart in Osaka last traded at 43,140, against the index's last close of 43,274.67.

Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng index stood at 25,741, pointing to a stronger open compared with the HSI's last close of 25,613.67.

U.S. stock futures traded just below the flatline on Wednesday evening.

S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% shortly after 6 p.m. ET, along with Nasdaq 100 futures. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, or about 0.1%.

Warren Buffett has dropped out of the top 10 richest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as of Tuesday night.

This comes as shares of Berkshire Hathaway have lagged in performance since Buffett announced his retirement in May.

In a Wednesday note to clients, Wolfe Research pointed to a solid earnings season for continuing the boost the fundamental backdrop of the U.S. economy.

""With U.S. policy (tariff and monetary) incredibly volatile throughout the quarter, we viewed these results as very strong,"" wrote Chris Senyek, the firm's chief investment strategist.

""While tariff volatility depressed the earnings outlook for the S&P 500 after the Trump Administration's Liberation Day, estimates have bounced back as companies continue to beat expectations and provide solid forward guidance,"" he continued. ""Though we expect seasonal volatility to pick up in the weeks ahead, the fundamental picture for stocks continues to be strong, especially as strong secular tailwinds, such as the AI Spending Narrative, remain intact.""

Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite climbed to new record closing highs on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 463.66 points, or 1.04%, closing at 44,922.27. The S&P 500 rose 0.32% to settle at 6,466.58, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.14% and finished at 21,713.14.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin hit a new record late Wednesday as ether climbed even closer to its all-time high.

The flagship cryptocurrency rose as high as $124,496, surpassing its July record of 123,193.63, according to Coin Metrics. Ether rose to $4,791.19 overnight, edging closer to its 2021 record of $4,866.01.

Both coins took a hit Thursday, however, after July's wholesale inflation data came in much hotter than expected. Bitcoin was lower by 3% at $117,860.89 while ether fell about the same to $4,562.58.

The initial gains were sparked by Tuesday's cooler-than-expected July inflation report, which had lifted investor optimism for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at the end of its September policy meeting. The coins rallied with the stock market for two days. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also scaled new records.

For the week, bitcoin is on pace for a 1% gain, while ether has rallied 12%. Ether flipped bitcoin as the crypto market leader in June, gaining 85% since then thanks to heavy institutional buying, tightening supply and adoption from corporate accumulators – all under the backdrop of a friendlier regulatory environment for the crypto industry. Jake Kennis, analyst at Nansen, said the rally likely has more room to run given the flows remain strong.

""Bitcoin hitting a fresh all time high and ETH being on the verge of doing so means we've moved from speculative mania to a phase where institutional adoption, real-world integration, and global liquidity are driving price discovery,"" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research and trading platform DYOR.

""The fact that both assets are on the verge of breaking records in tandem signals broad market conviction, not just a single-asset rally,"" he added. ""Momentum this strong rarely burns out instantly, but it also tends to draw in latecomers who can fuel volatility. Right now the story is less about euphoria and more about validation. Crypto is graduating from 'alternative' to 'essential' in the global portfolio mix.""

Block unveils Proto Rig, a modular, repairable bitcoin miner, and Proto Fleet, free open-source fleet management software, in a push to decentralize mining.

Block, Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) has unveiled Proto Rig, a first-of-its-kind modular bitcoin mining system, and Proto Fleet, a free and open-source fleet management software platform, marking a bold step toward decentralizing mining hardware, increasing operational efficiency, and boosting Bitcoin network resiliency.

The announcement took place at Core Scientific's facility in Dalton, GA, where Proto Rigs are already deployed as part of its mining fleet. This launch represents the first two end-to-end releases from Proto, Block's suite of bitcoin mining products and services, following its initial chip sale to Core Scientific.

Currently, bitcoin mining hardware faces significant inefficiencies. Most machines are single-use, prone to frequent breakdowns, expensive and time-consuming to repair, and difficult to upgrade. These issues lead to wasted power, poor space utilization, and shorter life cycles. On the software side, miners are often forced to piece together multiple tools to manage power scaling, monitoring, and diagnostics — creating a fragmented and costly operational environment.

Proto Rig aims to directly address these challenges by introducing a durable, modular design that transforms a historically disposable 3–5 year asset into a 10-year infrastructure investment. Operators can swap out individual hashboards instead of replacing entire units, cutting upgrade costs by 15–20% per cycle. In addition, tool-free, in-place repairs allow fixes to be completed in seconds rather than hours or days, significantly reducing downtime.

“Mining hardware hasn't really changed in years,” said Thomas Templeton, Hardware Lead at Block. “Machines break often, are hard to repair, expensive and time-consuming to upgrade, and don't make the most efficient use of power or space. With Rig, we set out to change all of that–and contribute to hardware decentralization in the process.”

With 1.5x more power per foot of rack space than traditional hardware, Proto Rig was built for compatibility with both modern and legacy infrastructure, to allow seamless integration without costly retrofits.

Alongside the hardware, Proto Fleet aims to deliver a comprehensive, open-source fleet management software that consolidates power-scaling, monitoring, diagnostics, and maintenance tools into a single intuitive platform.

“Mining hasn't really caught up with advances in software more broadly,” Templeton noted. “We saw an opportunity to make mining software something modern that improves operational efficiency instead of unnecessarily complicating things.”

By making Proto Fleet free for anyone to use, Block is leveling the playing field for mining operators of all sizes, ensuring access to high-quality management tools without proprietary lock-ins.

Together, Proto Rig's repairability, power efficiency, and backwards compatibility, paired with Proto Fleet's streamlined, open-source software, could help redefine the economics and accessibility of bitcoin mining. This launch further underscores Block's broader commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem, alongside its other initiatives through Square, Cash App, Bitkey, and Spiral.

Spot ethereum ETF inflows for the week stand at $2.2 billion so far, dwarfing their bitcoin counterparts. 

Despite ethereum's rally taking a breather, the cryptocurrency's ETFs are on track to set a new weekly inflow record. 

US spot ethereum ETFs have recorded $2.2 billion of inflows this week so far, the most these investment vehicles have ever seen and a figure multitudes higher than spot bitcoin ETFs' weekly inflows of $331 million, according to SoSoValue. The two days with the most ethereum inflows occurred in the same week, with Wednesday seeing $729.1 million and Monday producing $1 billion. 

Ethereum climbed to $4,779 in the last 24 hours, an almost four-year high, before correcting to about $4,500 Thursday morning. The token is now hovering just under the $4,700 level as of 10:50 a.m. ET.

As a result of the price decline, centralized exchanges liquidated more than $182.4 million ethereum long positions in the last four hours, data from analytics platform CoinGlass shows. 

Meanwhile, the exit queue for ethereum validators to unstake has shot up to 717,775 tokens worth $3.3 billion. The wait time for the exit line to clear is 12 days and 11 hours, which is higher than the entry queue wait of three days and 19 hours, according to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in. The total amount of tokens waiting to be unstaked is also at its highest point ever since staking withdrawals went live in 2023. 

TheBlock reported that a whale address (0x815) that participated in ethereum's initial coin offering sent $5.1 million worth of tokens to a Kraken deposit address on Thursday, bringing its total transfers to the centralized exchange to $24.1 million this week.  

TeraWulf jumped more than 32% in early trading this morning after it announced two 10-year $3.7 billion AI hosting deals with AI cloud platform Fluidstack. The agreement includes two five-year extension options, which could bring the total contract revenue to $8.7 billion if exercised.

Google will “backstop $1.8 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations” and will acquire 41 million shares of TeraWulf via warrants, representing an 8% stake of the company. 

Under the high-performance computing colocation agreements, the bitcoin mining company will deliver 200 megawatts of IT load at its Lake Mariner, New York, data center.

“Fluidstack is proud to be a trusted provider of critical compute for the world's leading AI labs. Our partnership with TeraWulf reflects our shared commitment to delivering rapid, scalable infrastructure for the AI frontier,” César Maklary, Fluidstack cofounder and president, said in the release. 

The company also announced a long-term ground lease for 183 acres at the Cayuga site in Lansing, NY, a deal that “marks a major step forward in the company's expansion of high-performance computing (HPC) and AI data center hosting.”

A year ago, bitcoin's price was around $57,000.

Crypto treasury firms focused on solana hold in total 3.4 million tokens, with Upexi, DeFi Development Corp., and Sol Strategies taking the top spots. 

Bitcoin is just shy of its July record. Meanwhile, Asia's largest corporate bitcoin holder reported positive Q2 results.

Coinbase developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr say autonomous AI agents could become Ethereum's “biggest power user.” They could use a revived web standard to make crypto payments without human help.

Autonomous AI agents are programs that can make decisions and complete tasks without human control. According to Coinbase (COIN) developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr, these agents could transform Ethereum's role in global commerce. They believe this shift will happen because of the revival of an internet standard from 30 years ago.





That standard is HTTP 402, also called “Payment Required.” When combined with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3009, it allows AI agents to send stablecoin payments automatically. The Ethereum Foundation highlighted the development this week, presenting it as a big step toward blockchain-powered automation.

To understand the idea, it helps to picture something familiar. Much like a vending machine, an AI agent receives a payment request, signs a transaction, and sends the funds. Once the payment is confirmed, the service delivers what was requested, whether that is data, storage, or computing power.

Because the process works instantly, it removes the need for traditional accounts or manual approvals. In other words, it turns APIs into services that can directly check a wallet's balance and process a payment in one simple step.

This is where Ethereum's strengths come into play. Its settlement system can handle payments instantly without the delays and intermediaries of traditional finance. Instead of invoices and disputes that can take days, Ethereum processes everything on the spot.

Furthermore, stablecoins make the process even more reliable by eliminating the price swings common with other cryptocurrencies. According to the developers, AI agents “need atomic payments, programmable policies, and composable wallets. Ethereum and stablecoins give them exactly that.” That combination makes Ethereum the natural home for this kind of technology.

The shift is already starting. For example, Hyperbolic Labs has integrated HTTP 402 into its large language model AI. This allows it to buy the data it needs automatically. Prodia Labs is using it to pay for the creation of images and videos.

Moreover, Coinbase has also built its own version called the “x402 payments protocol,” available for other developers on GitHub. By connecting multiple services in a chain, AI agents could eventually create complete economic loops without human involvement.

This ties into a trend already visible in crypto markets. AI agents are trading cryptocurrencies by reading market data and executing orders in real time. If they can also pay for services directly, their role could expand into areas like transportation, content creation, and data management.

Self-driving taxis could pay for their own charging stations. Content-producing AI could store its work instantly. If this adoption accelerates, AI agents could become Ethereum's biggest power users and help push blockchain technology into the mainstream far beyond just the crypto space.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $4,710.12.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

Market analysts are increasingly attentive to crypto leverage levels as digital assets extended gains on Thursday after a softer U.S. inflation print, buoyed by investor optimism on renewed ETF demand and rising rate-cut odds.

Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, said macro cues and Wall Street inflows have triggered a broad risk-on rally. In a note shared with The Block, he noted that bitcoin has reclaimed some strength above $120,000, while ether crossed $4,700, with ETF demand acting as a springboard for the move.

Spot ether ETFs in the U.S. recorded $729 million of net inflows on Wednesday — their second-largest daily haul on record — helping drive ETH toward its all-time high, according to The Block's reporting. BTC funds also saw modest flows compared to ETH vehicles.

Post-CPI price action “confirms that policy relief and structural inflows remain the backbone of the rally,” Misir said, but warned that record altcoin leverage plus low implied volatility historically introduce choppy price action. 

He cautioned that open interest across top altcoins has now climbed to a record after the price surge and a “significant influx of speculative capital.” Implied volatility remains low, a setup that “often precedes realized volatility expansion” into resistance zones that could spark sharp market swings.

Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode confirmed that open interest across major altcoins hit an all-time high of around $47 billion, marking a leverage buildup that can amplify both rallies and drawdowns. Glassnode also flagged ETH options open interest near year-to-date highs of $16.1 billion alongside spot prices near record levels. The Block's data dashboard similarly shows elevated ETH options OI, consistent with heavy positioning.

Simultaneously, options tenors are at multi-year lows, with modest skews and “no sign yet of panic hedging,” leaving room for a volatility breakout if resistance fails, according to BRN's analyst.



Misir said BTC's short-term holder cost basis near $120,000 is a key level, following brief losses after Bitcoin slipped to $112,000 last week. However, the BRN's analysis found that “most investors who recently bought Bitcoin were confident enough to hold onto their assets despite the price drop.”

The analyst opined that consolidation around the STH cost basis should encourage bullish sentiment for another rally above BTC's $124,128 all-time high. “If price can break above, the next target could be $144,000,” he said.

BTC tops the chart, but will ALTs steal the momentum?



Bitcoin has notched a fresh all-time high, pulling altcoins up with it. But can BTC hold dominance, or will a rotation into alts push BTC.D lower?

Zooming in, Bitcoin [BTC] is consolidating at the $120k support, using it as a launchpad, and validating the structure with back-to-back all-time highs, the latest breaching $123K. 

Q3 Crypto Outlook



However, an intraday pullback of 1.47% signals weak follow-through momentum. The result? BTC's market cap retraced from $2.46 trillion to $2.41 trillion, marking a $50 billion contraction.

Meanwhile, the broader crypto market tracked this move, slipping from $4.20 trillion to $4.15 trillion, also a $50 billion dip. That means this pullback is almost entirely BTC-driven, with dominance down 0.54%.

This divergence is notable for traders tracking market flows. 

As the chart illustrates, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) has carved out a third lower low in the past two weeks, despite BTC itself rallying nearly 6%.

Simply put, while Bitcoin is in a phase of price discovery, capital is rotating into altcoins. Backing this, TOTAL2 (market cap ex-BTC) has breached $1.65 trillion for the first time since 2021, signaling relative strength.

Bitcoin dominance is showing a gradual erosion. 

Over the past two months, BTC.D slid from 65% to 59%, even as Bitcoin rallied 15% to a $123K ATH, indicating that BTC's gains are not fully capturing market inflows.

At the same time, the altcoin season index has surged from 16 to 59, marking a 270% surge. The result? Even speculative assets like Dogecoin [DOGE] rallied 40%+ over the same period.

Source: TradingView (DOGE/USDT)

A closer look at 7-day returns reinforces this trend: Ethereum [ETH] was up 25.5%, Ripple [XRP] gained 16.2%, and Solana [SOL] rose 13.6%, reflecting an elevated speculative bid and momentum building in higher-beta alt assets.

In essence, while BTC carves out new all-time highs, capital is actively rotating into alternative assets, with the altcoin season index just 22 points shy of signaling a full-blown “altcoin season.”

The impact on Bitcoin? BTC dominance is under pressure and could test deeper lows. Price discovery is still led by BTC, but altcoins are grabbing the lion's share of flows, making them a stronger Q3 play.

Over 200,000 traders were wrecked daily. 

Bitcoin's price took an unexpected turn for the worse minutes ago as it dumped from over $121,000 to under $118,000.

The altcoins have it even worse, with more painful declines that have harmed over-leveraged traders, as the total value of wrecked positions surges toward $1 billion.

It has been quite the day for the primary cryptocurrency. Recall that just hours ago, the asset flew to a new all-time high, surpassing $124,500 for the first time ever.

However, it dropped by a few grand later during the day and calmed at around $121,000. In the past 10-15 minutes, though, the bears suddenly took complete control of the market, pushing bitcoin below $118,000 in a violent red candle.

BTC bounced off almost immediately and now sits a grand and a half higher, but it's still $5,000 away from the new peak charted earlier today.

The altcoins have followed suit with painful declines from the likes of ETH, XRP, SOL, DOGE, and ADA – all of which have dropped by 2-3% in the past hour alone.

The most notable news that came out in the past few hours is somewhat bullish, so that's probably not the reason behind the crash. After all, Putin said the US is actively pursuing peace between Russia and Ukraine and even hinted at a possible nuclear deal.

What could have had a bigger negative impact on BTC's price is actually the wholesale inflation data that came out earlier today. According to CNN, the surge was the highest in over three years.

Nevertheless, the liquidations have skyrocketed to over $930 million on a daily basis. Moreover, they are close to $460 million in the past hours alone. CoinGlass data shows that 207,000 traders have been wrecked in the past day.

An XRPL validator operating under the name Grapedrop, or Grape, has published data that he claims shows patterns of trading activity manipulation capable of influencing the price of XRP. The data, which was first posted on the social media platform X, includes screenshots from the XRPL Console and examples of live transactions, forming what the validator described as a clear on-ledger footprint of unusually large and repetitive transfers between exchange addresses.

Out of roughly 1,000 XRPL nodes in existence, about 150 to 170 are active validators, and Grape's node is one of them. Grape confirmed that he has been operating a validator since July 12, 2025, which has given him real-time oversight of transactions on the network. Interestingly, Grape stated that his findings are the result of systematic tracking using a custom Python tool that is designed to monitor and flag payments above 10,000 XRP. 

Since activating his validator, he has documented thousands of such high-value movements, often involving popular crypto exchanges like Bitget and Binance. His flagged transactions include examples such as 49,900 XRP, 67,655 XRP, and 146,757 XRP, with similar transfers recorded multiple times per hour and thousands of volumes a day.

The destinations and sources of these payments often connect to exchange-controlled wallets. However, the volume and frequency are standing well above the normal retail activity. The screenshots shared show consistent high-value movements to and from these crypto exchanges. 

An example is shown in the Console data below. Transactions include 3,018,977.72 XRP, 460,119 XRP, and 146,757.57 XRP, originating from one Binance-controlled wallet to another. This trend is more of an organized pattern rather than normal trading activity among traders.

Grape explained that XRP's price is often calculated using volume-weighted averages. As such, repeatedly moving large volumes between exchanges can inflate these volume figures and manipulate the calculations of market cap.

This activity, referred to as wash trading, is done to create an impression of artificial demand, which in turn tricks other people or other automated bots into buying into the crypto.

Responses to the findings by the XRPL validator have been divided, but most comments on his social media posts seem to agree with the manipulation explanation. One of the responses came from “Crypto Bitlord,” an account with over 415,000 followers on the social media platform. “It seems pretty accurate. And what you found in a short time imagine what you'll find over time,” he said.

In response, Grape noted that an enhanced version to deeply analyze and identify XRP price manipulation is currently being developed. 

Grapedrop's findings certainly raise concern, but they stop short of actually proving price manipulation. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.27, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

BySandy Carter,

 Contributor. 

I sat in on a session all about AI and crypto. The vibe was electric. It was clear from the conversations in the room that we are going to see more and more blockchain and crypto companies making big moves into AI. These will be serious plays, not experiments on the side.

When you think about it, the match is almost perfect. AI creates abundance, producing endless new possibilities from data. Blockchain enforces scarcity, giving us trust, verification, and value that holds. One is a creator, the other a protector. Put them together and you get a system that is both innovative and trustworthy.

At the session, three big points stood out for the AI and crypto era:

With that framing, it makes perfect sense that two of the biggest names in Web3, Blockchain.com and Tether, are going big on AI.

Since its inception in 2011, Blockchain.com has earned the trust of more than 90 million wallets across 190+ countries and has facilitated over $1 trillion in crypto transactions.

On August 12, 2025, Blockchain.com launched June, a privacy-focused AI assistant that will soon be rolling out to wallets in the app over the coming months. The launch tagline summed it up: Your Data, Your AI.

It was a clear signal to users that this tool was designed to work for them, not harvest their information. Conversations are not stored, and no personal data is used to train the AI models.

June is not a generic chatbot. It is tuned specifically for crypto users and offers several capabilities that go beyond a search bar:

The real advantage is that all of this happens inside the secure environment of Blockchain.com. Users do not need to link external tools or share their private data with third parties.

For Blockchain.com, June represents more than just a new feature. It is a way to build deeper engagement with its millions of users. By offering an always-available AI that understands crypto, the company increases loyalty, drives more transactions, and positions itself as a knowledge partner rather than just a service provider.

“At Blockchain.com, we've always believed that technology should empower individuals, not extract from them. With June, we're taking the same principles that fueled the growth of crypto—privacy, ownership, and decentralization—and bringing them to the world of AI,” said Nic Cary, Co-Founder & Vice Chairman, Blockchain.com. ""Now we're doing the same with intelligence. June is the next chapter in putting powerful tools in people's hands while keeping their data exactly where it belongs, with them.”

In a world where trust is hard-won, a privacy-first AI assistant could be a differentiator that keeps customers coming back.

Also note that June wrote her own blog post announcing her debut to the world.

Tether, the company behind USDT, the largest stablecoin in the world, is taking a very different approach to AI. Instead of focusing on a consumer product, Tether is building infrastructure that allows AI to operate in a decentralized, blockchain-native way.

Tether launched its AI SDK, built on top of the Bare JavaScript runtime. This gives it the flexibility to run almost anywhere, from mobile phones, laptops, servers, or even on the edge in IoT devices.

From there, the project evolved into Tether AI, a fully decentralized AI runtime. This system allows AI agents to operate peer-to-peer, without relying on centralized servers or API keys that could be controlled or censored.

The other major feature is native crypto payments. Through Tether's Wallet Development Kit, AI agents can directly transact in USDT or Bitcoin. That means an AI can initiate and complete payments without human intervention, opening the door for entirely new categories of machine-to-machine commerce.

Possible applications range from autonomous supply chain agents paying each other for data to IoT devices automatically purchasing bandwidth or compute resources. The combination of decentralized operation and native payment capability gives Tether AI the potential to become a foundational layer for the autonomous digital economy.

While both Blockchain.com and Tether are pursuing AI, their strategies are very different.

Blockchain.com is building a user-facing AI experience. June is designed to directly serve customers, making their crypto experience smarter, faster, and safer.

Tether is building AI infrastructure. Its decentralized runtime and payment integration are designed to support developers and innovators who want to build AI systems that live natively on blockchain networks.

Both companies are playing to their strengths. Blockchain.com has a massive consumer base and brand recognition in the retail crypto space. Tether has unmatched liquidity in its stablecoin and a strong incentive to increase USDT's usage in new and emerging transaction categories.

The significance of these moves goes beyond the companies themselves. AI in Web3 is moving from experimental projects to core strategy.

For users, this will mean more intelligent, personalized tools to help manage assets, find opportunities, and automate complex tasks. For developers, it means access to decentralized AI infrastructure that can handle identity, governance, and transactions without relying on a single central authority.

The Pantera session made it clear that we are heading toward AI-native Web3 ecosystems. In these ecosystems, AI will not just be an add-on to blockchain technology. It will be built into the way the systems think, act, and handle value.

Both companies face important challenges as they move forward.

For Blockchain.com, the challenge will be keeping its privacy-first commitment while finding sustainable ways to grow and monetize June. There is always a temptation to use aggregated data for commercial purposes, and resisting that temptation will be key to maintaining user trust.

For Tether, the challenge will be driving developer adoption. Building the tools is only half the battle. Tether will need to attract a strong community of developers willing to build meaningful, widely-used applications on its decentralized AI infrastructure. This will require great documentation, incentives, and active ecosystem support.

The fusion of AI and blockchain is not a passing trend. AI brings the ability to generate and act on information. Blockchain secures that information, verifies it, and enables it to be transacted in a trusted way. Together they offer new possibilities for finance, governance, and commerce.

Blockchain.com and Tether are showing that there is no single way to get into the space. Blockchain.com is starting with the end user. Tether is starting with the infrastructure. Both are shaping the early rules and opportunities for decentralized AI.

If 2024 was the year AI in Web3 became a mainstream talking point, 2025 is the year it became real.

And based on what I heard, this is only the beginning for AI and web3.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

 The cryptographic math once dismissed as fringe is now shaping US policy and bank infrastructure. StarkWare's Eli Ben-Sasson said it's only the beginning. 

A technology once confined to academic papers is now being called out in US government reports and powering the settlement systems of global banks. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) are cryptographic methods to verify data without revealing it, and they are quietly becoming the gold standard for blockchain security.

On the latest Clear Crypto Podcast, StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson sits down with hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson to explain why this once-niche math is “100%… the endgame for scaling the financial world.”

That confidence comes as zero-knowledge proofs move from cryptographic curiosity to a linchpin of mainstream blockchain adoption.

In July, the White House's crypto report singled them out as a way to “protect user privacy while enabling compliance checks.” JPMorgan's new private blockchain, Nexus, is already using the technology for tokenized cash settlements and interbank messaging.

Ben-Sasson explains the appeal in clear terms:

In blockchain environments, this means an entire day's worth of transactions can be verified with the effort of checking just one, reducing costs and increasing speed without compromising trust. “The blockchain doesn't need to check each and every of the 1 million transactions… it verifies the full integrity of a day's worth of transactions,” he says.

Related: Build on Bitcoin adds ZK-proofs in upgrade toward decentralization

“To verifiably check the validity of an entire blockchain… in seconds or less is unbelievably valuable,” Jenkinson notes, pointing to potential far beyond crypto-native systems, such as applications in financial auditing, public record-keeping and even secure identity checks at borders.

The adoption curve is also being accelerated by StarkWare's decision not to patent its implementation. Ben-Sasson said:

This open approach has allowed other projects, including Starkware's competitors, to build on the technology, spreading it faster than a closed model would allow.

With policy recognition, institutional integration, and open-source availability converging, ZK-proofs are no longer a theoretical upgrade for blockchain. They're becoming an industry standard and, if Ben-Sasson's vision holds, a foundation for how individuals will own and prove value in the digital economy.

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency industry has lately begun to heavily promote tokenized stocks, but what exactly are they? More importantly, what advantages do tokenized stocks offer — especially when investors already have safe, no-cost fractional share trading at many brokers?

A tokenized stock is a fancy way of saying that ownership of a stock can be transferred via blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency. Tokenizing, or digitizing, assets such as stocks, ETFs and other securities allows them to be traded on a specialized digital exchange and potentially directly between investors without the need for an exchange. These tokens are held in a digital wallet, much as crypto coins are, similar to a traditional brokerage account.

“The news cycle for crypto is all about representing traditional financial assets on a blockchain,” says Hilary Allen, professor, American University Washington College of Law. But Allen points out that investors and financial markets will endure major costs for doing so: “There are a lot of protections that are given up by this move.”

Compare advisors:  Bankrate's list of the best financial advisors

In order to establish a tokenized stock, these steps are needed:

Taking custody of the asset: The asset that will be tokenized needs to be held in custody by a custodian, whose job is to safeguard it on behalf of the token creator.

Creating the token: A financial institution such as an investment bank or fintech company then creates the digitized token, which corresponds to the asset in custody.

Setting up smart contracts: Each token is programmed with self-executing smart contracts that give the token's owner the same rights as stock ownership, including dividend distributions and voting rights, among others.

Once the stock is tokenized, traders can exchange it among themselves on crypto platforms, other decentralized finance platforms or even potentially a traditional stock brokerage. For example, crypto exchange Kraken has created tokenized stocks that it calls xStocks, and now allows trading in 60 major stocks. Meanwhile, brokerage Robinhood launched token trading in the European Union in June, offering access to more than 200 U.S. stock and ETF tokens.

Asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already offer tokenized money market funds. Goldman Sachs and BNY are teaming up to launch their own tokenized money market funds, too. More firms are exploring the idea of tokenized stocks.

In short, you could think of a tokenized stock as one that trades via blockchain. So what's the big deal for individual investors? The cryptocurrency industry is breathlessly hyping this as a huge leap forward – as it has done for crypto coins – but the benefits are modest for individual investors, especially buy-and-hold types, and the risks of tokenized stocks are high. In fact, the best stock brokers already offer many of these same benefits to investors at no cost.

The crypto industry touts the following benefits of tokenized stock trading, many of which are already features at top brokers or may soon be features.

Increased accessibility through fractional shares: Tokenized stocks let investors trade portions of a share, meaning that high-priced stocks are accessible to even those with a little money.

Lower cost: The crypto industry touts the potentially lower cost of transactions by eliminating intermediaries via blockchain.

Transparency: The industry says thatby recording ownership on the blockchain, tokenization ensures that ownership is established.

Security: Proponents say that blockchain-enabled trading also increases security because ownership is irrevocably established on the blockchain.

24/7 trading: Because tokenized stocks are held on a blockchain, they can be traded at any hour.

Immediate settling of trades: Proponents also point to the immediate settling of trades via tokenized stocks, in contrast to next-day settlement in the U.S.

More direct access between investors and firms: Tokenization may bypass existing financial intermediaries, letting companies raise money more directly from investors.

Others note the serious risks in tokenizing stocks, particularly in the area of investor protection.

Potentially irrevocable transactions: Like cryptocurrency transactions, a tokenized stock transaction may be irrevocable. Once it's done, it's done, and it may be all but impossible to undo.

Uncertain legal protections: The legal treatment of tokenized stocks is way behind where the crypto industry is trying to go, exposing investors to plenty of risks. For example, who is considered the issuer of a tokenized stock: the firm that tokenized it or the stock's original issuer? What happens if an asset is hacked?

Inflexible smart contracts: Smart contracts programmed into tokenized stocks will not cover all circumstances, says Allen. “It's not clear how they'll operate in unexpected environments.”

Circumventing investor protections: Private investments are private partially to protect investors, not merely to limit investments to the well-heeled, but tokenizing stocks can allow financial players to get around the rules. “It's absolutely built as an end run around securities laws,” says Allen. “Crypto is built as an end run around securities laws.”

Loss of trust in American financial markets: One of the potential long-term effects of not enforcing existing securities laws is the erosion of trust in American capital markets. If securities laws aren't enforced or are enforced inconsistently, then markets simply become a place to rip off investors.

Bankrate reached out to Kraken and Robinhood for further comment but has not heard back.

The crypto industry and some traditional financial institutions have talked a big game about tokenization of stocks and some players have moved toward tokenization. But what's in it for individual investors? Many of tokenization's supposed benefits touted by the crypto industry are already available for individual investors in the current system.

Fractional shares already exist: Individual investors can already access fractional shares — on thousands of stocks and ETFs — at the best brokers for fractional shares.

Stock trading is already commission-free: For individual investors, trading stocks is already free at every major online broker, so there's no added benefit to using tokenized stocks.

Transparency and security: Existing brokers already have high levels of security with a proven security process. In fact, it's the crypto exchanges and other DeFi platforms that have been beset by lax security, fraud and theft.

After-hours trading: Many brokers already offer after-hours, overnight and pre-market trading on existing stocks. While this is not 24/7 trading, brokers have been expanding access in recent years. Moreover, all-hours access to trading does not benefit long-term investors, who build wealth through the long-term success of the underlying business. Study after study shows that active trading underperforms passive investing.

“Democratization” of investing: Proponents of tokenization say that it gives access to private investments that are being hoarded by the wealthy. But giving a means to trade a stock — tokenizing it — does not mean that anyone will want to sell it to you. In fact, you should be skeptical when someone wants to sell you what they say is a great investment. (If it's such a great investment, why are they letting you in on it? It's not out of the kindness of their heart.)

So, while tokenization may offer a few incremental benefits to individual investors, albeit with significant risks, what's the real driver of tokenization? Who is actually going to benefit here? It's the crypto industry trying to make inroads into traditional finance, say experts.

Get started:  Match with an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals

“The crypto industry is waging a multi-pronged battle to get integrated into the financial system,” says Allen. The industry is working to “attract deep pockets” and bring more money into the fold, and tokenized stocks are part of that push, she explains.

So much of the crypto world is about hyping digital currency as “the next big thing.” Part of that process is projecting bombastic price targets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ones that are always rising over time. Such hype can make cryptocurrency seem inevitable.

As with cryptocurrency, one of the biggest use-cases for stock tokenization is (illegally) getting around existing laws (in this case, securities laws). So the full-bore adoption of stock tokenization has many potentially destructive effects, including the erosion of investor protections and robust securities laws that protect financial markets. Without these laws, it's “scammer take all.”

“Investors lose the benefit of the securities laws,” says Allen. She points out that what the crypto industry wants to run roughshod over are the very laws that they claim are roadblocks to their profits. ”We saw what happened in the 1920s and the lack of securities laws.”

Tokenization presents significant risks to individual investors and the financial markets as a whole, while offering few benefits to investors that don't already exist. Those who try out tokenized stocks should remain wary of their many risks amid an uncertain legal framework.

Some collaborations feel inevitable once you hear about them — like they were just waiting for the right moment to happen. The new partnership between Azuki, the Web3 anime brand with a thriving, creative community, and Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie. is one of those rare crossovers that makes perfect sense. On one side, you've got Azuki's forward-thinking blend of anime aesthetics, streetwear influence, and decentralized tech culture. On the other, a watchmaker known for stripping horology down to its purest form, only to rebuild it with a wink, a twist, and an uncompromising devotion to craft. Together, they're launching The Elements of Time — a luxury timepiece series inspired by Azuki's Elementals NFT collection.

Azuki has carved out its space by building a shared universe that thrives on community storytelling, creativity, and a commitment to quality. H. Moser & Cie., meanwhile, has spent centuries refining Swiss watchmaking while still pushing against tradition just enough to keep collectors on their toes. The Elements of Time isn't just about merging these worlds — it's about letting each one amplify the other. The project bridges the precision and heritage of Swiss timekeeping with the imaginative, limitless narratives of NFT culture.

The collection revolves around the four elemental domains that define the Elementals universe — Fire, Earth, Water, and Lightning. Each theme is interpreted through two models: the Pioneer Tourbillon and the Pioneer Centre Seconds. The tourbillons are exclusive to four pieces each, while the Centre Seconds models are capped at 24 pieces per domain.

Every dial in the series features a one-of-a-kind guilloché engraving that mirrors its elemental influence — the flowing crests of water, the sharp energy of lightning, the restless movement of flame, and the rugged patterns of earth. These aren't just decorative details; they're textural narratives, capturing light and shadow in ways that feel alive on the wrist.

The Pioneer Tourbillon editions deliver the mechanical spectacle collectors expect, pairing H. Moser & Cie.'s high complication expertise with design cues lifted from Azuki's digital universe. The Pioneer Centre Seconds models keep things slightly more understated but retain that same elemental depth and rare craftsmanship. Prices reflect their exclusivity — $75,000 for the tourbillons and $25,000 for the Centre Seconds.

Alex “Zagabond” Xu, CEO of Azuki Labs, sees the partnership as a natural extension of the brand's ethos. “The Azuki community was born around our shared values of storytelling, creativity and quality,” he says. “Working with H. Moser & Cie. is an opportunity to express this ethos through a new lens, one that celebrates craftsmanship, culture, and long-term value.”

For Bertrand Meylan, Co-owner of H. Moser & Cie. and CEO of MELB Luxe Subsidiaries, the collaboration is an opportunity to speak to a generation that values self-expression as much as tradition. “Collaborating with Azuki is a chance to explore a way of storytelling that speaks to a generation that values individuality, creativity, and culture.”

Bringing a project like this to life takes more than creative vision — it takes the right connective tissue between worlds. That's where The 1916 Company comes in, helping bridge collector culture, artisanal craft, and digital innovation. The global retailer will host in-person delivery events at its showrooms and lounges, giving buyers not just a watch, but a moment that links them to a wider network of like-minded collectors.

For those already hooked, early registration is open at h-moser.azuki.com. Given the extremely limited production numbers, these watches are less about walking into a store and more about earning a spot in a very small, very exclusive circle. With prices starting at $25,000, this is a commitment to owning both an elite piece of Swiss horology and a slice of Azuki's growing cultural footprint.

Whether you're a watch aficionado, a Web3 loyalist, or someone who just loves the idea of a mechanical timepiece infused with the energy of a living digital universe, The Elements of Time feels like the kind of drop people will talk about for years.

So, if you want a front-row seat to where luxury watchmaking and NFT culture collide — and maybe even snag one of these pieces — now's the time to make your move.

Articles Details

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- PENGU surged 12.6% this week, showing potential breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern with a $0.082 price target if it clears $0.045 resistance.

- Cosmos (ATOM) faced volatility, dropping to $4.48 before rebounding, fueled by Coinbase's support for dYdX token on its network.

- BlockDAG raised $374M in presale, trading below its $0.05 launch price, while expanding real-world partnerships with sports teams and EVM-compatible tools.

- Market remains fragmented with short-term volatility, as PENGU's ETF prospects and BlockDAG's hybrid blockchain-DAG structure attract investor attention.

This week, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a mix of optimism and turbulence as PENGU, ATOM, and BlockDAG each tell distinct stories. PENGU is drawing attention for its potential breakout from a classic cup-and-handle pattern, with analysts estimating a price target of $0.082 if it clears resistance at $0.045. Currently trading at $0.03843, PENGU has surged 12.6% over the week after rebounding from a $0.030 support level. The token has seen an impressive 800% rise since its 2025 lows, fueled in part by growing adoption in Asia and a key step toward regulatory credibility with the SEC's review of an NFT-linked ETF application backed by CBOE[1].  

In contrast, Cosmos (ATOM) faced a volatile session that saw it drop from $4.77 to $4.48 over two days before staging a late rally. The token briefly pushed past $4.56 in the final hour of the session, breaking key resistance levels and establishing a new short-term support zone at $4.54. This bounce came on the back of Coinbase announcing support for the dYdX token (COSMOSDYDX) on the Cosmos network, offering a potential catalyst for institutional interest despite ongoing uncertainty[2].  

Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a standout performer in the presale arena, having raised over $374 million. Priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, the token is trading well below its confirmed launch price of $0.05, creating early value for investors. The project is gaining traction not just for its fundraising numbers but also for its Dashboard V4, which simulates a live trading environment for presale participants. This includes real-time price charts, order books, and interactive features such as referral tracking and bonus calculators. The platform also supports EVM compatibility and offers a low-code smart contract builder to streamline dApp development[3].  

BlockDAG's hybrid blockchain-DAG structure enables high throughput and scalability, making it an attractive proposition for developers. Furthermore, its expanding brand presence includes partnerships with Major League Rugby's Seattle Seawolves and Major League Cricket's Seattle Orcas, which are enhancing its real-world adoption through NFT-based experiences and fan tokens. These strategic alliances are contributing to a broader narrative that extends beyond the typical crypto investor base[3].  

PENGU's path to $0.082 will depend on whether it can maintain momentum and hold the $0.030 support level amid growing speculation around its NFT-linked ETF prospects. ATOM's near-term outlook remains uncertain, with traders watching closely to see if the recent rebound can hold and lead to a sustained recovery. However, BlockDAG's combination of strong presale performance, innovative platform features, and real-world partnerships is setting it apart in what has otherwise been a fragmented market week.  

As investors assess these developments, the broader cryptocurrency market remains in a state of flux, with short-term volatility likely to continue in the near term.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

An Ethereum initial coin offering whale sent a further 1,060 ETH worth $5.1 million to a deposit address labelled as belonging to Kraken on Thursday — their fourth transfer to the crypto exchange in as many days, according to onchain analysts.

The address beginning ""0x815"" previously sent 2,000 ETH ($8.6 million) on Monday, followed by 1,162 ETH ($5.2 million) and 1,121 ETH ($5.2 million) on Tuesday and Wednesday, taking their total deposits to around $24.1 million this week. Approximately 4,657 ETH remain at the address, per Arkham data, worth $21.9 million.

While it is not certain that the participant no longer owns the ETH, such transfers to crypto exchange deposit addresses often indicate selling.

The participant initially received 100,000 ETH for $31,100 at the time of the ICO, now valued at $471 million, Onchain Lens said, citing Nansen data. The whale still holds more than 50,000 ETH across multiple wallets in total, the analysts noted.

However, they are not the only Ethereum ICO participant to have sold ETH in recent days as the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency approached all-time highs for the first time since November 2021.

On Monday, another Ethereum ICO participant transferred 2,300 ETH, worth about $9.9 million, according to Lookonchain. That whale originally received 20,000 ETH for roughly $6,200, which is now valued at around $94 million.

The address starting ""0x845"" also deposited the funds to Kraken, according to Arkham labeling, leaving the address with 1,623 ETH remaining ($7.6 million).

The Ethereum ICO ran from July 22 to Sept. 2, 2014, raising about $18.3 million by selling over 60 million ETH at an average price of $0.31 per ETH, with 1 BTC initially buying 2,000 ETH. The funds, equivalent to 31,531 BTC, supported the development of Ethereum, which subsequently launched in July 2015 with an initial supply of 72 million ETH, 83% of which went to ICO investors.

Ethereum is currently trading for $4,718, per The Block's ETH price page, up 23% over the past week to come within 3% of its prior all-time high of around $4,868.

	 ICO-era whales are cashing in as the price struggles to break its all-time high of $4,891.

On-chain data shows that 98% of Ethereum is currently in profit, raising the likelihood of profit-taking. The price has pulled back 1% in the last 24 hours and is now finding support around $4,600.





An early Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) participant has realized significant gains after offloading a portion of their holdings.

The investor, who originally purchased 100,000 ETH for $31,000 during the ICO, recently sold 4,283 ETH for approximately $18.97 million.

Since 2021, the wallet has sold a total of 44,284 ETH, generating around $105 million at an average price of $2,378 per token. Despite these sales, the address still holds 55,716 ETH, currently valued at about $261.6 million.

Overall, the investor's total profit from these transactions stands at $366.8 million, marking an extraordinary 11,835x return on the initial investment, reported LookonChain.

Amid the massive 60% ETH price rally over the past month, the cryptocurrency's market cap climbed above $500 billion, while overtaking giants like Netflix.

Following the recent rally, about 98% of ETH holders are in profit, which further raises the chances of profit-taking.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported that Ethereum's “Percent Supply in Profit” metric exceeded 98% on Thursday, marking its highest level in two years.

The indicator tracks the proportion of ETH coins currently valued above their last on-chain transaction price. Coins are considered “in profit” when the market price is higher than their previous transaction price and “in loss” when it is lower.

Historically, levels above 95% indicate an overheated market nearing a local peak, as the majority of investors sit on unrealized gains. This increases the likelihood of profit-taking.

I keep saying this, your time to buy $ETH isn't right now, that was earlier.

I'd prefer to wait for a strong correction to be chasing a position in $ETH.

So far, ETH treasury firms like Bitmine Technologies have supported the upside rally amid heavy accumulation over the past two months. The coming weeks will reveal whether whales are using this demand as an opportunity to exit their positions.

When a seasoned Ethereum (ETH) seed investor makes a move, the market pays attention. This month, one such early ETH backer has revealed a portfolio tilt toward the Top Crypto ICO featuring Pepe Dollar (PEPD), along with meme heavyweights SPX6900 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE). The combination of meme culture, presale positioning, and strategic Ethereum alignment is creating buzz across both whale and retail communities.



The investor in question was among the earliest to back Ethereum in its 2014 crowdsale, turning a modest initial outlay into generational wealth. Their strategy in 2025 mirrors that early conviction — finding projects with massive upside before they hit mainstream markets. Pepe Dollar (PEPD), SPX6900, and LILPEPE tick the boxes: strong community traction, viral narrative potential, and tokenomics engineered for scarcity and explosive price action.

Pepe Dollar (PEPD) stands out as the only meme coin in this selection with a utility-driven roadmap. Built on Ethereum, it merges meme culture with DeFi-compatible payments, a Layer-2 scaling backbone, and aggressive burn mechanics. The current presale pricing gives early buyers a chance to position before exchange listings and before liquidity injections from DeFi pools. For the seed investor, PEPD is the “smart meme bet” — volatile enough to moon, yet structurally designed to sustain.



SPX6900 has become a phenomenon in absurdist meme coin culture. Its value proposition is anti-value — no utility, no roadmap, just pure community-driven virality. The seed investor isn't looking at SPX6900 for long-term fundamentals, but rather for its proven ability to rally thousands of percent on hype waves. In a bull market, these spikes can deliver quick profit rotations into more stable holdings.

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) takes meme utility in a different direction, running on its own Layer-2 chain optimized for meme coin deployment. With ultra-low fees, anti-bot features, and a meme-launchpad ecosystem, LILPEPE is positioned as a growth hub for the next wave of viral tokens. The presale's rapid sell-through rate and nearly doubled pricing in early stages suggest strong demand before listings.

For the Ethereum seed investor, the logic is simple: combine the security and liquidity advantages of Ethereum's network with high-octane meme projects that can 5x–20x in months. By entering presales like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and LILPEPE early, and holding a tactical SPX6900 position for volatility spikes, they're building a portfolio that balances moonshot potential with blockchain network strength.

Even with SPX6900's hype and LILPEPE's Layer-2 appeal, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) remains the central piece. Its deflationary tokenomics, Layer-2 scaling, and Ethereum-native architecture make it both a meme coin and an infrastructure-adjacent asset. That dual appeal could allow PEPD to retain value long after speculative froth fades.



The best cryptos to buy now, according to one of Ethereum's earliest backers, are not just blue-chip altcoins — they're presale meme coins with viral potential and network compatibility. Pepe Dollar (PEPD), SPX6900, and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) form a trifecta aimed squarely at turning 2025 into another cycle of generational crypto gains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","The anti-CBDC bill is a fake answer to real privacy problems","https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/the-anti-cbdc-bill-is-a-fake-answer-to-real-privacy-problems","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Just over a month ago, a last-minute political scuffle managed to get three crypto-related bills approved by the House of Representatives. One was the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, which had already passed the Senate and so was signed into law a few days later. Another was the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a digital asset market structure framework and will be picked up by the Senate for heated debate after the summer recess.

A third was the anti-CBDC bill, which aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from ever issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. As the simplest of the three, this one has been largely overlooked. It deserves more scrutiny, however, not for its stated purpose, but for the exaggerated claims, misdirection of intent and unnecessary limitations.

H. R. 1919, known as the ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,"" is mercifully short, at barely one page. In just a few words, it puts big barriers in the Fed's way should it ever want to issue a digital currency to replace physical cash. (Companion legislation has been introduced in the Senate and is currently pending before the banking committee.)

Specifically, it prohibits any Federal Reserve bank from offering financial products or services — digital or not — directly to individuals. It also blocks all Federal Reserve banks from issuing any form of digital money that is a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System and is widely available to the public.

The thing is, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself has often pointed out and on which Fed scholars agree, the U.S. central bank would not be able to go beyond its current mandate — such as directly serving the public — without congressional approval anyway. Given the need for wide buy-in for such a move from banks, businesses and consumers, who would most likely see this as Fed overreach, that congressional approval would hardly be forthcoming. 

The bill goes further than just a retail CBDC issuance prohibition, though: It also says that the Federal Reserve ""may not test, study, develop, create, or implement"" anything even similar to a central bank digital currency.

That's a harsh ban. It could be read as preventing the Fed's participation in international groups debating various forms of digital issuance, potentially limiting its global influence. It could also require the exit of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from Project Agorá, a Bank for International Settlements-helmed, multi-institution initiative to explore cross-border tokenized payments.

True, Project Agorá focuses on wholesale CBDCs which have the potential to improve cross-border interbank transfers. But the bill emphasizes that the ban extends to ""substantially similar"" assets, which could leave room for an oppressive interpretation. And blocking all testing and studying of digital issuance from a central bank, just in case, is not exactly pro-innovation.

So, why go to the trouble of enshrining into law a prohibition of something that can't happen anyway, and that unnecessarily blocks exploration of the impact of new technologies on the global banking system?

The politicians involved insist it's to protect our privacy. The not unreasonable fear is that, if physical cash is replaced by a digital equivalent issued by the central bank, the authorities will have insight into all of our transactions, and possibly also the means with which to influence our behavior.

Bank groups, especially those representing the largest institutions, did little in the way of a public campaign against the provisions in the stablecoin bill that could disintermediate traditional banking, but are picking up steam for the upcoming market structure fight. 

This assumes that the government doesn't already know where our money goes. Almost 90% of payments today are digital, and that percentage is likely to increase as our lives continue their migration online. Some of us take care to use cash in certain circumstances, but even this is likely to become increasingly difficult as businesses prefer accounting for digital payments to the management hassle of tallying and securing physical notes and coins.

So, how much privacy would we actually lose were the Federal Reserve to issue a retail CBDC? Not nearly as much as we're led to believe. Many of us would want to hold on to the option of paying with cash, even though fewer of us would actually do so. And even if the cash option were to get legislated away, these days there are digital alternatives such as cryptocurrencies that move on public networks outside of traditional domains.

Meanwhile, a much bigger threat to financial privacy is the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, which allows the authorities broad access to transaction histories collected from a wide range of intermediaries, and mandates that financial institutions flag any payment deemed ""suspicious,"" with penalties for underreporting.

Moves to curb the BSA's scope would have a material impact on our financial privacy, and while there have been a few isolated attempts, they have not progressed as far as the anti-CBDC bill. This is not surprising — authorities rarely want to give up surveillance rights once they have them. And politicians are usually reluctant to suggest they do so, in case they get blamed for any future adverse events.

What's more, the focus on privacy masks a bigger threat: the disruption of our financial structure in exchange for little benefit. The central bank would foist on merchants and individuals a product they don't need or want while essentially competing with the banks it is tasked to oversee, diverting consumer deposits into Federal Reserve-issued CBDC wallets, and suppressing bank payment fees by establishing a competing network. And a weaker commercial banking system in the world's largest economy could end up hurting confidence in the dollar.

Yet politicians are understandably loath to focus on that risk: ""We want to protect banks"" does not have the same ring to it as ""we want to protect your privacy.""

This highlights my main objection to the bill: It's theater. A retail CBDC in the U.S. is not going to happen, with or without new legislation. And blocking a retail CBDC will not restore financial privacy, yet the bill is presented as a triumph for the individual.

Nevertheless, the noise does suggest a glimmer of hope that the political support around the Anti-CBDC bill could rekindle the privacy debate, perhaps awakening new questions, triggering stronger objections and leading to reforms elsewhere.

An Office of Inspector General audit says the agency's existing program for overseeing banks' technology providers lacks clear goals and metrics. It recommends the adoption of a new risk-ranking methodology by 2026.

The former head of resolutions at the FDIC has high hopes for a bank that's been embroiled in the Synapse disaster.

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said the Fed is not tied to Wall Street or political interests and that independence is necessary to prevent inflation.

The payment company is collaborating with Brazil's national real-time payment network to reach more e-commerce merchants, while adding Affirm as an option to its in-store point of sale system. That, and more in the American Banker global payments and fintech roundup. 

The scams are becoming increasingly harder to detect, as fraudsters mimic authentic communications from banks.

Project Acacia is a research initiative led by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) that explores how digital forms of money—including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), stablecoins, and deposit tokens—can support the development of wholesale tokenized asset markets in Australia.

Project Acacia is being conducted in two phases: 

Fireblocks is exploring the use of wholesale CBDC to enable atomic settlement of tokenized securities and other forms of tokenized money. 

In collaboration with NotCentralised, Redbelly Network, the Australian Bond Exchange (ABE), Northern Trust, and Fasanara Capital, we aim to demonstrate how a wholesale CBDC can be used to reduce counterparty risk through delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized securities, while simultaneously ensuring the singleness of money between the different stablecoins held by the buyer and seller of the security.

This use case aims to demonstrate:

This includes testing the end-to-end capabilities required for the issuance, trading, settlement, and distribution of a tokenized security to clients of commercial banks holding Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs). 

The proof-of-concept involves simulated transactions, with plans to progress towards a live pilot using real assets and money in future phases. The transaction itself is set within the Australian market, denominated in Australian Dollars (AUD), and involves the transfer of security ownership, where commercial bank money is swapped for wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) on the Redbelly blockchain for asset settlement.

As a technology provider in Project Acacia and to use case collaborators, Fireblocks powers secure infrastructure that enables every stage of the transaction lifecycle—from issuance to final settlement.

Our contributions include:

Fireblocks' prior experience from the first phase of the CBDC pilot and our work in Project Acacia is helping to advance Australia's digital finance infrastructure. By demonstrating how a wholesale CBDC can enable secure, efficient settlement across various forms of tokenized money, we aim to lay the groundwork for scalable, risk-reduced tokenized asset markets.

- Pakistan partners with Japan to develop a secure, scalable CBDC framework, accelerating its digital financial transformation.

- The collaboration leverages Japan's fintech expertise to modernize Pakistan's infrastructure and align with global digital standards.

- Experts highlight the initiative as a potential model for developing economies adopting CBDCs without compromising stability or security.

- Japan's involvement strengthens stakeholder confidence in Pakistan's CBDC project and reflects growing international cooperation in digital finance.

Pakistan has initiated a collaboration with Japan to assist in the development of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), marking a pivotal moment in its digital financial transformation. The move reflects the country's intent to modernize its financial infrastructure and align with global standards in digital payments and monetary systems [1]. Japanese technical expertise in fintech and digital currency regulation is being leveraged to design a secure, efficient, and scalable CBDC framework, potentially fast-tracking Pakistan's timeline for launching a functional digital currency [1].

This partnership is viewed as a strategic effort to integrate advanced digital financial solutions into Pakistan's existing economic structure, enhancing efficiency and competitiveness in an increasingly digitized global market. While specific technical details of the collaboration have not been disclosed, the engagement highlights the value of international cooperation in shaping the future of digital finance [1].

Experts suggest that this initiative could provide a model for other developing economies seeking to adopt CBDCs without compromising financial stability or security. The involvement of Japan—a global leader in digital finance—also serves to bolster confidence among both domestic and international stakeholders regarding the credibility and potential of Pakistan's CBDC project [1].

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin prices rallied on Wednesday, August 11, reaching a fresh, all-time high above $124,000.

The world's most valuable digital currency had climbed to roughly $124,380 around 8:30 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data from TradingView.

Interestingly enough, ether, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, was also in the green, rising to more than $4,750, less than $150 from the record high it reached in 2021, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal.

When explaining these latest price movements, analyst Joe DiPasquale cited several variables.

“Bitcoin's push to new highs is being fueled by strong ETF inflows, ongoing institutional adoption, and a supportive macro backdrop with rate cuts back on the table,” said DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital.

“Once BTC broke through prior resistance, momentum traders piled in, amplifying the rally,” he added.

Going forward, investors have a positive view of the innovative asset, he continued, stating that “Sentiment remains firmly bullish as investors view bitcoin as both a growth asset and an inflation hedge.”

Several analysts spoke to the implications of bitcoin's latest zenith, including Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, who claimed that “Although BTC just barely put in a new ATH today (at least, so far), there is almost certainly much more to come.”

“Unlike any other digital or fiat asset, the fundamental nature of the BTC market is in the process of radical change,” he emphasized. “There is an ever-growing list of companies, countries, states, provinces and massive whales all beginning to accumulate BTC.”

“And, today, almost no one is still proclaiming BTC to be a currency or a medium of exchange,” Enneking continued. “But, virtually everyone agrees that it has become a nearly perfect store of value: finite supply, not controlled by any single (or small group) actor, easily transferrable, potentially not traceable (pass on a flash drive and avoid the blockchain), secure (although a quantum-defense fork will be needed relatively soon), durable and, increasingly, popular with large, institutional investors.”

“Many of these characteristics are new and, therefore, their implications have not been fully priced in,” he claimed.

“Over the past eight months, the value of BTC has only increased 20%; gold has appreciated more – and with far fewer, secular tailwinds. Therefore, there is a strong argument that BTC is significantly undervalued and I think we are just beginning to see the market understand and absorb that,” Enneking concluded.

Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR, also spoke to the implications of the latest price movements of bitcoin and ether, emphasizing how the overall crypto space has matured over time.

“Bitcoin setting a new all time high and ETH edging ever closer to doing so means we've moved from the speculative, retail-driven mania of previous bull runs to a place where institutions are adopting, real-world integrations are happening, and global liquidity is increasingly driving more efficient price discovery.” he stated via email.

“It's telling that both assets are surging like this in tandem, and it signals more broad market conviction than just a single-asset rally,” said Kurland. “Momentum this strong often has legs because it tends to draw in latecomers who can further fuel even more volatility.”

“Right now, the story is more about validation than euphoria — and it means that crypto is graduating from an ‘alternative' asset to an ‘essential' one in the foundational portfolio mix,” he stated.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Global markets are closely monitoring a bold decision by the US that has pushed Bitcoin into the stratosphere.

Bitcoin has surged to an unprecedented high above US $124,000 (A$189,000), marking another big 2025 milestone for the fast-growing digital asset.

The record came in the wake of a massive US policy shift that aims to allow more than 90 million Americans to include Bitcoin and other digital assets in their 401(k) retirement plans.

Analysts say that move could unlock over a trillion dollars in new investment. 

The landmark decision is being hailed as a turning point for cryptocurrency's path into the financial mainstream. Founded in 2009, the digital currency spent years on the fringe before making its initial breakthrough in 2017 when prices surged.

While still heavily criticised by economic purists, its relatively rapid transition from an obscure niche product to a solution for an entire nation's retirement funds speaks volumes.

Global markets are closely monitoring the development, with speculation that other nations may soon follow suit to avoid losing ground in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector.

“By unlocking the trillion-dollar US retirement market, the United States has taken one of its most significant steps yet toward cementing crypto as a mainstream asset class,” Mena Theodorou, Co-founder of Aussie crypto exchange Coinstash, told news.com.au in a statement.

“The implications extend far beyond American borders. Global markets are now watching closely, and many will be unwilling to risk falling behind. Where the US leads, the rest of the world often follows.

“Institutional interest remains the driving force. Bitcoin ETFs continue to record strong inflows week after week, corporate treasuries are adding BTC to balance sheets, and long-term holders are showing little sign of selling. 

“Combined with macro tailwinds, from a weakening US dollar to growing expectations of substantial interest rate cuts, Bitcoin's resilience is solidifying its role as a hedge and a cornerstone of the modern financial system.”

Some market strategists believe the rally's next leg could happen very quickly. While the climb to $100,000 was turbulent, the push to $124,000 has been relatively smooth, prompting some to predict a rapid move toward $150,000 and beyond before the year is out.

Just over a month ago, a last-minute political scuffle managed to get three crypto-related bills approved by the House of Representatives. One was the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, which had already passed the Senate and so was signed into law a few days later. Another was the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a digital asset market structure framework and will be picked up by the Senate for heated debate after the summer recess.

A third was the anti-CBDC bill, which aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from ever issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. As the simplest of the three, this one has been largely overlooked. It deserves more scrutiny, however, not for its stated purpose, but for the exaggerated claims, misdirection of intent and unnecessary limitations.

H. R. 1919, known as the ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,"" is mercifully short, at barely one page. In just a few words, it puts big barriers in the Fed's way should it ever want to issue a digital currency to replace physical cash. (Companion legislation has been introduced in the Senate and is currently pending before the banking committee.)

Specifically, it prohibits any Federal Reserve bank from offering financial products or services — digital or not — directly to individuals. It also blocks all Federal Reserve banks from issuing any form of digital money that is a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System and is widely available to the public.

The thing is, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself has often pointed out and on which Fed scholars agree, the U.S. central bank would not be able to go beyond its current mandate — such as directly serving the public — without congressional approval anyway. Given the need for wide buy-in for such a move from banks, businesses and consumers, who would most likely see this as Fed overreach, that congressional approval would hardly be forthcoming. 

The bill goes further than just a retail CBDC issuance prohibition, though: It also says that the Federal Reserve ""may not test, study, develop, create, or implement"" anything even similar to a central bank digital currency.

That's a harsh ban. It could be read as preventing the Fed's participation in international groups debating various forms of digital issuance, potentially limiting its global influence. It could also require the exit of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from Project Agorá, a Bank for International Settlements-helmed, multi-institution initiative to explore cross-border tokenized payments.

True, Project Agorá focuses on wholesale CBDCs which have the potential to improve cross-border interbank transfers. But the bill emphasizes that the ban extends to ""substantially similar"" assets, which could leave room for an oppressive interpretation. And blocking all testing and studying of digital issuance from a central bank, just in case, is not exactly pro-innovation.

So, why go to the trouble of enshrining into law a prohibition of something that can't happen anyway, and that unnecessarily blocks exploration of the impact of new technologies on the global banking system?

The politicians involved insist it's to protect our privacy. The not unreasonable fear is that, if physical cash is replaced by a digital equivalent issued by the central bank, the authorities will have insight into all of our transactions, and possibly also the means with which to influence our behavior.

Bank groups, especially those representing the largest institutions, did little in the way of a public campaign against the provisions in the stablecoin bill that could disintermediate traditional banking, but are picking up steam for the upcoming market structure fight. 

This assumes that the government doesn't already know where our money goes. Almost 90% of payments today are digital, and that percentage is likely to increase as our lives continue their migration online. Some of us take care to use cash in certain circumstances, but even this is likely to become increasingly difficult as businesses prefer accounting for digital payments to the management hassle of tallying and securing physical notes and coins.

So, how much privacy would we actually lose were the Federal Reserve to issue a retail CBDC? Not nearly as much as we're led to believe. Many of us would want to hold on to the option of paying with cash, even though fewer of us would actually do so. And even if the cash option were to get legislated away, these days there are digital alternatives such as cryptocurrencies that move on public networks outside of traditional domains.

Meanwhile, a much bigger threat to financial privacy is the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, which allows the authorities broad access to transaction histories collected from a wide range of intermediaries, and mandates that financial institutions flag any payment deemed ""suspicious,"" with penalties for underreporting.

Moves to curb the BSA's scope would have a material impact on our financial privacy, and while there have been a few isolated attempts, they have not progressed as far as the anti-CBDC bill. This is not surprising — authorities rarely want to give up surveillance rights once they have them. And politicians are usually reluctant to suggest they do so, in case they get blamed for any future adverse events.

What's more, the focus on privacy masks a bigger threat: the disruption of our financial structure in exchange for little benefit. The central bank would foist on merchants and individuals a product they don't need or want while essentially competing with the banks it is tasked to oversee, diverting consumer deposits into Federal Reserve-issued CBDC wallets, and suppressing bank payment fees by establishing a competing network. And a weaker commercial banking system in the world's largest economy could end up hurting confidence in the dollar.

Yet politicians are understandably loath to focus on that risk: ""We want to protect banks"" does not have the same ring to it as ""we want to protect your privacy.""

This highlights my main objection to the bill: It's theater. A retail CBDC in the U.S. is not going to happen, with or without new legislation. And blocking a retail CBDC will not restore financial privacy, yet the bill is presented as a triumph for the individual.

Nevertheless, the noise does suggest a glimmer of hope that the political support around the Anti-CBDC bill could rekindle the privacy debate, perhaps awakening new questions, triggering stronger objections and leading to reforms elsewhere.

An Office of Inspector General audit says the agency's existing program for overseeing banks' technology providers lacks clear goals and metrics. It recommends the adoption of a new risk-ranking methodology by 2026.

 Military Bank, a Vietnamese state-controlled lender, has partnered with the parent company of South Korea's Upbit exchange, Dunamu, to develop a cryptocurrency exchange. 

Vietnamese state-controlled bank Military Bank (MB) plans to launch a regulated crypto exchange in partnership with Dunamu, the parent company of South Korean crypto exchange Upbit.

According to a Wednesday announcement from Dunamu, the company has signed a memorandum of understanding with Military Bank. In a Facebook post, Military Bank said Dunamu will support it building a cryptocurrency exchange in Vietnam with its technology.

“MB and Upbit will be trusted partners, working together to promote Vietnam's digital financial market,” Military Bank Chairman Luu Trung Thai said.

Military Bank is a financial institution under the Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, making the crypto exchange a government-led initiative.

In March, Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Duc Chi announced a pilot program for financial technology companies in Vietnam, including crypto exchanges. According to the official online newspaper of the local government, Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Pham Tien Dung announced during an event held earlier this month that Vietnam has officially established a legal framework for digital assets, including tokenized assets.

The leadership of SBV — the country's central bank — noted that the pilot program submitted in March by the Deputy Finance Minister was key to the development. The other two elements necessary were a resolution submitted by the National Assembly and a law on industry and digital technology.

“We're acting through law to facilitate investment and business in this sector,” SBV's Dung said.

Vietnam's crypto exchanges will be piloted at an international financial center. Still, the pilot scheme is being finalized, and multiple exchanges will be allowed, according to the Ministry of Finance.

While some reports suggested that this is Vietnam's first domestic crypto exchange, this is incorrect. The country currently hosts BitcoinVN, a no-sign-up instant exchange that supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USDt (USDT) and Ginero, operated by Bitcoin Vietnam.

Nami.Exchange also offers both spot and futures crypto trading as part of Nami Technology JSC, a Vietnam-registered company. 

Still, with Vietnam's pilot regulatory regime likely to result in licensing requirements in the future, Military Bank's crypto exchange could become the first regulated exchange under the new framework.

The digital economy is changing fast, and so is the way we think about our paychecks. Imagine if your paycheck wasn't just a figure in your bank account, but a living digital asset that reflects the work you do, in real-time. This idea is being brought to life by platforms like Soneium, which intelligently integrate culture and technology to create crypto payroll solutions that are more accessible and secure.

Crypto payroll platforms are being adopted more often, especially as businesses go remote. Companies are on the lookout for streamlined payroll processes that work for a global workforce. This is where crypto payroll platforms step in, allowing businesses to pay employees using digital currencies. Naturally, this is particularly appealing to tech-savvy employees and those in creative fields.

Soneium, built atop Ethereum's Layer 2, is a prime example of this trend. It uses blockchain tech to ensure transactions are smooth and offers a crypto-friendly payroll platform that supports various payment structures, including stablecoin payments. This adaptability is vital for businesses competing for talent.

Web3 is bringing a fresh take on corporate banking by providing decentralized solutions that make financial management more efficient. Traditional banking often lags behind the fast-paced digital world, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In contrast, Web3 corporate banking solutions allow for real-time transactions, lower fees, and better security.

For startups, the availability of crypto banking is particularly important. It allows them access to essential financial services without the limitations imposed by traditional banks. This not only fosters innovation but also encourages the creation of crypto-native business tools for modern enterprises.

What's particularly exciting is Soneium's focus on culture. By intertwining technology with cultural aspects, Soneium is crafting a unique ecosystem. Their partnerships with anime brands and emphasis on community engagement show how important culture is in shaping crypto payroll solutions.

With the digital economy evolving, the need for culturally relevant payment solutions is only going to increase. Soneium's commitment to building a lively community around its platform places it in a strong position to lead in this domain, opening doors to crypto payroll for DAOs and decentralized groups alike.

Of course, while the potential of crypto payroll solutions is huge, startups face their fair share of challenges. Regulatory hurdles, tech integration issues, and market acceptance can be tough. Complying with KYC and AML regulations can be particularly challenging, as the decentralized nature of crypto lacks clear guidelines.

But challenges can also lead to opportunities. Startups that manage to tackle regulatory concerns and create user-friendly platforms could find themselves thriving in the evolving landscape of crypto payroll. By harnessing blockchain tech and focusing on user experience, solutions can be developed that meet regulations while enhancing the payroll process.

Soneium's combination of blockchain tech and cultural engagement sets the stage for a new era in crypto payroll solutions. As the demand for innovative payment methods grows, platforms like Soneium are leading the charge, making crypto payroll more user-friendly and culturally relevant.

The future of compensation in the digital economy is bright. Crypto payroll solutions are set to change how we think about work and payment. With both culture and technology driving this change, Soneium isn't just a payroll platform; it's shaping the future of how we work. For creators, gamers, and remote workers, the possibilities are as broad as the digital landscape itself.

Bitcoin BTC$118,031.06 surged past $124,000, setting its fourth all-time high of 2025. 

On-chain data from Glassnode suggests this could mark the early stages of a continued bull market.

A key metric underpinning this view is the realized price, which measures the total value of all bitcoins at the price they were last moved on-chain, divided by the number of coins in circulation. This metric at $51,888 has now climbed above bitcoin's 200-week moving average (200WMA), a long-term trendline often seen as a dividing line between bear and bull markets.

History shows that when the realized price moves above the 200WMA and continues higher, as it did in the 2017 and 2021 cycles, the uptrend is sustained for a longer time. The 200WMA currently stands at $51,344, acting as a long-term support level that has historically defined the floor during bear markets.

This level has only been breached during periods of extreme market stress. The most recent example came at the end of the 2022 bear market, when bitcoin fell sharply amid the FTX collapse. The realized price dropped below the 200WMA in June 2022 and remained there for nearly three years before reclaiming it in 2025.

Breaking back above the 200WMA is significant, as it indicates renewed investor confidence and a shift in market structure. 

If historical patterns hold, this technical development could be the precursor to a sustained rally. With macroeconomic conditions and institutional interest aligning, Bitcoin's recent price action may be the opening chapter of its next major growth phase.

Since mid-July, bitcoin's (BTC) ascent has slowed above $120,000. Prices hit a new high of $124,157 early Thursday but have since pulled back to $123,000, lacking momentum.

This raises a question: who is cashing out of bitcoin and adding selling pressure to the market? According to observers, the answer lies in blockchain data, which shows old wallets have been liquidating their holdings.

""It may be linked to concentrated selling pressure from long-term holders who have recently accelerated their selling,"" Gabriel Halm, senior blockchain analyst at Sentora, told CoinDesk. 

""Historically, long-term holders' selling phases are cleanly defined within the bitcoin cycle. This time, however, accumulation during Q2's pullback has given way to renewed selling, suggesting the market's structure may be shifting.""

The supply of BTC controlled by long-term holders or wallets with a history of owning coins for 155 days or more has declined by over 300,000 BTC in four weeks, according to data source Bitcoin Magazine.

Several dormant wallets, inactive for over a decade, have become active in the past four weeks, moving coins on-chain for the first time in years, possibly in profit-taking operations.

Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode stated last week that profit-taking by long-term holders continues, albeit at a slower rate than in July.

""$BTC profit realization by long-term holders (7D SMA) has slowed in August after a July run consistently above $1B/day - one of the largest profit-taking periods on record,"" Glassnode said on X.

Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, stated that the supply from ancient wallets has been capping upside but has been largely absorbed well, matching the pattern seen last year when Germany's Saxony state liquidated its holdings.

""Price levels in BTC have tended to consolidate around psychological levels (think $100,000, $110,000, $120,000) and specifically around ATH levels. This same pattern was seen just last month at the $110,000 level as we touched all-time highs at the 112 area and then drifted lower several times,"" Gaer said.

The persistent selling of higher strike calls by institutions could have influenced the rally speed. They typically do so to earn an additional yield on top of spot market holdings. According to Gaer, the so-called call overwriting has led to a volatility meltdown. Implied volatility, which represents expected price turbulence over a specific period, is driven by demand for options.

""Call overwriting activity by long-term holders continues in a seemingly unabated fashion, with a vol crush that's left BTC with weekend vols in the teens- unheard of in my experience. I use the phrase '40 is the new 60' when referencing the overall BTC [implied] volatility repricing– this is a historical sign of a market maturing,"" Gaer said.

The path of least resistance remains upside, thanks to signs of strong dip-demand and macroeconomic tailwinds.

""1.88 million addresses bought 1.3 million BTC at an average of $118,000, indicating a strong layer of demand that has so far prevented a deeper pullback,"" Halm told CoinDesk.

Speaking of macro, the market is increasingly getting comfortable with the idea that the new normal inflation in the post-COVID world is well above the Fed's 2% target and expects the central bank to cut rates in September.

Steve Gregory, founder of Vtrader, expects renewed rotation of funds into bitcoin from ether.

""We may see a rotation back to bitcoin and a break of the $120,000 level as bitcoin's 3-month volatility hit its lowest since September 2023. Furthermore, 95% of ETH wallets are now in profit, indicating that traders may make a logical rotation back to BTC,"" Gregory said.

Bitcoin BTC$118,031.06 surged past its previous record on Wednesday, rallying in tandem with U.S. equities as investors continued piled into risk assets ahead of key macro catalysts.

BTC rose above $124,000 in early Asia trading on Thursday, topping the July 14 high of $123,205, before seeing slight profit taking. The move came as the S&P 500 logged its second consecutive record close, meaning BTC mirrored a rally in stocks as both markets feed off the same bullish macro backdrop.

It became the fifth-largest asset by market capitalization across all assets, data shows, crossing Google's $2.4 trillion.

The milestone reflects a year-long build in bullish sentiment, fueled by a friendlier regulatory backdrop under President Donald Trump and the rapid adoption of corporate treasury strategies centered on bitcoin accumulation.

Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) pioneered the playbook of stockpiling BTC as a balance sheet asset, a move now mirrored by smaller public companies — and increasingly, by Ether proponents.

The result has been broad-based strength across top digital assets, with bitcoin's market capitalization climbing to $2.46 trillion and Ether's to nearly $575 billion, according to CoinGecko. Together, the two dominate roughly 70% of all crypto trading activity.

The rally is also riding a wave of macro optimism. U.S. inflation data this week landed in line with expectations, reinforcing bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.

Lower borrowing costs tend to boost valuations for riskier assets by easing financial conditions, creating a spillover from blue-chip equities into high-volatility corners like crypto.

With bitcoin now firmly above the $120,000 resistance zone, some technical analysts are eyeing $135,000–$138,000 as the next upside target, as CoinDesk reported earlier in the week.

 Bitcoin hit a new peak of $124,500 and now has two possible paths ahead, according to Bitcoin OG Samson Mow. 

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, and its next move will either be a surge into new price discovery or a halt to make way for the oncoming altcoin season, said Bitcoin pioneer Samson Mow.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices reached $124,500 on Coinbase in early trading on Thursday, according to TradingView. The move added 3.5% to the asset on the day and pushed total crypto market capitalization to a record high of $4.26 trillion.

Bitcoin OG Samson Mow said there are now two possible paths for Bitcoin:

“We Godzilla or Omega up, suck all the oxygen out of the room, and altcoins drop 30-40%,” or “alt mania” peaks, triggering a massive sell-off as the “Bagholder's Dilemma loses equilibrium,” which would see BTC dipping briefly before going up again when altcoins tank, he said on Thursday. 

The Bitcoin maximalist couldn't resist having another bash at Ether (ETH), as he compared market capitalizations and said, “But no matter what, it's impossible that Ethereum is worth 4,600,000 BTC,” before adding, “this has to correct sooner or later.”  

Mow discussed “Bagholder's Dilemma” earlier this week when he speculated that Ether investors will soon start dumping and rotate back into Bitcoin. 

He said that it will be challenging for ETH to break all-time highs because “the closer you reach that psychological level, the stronger the drive to sell.” The same premise doesn't appear to apply to Bitcoin, according to Mow. 

Ether has outperformed Bitcoin by a huge margin over the past 30 days, surging 58% while BTC has gained just 3.5% over the same period. 

The Jan3 CEO also said there will be more Bitcoin all-time highs, “but I think we will see a pullback because alts are running too hot now.”

Once the “altcoin mania” passes, Bitcoin will take off, “This is just how it's always been,” he said.

Bitcoin dominance has dropped about 10% since late June, falling below 60% this week for the first time since January, according to TradingView. Sharp declines in Bitcoin dominance have been historical indicators that altseason is imminent. 

Some industry experts agreed that investor interest in Bitcoin may cool, with decentralized finance potentially taking the spotlight. 

“We believe ETH and DeFi assets will continue to outperform here, supported by the regulatory environment and the tokenisation of RWA (real-world assets),” Apollo Capital's chief investment officer, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph.

Total value locked in DeFi is at a peak and rising quickly, which is fuelling DeFi revenue, he said, adding: 

Director at LVRG Research Nick Ruck told Cointelegraph that BTC may consolidate near current levels. “Declining dominance and rising altcoin volumes suggest an altseason is starting, led by ETH's outperformance and speculative inflows into DeFi tokens.”

 Bitcoin technical indicators are starting to show some signs of BTC price overheating, but onchain data suggests otherwise. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $124,450 on Thursday, and signs of overheating are starting to appear.

Several technical indicators suggest a potential top at $124,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) recorded a new all-time high of $124,450 during the early Asian trading hours on Thursday. However, BTC price had pulled back to $121,670 at the time of writing.

Despite the correction, there were mixed signals about whether the price rally had peaked or whether it was a healthy pullback.

Bitcoin was not showing any signs of peaking despite reaching new all-time highs on Thursday, with several onchain metrics suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.

Overheating indicators such as funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors was limited, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Bitcoin's funding rate, an indicator used to indicate an overheated market, shows an increase in long bets. However, these bets remain much smaller compared to previous peaks, suggesting that Bitcoin still has further to go before overheating conditions kick in. 

A spike in Bitcoin funding rates can sometimes cause worry among market participants about increased Bitcoin volatility and liquidation risks.

Still, the funding rates are only moderately positive, signaling that traders are optimistic about Bitcoin's price and buyers are willing to pay sellers a fee to hold their positions.

Meanwhile, the short-term holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric reveals that few have taken profits during the recent rise despite STHs returning to profit. 

This indicator is currently valued at 1.01%, suggesting that STHs are realizing some profits at much lower rates. Unlike in March 2024 and November 2024, profit-taking activity remains relatively subdued.

The 30 bull market peak indicators from CoinGlass suggest that Bitcoin shows no signs of overheating with $187,000 BTC price in play.

A combination of technical indicators suggests BTC price might have topped at $124,000, according to popular analyst Captain Faibik.

In his Bitcoin analysis on Thursday, the analyst said that after grabbing liquidity on its run to all-time highs, the BTC/USD pair has sent a number of bearish signals, including the appearance of the “9th TD sell candle” on the daily chart. 

The bearish divergence from the daily relative strength index (RSI) shows weakening momentum, while the rising wedge formation indicates diminishing buying pressure, often preceding a price decline.

Captain Faibik wrote:

Bitcoin's RSI shows a retracement after reaching overbought conditions on multiple time frames. Bitcoin's RSI hit 72, 71 and 70 on the four-hour, 12-hour and daily charts, respectively, as BTC hit fresh all-time highs.

The retracement to $121,000 from $124,000 followed overbought conditions as shown on the chart below. Overbought conditions resulting from Bitcoin's run to its previous all-time highs of $123,000 in July also preceded a 6% drawdown to $115,000.

Even though these metrics are warning of a possible pullback in the short term, it is important to note that RSI conditions do not always guarantee a trend reversal. Crypto prices are volatile, and BTC could continue to rally, fueled by increasing institutional demand and money supply growth.

 Ether investors seem to be pricing in “perfection” — but what if inflation increases or a major war breaks out? 

Ether's recent rally to over $4,700 is being largely propped up by expectations of a US federal rate cut in September, which could prove disastrous if it doesn't eventuate, crypto analysts warn.

“The main issue right now is that the whole market move is based on an assumption that the Fed will give the market a rate cut next month,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph on Thursday, as Ether (ETH) continues to trade at only 2.80% below its 2021 all-time high, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Market participants are expecting a 95.8% chance the Fed will cut rates in September, according to the CME Watch Tool. 

“It looks like we're priced for perfection, and that's always when you need to be most careful,” Hundal added, pointing to the mounting Ether ETF flows and steady funding rates. 

On Monday, spot Ether ETFs recorded their biggest day of net inflows ever, with flows across all funds totalling $1.01 billion. Over the past seven days alone, the asset has surged 30%.

Capriole Investments founder and REF founder Charles Edwards told Cointelegraph he is highly bullish on Ether and expects its price to go higher, but agrees an unexpected move from the Fed could have an impact:

Edwards explains that it may “cause liquidity to get scared where capital just kind of freezes up and flows stop.”

While Edwards won't “rule out anything,” he says he remains bullish as long as institutional demand exceeds Bitcoin's (BTC) and ETH's supply. “Like there's only one way price can go, to be honest,” he said. 

“I'm open-minded to all outcomes, but right now, I see it going a lot higher,” Edwards said.

Edwards said Ether could “probably quite easily double” in the coming months if Bitcoin climbs between $150,000 and $200,000.

“It can definitely see significant appreciation, especially given the backdrop of strong fundamentals,” he said.

While market participants are tipping for a rate cut in September, not all economists are convinced that this is a done deal. 

On Wednesday, Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said, “The biggest thing to watch now is … are [Fed officials] going to push back on market expectations.”

“If they think the market is wrong, they will go out there, because they've got a job to do to talk down the market,” she said.

Meanwhile, Jeff Schmid, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City president, suggested the current rate is appropriate. 

“With the economy still showing momentum, growing business optimism, and inflation still stuck above our objective, retaining a modestly restrictive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for the time being,” Schmid said.

On Wednesday, the July US CPI print showed inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June and below the forecast of 2.8%.

New Brain Device Is First to Read Out Inner Speech

A new brain prosthesis can read out inner thoughts in real time, helping people with ALS and brain stem stroke communicate fast and comfortably

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Allison Parshall

After a brain stem stroke left him almost entirely paralyzed in the 1990s, French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby wrote a book about his experiences—letter by letter, blinking his left eye in response to a helper who repeatedly recited the alphabet. Today people with similar conditions often have far more communication options. Some devices, for example, track eye movements or other small muscle twitches to let users select words from a screen.

And on the cutting edge of this field, neuroscientists have more recently developed brain implants that can turn neural signals directly into whole words. These brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) largely require users to physically attempt to speak, however—and that can be a slow and tiring process. But now a new development in neural prosthetics changes that, allowing users to communicate by simply thinking what they want to say.

The new system relies on much of the same technology as the more common “attempted speech” devices. Both use sensors implanted in a part of the brain called the motor cortex, which sends motion commands to the vocal tract. The brain activation detected by these sensors is then fed into a machine-learning model to interpret which brain signals correspond to which sounds for an individual user. It then uses those data to predict which word the user is attempting to say.

But the motor cortex doesn't only light up when we attempt to speak; it's also involved, to a lesser extent, in imagined speech. The researchers took advantage of this to develop their “inner speech” decoding device and published the results on Thursday in Cell. The team studied three people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and one with a brain stem stroke, all of whom had previously had the sensors implanted. Using this new “inner speech” system, the participants needed only to think a sentence they wanted to say and it would appear on a screen in real time. While previous inner speech decoders were limited to only a handful of words, the new device allowed participants to draw from a dictionary of 125,000 words.

A participant is using the inner speech neuroprosthesis. The text above is the cued sentence, and the text below is what's being decoded in real-time as she imagines speaking the sentence.

“As researchers, our goal is to find a system that is comfortable [for the user] and ideally reaches a naturalistic ability,” says lead author Erin Kunz, a postdoctoral researcher who is developing neural prostheses at Stanford University. Previous research found that “physically attempting to speak was tiring and that there were inherent speed limitations with it, too,” she says. Attempted speech devices such as the one used in the study require users to inhale as if they are actually saying the words. But because of impaired breathing, many users need multiple breaths to complete a single word with that method. Attempting to speak can also produce distracting noises and facial expressions that users find undesirable. With the new technology, the study's participants could communicate at a comfortable conversational rate of about 120 to 150 words per minute, with no more effort than it took to think of what they wanted to say.

Like most BCIs that translate brain activation into speech, the new technology only works if people are able to convert the general idea of what they want to say into a plan for how to say it. Alexander Huth, who researches BCIs at the University of California, Berkeley, and wasn't involved in the new study, explains that in typical speech, “you start with an idea of what you want to say. That idea gets translated into a plan for how to move your [vocal] articulators. That plan gets sent to the actual muscles, and then they carry it out.” But in many cases, people with impaired speech aren't able to complete that first step. “This technology only works in cases where the ‘idea to plan' part is functional but the ‘plan to movement' part is broken”—a collection of conditions called dysarthria—Huth says.

According to Kunz, the four research participants are eager about the new technology. “Largely, [there was] a lot of excitement about potentially being able to communicate fast again,” she says—adding that one participant was particularly thrilled by his newfound potential to interrupt a conversation—something he couldn't do with the slower pace of an attempted speech device.

To ensure private thoughts remained private, the researchers implemented a code phrase: “chitty chitty bang bang.” When internally spoken by participants, this would prompt the BCI to start or stop transcribing. 

Brain-reading implants inevitably raise concerns about mental privacy. For now, Huth isn't concerned about the technology being misused or developed recklessly, speaking to the integrity of the research groups involved in neural prosthetics research. “I think they're doing great work; they're led by doctors; they're very patient-focused. A lot of what they do is really trying to solve problems for the patients,” he says, “even when those problems aren't necessarily things that we might think of,” such as being able to interrupt a conversation or “making a voice that sounds more like them.” 

For Kunz, this research is particularly close to home. “My father actually had ALS and lost the ability to speak,” she says, adding that this is why she got into her field of research. “I kind of became his own personal speech translator toward the end of his life since I was kind of the only one that could understand him. That's why I personally know the importance and the impact this sort of research can have.”

The contribution and willingness of the research participants are crucial in studies like this, Kunz notes. “The participants that we have are truly incredible individuals who volunteered to be in the study not necessarily to get a benefit to themselves but to help develop this technology for people with paralysis down the line. And I think that they deserve all the credit in the world for that.”

They can add a quantum battery to the entangled pair to store entanglement information, which could help improve the efficiency of quantum systems. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The worlds of quantum and classical physics seldom get along. Take, for instance, the concept of quantum entanglement. The central feature of quantum mechanics, entanglement, details how the information of two particles can correlate with each no matter the distance. This idea is so strange in the classical sense that Albert Einstein famously labeled the idea “spooky action at a distance” and left it at that. 

However, a new study explores how the rules of quantum entanglement do have a classical counterpart of a sort: the laws of thermodynamics. In an idealized quantum system, for example, entanglement does feature a kind of entropy analogous to the first law of thermodynamics. 

Now, scientists wonder if the second law—that perfect reversibility is possible in a highly efficient ideal system—could also apply to entanglement, and a team of researchers thinks they may have an answer thanks to a high-tech workaround: quantum batteries. The results of the study were published in the journal Physical Review Letters. 

“Finding a second law analogous to the second law of thermodynamics has been an open problem in quantum information science,” Tulja Varun Kondra, a former University of Warsaw Ph.D. student and study co-author now working at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, said in a press statement. “Solving this has been our primary motivation.”

Most scenarios designed to investigate reversibility focus on two particles (usually nicknamed Alice and Bob), but are restricted locally and must act through classical means, such as the internet. These are known as local operations and classical communication (LOCC) operations, and so far, scientists have discerned that in this scenario, entanglement is indeed irreversible. To find out if this was a universal rule, the authors needed to dig deeper by “somehow go[ing] beyond LOCC in a meaningful way and recover[ing] reversibility,” according to Varun Kondra. 

The team succeeded by introducing another party to this quantum duo known as a “quantum battery.” Just as a normal battery stores thermodynamic energy, a quantum battery stores entanglement. The authors say that this battery ensures no net entanglement is lost, and when assisting with LOCC operations, mixed-state entanglement transformations can be perfectly reversible. 

“We can have a battery that is supposed to preserve coherence or free energy, and then we can formulate a reversible framework in this setting where, instead of entanglement, we reversibly manipulate that particular resource of our system,” Streltsov said. “Though many of these other principles of reversibility have already been confirmed via other approaches, our technique offers a unified proof framework based on well-established physical principles.”

The authors said that proving reversibility across various quantum scenarios could open a whole “family” of second laws for quantum manipulation. They also hope that future research will use reversibility to create more highly efficient quantum technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Unprecedented climate shocks are changing the Great Lakes forever","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083616.htm","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:13:40 GMT","

Heat waves and cold spells are part of life on the Great Lakes. But new research from the University of Michigan shows that is true today in a fundamentally different way than it was even 30 years ago.

""The appearance of these extreme temperatures is increasing,"" said Hazem Abdelhady, a postdoctoral research fellow in the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability, or SEAS. ""For most lakes, the appearance is up more than 100% compared with before 1998."" That timing is significant because it coincides with the 1997-1998 El Niño, which is one of the strongest on record, he added.

To reveal this trend, Abdelhady and his colleagues developed a state-of-the-art approach to modeling the surface temperature of the Great Lakes, which allowed them to study heat waves and cold spells dating back to 1940. The surface water temperature of the Great Lakes plays an important role in the weather, which is an obvious concern for residents, travelers and shipping companies in the region.But the uptick in extreme temperature events could also disrupt ecosystems and economies supported by the lakes in more subtle ways, Abdelhady said.

""These types of events can have huge impacts on the fishing industry, which is a billion-dollar industry, for example,"" Abdelhady said. Tribal, recreational and commercial fishing in the Great Lakes account for a total value of more than $7 billion annually, according to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

While fish can swim to cooler or warmer waters to tolerate gradual temperature changes, the same isn't always true for sudden jumps in either direction, Abdelhady said. Fish eggs are particularly susceptible to abnormal temperature spikes or drops.

Hot and cold streaks can also disrupt the natural mixing and stratifying cycles of the lakes, which affects the health and water quality of lakes that people rely on for recreation and drinking water.

Now that the researchers have revealed these trends on each of the Great Lakes, they're working to build on that to predict future extreme temperature events as the average temperature of the lakes -- and planet -- continue to warm. In studying those events and their connections with global climate phenomena, such as El Niños and La Niñas, we can better prepare to brace for their impact, Abdelhady said.

""If we can understand these events, we can start thinking about how to protect against them,"" Abdelahdy said.

The study was conducted through the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, or CIGLR, and published in Communications Earth & Environment, part of the Nature journal family. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation, its Global Centers program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.

Capturing the greatness of the lakes

One of the challenges of this work was the size of the problem itself. Although researchers have developed computer models that can simulate processes in most lakes around the world, the Great Lakes aren't most lakes.

For starters, they're an interconnected system of five lakes. They also contain more than a fifth of the world's fresh surface water. And the length of their shoreline is comparable to that of the U.S.'s entire Atlantic coast -- including the gulf states.

In many regards, the Great Lakes have more in common with coastal oceans than with other lakes, said study coauthor Ayumi Fujisaki-Manome, who is an associate research scientist with SEAS and CIGLR.

""We can't use the traditional, simpler models for the Great Lakes because they really don't do well,"" Fujisaki-Manome said.

So Abdelhady turned to modeling approaches used to study coastal oceans and tailored them for the Great Lakes. But there was also a data hurdle to overcome in addition to the modeling challenges.

Satellites have enabled routine direct observations of the Great Lakes starting about 45 years ago, Fujisaki-Manome said. But when talking about climate trends and epochs, researchers need to work with longer time periods.

""The great thing with this study is we were able to extend that historical period by almost double,"" Fujisaki-Manome said.

By working with available observational data and trusted data from global climate simulations, Abdelhady could model Great Lakes temperature data and validate it with confidence back to 1940.

""That's why we use modeling a lot of the time. We want to know about the past or the future or a point in space we can't necessarily get to,"" said coauthor Drew Groneworld, an associate professor in SEAS and a leader of the Global Center for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters. ""With the Great Lakes, we have all three of those.""

David Cannon, an assistant research scientist with CIGRL, and Jia Wang, a climatologist and oceanographer with NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, also contributed to the study. The study is a perfect example of how collaborations between universities and government science agencies can create a flow of knowledge that benefits the public and the broader research community, Gronewold said.

The team's model is now available for other research groups studying the Great Lakes to explore their questions. For the team at U-M, its next steps are using the model to explore spatial differences across smaller areas of the Great Lakes and using the model to look forward in time.

""I'm very curious if we can anticipate the next big shift or the next big tipping point,"" Gronewold said. ""We didn't anticipate the last one. Nobody predicted that, in 1997, there was going to be a warm-winter El Niño that changed everything.""

Scientists have discovered hundreds of giant sand bodies beneath the North Sea that appear to defy fundamental geological principles and could have important implications for energy and carbon storage.

Using high-resolution 3D seismic (sound wave) imaging, combined with data and rock samples from hundreds of wells, researchers from The University of Manchester in collaboration with industry, identified vast mounds of sand -- some several kilometers wide -- that appear to have sunk downward, displacing older, lighter and softer materials from beneath them.

The result is stratigraphic inversion -- a reversal of the usual geological order in which younger rocks are typically deposited on top of older ones on a previously unseen scale.

While stratigraphic inversion has previously been observed at small scales, the structures discovered by the Manchester team -- now named ""sinkites"" -- are the largest example of the phenomenon documented so far.

The finding, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, challenges scientists understanding of the subsurface and could have implications for carbon storage.

Lead author Professor Mads Huuse from The University of Manchester, said: ""This discovery reveals a geological process we haven't seen before on this scale. What we've found are structures where dense sand has sunk into lighter sediments that floated to the top of the sand, effectively flipping the conventional layers we'd expect to see and creating huge mounds beneath the sea.""

It is believed the sinkites formed millions of years ago during the Late Miocene to Pliocene periods, when earthquakes or sudden shifts in underground pressure may have caused the sand to liquefy and sink downward through natural fractures in the seabed. This displaced the underlying, more porous but rigid, ooze rafts -- composed largely of microscopic marine fossils -- bound by shrinkage cracks, sending them floating upwards. The researchers have dubbed these lighter, uplifted features 'floatites'.

The finding could help scientists better predict where oil and gas might be trapped and where it's safe to store carbon dioxide underground.

Prof Huuse said: ""This research shows how fluids and sediments can move around in the Earth's crust in unexpected ways. Understanding how these sinkites formed could significantly change how we assess underground reservoirs, sealing, and fluid migration -- all of which are vital for carbon capture and storage.""

Now the team are busy documenting other examples of this process and assessing how exactly it impacts our understanding of subsurface reservoirs and sealing intervals.

Prof Huuse added: ""As with many scientific discoveries there are many skeptical voices, but also many who voice their support for the new model. Time and yet more research will tell just how widely applicable the model is.""

This research has been published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

A treasure trove of exceptionally preserved early animals from more than half a billion years ago has been discovered in the Grand Canyon, one of the natural world's most iconic sites.

The rich fossil discovery - the first such find in the Grand Canyon - includes tiny rock-scraping molluscs, filter-feeding crustaceans, spiky-toothed worms, and even fragments of the food they likely ate.

By dissolving the rocks these animals were fossilized in and examining them under high-powered microscopes, researchers led by the University of Cambridge were able to get a highly detailed picture of a unique period in the evolution of life on Earth.

The fossilized animals date from between 507 and 502 million years ago, during a period of rapid evolutionary development known as the Cambrian explosion, when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record.

In some areas during this period, nutrient-rich waters powered an evolutionary arms race, with animals evolving a wide variety of exotic adaptations for food, movement or reproduction.

Most animal fossils from the Cambrian are of hard-shelled creatures, but in a handful of locations around the world, such as Canada's Burgess Shale formation and China's Maotianshan Shales, conditions are such that softer body parts could be preserved before they decayed.

So far, however, fossils of non-skeletonized Cambrian animals had been known mostly from oxygen and resource-poor environments, unlikely to kickstart the most complex innovations that shaped early animal evolution.

Now, the Grand Canyon has revealed the first soft-bodied, or non-mineralized, Cambrian fossils from an evolutionary 'Goldilocks zone' that would have provided rich resources for the evolution of early animals to accelerate. The results are reported in the journal Science Advances.

""These rare fossils give us a fuller picture of what life was like during the Cambrian period,"" said first author Giovanni Mussini, a PhD student in Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences. ""By combining these fossils with traces of their burrowing, walking, and feeding - which are found all over the Grand Canyon - we're able to piece together at an entire ancient ecosystem.""

Mussini and colleagues from the US located the fossils during a 2023 expedition along the Colorado River, which began carving the Grand Canyon in what is now Arizona between five and six million years ago.

""Surprisingly, we haven't had much of a Cambrian fossil record of this kind from the Grand Canyon before - there have been finds of things like trilobites and biomineralized fragments, but not much in the way of soft-bodied creatures,"" said Mussini. ""But the geology of the Grand Canyon, which contains lots of fine-grained and easily split mud rocks, suggested to us that it might be just the sort of place where we might be able to find some of these fossils.""

The researchers collected several samples of rock and returned them to Cambridge. The fist-sized rocks were first dissolved in a solution of hydrofluoric acid, and the sediment was passed through multiple sieves, releasing thousands of tiny fossils within. None of the animals were preserved in their entirety, but many recognizable structures helped the researchers identify which groups the animals belonged to.

Further examination of the fossils revealed some of the most complex ways animals were evolving during the Cambrian to capture and eat their food. ""These were cutting-edge 'technologies' for their time, integrating multiple anatomical parts into high-powered feeding systems,"" said Mussini.

Many of these fossils are of crustaceans, likely belonging to the group that includes brine shrimp, recognizable by their molar teeth. These tiny creatures had hair-like extensions on triangular grooves around their mouths, and used their hairy limbs to sweep up passing food particles like a conveyer belt. Tiny grooves on their teeth could then grind up their food. The detail on the fossils is such that several plankton-like particles can be seen near the crustaceans' mouths.

Other modern-looking animals from the Cambrian of the Grand Canyon include slug-like molluscs. These animals already had belts or chains of teeth not dissimilar to modern garden snails, which likely helped them scrape algae or bacteria from rocks.

The most unusual creature identified by the researchers is a new species of priapulids, also known as penis or cactus worms, which were widespread during the Cambrian but are nearly extinct today. The Grand Canyon priapulid had hundreds of complex branching teeth, which helped it sweep food particles into its extensible mouth. Due to the size of the fossil and its exotic rows of teeth, the researchers named this new animal Kraytdraco spectatus, after the krayt dragon, a fictional creature from the Star Wars universe.

""We can see from these fossils that Cambrian animals had wide variety of feeding styles used to process their food, some which have modern counterparts, and some that are more exotic,"" said Mussini.

During the Cambrian, the Grand Canyon was much closer to the equator than it is today, and conditions were perfect for supporting a wide range of life. The depth of the oxygen-rich water, neither too deep or too shallow, allowed a balance between maximizing nutrients or oxygen and reducing wave damage and exposure to UV radiation from the Sun.

This optimum environment made it a great place for evolutionary experimentation. Since food was abundant, animals could afford to take more evolutionary risks to stay ahead of the competition, accelerating the overall pace of evolution and driving the assembly of ecological innovations that still shape the modern biosphere.

""Animals needed to keep ahead of the competition through complex, costly innovations, but the environment allowed them to do that,"" said Mussini. ""In a more resource-starved environment, animals can't afford to make that sort of physiological investment. It's got certain parallels with economics: invest and take risks in times of abundance; save and be conservative in times of scarcity. There's a lot we can learn from tiny animals burrowing in the sea floor 500 million years ago.""

The research was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Natural and Environment Research Council (NERC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Giovanni Mussini is a Bye-Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient predators and giant amphibians found in african fossil treasure trove","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083614.htm","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:56:10 GMT","

An international team of paleontologists has spent more than 15 years excavating and studying fossils from Africa to expand our understanding of the Permian, a period of Earth's history that began 299 million years ago and ended 252 million years ago with our planet's largest and most devastating mass extinction. Led by researchers at the University of Washington and the Field Museum of Natural History, the team is identifying the animals that thrived in southern Pangea -- the planet's single supercontinent at the time -- just before the so-called ""Great Dying"" wiped out about 70% of terrestrial species, and an even larger fraction of marine ones.

""This mass extinction was nothing short of a cataclysm for life on Earth, and changed the course of evolution,"" said Christian Sidor, a UW professor of biology and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the UW Burke Museum of Natural History & Culture. ""But we lack a comprehensive view of which species survived, which didn't, and why. The fossils we have collected in Tanzania and Zambia will give us a more global perspective on this unprecedented period in our planet's natural history.""

Sidor and Kenneth Angielczyk, curator of paleomammalogy at the Field Museum, are co-editors of a 14-article series published Aug. 7 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology featuring the team's recent discoveries about the myriad of animals that made Permian Africa their home. These include saber-toothed predators, burrowing foragers and a large, salamander-like creature.

All these finds were excavated in three basins across southern Africa: the Ruhuhu Basin in southern Tanzania, the Luangwa Basin in eastern Zambia and the Mid-Zambezi Basin in southern Zambia. Most were discovered by team members on multiple, month-long excavation trips to the region over the past 17 years. Others were analyses of specimens dug up decades prior that had been stored in museum collections.

""These parts of Zambia and Tanzania contain absolutely beautiful fossils from the Permian,"" said Sidor. ""They are giving us an unprecedented view of life on land leading up to the mass extinction.""

Starting in 2007, Sidor and his team, including UW students and postdoctoral researchers, made five trips to the Ruhuhu Basin and four to the Mid-Zambezi and Luangwa basins, all in cooperation with the Tanzanian and Zambian governments. The researchers trekked between field sites miles apart to collect fossils. They stayed in villages or camped in the open -- once waking during the night to the ground-quaking stomps of a nearby elephant herd. All fossils collected by the team will be returned to Tanzania and Zambia after researchers have completed their analyses.

The Permian is the endpoint of what paleontologists call the Paleozoic Era. During this time, animal life -- which evolved first in Earth's oceans -- began to colonize land and complex terrestrial ecosystems developed. By the Permian, a diverse array of amphibian and reptile-like creatures roamed environments ranging from early forests to arid valleys. The end-Permian mass extinction -- whose precise cause scientists are still debating -- obliterated many of these ecosystems and ushered in the Mesozoic Era, which saw the evolution of dinosaurs, as well as the first birds, flowering plants and mammals.

For decades, scientists' best understanding of the Permian, the Great Dying and the start of the Mesozoic came from the Karoo Basin in South Africa, which contains a near-complete fossil record of periods before and after the mass extinction. But beginning in the 1930s, paleontologists realized that basins in Tanzania and Zambia contain fossil records of this time range that are almost as pristine as the Karoo's. The excavation trips by Sidor, Angielczyk and their colleagues represent the largest analysis to date of the region's fossil record from before and after the Great Dying. In 2018, they published a comprehensive analysis of the post-Permian animals of the Ruhuhu and Luangwa basins. These new papers look further back into the Permian.

""The number of specimens we've found in Zambia and Tanzania is so high and their condition is so exquisite that we can make species-level comparisons to what paleontologists have found in South Africa,"" said Sidor. ""I know of no better place on Earth for getting sufficient detail of this time period to make such detailed conclusions and comparisons.""

The team's papers describe a number of new species of dicynodonts. These small, burrowing, reptile-like herbivores first evolved in the mid-Permian. By the time of the mass extinction, dicynodonts -- many of whom sported a beak-like snout with two small tusks that likely aided burrowing -- were the dominant plant-eaters on land. The team's findings also include several new species of large, saber-toothed predators called gorgonopsians, as well as a new species of temnospondyl, a large salamander-like amphibian.

""We can now compare two different geographic regions of Pangea and see what was going on both before and after the end-Permian mass extinction,"" said Sidor. ""We can really start to ask questions about who survived and who didn't.""

In addition to the UW and the Field Museum, the team includes scientists from the University of Chicago, Loyola University Chicago, Idaho State University, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, Carleton University, the University of Southern California, the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, the Iziko South African Museum, Southern Methodist University, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the Museum for Natural History in Berlin, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Oklahoma, the National Heritage Conservation Commission in Lusaka, Virginia Tech, and the Chipembele Wildlife Education Center in Mfume, Zambia. Seven of these scientists are former UW postdoctoral researchers, doctoral students or undergraduate students. The research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Injectable “skin in a syringe” could heal burns without scars","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083610.htm","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:25:39 GMT","

Researchers have created what could be called ""skin in a syringe."" The gel containing live cells can be 3D printed into a skin transplant, as shown in a study conducted on mice. This technology may lead to new ways to treat burns and severe wounds. The study was led from the Center for Disaster Medicine and Traumatology and Linköping University in Sweden, and has been published in Advanced Healthcare Materials.

As long as we have a healthy skin, we do not give it much thought. However, if we get major wounds or other injuries, it becomes clear that the skin is the body's protection from the outside world. Helping the body restore the skin barrier after a serious burn can therefore be a matter of life and death.

Large burns are often treated by transplanting a thin layer of the top part of the skin, the epidermis. This is basically composed of a single cell type. Transplanting only this part of the skin leads to severe scarring.

Under the epidermis there is a thicker and more advanced layer of skin called the dermis. It has blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles and other structures necessary for skin function and elasticity. However, transplanting also the dermis is rarely an option, as the procedure leaves a wound as large as the wound to be healed.

The trick is to create new skin that does not become scar tissue but a functioning dermis.

""The dermis is so complicated that we can't grow it in a lab. We don't even know what all its components are. That's why we, and many others, think that we could possibly transplant the building blocks and then let the body make the dermis itself,"" says Johan Junker, researcher at the Swedish Center for Disaster Medicine and Traumatology and docent in plastic surgery at Linköping University, who led the study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials.

The most common cell type in the dermis, the connective tissue cell or fibroblast, is easy to remove from the body and grow in a lab. The connective tissue cell also has the advantage of being able to develop into more specialized cell types depending on what is needed. The researchers behind the study provide a scaffold by having the cells grow on tiny, porous beads of gelatine, a substance similar to skin collagen. But a liquid containing these beads poured on a wound will not stay there.

The researchers' solution to the problem is mixing the gelatine beads with a gel consisting of another body-specific substance, hyaluronic acid. When the beads and gel are mixed, they are connected using what is known as click chemistry. The result is a gel that, somewhat simplified, can be called skin in a syringe.

""The gel has a special feature that means that it becomes liquid when exposed to light pressure. You can use a syringe to apply it to a wound, for example, and once applied it becomes gel-like again. This also makes it possible to 3D print the gel with the cells in it,"" says Daniel Aili, professor of molecular physics at Linköping University, who led the study together with Johan Junker.

In the current study, the researchers 3D-printed small pucks that were placed under the skin of mice. The results point to the potential of this technology to be used to grow the patient's own cells from a minimal skin biopsy, which are then 3D-printed into a graft and applied to the wound.

""We see that the cells survive and it's clear that they produce different substances that are needed to create new dermis. In addition, blood vessels are formed in the grafts, which is important for the tissue to survive in the body. We find this material very promising,"" says Johan Junker.

Blood vessels are key to a variety of applications for engineered tissue-like materials. Scientists can grow cells in three-dimensional materials that can be used to build organoids, i.e. mini versions of organs. But there is a bottleneck as concerns these tissue models; they lack blood vessels to transport oxygen and nutrients to the cells. This means that there is a limit to how large the structures can get before the cells at the centre die from oxygen and nutrient deficiency.

The LiU researchers may be one step closer to solving the problem of blood vessel supply. In another article, also published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, the researchers describe a method for making threads from materials consisting of 98 per cent water, known as hydrogels.

""The hydrogel threads become quite elastic, so we can tie knots on them. We also show that they can be formed into mini-tubes, which we can pump fluid through or have blood vessel cells grow in,"" says Daniel Aili.

The mini-tubes, or the perfusable channels as the researchers also call them, open up new possibilities for the development of blood vessels for e.g. organoids.

Lars Kölby, professor of plastic surgery at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, also participated in the project. The research has received funding from, among others, the Erling-Persson Foundation, the European Research Council (ERC), the Swedish Research Council and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

Cats with dementia have brain changes similar to those of people with Alzheimer's disease, offering a valuable model for studying the condition in humans, a study says.

Scientists discovered a build-up of the toxic protein amyloid-beta in the brains of cats with the condition - one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease.

The findings offer a clearer picture of how amyloid-beta may lead to age-related brain dysfunction and memory loss in cats, experts say.

Many older cats develop dementia, leading to behavioral changes such as increased vocalization - or meowing - confusion and disrupted sleep - symptoms similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh examined the brains of 25 cats of different ages after they had passed away, including those with signs of dementia.

Powerful microscopy images revealed a build-up of amyloid-beta within the synapses - connections between brain cells - of older cats and cats with dementia.

Synapses allow the flow of messages between brain cells and are vital to healthy brain function. Their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities in humans with Alzheimer's disease.

The research team also found evidence that astrocytes and microglia - types of support cells in the brain - engulfed or 'ate' the affected synapses. This process, called synaptic pruning, is important during brain development but can contribute to synapse loss in dementia.

Experts say the findings will not only help to understand and manage dementia in cats but, given their similarities, could also contribute to the development of future treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists studying Alzheimer's disease in the past have relied heavily on genetically modified rodent models. Rodents do not naturally develop dementia, and studying cats with dementia has the potential to advance knowledge and help develop treatments for both cats and people, experts say.

The study, funded by Wellcome and the UK Dementia Research Institute, is published in the journal European Journal of Neuroscience. The research team included scientists from the Universities of Edinburgh and California, UK Dementia Research Institute and Scottish Brain Sciences.

Dr Robert McGeachan, study lead from the University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, said: ""Dementia is a devastating disease -- whether it affects humans, cats, or dogs. Our findings highlight the striking similarities between feline dementia and Alzheimer's disease in people. This opens the door to exploring whether promising new treatments for human Alzheimer's disease could also help our aging pets. Because cats naturally develop these brain changes, they may also offer a more accurate model of the disease than traditional laboratory animals, ultimately benefiting both species and their caregivers.""

Professor Danièlle Gunn-Moore, Personal Chair of Feline Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, said: ""Feline dementia is so distressing for the cat and for its person. It is by undertaking studies like this that we will understand how best to treat them. This will be wonderful for the cats, their owners, people with Alzheimer's and their loved ones. Feline dementia is the perfect natural model for Alzheimer's, everyone benefits.""

The immune system undergoes substantial changes throughout life, with ageing broadly impacting immune cell composition, function and regenerative capacity. Emerging evidence suggests that age-associated changes in immune fitness — the ability to respond to and eliminate infection, pathogens and malignancy while maintaining self-tolerance — reshape antitumour immunity and influence the efficacy of immunotherapies. Technological advances in high-dimensional immunoprofiling have begun to reveal the complex interplay between ageing, immune fitness and cancer biology, uncovering new therapeutic vulnerabilities and challenges. In this Review, we discuss recent insights derived from age-resolved immunoprofiling of the human tumour microenvironment, how ageing haematopoiesis affects immune cells that contribute to the microenvironment and impact cancer progression, and what is known from preclinical modelling about the functional consequences of immune ageing on tumour control. We further highlight emerging age-stratified analyses of treatment responses, which are beginning to inform hypotheses about how ageing shapes immunotherapy outcomes. Together, these perspectives provide a framework for integrating age as a critical biological variable, underscore the need to consider age in both preclinical models and clinical trial design, and identify key challenges and priorities for the field moving forward.

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical healthcare applications, their utility for personalized health monitoring using wearable device data remains underexplored. Here we introduce the Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), designed for applications in sleep and fitness. PH-LLM is a version of the Gemini LLM that was finetuned for text understanding and reasoning when applied to aggregated daily-resolution numerical sensor data. We created three benchmark datasets to assess multiple complementary aspects of sleep and fitness: expert domain knowledge, generation of personalized insights and recommendations and prediction of self-reported sleep quality from longitudinal data. PH-LLM achieved scores that exceeded a sample of human experts on multiple-choice examinations in sleep medicine (79% versus 76%) and fitness (88% versus 71%). In a comprehensive evaluation involving 857 real-world case studies, PH-LLM performed similarly to human experts for fitness-related tasks and improved over the base Gemini model in providing personalized sleep insights. Finally, PH-LLM effectively predicted self-reported sleep quality using a multimodal encoding of wearable sensor data, further demonstrating its ability to effectively contextualize wearable modalities. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to revolutionize personal health monitoring via tailored insights and predictions from wearable data and provides datasets, rubrics and benchmark performance to further accelerate personal health-related LLM research.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong language generation performance across diverse domains. LLMs have achieved passing grades on examinations in the style of the US legal bar examination1 and the second-year medical school examination2,3,4. In medicine specifically, natural language generation may influence clinical practice5, education and research6. When enriched with healthcare-specific data, LLMs achieve impressive performance in medical question answering2,4, electronic health record analysis7, differential diagnosis from medical images8, psychiatric functional assessment9 and delivery of psychological interventions10,11,12.

Conventional clinical visits provide invaluable information but offer only periodic assessments of lifestyle features, including sleep, physical activity, stress and cardiometabolic health. These features, which have profound impact on adverse health outcomes, morbidity, disability-adjusted life years and overall health13,14,15,16,17,18, can be measured passively and continuously by wearable devices19. However, these features are not yet widely used in clinical practice nor are incorporated into standard datasets used for medical question answering20,21, likely because these data are typically captured without context, are computationally demanding to store and analyze and can be difficult to interpret. Consequently, general foundation LLMs and even medically tuned LLMs may be unable to use these data effectively to reason about and recommend interventions based on personalized individual health behaviors.

Despite these hurdles, initial efforts to integrate sensor data with LLMs have occurred. Personal Health Insights Agent investigated tool use and code generation within an agent framework to accurately compute summary metrics of raw sensor data for use in question answering22. Similarly, Health-LLM evaluated LLMs on rating scale questions in consumer health framed as classification and regression problems23. Although valuable in demonstrating sensor data integration, these approaches do not assess the capability of LLMs to generate the long-form, nuanced and actionable advice characteristic of effective personal health coaching, leaving this critical application underexplored.

Here we provide new datasets, evaluation rubrics and benchmarks to assess LLM performance in the sleep and fitness domains. Although wearable devices measure more than just sleep and fitness, we focus on these domains specifically because the accuracy and suitability of commercial wearable measurements for these domains are well studied24,25; they have high engagement among device wearers; and practical recommendations can be offered without giving clinical advice. Additionally, the datasets introduced here can be used to improve performance of other LLMs, and the approach and rubrics are extensible to additional personal health domains.

Our main contributions are summarized in Fig. 1. We created Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), a version of Gemini finetuned to generate both insights about and recommendations to improve sleep and fitness patterns. We evaluated the performance of PH-LLM across three tasks in the sleep and fitness domains that span a breadth of abilities useful for a personal health coach. First, we assessed the amount of expert domain knowledge present in PH-LLM using multiple-choice examinations. Second, we evaluated the model's ability to apply its expert knowledge and interpret aggregated sensor data to provide coaching recommendations from long-form case studies. Finally, for sleep only, we assessed the ability of PH-LLM to predict subjective patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in order to function as a coach that can incorporate individual assessments of sleep quality when generating recommendations.

a, Schematic showing the overall experiment design of the study. PH-LLM was evaluated on three aspects of personal health: (1) assessing its level of expert knowledge based on certification examination-style MCQs; (2) generating personalized insights and recommendations for user goals in the sleep and fitness domains; and (3) predicting PROs for sleep quality from aggregated daily-resolution numerical sensor data. b, Performance of PH-LLM, as contextualized with the responses of human experts, for professional examinations, coaching recommendations and PROs for sleep quality. Data are presented as mean accuracy (n = 629 sleep questions and n = 99 fitness examination questions), mean human expert rating (n = 4,265 sleep and n = 5,049 fitness case study ratings across principles and subsections from PH-LLM and n = 2,606 and n = 3,335 from human experts) and AUROC (n = 833 survey responses) bootstrapped over 1,000, 1,000 and 100 iterations, respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. ‘*' indicates a statistically significant difference between two groups using a two-sided t-test for examinations (P = 1.52 × 10−10 for fitness) and a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test for recommendation ratings (P = 3.31 × 10−11 for sleep). ‘Naive performance' is that achieved by a random classifier HR, heart rate; HRV, heart rate variability.

The PH-LLM was developed upon Gemini Ultra 1.0 (ref. 26) using a two-stage training process. First, we finetuned the entire model on the task of generating long-form case study responses for sleep and fitness. The training and evaluation data consist of textual representations of demographic data, up to 30 days of daily metrics, aggregated metrics and, for fitness case studies only, individual exercise logs and synthetically generated subjective assessments of workout readiness that mimic a user training log. The target case study responses were created by domain experts in sleep and fitness working in concert with Gemini Ultra 1.0 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). After finetuning on case studies, we finetuned a multimodal adapter for PH-LLM prediction of PROs in sleep disruption and sleep impairment27 from longitudinal passive sensor data containing daily sleep and activity metrics for at least 15 days28 (Methods). After both training stages were completed, we evaluated the performance of PH-LLM across three tasks in the sleep and fitness domains: multiple-choice examinations assessing expert knowledge, coaching recommendations in case study responses and classification performance on PRO prediction. To measure case study response quality, we designed a custom evaluation rubric that quantifies incorporation of user data, appropriate personalization based on user data, use of expert domain knowledge, evidence of confabulations or unwarranted assumptions, potential for harm, readability and overall quality.

We compiled multiple-choice examinations in the style of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Sleep Medicine Certification examination and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists (CSCS) examination (Methods). PH-LLM correctly answered 79% of sleep medicine and 88% of fitness board examination questions tested (Table 1 and Fig. 1b), comfortably exceeding the approximate grade (70%) to either receive continuing medical education (CME) credit for sleep (https://www.boardvitals.com/sleep-medicine-moc-recertification) or pass the practice examination for fitness (https://www.nsca.com/certification/cscs/certified-strength-and-conditioning-specialist-exam-description), and was competitive with leading external models, slightly worse for sleep but equivalent for fitness questions (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In sleep, PH-LLM scored 79%, whereas Gemini Ultra 1.0 scored 77%. In fitness, both PH-LLM and Gemini Ultra 1.0 scored 88%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves confirm strong model performance in both examinations (Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, despite finetuning PH-LLM for sleep and fitness tasks, its performance on the general medical benchmarks PubMedQA29 and MedQA30 does not degrade (Supplementary Table 1).

The sleep medicine question bank contained additional metadata for each question including the distribution of responses from human test takers, enabling performance comparisons stratified by empirical question difficulty. PH-LLM consistently improved slightly over Gemini Ultra 1.0, with larger performance improvement on more difficult questions, suggesting that finetuning on sleep case studies was relevant for these questions (Table 2). Notably, although this is not able to be confirmed, this trend of stronger performance for easier questions suggests that the overall strong performance is not due to memorization or presence of the questions in the model pretraining corpus.

To contextualize the performance of PH-LLM, we recruited five sleep medicine experts (average experience: 25 years) with advanced degrees and five professional athletic trainers (average experience: 13.8 years) to take the respective exams. The experts achieved an average score of 76% in a representative subset of the sleep medicine examination (N = 204) and 71% in the fitness examination. PH-LLM outperformed these expert graders on both question banks (Table 1). In sleep, when stratifying performance by empirical question difficulty for human test takers, we observed that PH-LLM performed similarly to both those test takers and the set of sleep medicine experts whom we recruited (Table 2).

We additionally performed ablation studies on the use of self-consistency31 (N = 5 rounds) and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting32 (prompts in Supplementary Tables 2–4). Self-consistency improved performance on fitness questions for both CoT and non-CoT prompting techniques, whereas the performance from including CoT was mixed (Supplementary Table 5). Few-shot prompting with self-consistency improved performance further in both sleep and fitness examinations (Supplementary Table 6). Correct and incorrect answer examples are provided in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8.

We next sought to evaluate the model's ability to apply its expert knowledge and interpret sensor data. To do so, we created the first dataset of detailed personal health case studies in sleep and fitness (857 case studies containing 3,271 question–answer pairs) curated by multiple experts in the associated domains. The dataset contains individual wearable sensor data over a multi-week timeframe and corresponding long-form insights and recommendations (Fig. 2a,b). To assess model performance, we compiled responses to each case study by Gemini Ultra 1.0, PH-LLM and a human expert and had all responses rated by human experts.

a,b, Visual depiction of wearable sensor data used as input and corresponding expert analysis and recommendations for improving sleep quality (a) and for assessing workout readiness and fitness (b). For each case study, the experts considered demographic information and wearable sensor data for a period of up to 30 days over which the device was worn (sections (i)–(iii) of a and b). For all metrics considered, see Supplementary Tables 26 and 27 for sleep data and Supplementary Tables 28–36 for fitness data. Both human experts and PH-LLM used these inputs to create domain-specific responses: sleep case studies contained subsections for insights, possible etiologies and recommendations, and fitness case studies contained subsections for training load, sleep, health metrics, readiness assessment and recommendations. Abridged examples of human expert responses are shown in sections (iv) of a and b. c,d, Mean expert ratings across all subsection principles for case study responses generated by Gemini Ultra 1.0, PH-LLM and human experts in the sleep (c) and fitness (d) domains.

Source data

We evaluated the aggregated performance of PH-LLM and human experts on the long-form case study responses, rated by human experts using 15 questions with grading scale 1 (worst) through 5 (best), spanning topics such as using important domain knowledge, correctly referencing relevant user data and avoiding confabulations (Supplementary Table 9). Our rubric closely tracks prior human evaluation of LLMs in healthcare33. To enable inter-rater reliability assessments, we had multiple human experts rate responses (Methods). We conclude moderate inter-rater reliability, based on Gwet's AC2 (refs. 34,35) ranging from 0.699 to 0.956 (Extended Data Fig. 3) and contingency tables of inter-rater agreement (Extended Data Fig. 4).

For sleep case studies, PH-LLM responses received an average rating of 4.61 versus 4.75 for human expert responses (P = 3.3 × 10−11, N ≥ 2,606, Z (test statistic) = −6.63, r (effect size) = −0.08; Fig. 1b). Although the difference is statistically significant, the effect size is small, and PH-LLM responses are high quality as indicated by receiving the top rating 73% of the time. Finetuning PH-LLM on sleep case studies significantly improved its overall performance in this task as compared to Gemini Ultra 1.0 (average rating of 4.51 for Gemini Ultra 1.0 versus 4.61 for PH-LLM, P = 4.0 × 10−6, N ≥ 2,603, Z = 4.63, r = 0.06). For fitness case studies, PH-LLM aggregate performance was not statistically different from expert performance (P = 0.48, N ≥ 3,335, Z = −0.70, r = −0.01; Fig. 1b). Gemini Ultra 1.0 responses also were not statistically different from human expert responses (P = 0.92, N ≥ 3,161, Z = −0.10, r = −0.00).

Because the case studies contain multiple sections, we also analyzed ratings for each section separately (Fig. 2c,d). For sleep case studies, finetuning PH-LLM improved its ability to provide insights and etiologies (P = 6.65 × 10−7, N ≥ 800, Z = 5.18, r = 0.11 and P = 2.46 × 10−3, N ≥ 801, Z = 3.15, r = 0.07, respectively). Recommendations showed no statistically significant difference between Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM (P = 0.45, N ≥ 801, Z = 0.76, r = 0.02). We further analyzed ratings by various rubric questions (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Finetuning PH-LLM improved its ability to reference important domain knowledge (P = 4.47 × 10−5, N ≥ 201, Z = 4.44, r = 0.19), important interpretations (P = 4.47 × 10−5, N ≥ 201, Z = 4.48, r = 0.19), important user data (P = 5.21 × 10−8, N ≥ 201, Z = 5.91, r = 0.26) and no unimportant interpretations (P = 4.31 × 10−2, N ≥ 201, Z = 2.53, r = 0.11).

For fitness case studies, PH-LLM had similar performance as both human experts and Gemini Ultra 1.0 (no statistically significant difference observed, N ≥ 768) on three out of four sections (Fig. 2d). Training load was the only section in which responses from human experts and Gemini Ultra 1.0 were rated higher than those from PH-LLM (P = 0.01, N ≥ 768, Z = 3.02, r = 0.07). When analyzing ratings by rubric questions, we observed no statistically significant differences in ratings between PH-LLM and human experts (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

We present examples of PH-LLM model responses for sleep (Supplementary Tables 10–12) and fitness (Supplementary Tables 13–17). To assess robustness to missing data, we examined performance on case studies stratified by data availability. We observed no bias in rating distributions based on data availability (Supplementary Fig. 3). To understand the effect of context changes on the PH-LLM response, we varied the input context provided to PH-LLM. We observed that PH-LLM appropriately adapted its responses depending on the length of the context available (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 18). Additionally, PH-LLM effectively used different parts of the input data for distinct aspects of its response. For example, modifying training load statistics while keeping workout logs constant led the model to adjust its response accordingly (Supplementary Table 19). Similarly, the model adapted its output when faced with missing information, such as the absence of today's sleep metrics (Supplementary Table 20). Finally, we note that some individuals were the subject of multiple fitness case studies from distinct days. Expert assessments of workout readiness can appropriately vary from one day to the next (Supplementary Fig. 5), and the relative performance of PH-LLM and human experts is consistent at a variety of target date overlaps allowed in the holdout set (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Expert human grading of case studies is laborious and time-consuming. To enable a wider set of ablation studies and additional experiments, we used the expert human ratings to train a separate LLM to automatically evaluate responses (‘AutoEval') according to the rubric (Methods)36. Our best AutoEval models ranked case study response sources more accurately than an LLM not explicitly finetuned for AutoEval tasks (Supplementary Table 21) and similarly to human experts (Extended Data Fig. 6) in a fraction of the time (Supplementary Table 22).

When evaluated using the best AutoEval model, PH-LLM scored significantly higher than leading external models on sleep insights and etiologies sections and competitively on the other sections (Extended Data Fig. 7). Additionally, we used our AutoEval raters to explore the effect of finetuning data size on model performance. We observed that sleep insights and etiologies sections showed statistically significant rating improvements when using the whole dataset compared to training with only 25% of samples (Extended Data Fig. 8).

To assess whether PH-LLM could infer subjective user experience to better tailor coaching advice, we evaluated its ability to predict PROs in sleep disturbance and sleep impairment from daily-resolution numerical sensor data. To do so, we used the Google Digital Wellbeing (DWB) study dataset, which recruited thousands of individuals to use wearable devices and take validated survey instruments that measure wellbeing over a 4-week span28. We filtered the dataset to 4,163 individuals who had both daily measurements of 20 wearable sensor features for at least 15 days and complete responses for the sleep disturbance and impairment surveys at study completion (Methods). We first explored the PRO data by computing the correlation between the survey answers obtained from research participants. The 16 questions measure related but distinct sleep outcomes (Fig. 3a). We then investigated sensor features for possible confounding and observed similar distributions of sensor readings across devices and participant compliance (Supplementary Fig. 7). Next, we computed the importance of individual sensor features for predicting PROs by fitting linear models that used all sensor features as input to predict each survey question independently. We quantified importance as the magnitude of the regression coefficient. We observed that no single feature dominated predictive power across all PROs and that the overall predictive signal was spread across many sensors (Fig. 3b). However, we note that interpreting the relationships between sensor features and outcomes is complicated because sensor features may capture demographic effects.

The dashed vertical line denotes the AUROC of the random predictor. Data are presented as mean AUROC over 100 bootstrapping iterations, and error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Outcomes for which the confidence intervals of the difference in AUROC between PH-LLM with adapter and both zero- and few-shot both exclude 0 in 100 paired bootstrapping iterations are annotated with ‘*'. d, AUPRC for the performance of PH-LLM with adapter, zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches when predicting binary outcomes derived from survey responses in the test set (n = 833).

Outcomes for which the confidence intervals of the difference in AUPRC between PH-LLM with adapter and both zero-shot and few-shot both exclude 0 in 100 paired bootstrapping iterations are annotated with ‘*'.

Source data

To enable PH-LLM to predict PROs from sensor features, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) adapter to map summary statistics of the 20 sensor features into PH-LLM's latent token space (Methods). We then provided the latent tokens to PH-LLM as context and prompted it to predict each binary outcome, analogous to previous work37. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for each binary trait with zero-shot and few-shot text approaches (Fig. 3c,d) in a heldout test set. We note that objective measurements of sleep and sleep behaviors generally provide only modest predictive power for perceived sleep quality metrics. However, PH-LLM using the adapter significantly outperformed both prompt-based approaches in terms of AUROC and AUPRC (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 23 and 24). This performance increase is likely due to adapter-enabled LLMs being able to capture more signal from the training set than zero-shot and few-shot prompting, which see a very limited amount of training data37.

To assess how well PH-LLM performed compared to traditional machine learning approaches, we fit independent logistic regression models for each binary trait using the same encoded vector input. We found no statistically significant differences in performance between PH-LLM and logistic regression models for AUROC and only one statistically significant difference out of 16 outcomes for AUPRC (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 23 and 24). Furthermore, we hypothesized that, in a low-data regime, LLMs might leverage their prior knowledge to outperform logistic regression. However, our comparison of PH-LLM and logistic regression revealed no such advantage (Supplementary Fig. 8), likely due to the limited representation of wearable sensor data in LLM training corpora. Separately, to model nonlinear effects not captured by these logistic regression models, we also trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the full time-series sensor data to predict the same outcomes. However, due to the limited size of the existing dataset, the CNN model performed worse than the logistic regression model (Extended Data Fig. 9).

We performed multiple ablation analyses to assess the effects of the sensor data context window length (number of days of sensor data), number of training data examples and data augmentation on PRO prediction performance. We observed that using only 5 days of sensor data led to lower AUROC and AUPRC metrics, whereas using 10 days or 15 days gave similar performance (Supplementary Fig. 9). Increasing the context window beyond 10 days is likely to provide little value because Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep survey questions refer specifically to the past 7 days. We also observed a significant performance improvement when increasing the number of training samples from 25% to 50% and a smaller improvement when increasing the number of training samples from 50% to 100% (Supplementary Fig. 10), indicating that PH-LLM's performance may continue to improve with additional training data. Finally, we retrained PH-LLM after augmenting the adapter inputs with various levels of zero-mean Gaussian noise. Although the AUROC scores do not show consistent trends, the AUPRC scores are generally higher—albeit with wide error bar estimates—from the model augmented with Gaussian noise with zero mean and 0.001 s.d. (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting that data augmentation may modestly improve performance further.

We developed an LLM finetuned from Gemini (PH-LLM) to perform a variety of tasks relevant to setting and achieving personal health goals in sleep and fitness. Our study showed that PH-LLM can answer technical multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in these domains with accuracy exceeding multiple experts. Furthermore, we showed that PH-LLM can integrate passively acquired objective data from wearable devices into personalized insights, potential causes for observed behaviors and recommendations to improve sleep hygiene and fitness outcomes. After finetuning from Gemini Ultra 1.0, which itself displays aggregate performance approaching that of experts in fitness, PH-LLM demonstrated significantly improved use of domain knowledge and personalization of relevant user information for sleep insights. Finally, we trained PH-LLM to use a multimodal encoder that natively integrates daily summaries of time-series health sensor data to predict subjective self-reported outcomes in sleep and achieved performance on par with specialized models to predict the same outcomes.

Multiple-choice examinations are commonly used benchmarks to assess general domain knowledge of LLMs1,2,3,4,26. Strong performance on MCQs can be considered a necessary, but not sufficient38, requirement for practical utility of LLMs in realistic settings. Through exhaustive evaluation of PH-LLM and comparison to multiple human experts and other models, we showed that, although leading external general-purpose LLMs exhibited slightly stronger performance on general sleep knowledge, PH-LLM comfortably demonstrates expert-level performance in both sleep and fitness MCQs, and finetuning toward these tasks did not degrade its performance on general medical benchmarks.

Open-ended long-form case studies represent key use cases for applications of LLMs to personal health features on wearable devices. In the present study, we created 857 case studies to assess sleep quality and fitness readiness for a workout and coupled the case studies with rigorous evaluation rubrics. We observed that the average performance over all case study responses was very high for all human experts, Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM, underscoring the strong knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the Gemini model family.

However, finetuning Gemini Ultra 1.0 to create PH-LLM produced significant improvements in the model's ability to provide insights and etiologies for sleep. For example, PH-LLM is better at using relevant domain knowledge, providing important interpretations of data and using important user data. The relatively lower performance gain observed for sleep recommendations may be driven in part by both the increased ambiguity of the task, which led to wider variety in training example content, and the increased challenge of requiring consistency across multiple model generations to provide an accurate recommendation that referenced real data.

In contrast, for fitness, both PH-LLM and Gemini Ultra 1.0 performed similarly. This pattern may be attributable to several factors. First, the base model's stronger performance in fitness could reflect well-optimized prompting, minimizing potential gains from finetuning. Second, differences in training data could have influenced the performance. For example, our use of a standardized format for sleep analysis may have resulted in more specific training data, whereas the absence of a standardized guideline for fitness may have led to more generalized data that are more difficult to differentiate. Third, Gemini Ultra 1.0 may possess stronger baseline knowledge in fitness compared to sleep medicine.

PH-LLM was outperformed by Gemini Ultra 1.0 (and human experts) for a single section: the training load section of fitness case studies. This may be partially explained by the data generation process, in which multiple models were used to create candidate case study responses. Expert rater comments suggest that some lower-quality statements with incorrect use of domain and user data may be present in the training data, particularly with respect to rest periods. Moreover, because the fitness case studies incorporate sleep quality as one input, there is potential for further improvements in fitness by integrating full sleep case studies into the sleep section of fitness for a more detailed view of an individual's rest status.

Additionally, we developed methods for automated evaluation of case studies and demonstrated their ability to be used as scalable proxy measures for expert human evaluation of LLM performance. Our best AutoEval models ranked study responses similarly to human experts, and these models obtained similar agreement measures with expert raters when compared using inter-rater concordance metrics. We used the best AutoEval models to compare PH-LLM to public external models and perform dataset ablation analyses. The analyses underscored the value of our expert-curated case studies, as PH-LLM significantly outperformed on sleep insights and etiologies, and performance degraded when trained on subsets of the data.

Beyond expert interpretation of wearable features, understanding the subjective experience of an individual can be useful for determining a comprehensive and personalized action plan. Indeed, subjective PROs are receiving greater attention in health management39,40,41. However, predicting subjective PROs from sensor information alone is difficult, with specialized models developed specifically for those tasks only reaching AUCs in the 0.55–0.75 range. We trained a multimodal adapter to enable PH-LLM to predict subjective PROs from aggregates of daily sensor information and showed that the native multimodal integration was necessary and sufficient to achieve performance on par with specialized discriminative models. Although for the standalone task of PRO prediction the simpler logistic regression model is much more efficient and interpretable, enabling PH-LLM to predict subjective wellbeing allows for integrating this capability directly into user-facing interactions. Additionally, by building the capability directly into PH-LLM, it may benefit from positive transfer learning toward additional out-of-distribution outcomes for which it was not trained, as shown previously8.

Our work has several limitations. First, expert evaluation of long-form text is inherently subjective for open-ended tasks such as coaching42, and the observed distribution of case study rubric ratings was skewed high, making differentiation across models and expert responses challenging. Although some case study sections and evaluation rubric principles showed significant differentiation, further training of expert raters to increase inter-rater reliability or adjudicating existing responses could increase signal strength of model performance. Second, to minimize inter-rater variability, most case studies had a single expert rate all candidate responses. Although this made direct comparison of candidate responses straightforward, it introduced the potential for experts to identify expert versus model responses based on style or other non-material factors and, thus, introduce conscious or unconscious biases into ratings. Third, we observed that, despite improvements in referencing and integrating user data into insights, confabulations and incorrect referencing of user data still occasionally occurred. Preventing these issues will be critical to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these technologies into user-facing features. Fourth, the case studies were sampled broadly across demographics (sleep) or to identify common patterns in active individuals (fitness), and the DWB study recruited samples by self-selection into the study, so they may not be representative samples of the population (Supplementary Table 25) nor exhaustively explore the sleep and fitness concerns and unmeasured contextual factors affecting individuals. In particular, the case studies and broad Fitbit research population do not acquire race or ethnicity information, so these samples may be a biased subset of the US population. Furthermore, we sampled to enrich patterns of activity in fitness case studies that enriched those case studies for male participants and individuals aged 30–59 years. Also, the self-selection into the DWB study induced a skew toward female participants. Each of these distributional biases may affect generalizability of the results presented here for the entire US or global population. Fifth, we only considered textual representations of case study data input, owing to the absence of persisted raw time-series in the dataset. Exploring the potentially richer temporal signals encoded in raw sensor data is an important area for future work. Sixth, our exploration of multimodal encoding of sensor data similarly explored a small fraction of modeling possibilities owing to the relatively small dataset with nearly complete sensor data and paired outcome data. Further exploration of self-supervised pretraining on raw waveforms and granularly aggregated sensor features may yield richer representations of individuals useful for personal health outcome predictions43 that expand beyond sleep metrics. Seventh, by using daily sensor measurements and imposing selection criteria for case studies, we largely avoided challenges of missing data that wearable sensor studies frequently face. Although our analyses stratified by data missingness and sensor data ablations suggest that PH-LLM is robust to missingness, further exploration is warranted. Eighth, a primary overarching goal for developing models specific to personal health is to improve long-term health outcomes through effective behavior change and maintenance of healthy habits. Blinded user preference studies could provide important evidence of the model's effectiveness and performance relative to expert coaching in the studied domains. Furthermore, we selected the three categories of tasks described herein as they represent important capabilities, but we recognize that there are many other dimensions that one could evaluate, and these remain important areas for future work. Finally, although the performance of PH-LLM on the tasks presented here is encouraging, we caution that much work remains to be done to ensure that LLMs are reliable, safe and equitable in personal health applications. Further reducing confabulations, considering an individual's unique health circumstances not captured by sensor information alone and ensuring alignment of the training data with real-world distributions are a subset of important research areas that warrants further attention.

Despite these limitations, we have demonstrated here that Gemini-based models contain substantial health knowledge, and we can effectively finetune Gemini Ultra 1.0 to improve performance across multiple outcomes relevant for personal health. We provide a suite of benchmark tasks relevant for personal health coaching, contextualize performance through exhaustive comparison to human experts and highlight strengths and gaps in current LLMs for acting as coaching agents. The results from this study represent, in our estimation, an important step toward LLMs that deliver personalized information and recommendations that support individuals to achieve their health goals.

Owing to the absence of clearly defined language and multimodal datasets in the domain of personal health, we created datasets and associated tasks to evaluate different capabilities of PH-LLM. These datasets include professional examinations that test domain knowledge about sleep medicine and fitness, case studies about real-world coaching recommendations and PROs about sleep.

Sleep medicine examinations: we compiled 629 MCQs from BoardVitals (https://www.boardvitals.com/) sleep medicine board review question banks. We used the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician's Recognition Award (PRA) ‘Category 1 - Sleep Medicine' question bank, which emulates examination content for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Sleep Medicine Certification Exam. We also used the Sleep Medicine Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Exam and Longitudinal Knowledge Assessment Review question bank, which emulate examination content for the ABIM Sleep Medicine MOC Exam and the ABIM Longitudinal Knowledge Assessment. This compiled set of MCQs spanned a wide range of sleep-related topics: Normal Sleep and Variants (N = 127), Breathing Disorders (N = 84), Hypersomnolence (N = 60), Insomnias (N = 85), Movement Disorders (N = 23), Parasomnias (N = 57), Sleep in Other Disorders (N = 112) and Sleep-Wake Timing (N = 81).

A subset of 204 questions was selected for evaluation by sleep experts. Sampling was performed randomly to ensure similar distributions to the entire set of MCQs when stratified based on medical content categories (https://www.abim.org/Media/aypkdxpi/sleep-medicine.pdf) and their difficulty levels.

Fitness examinations: we compiled 99 MCQs sourced from multiple question banks that emulate examination content for the CSCS examination preparation book that the NSCA provides (https://www.nsca.com/certification/cscs/certified-strength-and-conditioning-specialist-exam-description). We used the test examination questions from the NSCA-CSCS textbook Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning.

Accuracy was used as the metric to evaluate the performance of our model in professional examinations, in line with previous work evaluating MedMCQA44. Each question presents up to five possible answers, with a single correct answer. MCQs were not used for model training. All samples were used in evaluation.

Each of the 857 case studies was sampled from anonymized Fitbit production data from individuals who provided consent for research purposes. Case studies were designed to interpret a range of physiological sensor information toward deriving insights, potential causes or recommendations for future behaviors.

Creation of case studies consisted of four main parts, each developed in close collaboration with domain experts: identifying the primary goals of the case studies, selecting case study input features, sampling individuals for inclusion in case studies and creating gold standard case study responses.

Domain experts in sleep and fitness each consisted of ‘primary' and ‘secondary' contributors to case study response creation and evaluation. This categorization was based on each expert's general availability; ‘primary' contributors had more involvement and higher workload volumes. The level of domain expertise was similar across the two groups. The sleep and fitness verticals were each led by a clinical expert in their respective fields. The clinical lead oversaw case study development and provided feedback and quality control to the set of domain experts.

We recruited six domain experts, all of whom possessed advanced degrees (MD, DO or PsyD) in sleep medicine and professional sleep medicine work experience ranging from 4 years to 46 years. All experts were trained to read and interpret wearable data and map outputs to their corresponding sleep medicine literature counterparts.

Primary goals: the sleep case studies aimed to enhance understanding of sleep patterns, identify causes of irregular sleep and offer actionable recommendations based on these findings, with the ultimate objective of enhancing the sleep quality of the individual.

Input feature selection: each sleep case study incorporated demographic information (age and self-reported gender), daily sleep metrics (for example, bedtimes, wake times and sleep stage durations) and aggregated sleep statistics (for example, average bedtime) (Fig. 2a). The daily sleep metrics contained up to 29 days of data across 16 metrics (Supplementary Table 26). The aggregated sleep statistics included multiple summary measures for each daily metric computed over all the days, the percentile that the aggregated metric is in as compared to other individuals within the same demographic group and the 5th and 95th percentiles of the aggregated metric as compared to other individuals within the same demographic group. For some metrics, such as bedtime, the metrics were computed separately for all days, weekdays only and weekends only to understand weekday versus weekend patterns (Supplementary Table 27).

Sample selection: the dataset was sampled to enrich for non-missingness and achieve a representative group across age and self-reported gender (Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 25). We first limited the data to individuals with at least 28 sleep events within the 29-day window. We then sampled from 64 different demographic groups, determined by a combination of 32 different age buckets (13–20 years old and 20–80 years old, with each group within this range spanning 2 years, and 80 years old and above) and two gender buckets (male and female). Each case study (N = 507) was created from a unique individual. The distribution of the number of days for which data are available in the sleep case studies is presented in Supplementary Fig. 12a.

Gold standard response creation: experts were instructed to interpret the case study input data to craft guidance in the second-person narrative, fostering a direct and personalized dialogue with the user. The case study input data were presented to the experts in both graphical and tabular formats for ease of analysis (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 26 and 27). The experts composed responses across the following sections:

Insights: implicitly, this section answered the question of ‘What are some sleep-related insights based on my data?' The sleep medicine expert examined the data and provided an interpretation of whether a data point might represent an atypical sleep pattern. The experts were asked to systematically review each case to provide a holistic assessment of the user's sleep patterns. To do so, Fitbit sleep metrics were assessed according to the validated Routine, Sleep Quality, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency and Duration (RU-SATED) framework to generate sleep insights45.

Etiology: implicitly, this section answered the question of ‘What are the possible underlying causes that could explain the observed data?' The experts generally considered the contribution of circadian rhythm, homeostatic drive, psychophysiologic hyperarousal and extrinsic factors and indicated their likelihood.

Recommendations: implicitly, this section answered the question of ‘What can I do to improve my sleep?' The experts were asked to provide personalized recommendations to the individual that can help them improve their sleep by addressing potential causes identified in the etiology section. The experts were instructed to create recommendations that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART)46.

We recruited seven domain experts in fitness to analyze an individual's quantitative fitness data. The seven fitness experts all possessed advanced degrees (MS, MA, MEd or DAT) related to the athletic training field and professional athletic training work experience ranging from 4 years to 25 years.

Primary goals: the fitness case studies were designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of an individual's training load, sleep patterns and health metrics, with the ultimate objective of synthesizing the metrics into a data-driven assessment of the extent to which the individual is prepared for physical activity today, and to provide associated recommendations.

Input feature selection: similar to the sleep case studies, fitness case study inputs spanned demographic information (age, self-reported gender, height, weight and body mass index (BMI)), wearable sensor daily values for cardiovascular training load, sleep and health metrics and aggregated statistics (Fig. 2b). The quantitative fitness data contain up to 30 days of data.

Sample selection: we enriched for samples containing sufficient activity for interesting training readiness analysis by considering individuals who logged more than 30 lifetime runs and had, within a contiguous 21-day window, mean active zone minutes of at least 45 minutes and, at most, 5 days of missing data for step counts, sleep, heart rate variability and resting heart rates. We further filtered to person-days with at least two logged exercises in the past 28 days and that contained noticeable recent changes in heart rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, active zone minutes or run activity. Each case study (N = 350) targets a unique person-day combination, with N = 58 unique individuals in the dataset. The distribution of the number of available days for fitness case studies is presented in Supplementary Fig. 12b. The demographics of the individuals in fitness case studies are presented in Extended Data Fig. 10b and Supplementary Table 25 for age and gender and in Supplementary Fig. 13 for BMI, height and weight.

Gold standard response creation: experts were instructed to formulate insights, assessments and recommendations in the second-person narrative. The case study input data were presented to the experts in tabular, text and graphical formats. The experts composed responses across the following sections:

Demographics: the experts considered the demographics data (age, self-reported gender, height, weight and BMI) and commented on whether any precautions should be taken when recommending a fitness program.

Training load: the experts were provided with a detailed table capturing daily metrics over the past 30 days, including day of the week, date, minutes spent in fat-burn, cardio and peak zones, training impulse (TRIMP), which is a training load measure derived from heart rate and exercise duration, and number of steps (Supplementary Table 28). Daily TRIMP values were additionally visualized in a bar plot (Fig. 2b). Aggregate statistics were also provided, including means; ranges; acute TRIMP (7-day total training load), a measure of acute training load; chronic TRIMP (28-day average acute training load), a measure of chronic training load; and acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), aiding the assessment of training stress. Recent exercise logs and associated metrics were provided for each exercise entry (Supplementary Table 29).

Sleep metrics: the data included nine daily sleep metrics: day of the week, date, bedtime, wake time, sleep time, awake time, deep sleep duration, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration and the sleep score (Supplementary Table 30). Experts were also given aggregated metrics, including means, standard deviations and z-scores, indicating the difference in metrics between the most recent 3 days and the past 28 days to identify recent trends (Supplementary Table 31). Select sleep metrics were additionally visualized (Fig. 2b).

Health metrics: daily data on day of the week, date, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and respiratory rate were provided to assess recovery and stress (Supplementary Tables 32 and 33), along with graphical representations (Fig. 2b). The experts were also given aggregate metrics, such as means, standard deviations, ranges and z-scores, indicating the difference in metrics between the most recent day and the past 28 days (Supplementary Table 34), to gauge changes over time and assess recovery and stress levels effectively.

Assessment and recommendation: the experts integrated multiple data sources to evaluate workout readiness and provide personalized recommendations. They synthesized the most important insights from the previous sections along with simulated user feedback about their subjective state. The synthetically generated user feedback included a qualitative description of subjective readiness (for example, ‘feeling fatigued') and muscle soreness (for example, ‘manageable soreness') (Supplementary Tables 35 and 36). The synthetically generated user feedback was generated using Gemini 1.0 Pro (prompts are shown in Supplementary Tables 37 and 38). Based on all available information, the experts assessed the individual's readiness to work out on a scale of 1 to 5 and provided specific fitness recommendations (Fig. 2b).

Sleep and fitness case studies were collected from distinct sets of individuals. For both the sleep and fitness verticals, we generated two sets of data: a dataset used for model training, validation and testing and a holdout dataset that was used only for final evaluation of the model by experts (Extended Data Fig. 1).

To generate the dataset used for training, validation and testing, we first prompted the Gemini family of models with the data for each section in order to generate baseline model (Gemini Ultra 1.0) responses (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The experts then reviewed and rewrote the responses as needed. The dataset also underwent multiple rounds of quality control, engaging the experts and clinical leads. Separately, to generate the holdout dataset, the experts wrote the responses from scratch (without any LLM assistance). This was done to ensure a clearer comparison between experts and the model during final evaluation.

In total, we created 507 case studies for sleep (457 case studies for the training, validation and test set and 50 case studies for the holdout set, all drawn from unique individuals) and 350 case studies for fitness (300 case studies drawn from 48 individuals for the training, validation and test set and 50 case studies drawn from 11 individuals for the holdout set). Data splits for fitness, which sample multiple case studies from single individuals, were created to ensure that person-months were unique between the train and holdout test set. Although a single individual contributes case studies with unique person-months to both the train and holdout splits (N = 5 and N = 3, respectively), excluding these holdout samples did not substantially impact holdout performance (Supplementary Fig. 6). Within each fitness split, case studies from a given individual were selected from distinct days such that target person-days were unique across samples.

Because each case study had multiple sections (three sections for sleep and five sections for fitness), in total we obtained 3,271 question–answer pairs (457 × 3 + 300 × 5 = 2,871 for train/validation/test and 50 × 3 + 50 × 5 = 400 for the holdout evaluation).

To evaluate the ability of PH-LLM to predict PROs from longitudinal passive sensor data, we used a large institutional review board (IRB)-approved study in which wearable data were collected for a population of 10,099 consented individuals for a 4-week period28. At both intake and completion, participants were asked to complete two surveys: the PROMIS short-form Sleep Disruption and Sleep Impairment surveys27, each containing eight questions with answers on a five-point Likert scale (Supplementary Tables 39 and 40). The study thus linked individuals' perceived sleep quality and its impact on their functioning with longitudinal observed physiological (for example, heart rate and sleep duration) and behavioral (activity) measurements.

We used the completion survey responses for all 16 questions as the basis for prediction and, for each question, defined a binary outcome that compared the highest answer (for example, ‘strongly agree') against all others (Supplementary Fig. 14). Features used to predict each binary outcome include 20 time-varying wearable measurements (Supplementary Table 41), each of which was collected from study participants over a 4-week span. Although most individuals have sensor data for over 21 days, distributions are heavily left-skewed (Supplementary Fig. 15). To obtain data points with complete labels and standardized input features, we filtered the dataset to retain only individuals who have all completion survey responses and at least 15 days of sensor data (N = 4,163 individuals). For each individual, we kept only the last 15 (possibly non-contiguous) days of sensor data, resulting in a 20 × 15 matrix that represents the wearable sensor data for each research participant over 15 days as well as a vector of 16 binary values as the prediction targets. We performed sensor data quality filtering by replacing values more than 4 s.d. from the population median with their nearest non-outlier values.

In total, we created 4,163 PRO samples, randomly split into 2,914 (70%) training examples, 416 (10%) validation examples and 833 (20%) testing examples. Each sample corresponds to a unique individual and contains labels for 16 binary outcomes, resulting in 46,624 (=2,914 × 16) training, 6,656 validation and 13,328 testing data points with binary labels.

To train PH-LLM from the most capable base model, we performed automated evaluation of several Gemini candidate model sizes and a medical LLM on the professional examination questions. The candidate models were Gemini Nano 1.0, Gemini Pro 1.0, Gemini Ultra 1.0 (ref. 26) and Med-PaLM 2 (ref. 2).

Because Gemini Ultra 1.0 was the most accurate Gemini family base model on professional examinations, suggesting that it has appropriate domain knowledge in the areas of sleep and fitness, we explored the performance of this model on case studies. We prompted Gemini Ultra 1.0 by summarizing guidelines given to the experts for dataset creation. For example, the sleep experts generally were asked to follow the RU-SATED format45 to generate sleep insights. To encourage Gemini Ultra 1.0 to generate high-quality case study responses, we similarly prompted it to follow the RU-SATED format and provided an explanation of what metrics should be used to assess each dimension (see Supplementary Tables 42–49 for details). We note that each case study consisted of multiple sections containing textual representations of aggregated sensor data that represent different queries and responses: three sections for sleep case studies (insights, etiology and recommendations) and five sections for fitness case studies (demographics, training load, sleep, health metrics and the assessment). Because each section represented a different aspect of the case study, we developed prompts specifically for each section (Supplementary Tables 42–44 for sleep; Supplementary Tables 45–49 for fitness). We represented aggregated sensor data as text to mimic observations of how the experts used and interpreted the case study data while creating gold standard responses. For sections that synthesized results from previous sections—that is, the etiology and recommendation sections in sleep case studies and the assessment section in fitness case studies—we substituted the model answers from previous sections into the prompt (Supplementary Table 49).

We finetuned Gemini Ultra 1.0 on the case studies to create PH-LLM. We used the case studies from the training, validation and test sets for model training and selection (457 case studies from 457 individuals for sleep and 300 case studies from 48 individuals for fitness). For each of the sleep and fitness domains, we randomly split the case studies into separate training, validation and test splits using a 70:15:15 ratio. We used the same text prompts that were given to the baseline model to form prompt–response pairs for model tuning. Because each section was treated as a separate example, this resulted in 1,371 prompt–response pairs for sleep and 1,500 prompt–response pairs for fitness across the training, validation and test sets (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

Typically, LLMs are trained on mixtures of tasks47. Here, we finetuned the model on a 1:1 mixture of sleep and fitness prompt–response pairs. Within the fitness prompt–response pairs, we upsampled higher-quality case studies by a 2:1 ratio, where higher-quality case studies were defined as those that underwent additional rounds of quality control by the fitness experts.

The Gemini Ultra 1.0 model, which is based on a transformer decoder26, was finetuned for 1,500 steps with a global batch size of four using linear warmup over 50 steps and cosine decay. Finetuning was performed by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between predicted and target token distributions. We used a learning rate of 2.5 × 10−7, a weight decay of 1 × 10−2 and a learning rate decay minimum ratio of 0.1. We saved model checkpoints every 50 steps. For our final model candidate, we chose the first checkpoint (step = 550) after the model had been trained for at least one epoch. At this point, the validation loss had started to plateau and stabilize (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Using PH-LLM finetuned on case studies, we further finetuned an adapter for PH-LLM to predict PROs from wearable data. To do so, we used a subset of the Google DWB study dataset28, which collected both wearable data and self-reported outcomes, and we trained the model following the methodology developed in HeLM37. The wearable data of each individual consisted of 20 device measurements over 15 days and were passed to the model through both textual prompt and the adapter. The textual prompt provided the age of the individual, listed the names of 20 device measurements and their mean values across 15 days and asked the model to predict either ‘yes' or ‘no' for a specific binary outcome (Supplementary Table 50). For the adapter, we standardized the wearable data by z-scoring using the training data mean and s.d. for each wearable sensor. Then, for each individual, we computed the mean and variance of z-scored sensor values across 15 days for each measurement, yielding a standardized and aggregated 20 × 2 sensor data matrix. This matrix was projected into four ‘soft tokens' in the PH-LLM token embedding space by an MLP adapter with an input layer of size 40; three hidden layers of sizes 1,024, 4,096 and 1,024, each followed by rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function; and an output layer of size 4 × 14,336 = 57,344 where 14,336 is the token embedding size of PH-LLM. Finally, these four ‘soft tokens' were passed to PH-LLM as a prefix to the textual prompt.

The adapter was trained to minimize cross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual binary outcome value while keeping PH-LLM weights frozen. The adapter was trained for, at most, 30,000 steps using a global batch size of eight, a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 with linear warmup over 50 steps and cosine decay. The final checkpoint was selected as the one with the highest AUPRC (averaged over 16 binary outcomes) on the validation dataset.

We compared the predictions on the test dataset from PH-LLM with adapter to those from text-only PH-LLM using either zero-shot or few-shot prompting. For zero-shot, the prompt was almost the same as that for PH-LLM with adapter except that there was no adapter-based soft token prefix and the prompt also listed the variance across 15 days for each raw measurement value. For few-shot, the prompt additionally added three examples (the maximum number of complete examples that fit within the context window). For all three models, positive and negative outcomes were scored by computing the log likelihood for each outcome.

We fit a logistic regression model separately for each binary outcome where the input is the same as that to the PH-LLM adapter. We also trained a CNN using the z-scored wearable data of shape 20 × 15 (whose sensor-based means and variances are the input to the PH-LLM adapter and logistic regression models) as input. The CNN sequentially consists of two convolutional layers with kernel shapes (15, 1) and (1, 1), respectively, each followed by a batch normalization layer and a dropout layer with dropout probability 0.2, two feedforward layers with sizes 64 and 1 and a sigmoid activation at the end. Both convolutional layers have 16 filters, one-step strides and a ReLU activation.

We evaluated model performance on the professional examination dataset using a combination of CoT prompting32 and self-consistency31. For our primary results, we generated five reasoning paths per question and selected the most common response as the final answer. For questions that did not have a unique modal response, we selected the answer option with highest log probability as the final answer.

To assess the ability of PH-LLM to differentiate correct from incorrect answers based on confidence, we used a log probability analysis. For each multiple-choice examination question, we computed the model's log probability for every answer option and applied softmax normalization to obtain a probability distribution over all answer options. For metric calculation, each answer option was treated as an individual prediction, comparing the model's normalized log probability against a binary label (1 for a correct response, 0 otherwise). We then computed micro-averaged AUROC and micro-averaged AUPRC across the sleep and fitness examinations independently.

Although evaluation against MCQs and PROs can be performed by comparing model predictions to gold standard structured responses and numerical values, respectively, the case studies involve longer-form outputs. To evaluate these model responses, the domain experts (including all experts involved in creating the case study responses) were asked to evaluate three responses written to each case study: one by Gemini Ultra 1.0, one by PH-LLM and one by a domain expert (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Of the 100 holdout case studies, 94 had at least one single expert rate all three responses (45/50 in sleep and 49/50 in fitness); the remainder had multiple experts contribute ratings. Each domain expert was assigned evaluations randomly to case studies for which they did not write the expert response and were blinded to the source of each response. The domain experts evaluated each case study response based on a custom rubric that quantifies incorporation of user data, appropriate personalization based on user data, use of expert domain knowledge, evidence of confabulations or unwarranted assumptions, potential for harm, readability and overall quality (Supplementary Table 9).

Holdout case studies were fully distributed across the primary group of experts. A portion of the holdout case studies was additionally assigned to the rest of the available domain experts.

To assess inter-rater agreement and analyze differences between primary and secondary rater groups, we introduced overlap across case study rating assignments within each vertical, resulting in 78–1,428 paired ratings within a subset of raters. To evaluate inter-rater reliability, we employed several established metrics: raw counts of agreement, pairwise Spearman's rank correlation, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W), weighted Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC2. Spearman's correlation and Kendall's coefficient of concordance are metrics based on comparing ranks of expert ratings. These may be more conservative in the presence of many ties, as in our data with many ratings clustered around 4 and 5 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Weighted Cohen's kappa measures agreement between raters adjusted for chance agreement. The metric ranges from −1 to 1 with 0 indicating that the agreement among raters is similar to chance. Weighted Cohen's kappa can exhibit paradoxical behavior (‘Kappa Paradox'), underestimating the true extent of agreement between raters34 in imbalanced datasets such as ours. Gwet's AC1, and its weighted extension designed for ordinal data, Gwet's AC2, were designed to deal with class imbalance while adjusting for chance agreement34,35. Qualitative trends for all metrics were consistent across rater pairs in both verticals (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).

Although expert grading of case study responses was our primary mechanism for assessing model performance, AutoEval allows us to obtain a quick, although potentially less accurate, signal by using secondary models to perform this grading task48.

AutoEval dataset: while exploring different modeling mechanisms, we performed an initial round of expert grading using the rubrics (Supplementary Table 9) and procedure described above for 50 expert-generated case studies from each vertical across three response sources: experts, an untuned Gemini Ultra 1.0 model and a finetuned Gemini Pro 1.0 model. We split these studies into vertical-specific training and validation splits containing approximately 80% (N = 38) and 20% (N = 12) of case studies, respectively. Splits were structured such that samples rated by a given expert were evenly distributed between sets. All ratings associated with a given case study were included in that split, resulting in N = 6,552 total ratings across case study sections and evaluation principles for sleep (N = 4,872 train and N = 1,596 validation) and N = 9,331 for fitness (N = 7,138 train and N = 2,193 validation).

AutoEval examples: using the rated case studies, we constructed LLM prompts and targets. Prompts included a description of the rating task objective for the given case study section, a summary of data describing the case study, the principle being assessed and the principle's Likert scale options. Each target was the expert-generated rating followed by the rating's Likert option text description (for example, for a ‘No incorrect domain knowledge' principle rating of 5, the target is ‘5. No incorrect domain knowledge references exist'.) (Supplementary Table 51).

AutoEval model training: we created AutoEval rater models by finetuning the smaller Gemini Pro 1.0 model26 using LoRA49 across a variety of vertical-specific data mixtures, including all ratings for a vertical and all ratings from a single rater. All AutoEval modeling experiments used a fixed set of hyperparameters, varying only the training data mixture: a LoRA rank of 4 on attention heads, random Gaussian initialization for LoRA's A matrix and zero initialization for LoRA's B matrix. Models were tuned to minimize the cross-entropy loss between predicted and target token distributions using the Adafactor optimizer50 with a constant learning rate of 2 × 10−5, a β1 of 0.95, a decay of 0.995 and a gradient norm clipping threshold of 1.0. None of warmup, weight decay or quantization was used. Models were tuned for a maximum of 20 epochs with a global batch size of 32. Checkpoints were taken four times per epoch, and the best checkpoint was selected by minimizing validation set log perplexity. The total number of steps varied per model because each training mixture contained a different number of samples depending on the vertical and rater (Supplementary Table 52).

AutoEval model selection: we evaluated four candidate AutoEval models for each vertical. An untuned Gemini Pro 1.0 model served as a baseline. The other three AutoEval candidates were trained identically using different data mixtures: ‘All' contained all ratings in the vertical; ‘High variance' contained ratings from only the expert rater with highest rating variance (raters ‘Sleep Primary C' and ‘Fitness Primary C'); and ‘Low variance' contained ratings from only the expert rater with lowest rating variance (raters ‘Sleep Primary D' and ‘Fitness Primary B'). We generated model predictions by scoring the likelihood of each Likert option given the input prompt, converted these scores into five-class multinomial probabilities and chose the option with the largest probability score. We selected the best AutoEval model for each vertical using a combination of log perplexity loss and Spearman's rank correlation between predictions and the ground truth ratings in the validation dataset (referred to as ‘best AutoEval' models).

AutoEval inference: given case study candidate responses, we used the Likert scoring procedure described above to automatically rate outputs across case study sections and evaluation principles with our best AutoEval models.

Confidence intervals (95%) were determined via bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations. Statistical significance of expert ratings was determined using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini–Hochberg) correction when multiple sections or multiple evaluation principles were analyzed together. All P values refer to P values after FDR correction. For each P value, we report the test statistic Z and the effect size \(r=Z/\sqrt{N}\), where N is the total sample size of the test.

a, Case studies were selected from anonymized Fitbit production data from individuals who provided consent for research purposes. Two sets of case studies were generated: one set for model training, validation, and testing and a separate holdout set for final evaluation. To facilitate rapid development of high-quality answers, the train/validation/test set of case studies had candidate responses generated by Gemini, which were then edited and rewritten by domain experts. To enable comparison of human and model-derived responses, the holdout set had responses written solely by the domain experts. b, For model training, each case study was split into multiple prompt/answer pairs based on how many sections the case study had: N=3 for sleep with insights, etiology, and recommendations sections, N=5 for fitness with demographics, training load, sleep metrics, health metrics, and assessment sections (Methods). Gemini Ultra 1.0 underwent full fine-tuning using those examples to create PH-LLM. c, Expert evaluation was performed independently on the holdout dataset by the same set of domain experts responsible for generating the expert responses. For each case study in the holdout set, one or more experts who did not write the corresponding expert response graded the candidate responses (expert-written response, Gemini Ultra 1.0 response, and PH-LLM response, with 94 of the 100 case studies having all three candidate responses graded by a single expert.

All Gemini model sizes are based on the Gemini 1.0 model family. The sleep and fitness exams comprised n= 629 and n= 99 questions, respectively. Data are presented as mean categorical accuracy over 1,000 bootstrapping iterations and error bars show 95% confidence intervals.

Source data

Metrics were computed using all ratings for each principle and section across case studies rated by more than one rater in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. The number of overlapping ratings is denoted by n. Mean metrics and 95% confidence intervals derived from 1,000 bootstrapping iterations are reported for each pair.

Source data

Counts are aggregated across all case studies, sections, and principles for each case study for which multiple ratings are available in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. Blue, primary versus primary raters. Green, primary versus secondary raters. Yellow, secondary versus secondary raters.

Source data

Mean ratings given by experts for different case study evaluation principles across all sections in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. The principles are ordered according to the rubric presented in Supplementary Table 9. ‘*' indicates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multiple hypothesis testing correction. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals bootstrapped over 1,000 iterations. Within each bar, n denotes the number of principle ratings per conversation source and circles show the proportion of scores at a given Likert rating.

Source data

Counts are aggregated across all case studies, sections, and principles for each case study for which at least one rating from the AutoEval training rater is available in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. Blue, the primary expert rater versus other raters. Green, the AutoEval model trained on primary expert ratings versus other raters. Yellow, the primary expert rater versus the corresponding AutoEval model.

Source data

Mean ratings were generated using our best AutoEval models for the holdout case study subsections in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. Within each section, a ‘*' indicates a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) from the top rated response type using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multiple hypothesis testing correction. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals bootstrapped over 1,000 iterations. Within each bar, n denotes the number of principle ratings per conversation source and circles show the proportion of scores at a given Likert rating.

Source data

Mean ratings were generated using our best AutoEval models for the holdout case study subsections in the sleep (a) and fitness (b) domains. ‘PH-LLM' denotes standard performance while ‘Subsampled 25%' and ‘Subsampled 50%' denote responses from models trained on 25% and 50% of the training dataset, respectively. ‘Gemini Ultra' denotes untuned baseline performance (that is, Gemini Ultra 1.0 trained on 0% of the training dataset). Within each section, a ‘*' indicates a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) from the top rated response type using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multiple hypothesis testing correction. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals bootstrapped over 1,000 iterations. Within each bar, n denotes the number of principle ratings per conversation source and circles show the proportion of scores at a given Likert rating.

Source data

We compared the ability of PH-LLM with and without a multimodal adapter, logistic regression, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer subjective patient-reported outcomes in the test set (n=833). a, Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). b, Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Data are presented as mean performance measures over 100 bootstrapping iterations and error bars show 95% confidence intervals. The CNN underperforms logistic regression, likely due to the limited size of the dataset.

If you have an Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra Watch 2 that you bought in the US in the past year, you'll finally get the blood oxygen sensing feature back via a software update later today, according to Apple.

To make sure you get the feature, update your paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and the Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1. Sensor data will be calculated in the app, and you will be able to see your blood oxygen in the Respiratory section of the Health app. If you bought your watch before 2024 or outside of the US, you won't see any changes.

A recent US Customs ruling resolved a years-long dispute with health tech company Masimo. In 2021, Masimo sued Apple, claiming the Apple Watch maker infringed on one of its patents for optical blood monitoring. A judge ruled that Apple infringed on the patent, and the International Trade Commission upheld that ruling.

Apple was forced to suspend sales of the two offending products from 2023 to 2024. When the company launched the Apple Watch Series 10 on its landmark 10th anniversary, it did so without the blood oxygen sensing feature. This feature was originally launched on the Watch Series 6 in 2020 and has since become a core feature on almost every fitness tracker.

Apple says it “redesigned” the feature but didn't share more details. This update fixes the single biggest problem on Apple's latest watches. Many other fitness trackers, like Garmin, have included a blood oxygen sensing feature for years. High-end trackers use the sensor data to help athletes train at altitude for optimum performance, but the feature became more important during the Covid-19 pandemic.

You might not necessarily notice your blood oxygen level dipping, but your watch can. Sales of pulse oximeters skyrocketed. I myself realized that my cough was pneumonia when my blood oxygen level started dipping to around 84 percent. (An abnormal blood oxygen rating is not enough information to diagnose illness, and you should see a doctor if you get a worrisome reading from your device.)

This is a positive development for Apple ahead of its annual September event, where it's expected to debut new iPhones and the Apple Watch Series 11, which will inevitably introduce more extensive health features.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Kryptos Key Is Going Up for Sale","https://www.wired.com/story/jim-sanborn-auctions-kryptos-key/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 05:00:00 GMT","

Ever since artist James Sanborn unveiled Kryptos, an outdoor sculpture that sits at CIA headquarters, amateur and professional cryptanalysts have been feverishly attempting to crack the code hidden in its nearly 1800-character message. While they have decoded 3 of the 4 panels of ciphertext in the S-shaped copper artwork, the final panel, known as K4, still defies solution. Only one human being on Earth knows the message of K4: Sanborn. But soon someone else will join the club. Sanborn is putting the answer up for sale.

“I'm auctioning off the 97-character plaintext of K4, which is the secret of Kryptos,” Sanborn tells me. He's even throwing in a curved metal plate that he used as a cutting sample for the panel that now sits at the agency.

Sanborn has hinted that auctioning off the secret was a possibility, most recently in a March interview he did with me. At the time, he was frustrated by idiots triumphantly and inaccurately claiming they had cracked the code with artificial intelligence.

But why now? “I wanted to be of sound mind and body when it happened, so I could control it in some way,” says Sanborn, who is turning 80 around the time the bidding will commence in November. He could also use the money. As a working artist, he doesn't have a massive retirement account, and he is particularly concerned that if he or his wife suffered a serious disability, they would face considerable financial challenges. Part of the proceeds, he says, will go to programs for the disabled. The bidding will be handled by RR Auction and the reserve, he says, should be around $300,000.

It's his hope and assumption that the winning bidder, after experiencing the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of seeing the solution, will take over handling the putative answers from the still-active community of people trying to crack the code. Though handling the queries has been intensive work, (Sanborn fields 30 to 40 letters a week), the artist thinks that it could soon get easier—ironically with the help of AI. After my WIRED article last March, Sanborn says he was contacted by a well-known figure in the AI field. (He won't say who.) This person outlined how Sanborn could use AI to respond to Kryptos fans, which is funny since much of the annoyance comes from responding to incorrect answers from people using AI. “The irony is not lost on me,” he says. Sanborn himself has no interest in working in tandem with the winning bidder to respond to the stream of would-be solvers, “I'd rather it be over,” he says. “At this point, I'm tired of it.”

But anything could happen. If some wise-ass Bitcoin billionaire prankster snaps up the code, the whole thing could very well blow up. Remember when Martin Shkreli, who likely made a fortune by jacking up the price of a medicine he controlled, was the high bidder for the single copy of a Wu-Tang Clan recording? It was a fiasco! After Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud, the record was seized by the US government, and it was eventually sold to people who planned to carefully release sections of the album as NFTs. But Shkreli had retained his own copies, and briefly started streaming them. The experience showed how an ill-intentioned owner could violate the vision of an artist. Nonetheless, Sanborn says his sale comes without conditions.

For many years, it was assumed that only one other person possibly had the solution: William Webster, the CIA director at the time the sculpture was completed. At the christening, Sanborn handed Webster a sealed envelope that supposedly had the key to Kryptos. Years later, Sanborn hinted that the contents did not have the complete solution. In any case, Webster died on August 8, and no word has come about what happened to that envelope.

Sanborn tells me that he has not formally informed the CIA of his decision (though if they don't know it's kind of embarrassing for an intelligence agency with a multi-billion dollar budget). “There's no question that I can do it–I have rights to the text,” he says. “But there's so much paranoia floating around, like, what if a Russian oligarch gets a hold of the CIA crypto secret?”

It's also not clear that having the complete plaintext will actually solve the mystery of Kryptos. Sanborn has indicated that the text of K4 is actually an instruction for how to solve it, and it may well involve other parts of the installation besides the S-shaped metal sculpture with the encrypted text. “Even when K4 has been solved, its riddle will persist as K5,” he wrote in a statement released to a few media organizations. Sanborn did tell me that attaining that complete solution does not require physical access to CIA grounds. Like everyone else in the world but him, I don't know what the hell that means.

Now someone besides the artist will. “I hope the owner will choose to keep K4 secret,” he says.If they don't, what's the point? “If you don't have the secrets, you don't have any power.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The First Federal Cybersecurity Disaster of Trump 2.0 Has Arrived","https://www.wired.com/story/the-first-federal-cybersecurity-disaster-of-trump-20-has-arrived/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:20:00 GMT","

The second Trump administration has its first federal cybersecurity debacle to deal with.

A breach of the United States federal judiciary's electronic case filing system, discovered around July 4, has pushed some courts onto backup paper-filing plans after the hack compromised sealed court records and possibly exposed the identities of confidential informants and cooperating witnesses across multiple US states.

More than a month after the discovery of the breach—and in spite of recent reports from The New York Times and Politico that Russia was involved in perpetrating the hack—it is still unclear exactly what happened and which data and systems were affected.

Politico first reported the breach of the “case management/electronic case files,” or CM/ECF, system, which may have impacted criminal dockets, arrest warrants, and sealed indictments. The CM/ECF system also suffered a breach in 2020 during the first Trump administration, and Politico reported on Tuesday that, in the recent attack, hackers exploited software vulnerabilities that remained unaddressed after being discovered five years ago in response to that first incident. Security researchers say that gaps in public information about the situation are concerning, particularly when it comes to lack of clarity on what data was affected.

“We're more than a month into detecting this intrusion and still don't have a full accounting of what's impacted,” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and current vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “If we don't have sufficient logging to reconstruct attack activity, that would be extremely disappointing, because this system has been repeatedly targeted over the years.”

In response to a request for comment, the United States Courts referred WIRED to its August 7 statement, which says the federal judiciary “is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents” and “further enhancing security of the system.” The courts also mention that the “vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary's electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public,” while conceding that “some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view.”

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the scope of the breach or who perpetrated it.

Reports this week that Russia was involved in the attack or may be the sole perpetrator have been difficult to interpret, given other indications that espionage actors backed by multiple countries—and possibly organized crime syndicates—may have been involved in or piggybacking on the breach for their own exfiltration.

John Hultquist, chief analyst in Google's Threat Intelligence Group, says it is not uncommon to see multiple actors poking at a sensitive, and potentially vulnerable, system. “Investigations are regularly targeted by cyberespionage actors from several countries,” he says.

News of the breach comes as the Trump administration has continued to slash the federal workforce, including combing intelligence and cybersecurity agencies to remove officials or pressure them to resign.

“I think federal investigators probably know who was behind the attack, but given the climate, I would suspect that no one wants to say with certainty,” Hunter Strategy's Williams says.

Multiple administrations have struggled to get a handle on insidious espionage operations, particularly campaigns perpetrated by Chinese and Russian actors. But researchers emphasize that vulnerabilities enabling the attack on CM/ECF should have been addressed after the 2021 breach.

“Enforcing policies to require that sealed or highly sensitive documents be handled via air-gapped systems or secure isolated networks rather than through CM/ECF or PACER would have dramatically limited exposure. And this was actually recommended post-2021,” says Tim Peck, senior threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Securonix. “Instituting consistent, centralized logging—among other things—across all disparate CM/ECF instances could have enabled earlier detection and rapid mitigation before data exfiltration escalated as far as it did.”

In other words, highly targeted systems like those of the US Courts are likely going to suffer breaches. But the best way to reduce the likelihood and severity of these attacks is to make sure flaws actually get fixed after they're first exploited.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Future of EV Charging Can Be Found at Your Local Gas Station","https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-ev-charging-gas-stations-rest-stops/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

New federal guidance controlling $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle fast chargers in the US could direct more money towards gas station and truck stop operators. The result? The future of “topping up” your car might look a lot like the present.

This week, the US Department of Transportation released new interim guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. These rules advise states on how to spend $5 billion in funding for new electric-vehicle fast chargers, with the goal of creating a nationwide highway network of some half a million public chargers. The NEVI program was first established in 2021 by the Biden administration's infrastructure bill, with the goal of doing away with one of car buyers' biggest electric-vehicle fears: that they'll run out of charge.

But the program came under fire in the first weeks of Donald Trump's administration, part of a push to nix what the president has called an “electric vehicle mandate.” The DOT “paused” the program for months, halting some payments to the states. (The department was forced to restart funding in some states after a handful of blue ones won cases in court.)

The new guidance, which isn't yet final, isn't very different from the old language. The Federal Highway Administration, the agency in charge, says the goal is to “streamline” the program, making it easier for states to get charger money to the companies that build them, which then get chargers quickly into the ground. It directs states to submit new plans for using the charger funding within 30 days.

The agency also added some new provisions, including one that encourages states to give their money to charging locations where the businesses that own the stations also own the ground below it. The goal here is to “accelerate project delivery”—and it's great news for incumbents in the (now mostly gas) fueling industry. Big winners will likely include the names you recognize from today's road trips: truck stop operators like Pilot Flying K, Love's Travel Stops, and TravelCenters of America; convenience store chains like Sheetz, WaWa, and Kwik Trip; and even some big-box stores, like Walmart.

Right now, these federal recommendations don't have the force of law behind them; they're just “encouragements.” But if states go along with the guidance, and send billions in public charger money to these sorts of companies, then drivers with electric vehicles will likely be lured to the same sort of amenity-rich places to charge that their gas-powered cars visit today.

The move makes some sense, says Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, an EV charging data-analytics firm. Installing electric-vehicle charging is already complex work, requiring permits, construction, and the purchase of sometimes pricey and delayed electrical equipment. Add to that several different firms—a site host, plus a different company actually operating the charging equipment—and some projects have seen holdups. With the feds' new arrangement, he says, “you don't have to go through a lease negotiation, which can take a long time—months.”

Plus, survey data suggests electric vehicle drivers like truck-stop-like amenities when they're stopping to charge, a process that can take between 15 minutes and an hour, depending on the car. Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman, a spokesperson for the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, a trade association that represents travel centers and truck stops, praised the new NEVI provision and said that drivers want continuity. “The refueling experience for electricity should be as similar as possible to today's refueling experience and should work with consumer behaviors and habits,” she wrote in an email.

Los Angeles' new Tesla Diner has become a flashpoint for people's feelings about the electric automaker, its cars, its technology, and CEO Elon Musk, but it might also be a nice selling point for Tesla drivers. If you're going to have to spend time charging, why not watch some robots hand out popcorn, eat (an expensive) hotdog, or watch a drive-in movie on a big screen?

Several charging companies, including Ionna and EVgo didn't respond to WIRED's requests for comment. The Charge Ahead Partnership, a group that represents several convenience stores, truck stops, and fueling groups, said the program changes promoted flexibility and could lead to charger growth. “Prioritizing chargers at locations where the site host is also the operator eliminates the step of the applicant having to find a site host, and it promotes greater accountability once the charger is operating,” spokesperson Ryan McKinnon wrote in a statement to the media.

The new guidance also makes some other smaller changes to the NEVI program. In keeping with the administration's hostility towards “diversity,” it rescinds language that asks states to consider how small businesses, including minority- and women-owned ones, might get involved with charger installation, as well as language that asked states to think about engaging “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged” communities. States also no longer have to consider emergency evacuation plans and consumer protections when they're giving out their money.

Several environmental groups criticized the new guidance and the funding pause that led to it. “The guidance only restates requirements already in law, making clear that the real purpose of the Trump administration's freeze was to try to stall electric vehicle momentum,” Sierra Club clean transportation head Katherine García wrote in a statement.

The LG B5 is a lovely TV that you probably shouldn't buy—at least not yet. As usual, the B-series is among the cheapest ways to get an LG OLED and its perfect black levels, rich contrast, and naturalistic colors that enhance everything you watch. Also as usual, it's the step-up C-series that generally offers the best overall value for your OLED dollars.

That includes last year's C4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) on sale, and even the upgraded C5 if you time it right. In fact, as I write this review, you can grab a 65-inch C5 for just $100 more than the B5, which grants you LG's “evo” panel tech for better brightness and colors, a more stylish and stout design, and other performance benefits. Moreover, last year's B4 and C4 are so close in pricing at present, it makes more sense for most folks to move up to the mid-ranger.

None of that takes away from the B5's excellent performance. It offers strikingly accurate colors, impressive contrast and shadow detail for viewing in multiple environments, and gaming features that best some flagship TVs. In short, it's a good OLED TV, and while that's not all you need to know, it's a great starting point if you value performance. Once the B5's price really sinks, it will once again be the most affordable way to land some of the best TV tech you can buy.

The B5's design feels like a blast from OLED past. Most modern OLEDs are thicker than the pencil-thin panels of a few years ago, likely due to a mix of new panel tech to boost brightness and a desire for increased durability. The B5 is old-school, stretching just a hair or two thicker than the four-year-old LG C1 in my bedroom. As such, I wasn't shocked to see my well-used 65-inch review model slightly bent at the base on one side.

To my relief, the picture was fine—a benefit of OLED's emissive design—but it's a reminder to be both gentle and thorough when unboxing. The B5's A-frame feet make setup easier than the pedestal stands common in most step-up models, but they look chintzier. If you're wall mounting, the low-slung VESA holes at the bottom panel and two back-facing HDMI ports may require you to adjust (or rethink) your mount.

Software setup is easy with either your phone or the remote. LG's webOS isn't as simple as Roku or as feature-packed as Google TV, but it's easy enough to find content, with built-in voice search via Amazon Alexa. Video and app loading were smooth, if not as immediate as the flagship G5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). My main complaint is the lack of a global Continue Watching feature, but at least the new magic remote's quick keys are mostly useful.

Speaking of the remote, I like the slimmer design, and it continues to offer LG's Wii-style cursor, but the lack of a dedicated input key is confusing until you realize the encircled Home Hub key (set above the regular one) calls up inputs with the smart hub. The lack of a mute key is worse. Muting is engaged by holding volume down, which kind of works with the zippy G5, but with the slower B5 it often just lowers volume. Seriously, LG, bring back the damn mute.

My favorite part of the setup was getting the picture locked in, because the B5 looks pretty fantastic in any of LG's film-forward picture modes by default. I prefer Filmmaker for both SDR and HDR10 content because it looks accurate and most of the extra nonsense is turned off (though there is a separate light sensor that dims the screen hidden in the Eco Mode settings). If you want a brighter picture, you can goose up the backlight in SDR, turn on Dynamic Tone Mapping in HDR, or pick one of the brighter film modes like Cinema, ISF Bright, or Standard.

For Dolby Vision, I used Cinema Home, which looks killer after turning off a few settings like noise reduction and motion smoothing. Filmmaker also looks great, though it can be too dim with super-dark content for daytime viewing.

The B5 offers good features for its class, from Dolby Vision HDR to streaming via AirPlay and Google Cast, but its gaming credentials are the most notable. You'll get four (not two) HDMI 2.1 inputs, with support for VRR (variable refresh rate) at up to 120 Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and ALLM (auto low latency mode). You'll get higher refresh rates for PC gaming with the C5 (144 Hz) and G5 (165 Hz), but game consoles top out at 120 Hz.

Game response is quick, and the TV looks stellar by default. Roaming around Ghost of Tsushima was a treat, from windswept Japanese maples to glittering pools bathed in sunlight.

The worst thing you could say about the B5's picture is it's not particularly bright, especially considering the state of TV tech, where QLED TVs (LED TVs with quantum dots) like the Hisense U8QG (7/10, WIRED Recommends) get multiple times brighter. The B5 is more in line with cheaper QLEDs like TCL's baseline QM6K QLED (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Brightness aside, the QM6K is one of the best TVs in its class, thanks in large part to deep black levels for impressive contrast—and when it comes to picture quality, contrast is king.

That's all the more evident in the B5, which starts from perfect black thanks to OLED's emissive ability to pinpoint light at the pixel level. That means its contrast looks more dynamic than the QM6K and even some brighter LED models. No, it's not going to blast you out of the water or make you squint to see menus, but there's enough punch to showcase HDR content, especially in brighter picture modes. That combines with shadow detail that bests even high-end OLEDs from a year or two back, making it easy to view even dark content in moderately bright rooms.

Any other reservations I might have had about the B5's premium status were squashed from the first set of test patterns, where the TV revealed near-perfect screen uniformity. In regular viewing, that's most noticeable in bright, panning skylines in films or games, where you'll see no sign of the columns or smudges common in most LED TVs at this price and even above it.

There's a sumptuous touch to images of all sorts, and colors are delineated with depth and accuracy, making everything from skin tones to sports jackets stand out. You can lose yourself in subtle gradients, especially when dialing up dazzling imagery like the sparkling ocean scenes in Netflix's Our Planet. A haunting view of California golden kelp isn't just gold, but a transfixing mix of gold, brown, orange, and mustard.

The B5's Gen 2 A8 picture processor provides sparkling 4K images and solid HD upscaling. It's not quite on par with top-tier models, especially flagships like the G5 or Sony's near-holographic Bravia 8 II OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but it's better than similarly priced models from brands like Hisense and TCL.

Then there are things that QLED TVs simply can't do, like offering zero light bleed or excellent off-axis performance. I was actually surprised to find some discoloration when moving slightly off-axis with grayscale test patterns, but it was barely visible in regular viewing, ensuring everyone in the room gets a great experience.

I could raise a few other complaints, like the B5's so-so reflection handling (especially compared to flagship models) and some stuttering in motion panning, likely due in part to the TV's fast input response for gaming. Mostly, though, I just enjoyed the show because, well, it's an OLED.

If I went shopping with you today, I'd push you toward the C5, or the C4 while it lasts, as both are on steep discounts as I type this. Once the B5's price falls closer to a grand for the 65-incher, it's a sweet deal, and the best budget OLED on the market.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","HP Doubles Down on Gaming Innovation","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/hp-doubles-down-on-gaming-innovation-179867.html","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:15:00 GMT","

Let's face it: the PC gaming market may not be growing at the breakneck pace it once did, but it still commands extraordinary influence.

Gaming hardware is often the proving ground for technologies that spill over into mainstream consumer and commercial PCs — high-end graphics, advanced cooling systems, immersive audio, and personalization features that redefine user expectations.

HP knows this, and its latest gaming announcement shows the company isn't treating gaming as a side hustle. Instead, it's going all-in, fusing design ingenuity with gamer-driven engineering and leveraging its HyperX acquisition to stake a stronger claim in a competitive, if maturing, space.

At the heart of HP's gaming philosophy is a deceptively simple principle: build based on what gamers say they want. That's not just marketing rhetoric. HP's gaming team has organized its roadmap around three pillars that surface repeatedly in its product strategy: performance, personalization, and play.

Every new launch, from flagship desktops to headsets and microphones, ties back to these themes, making the portfolio a coordinated ecosystem rather than a random set of SKUs.

HP's new Omen Max 45L desktop is a statement piece — its most powerful gaming tower to date, and one designed from the inside out with a focus on thermal performance, upgrade flexibility, and aesthetic customization.

Cooling is the headline here, with HP's patented Cryo Chamber technology making a leap from its first-generation 120mm radiator to a new 360mm liquid cooling system.

Unlike typical designs that recirculate warm case air, the Cryo Chamber is physically isolated at the top of the chassis, pulling in cool ambient air and delivering up to a 7.5-degree Celsius drop in CPU temperatures and a 2-degree drop for the GPU.



HP's Omen Max 45L gaming desktop showcases triple front RGB fans and a side window view of its GeForce RTX 5090-powered interior with next-gen liquid cooling.

For gamers running high-wattage parts like AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Nvidia's RTX 5090, that's not a luxury — it's a performance enabler and a longevity boost.

HP also tackled airflow at the chassis level, strategically placing vents and elevating the case feet to improve intake. The modular 1,200-watt PSU supports cleaner cable management, further aiding airflow, and integrates a novel “fan cleaner” feature that reverses fan direction to dislodge dust on a schedule. These aren't gimmicks; they're the kind of engineering touches that experienced gamers and PC builders notice immediately.

Layered on top of the hardware is the Omen Gaming Hub software, which integrates overclocking, thermal control, lighting, and HP's AI-powered performance tuning. Omen AI applies machine learning to optimize OS, hardware, and in-game settings simultaneously—one-click performance that HP claims can extract maximum FPS in popular titles without manual tweaking.

HP is also refreshing its Omen 35L desktop and introducing a “Stealth Mode” variant with the same high-end specs, but stripped of RGB lighting for gamers seeking tournament-level performance in a minimalist package.

This model has already been tapped as the official PC for League of Legends and Valorant esports events, giving HP the kind of credibility that comes from pro-level adoption.

The Omen 16 gaming laptop gets its own boost, now configurable with Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti for creators and gamers who need portability without sacrificing rendering horsepower.

HP's 2021 acquisition of HyperX is now paying dividends. Rather than treating it as a bolt-on accessory brand, HP is tightly integrating HyperX's audio, microphone, and peripheral expertise into its gaming strategy, using the same gamer-feedback loop that shapes its PCs.

The new HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless 3 Headset is a flagship example. With pro-grade, dual-chamber 53mm drivers tuned for both explosive bass and positional accuracy, the Alpha 2 builds on HyperX's audio pedigree while adding thoughtful upgrades, like simultaneous dual-wireless connectivity, so you can game over 2.4GHz while taking calls over Bluetooth. Battery life is a staggering 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, roughly double that of competing headsets.



By pairing the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless 3 Headset with a customizable RGB control hub, HP is signaling that audio gear is as vital to gaming performance as the PC itself.

A standout innovation is the world's first reprogrammable RGB base station for a wireless gaming headset. This feature replaces the traditional USB dongle with a desk-friendly control hub that can adjust mic levels, toggle between headset and speakers, and run macros—all customizable in HyperX's redesigned Ngenuity software.

The Cloud Flight 2 family continues HyperX's tradition of comfort and durability, now with full RGB panels behind removable earcups for personalization and battery life up to 150 hours on Bluetooth.

Recognizing that gaming culture has shifted toward streaming and content creation, HP is leaning on HyperX to deliver professional-grade microphones that are accessible to non-engineers.

The new HyperX Flipcast is a dynamic XLR/USB hybrid microphone that excels at rejecting background noise — ideal for gamers in less-than-ideal acoustic environments. Features like a real-time input meter, tap-to-mute, and on-device EQ filters make it creator-friendly, while dual connectivity allows it to scale from plug-and-play to professional setups.

For newcomers, the SoloCast 2 condenser mic offers clear audio in a simpler package, with a redesigned shock mount, weighted stand, and built-in pop filter — again, the kind of incremental refinement that comes from listening to feedback on previous models.



HyperX SoloCast 2 condenser microphone with built-in stand and USB-C to USB-A cable, designed for clear audio in a compact, creator-friendly package.

From hardware to peripherals, HP's cohesive approach reinforces its commitment to gaming as a core pillar of its broader strategy.

On paper, the global PC gaming market isn't expanding dramatically. But HP's moves show an understanding that gaming remains strategically essential for three reasons.

First, gaming buyers are among the most discerning tech customers. Win them over, and you validate your engineering prowess to a broader audience.

Second, innovations born in gaming — such as AI-assisted performance tuning, advanced cooling, and premium input devices — tend to cascade into non-gaming products, elevating the entire portfolio.

Third, gaming keeps HP visible in cultural spaces that resonate with younger demographics, from esports tournaments to Twitch streams, which helps future-proof the brand.

HP's approach also leans heavily on its industrial design capabilities. The Omen Max 45L's modularity, the Stealth Mode's understated profile, and the tactile, premium feel of HyperX gear all underscore HP's belief that form and function aren't mutually exclusive.

Even playful touches — such as customizing the Omen cooler's LCD display with GIFs or system stats — add to the visceral sense that HP is designing for lifestyles, not just benchmarks.

In a category where spec sheets often blur together, these kinds of human-centric design details can create real differentiation.

HP's latest announcements suggest a gaming strategy that is cohesive, deeply integrated across hardware and peripherals, and genuinely informed by user input.

By balancing flagship innovation with practical usability — whether that's easier upgrades, cleaner cable routing, or software that removes friction — HP is positioning itself as a brand that respects both the performance purists and the everyday gamers who just want their gear to work beautifully.

Analysts widely agree that the global PC gaming market has been relatively stable. Growth rates have hovered around 2% to 4% annually, driven primarily by demand for upgrades rather than new installations.

While overall PC sales have fluctuated, gaming components like GPUs and high-refresh-rate monitors have continued to hold steady market share, thanks to gaming enthusiasts and esports growth.

Given these market dynamics and realities, HP is sending a clear signal that even if the market isn't on a rocket-ship growth curve, it intends to be one of the companies defining what the next era of gaming hardware looks and feels like.

If history is any guide, much of what HP is pioneering here will find its way into the devices the rest of us use every day.

Is this the Allen Institute for AI's breakout moment?

The U.S. National Science Foundation and chip powerhouse Nvidia will provide a total of $152 million in funding and infrastructure to the Seattle-based non-profit research institute to lead a new national project to build open AI models for scientific research.

The five-year initiative positions Ai2, as it's known, as a key player in building the technological backbone of U.S. artificial intelligence, while expanding its sources of support beyond its historic reliance on grants and philanthropy from the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

It marks NSF's first major investment in AI software infrastructure for science.

The initiative “will supercharge the work we do at Ai2 and increase America's ability to deliver breakthrough AI developments,” Ai2 CEO Ali Farhadi said in a statement. 

The project, Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure to Accelerate Science (OMAI), will develop a family of large, fully open, multimodal AI models trained on scientific literature and data. The goal is to accelerate breakthroughs in fields such as materials science, biology, and energy.

AI is becoming “not just a tool for research, but a catalyst for rethinking how discovery happens across every discipline,” said the OMAI project leader, Noah Smith, Ai2 senior director of natural language processing research and a computer science professor at the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering.

Consisting of $75 million from the NSF and $77 million from Nvidia, the initiative is part of the White House AI Action Plan to strengthen U.S. leadership in AI-driven research.

“The question isn't if AI will transform science — it's who will lead that transformation, and this investment helps ensure that the answer is America,” said Tess deBlanc-Knowles, special assistant for artificial intelligence at NSF, in a briefing with reporters this week. 

The project gives Ai2 a rare level of access to key AI hardware: Nvidia will supply its HDX B3-100 systems, built on the company's new Blackwell Ultra architecture, along with AI Enterprise software to accelerate training and inference for the new models. 

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement about the project that the goal is “to generate limitless intelligence, making it America's most powerful and renewable resource.”

The hardware is designed to handle massive datasets with high efficiency, speeding up the pace of scientific discovery, said Jack Wells, Nvidia's director of higher education and research, during the briefing with reporters.

Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, Ai2 has operated largely behind the scenes of the AI boom in recent years, focusing on research and open-source tools while for-profit giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta have dominated headlines. 

Ai2's work — from natural language models to scientific search engines — has earned respect in research circles, but the new federal and corporate backing stands to elevate its profile.

The project illustrates Washington state's position “at the epicenter of the AI-powered scientific research revolution,” Sen. Maria Cantwell said in a statement, citing the efforts of the UW and Ai2 and saying that the initiative will “position our state's researchers to drive AI breakthroughs in medicine, clean energy, and materials science.”

In leading the OMAI project, Ai2 will build on its experience creating OLMo and Molmo, two families of high-performance open AI models, along with open datasets such as Dolma. 

Unlike many leading AI systems that are fully proprietary or only partially open, Ai2's models are released with the full weights, training data, code, and evaluation tools needed for researchers to inspect, adapt, and retrain them. The idea is to give scientists the transparency they need to recreate results, and trust the technology used in high-stakes research.

Also involved will be research teams from the University of Washington (led by Hanna Hajishirzi, also with Ai2), the University of Hawai'i at Hilo (Travis Mandel), the University of New Hampshire (Samuel Carton), and the University of New Mexico (Sarah Dreier).

Ai2 said the funding will primarily be used for computing power to train larger, more advanced models on the open foundations established with OLMo and Molmo. 

The OMAI models will be designed for scientific workflows, helping researchers process and visualize data, generate code for analysis, and identify patterns they might otherwise miss. The systems could also surface relevant findings from outside a researcher's specialty, linking new insights to past discoveries to speed breakthroughs, according to Ai2. 

The project will roll out in stages, with datasets, code, and other resources released along the way. Ai2 expects the first major model to be available about 18 months into the five-year effort.

Oracle is laying off 161 workers in Seattle, according to a filing with the Washington state Employment Security Department.

The cloud and database giant has more than 400 employees in the Seattle region, according to LinkedIn. We reached out to the company for comment and we'll update this story if we hear back. 

The layoffs appear to be part of broader cuts across the tech giant's operations. DatacenterDynamics reported Tuesday that the layoffs impacted Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) teams, as well as data center operations technicians, technical project managers for the AI/ML team, and others. Teams in the U.S., Canada, and India were impacted, according to the publication.

The company has 235 open roles in Seattle on its jobs page. 

Oracle has grown its presence in the Seattle region over the past decade, tapping into the area's robust engineering talent pool as it battled Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud. In more recent years Oracle has established partnerships with both Seattle-area companies. 

Oracle, Microsoft, and other cloud behemoths are investing heavily to expand capacity for training and running AI models. 

Rising capital expenditures have created pressure to reduce operating costs through workforce reductions. Microsoft recently laid off more than 15,000 people globally.

Oracle is part of the $500 billion joint venture AI infrastructure project “Stargate” with OpenAI and SoftBank. It also inked a recent deal with Temu and helps power TikTok's servers.

Oracle announced last year that it was relocating its headquarters from Austin to Nashville. 

The company's stock is up nearly 50% this year.

Apple announced on Thursday it's introducing a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature for some Watch Series 8, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra. With this move, Apple is bringing back blood oxygen monitoring by tweaking the feature to get around the International Trade Commission's (ITC) import ban.

Blood oxygen data will be measured and calculated on the user's paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app. This means users won't be able to view the data on their Apple Watch, as they'll need to do so on their iPhone. 

Apple says the update announced today is enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling, which means that the tech giant is allowed to import Apple Watches with the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature.

The change doesn't affect previously sold models with the original version of the feature or units bought outside the U.S.

The redesigned feature only applies to Apple Watches that were sold after the ITC import ban took effect in early 2024. These users can access the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature through an iPhone and Apple Watch software update coming on Thursday.

The move comes as Apple has been in an ongoing legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo, which has accused the tech giant of stealing its pulse oximetry technology after initial talks about a potential collaboration. 

In 2023, Masimo secured a victory against Apple at the ITC to block imports of Apple Watches with blood oxygen monitoring, after the commission found that Apple's technology infringed upon Masimo's patents. Apple then had to remove the feature. 

Apple counter-sued Masimo, claiming that the company copied Apple Watch features to use in its own smartwatches. The tech giant has also filed an appeal of the ITC ban.

Airbnb has launched a new feature called “Reserve Now, Pay Later” that lets users in the U.S. reserve a property without paying up front, potentially allowing people to cancel their bookings with less hassle if their plans change.

The feature is applicable to properties that have a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy. Flexible policies let users cancel their reservation up to 24 hours before they check in, while moderate policies allow for no-fee cancellations until five days before check-in.

Users will need to pay the full amount for their booking before the listing's free cancellation period ends. Airbnb will send users a reminder to pay before that date.

The company is not new to the buy now, pay later arena. In 2018, it launched a “Pay part now, part later” product that allowed users to pay either 20% or 50% in the first tranche and the rest later. In 2023, the company teamed up with Klarna to let users pay for their stays in four installments over six weeks.

Citing a survey it conducted with Focaldata, Airbnb said 55% of those surveyed preferred a flexible payment option while booking a stay, with 42% saying they missed out on properties while trying to figure out payment logistics with other travelers.

Investors once saw Canadian AI startup Cohere as a promising contender to challenge OpenAI and Anthropic in the race to build frontier AI models, with its backers pouring roughly $1 billion behind CEO Aidan Gomez, who co-authored a seminal paper on LLMs when he was a 20-year-old Google intern.

But Cohere's AI models have fallen behind the state-of-the-art, and its business hasn't scaled like its competitors.

Now, the company is bringing in a veteran research leader to revamp its AI efforts: Cohere has hired Joelle Pineau, Meta's former VP of AI research who previously oversaw the tech giant's fundamental AI research (FAIR) lab. In her newly created chief AI officer role, Pineau will oversee AI strategy across Cohere's research, product, and policy teams.

A Canadian AI scientist and McGill professor, Pineau helped guide the early development of Meta's open Llama AI models alongside Yann LeCun, a pioneer of neural networks. Pineau left Meta in May after nearly eight years with the company.

For Cohere this is a big hire, and it is pinning its hopes on the veteran helping it with more research breakthroughs, improving its research and product pipeline, and recruiting top talent. 

The hire comes at a pivotal moment for Cohere: The company just raised $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation — an impressive sum were the startup not competing with the likes of OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic, whose war chests are worth dozens of billions each.

But while its rivals are trying to develop AI systems that can match (or exceed) human performance on a wide variety of tasks, Cohere has a narrower focus. The startup primarily builds AI applications that can solve practical problems for enterprises and government agencies, emphasizing privacy and security. 

In an interview with TechCrunch, Pineau said Cohere's focus on real-world enterprise applications is something she's excited about. “A lot of players out there are quite singularly focused on AGI, superintelligence, and so on,” said Pineau, alluding to companies like her former employer, Meta, which recently invested billions in its new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) unit. “They haven't necessarily figured out what this AI is going to be used for.”

She pointed to OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 last week, which many felt was underwhelming, as evidence the timeline to achieving AGI may be “a little bit longer than we thought.” In the meantime, Pineau says there's a lot of room for more practical AI models to deliver leaps in productivity in different industries.

A Canada native, Pineau said she's had her eye on Cohere since they were founded in 2019, and that she's excited to contribute to a company whose founders are based in her home country.

Beyond the patriotism, Pineau feels the opportunity with Cohere is a good chance to venture beyond research. At FAIR, Pineau oversaw research teams working on projects that could take anywhere from 18 months to 10 years to deliver. Now, she'll be working within a much tighter timeline, as well as getting involved with customers and products. And even though Cohere has fewer resources than Meta, Pineau said she'll be more agile in her new role.

Cohere's latest product is an AI agent platform dubbed North that enterprises and government agencies can deploy privately on their own infrastructure, an attractive notion for many of its customers, which are banks and federal organizations that handle highly sensitive data. That puts Cohere in competition with open source providers like DeepSeek and Meta, whose models can also be run locally, but at a lower cost. Cohere is betting that by offering more support around its private deployments, it can beat out open models.

Pineau said she's particularly interested in gearing more of Cohere's research around North, figuring out ways to develop AI agents in private and secure settings, and creating benchmarks to evaluate these systems. Pineau also said she's interested in exploring how networks of AI agents interact with each other in the real world.

One immediate challenge for Pineau will be replacing Cohere's VP of AI Research, Sara Hooker, who announced her departure this week after several years of helping build the company's research program. Hiring an AI researcher of Hooker's caliber may be difficult in the current market given the skyrocketing demand for AI talent.

But Pineau sees this as an opportunity to “bring in a lot of talent,” noting that when she left Meta, several of her former colleagues suggested they'd follow her to a new AI lab. However, she emphasized that Cohere has a solid base of AI researchers, and that it's important to not just bring in anyone.

“Hiring a bunch of superstars doesn't necessarily make a superstar team,” said Pineau. “It's really about how the people work together.”

Of course, Meta's AI units today look very different compared with when Pineau was there just a few months ago. Over the summer, Mark Zuckerberg went on a recruiting spree, reportedly offering some of the industry's best AI researchers compensation packages north of $100 million to join MSL. That prompted OpenAI to also raise compensation for its star employees, thus making it quite difficult for smaller players to land top AI researchers.

As Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic throw billions of dollars at their AI efforts, Cohere is trying to do more with less. For Pineau, that will mean making calculated research bets — the kind that can quickly turn into compelling products and keep the company in the race.

Google on Thursday announced a new AI-powered search tool to help travelers find flight deals — even as regulators continue to question whether the search giant's dominance in travel discovery stifles competition.

Called Flight Deals, the new tool is available within Google Flights and is designed to help “flexible travelers” find cheaper fares. Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options.

These queries can be like “week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only” or “10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,” Google said in a blog post.

Google confirmed to TechCrunch that Flight Deals uses a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The pricing information comes from real-time data feeds with airlines and other travel companies. The prices shown in Flight Deals match those in existing Google Flights preferences, though, it uses AI to parse natural language queries and surface matching destinations, the company said.

The tool ranks results based on the percentage of savings, with the highest savings appearing first, the company stated. If the savings percentages are equal, the lower absolute price is shown first. Deals without a savings badge are ranked by the lowest price, the company said.

Because flight prices change frequently, Google told TechCrunch that the ranking and availability of deals on the tool may vary.

Regulators, including the European Commission, are currently investigating how Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. EU regulators are eyeing Google for enforcement under the Digital Markets Act, aiming to rein in the power of major tech platforms. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit is reportedly planning to propose changes to appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results.

Initially, Google has brought Flight Deals in beta, with plans to roll it out in the U.S., Canada, and India over the next week. The company said the goal of the beta release is “to gather feedback and explore how AI can improve travel planning.”

Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it treats user queries like search history, and users have the option to manage or delete their history created through the tool by visiting MyActivity.

The latest move is part of a broader experiment as Google looks to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other major AI players by integrating generative AI into travel search.

Competitors like Booking.com, Expedia, and Indian travel aggregator MakeMyTrip have already rolled out their own AI integrations to streamline trip planning. In that sense, Google is arriving a bit late. But with its scale and reach, the company could still pose a serious challenge — if the tool proves effective and gains traction.

Nonetheless, the classic Google Flights interface will continue to exist. The original flight search tool, launched in 2011, is even getting an update with an option to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada.

One of Europe's most prominent AI startups has released two AI models that are so tiny, they have named them after a chicken's brain and a fly's brain.

Multiverse Computing claims these are the world's smallest models that are still high-performing and can handle chat, speech, and even reasoning in one case. 

These new tiny models are intended to be embedded into Internet of Things devices, as well as run locally on smartphones, tablets, and PCs. 

“We can compress the model so much that they can fit on devices,” founder Román Orús told TechCrunch. “You can run them on premises, directly on your iPhone, or on your Apple Watch.”

As we previously reported, Multiverse Computing is a buzzy European AI startup headquartered in Donostia, Spain, with about 100 employees in offices worldwide. It was co-founded by a top European professor of quantum computers and physics, Román Orús; quantum computing expert Samuel Mugel; and Enrique Lizaso Olmos, the former deputy CEO of Unnim Banc.

It just raised €189 million (about $215 million) in June on the strength of a model compression technology it calls “CompactifAI.” (Since it was founded in 2019, it has raised about $250 million, Orús said.)

CompactifAI is a quantum-inspired compression algorithm that reduces the size of existing AI models without sacrificing those models' performance, Orús said. 

“We have a compression technology that is not the typical compression technology that the people from computer science or machine learning will do, because we come from quantum physics,” he described. “It's a more subtle and more refined compression algorithm.”

The company has already released a long list of compressed versions of open source models, especially popular small models like Llama 4 Scout or Mistral Small 3.1. And it just launched compressed versions of OpenAI's two new open models. It has also compressed some very large models — it offers a DeepSeek R1 Slim, for instance. 

But since it's in the business of making models smaller, it has focused extra attention on making the smallest yet most powerful models possible. 

Its two new models are so small that they can bring chat AI capabilities to just about any IoT device and work without an internet connection, the company says. It humorously calls this family the Model Zoo because it's naming the products based on animal brain sizes.

A model it calls SuperFly is a compressed version of Hugging Face's open source model SmolLM2-135. The original has 135 million parameters and was developed for on-device uses. SuperFly is 94 million parameters, which Orús likens to the size of a fly's brain. “This is like having a fly, but a little bit more clever,” he said.

SuperFly is designed to be trained on very restricted data, like a device's operations. Multiverse envisions it embedded into home appliances, allowing users to operate them with voice commands like “start quick wash” for a washing machine. Or users can ask troubleshooting questions. With a little processing power (like an Arduino), the model can handle a voice interface, as the company showed in a live demo to TechCrunch.

The other model is named ChickBrain, and is larger at 3.2 billion parameters, but is also far more capable and has reasoning capabilities. It's a compressed version of Meta's Llama 3.1 8B model, Multiverse says. Yet it's small enough to run on a MacBook, no internet connection required.

More importantly, Orús said that ChickBrain actually slightly outperforms the original in several standard benchmarks, including the language-skill benchmark MMLU-Pro, math skills benchmarks Math 500 and GSM8K, and the general knowledge benchmark GPQA Diamond.

Here are the results of Multiverse's internal tests of ChickBrain on the benchmarks. The company didn't offer benchmark results for SuperFly but Multiverse also isn't targeting SuperFly at use cases that require reasoning. 

It's important to note that Multiverse isn't claiming that its Model Zoo will beat the largest state-of-the-art models on such benchmarks. Zoo performances might not even land on the leaderboards. The point is that its tech can shrink model size without a performance hit, the company says. 

Orús says the company is already in talks with all the leading device and appliance makers. “We are talking with Apple. We are talking with Samsung, also with Sony and with HP, obviously. HP came as an investor in the last round,” he said. The round was led by well-known European VC firm Bullhound Capital, with participation from a lot of others, including HP Tech Ventures and Toshiba.

The startup also offers compression tech for other forms of machine learning, like image recognition, and in six years has obtained clients like BASF, Ally, Moody's, Bosch, and others.

In addition to selling its models directly to major device manufacturers, Multiverse offers its compressed models via an API hosted on AWS that any developer can use, often at lower token fees than competitors.

Ford announced plans for a $30,000 electric pickup and a new manufacturing process to cut costs across EV models.

On Monday, Ford announced plans for an affordable electric truck with a 2027 delivery date and an expected price tag of about $30,000, thanks in part to a new manufacturing process that it says will help cut costs.

This could be the shot in the arm that the slowing US EV market needs. Sales are slowing, and Ford in particular has struggled recently—the automaker has lost $12 billion over the last two and a half years on its EV division. And the adoption barriers continue to mount, with the Trump administration cutting tax credits as well as rules designed to push automakers toward zero-emissions vehicles. And that's not to mention tariffs.

But if anything can get Americans excited, it's a truck, especially an affordable one. (There was a ton of buzz over the announcement of a bare-bones truck from Bezos-backed Slate Auto earlier this year, for example.) The big question is whether the company can deliver in this environment.

One key thing to note here: This is not the first time that there's been a big splashy truck announcement from Ford that was supposed to change everything. The F-150 Lightning was hailed as a turning point for vehicle electrification, a signal that decarbonization had entered a new era. We cited the truck when we put “The Inevitable EV” on our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2023. 

Things haven't quite turned out that way. One problem is that the Lightning was supposed to be relatively affordable, with a price tag of about $40,000 when it was first announced in 2021. The starting price inflated to $52,000 when it actually went on sale in 2022.

The truck was initially popular and became quite hard to find at dealerships. But prices climbed and interest leveled off. The base model hit nearly $60,000 by 2023. For the past few years, Ford has cut Lightning production several times and laid off employees who assembled the trucks.

Now, though, Ford is once again promising an affordable truck, and it's supposed to be even cheaper this time. To help cut costs, the company says it's simplifying, creating one universal platform for a new set of EVs. Using a common structure and set of components will help produce not only a midsize truck but also other trucks, vans, and SUVs. There are also planned changes to the manufacturing process (rather than one assembly line, multiple lines will join together to form what they're calling an assembly tree). 

The country is installing solar, building EVs, and investing across energy at a rapid clip.

Another supporting factor for cost savings is the battery. The company plans to use lithium-iron phosphate (or LFP) cells—a type of lithium-ion battery that doesn't contain nickel or cobalt. Leaving out those relatively pricey metals means lower costs.

Side note here: That battery could be surprisingly small. In a media briefing, a Ford official reportedly said that the truck's battery would be 15% smaller than the one in the Atto crossover from the Chinese automaker BYD. Since that model has a roughly 60-kilowatt-hour pack, that could put this new battery at 51 kilowatt-hours. That's only half the capacity of the Ford Lightning's battery and similar to the smallest pack offered in a Tesla Model 3 today. (This could mean the truck has a relatively limited range, though the company hasn't shared any details on that front yet.) 

A string of big promises isn't too unusual for a big company announcement. What was unusual was the tone from officials during the event on Monday.

As Andrew Hawkins pointed out in The Verge this week, “Ford seems to realize its timing is unfortunate.” During the announcement, executives emphasized that this was a bet, one that might not work out.

CEO Jim Farley put it bluntly: “The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions, and they fizzled out with idle plants, laid-off workers, and red ink.” Woof.

From where I'm standing, it's hard to be optimistic that this announcement will turn out differently from all those failed ones, given where the US EV market is right now.   

In a new report published in June, the energy consultancy BNEF slashed its predictions for future EV uptake. Last year, the organization predicted that 48% of new vehicles sold in the US in 2030 would be electric. In this year's edition, that number got bumped down to just 27%.

To be clear: BNEF and other organizations are still expecting more EVs on the roads in the future than today, since the vehicles make up less than 10% of new sales in the US. But expectations are way down, in part because of a broad cut in public support for EVs. 

The tax credits that gave drivers up to $7,500 off the purchase of a new EV end in just over a month. Tariffs are going to push costs up even for domestic automakers like Ford, which still rely on imported steel and aluminum.

A revamped manufacturing process and a cheaper, desirable vehicle could be exactly the sort of move that automakers need to make for the US EV market. But I'm skeptical that this truck will be able to turn it all around.

What are those unexplained objects zipping around in the sky? They could be aliens; they could be secret government aircraft; they might even be Superman. Or, if you believe the latest MAGA politician to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're beings from another dimension.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, has held hearings on Capitol Hill to investigate UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena, and the congresswoman told Rogan on Wednesday's episode that she's seen evidence they could be “interdimensional beings.”

“Based on our interviews, and this has been something that you can go back and watch with the congressional hearings, but I was actually able to ask some of the witnesses, ‘What are these things?'” Luna told Rogan. “And they keep saying interdimensional and then when you talk about the interdimensional aspect of ‘are these things pre-existing maybe outside of what we currently know as our own dimension?'…”

Rogan was obviously curious and asked Luna to elaborate. The congresswoman, who earlier this year introduced legislation to put Trump's face on Mount Rushmore, then tried to explain and seemed to suggest that these “interdimensional beings” were found in the Bible. Or at least they would've been, if the Bible hadn't been censored.

Rep. Luna: Well, they call them interdimensional beings. I think that they can actually operate through the time-spaces that we currently have. And that's not something that I came up with on my own. That's based on stuff that we've seen, that's based on information that we've been told. And then also too, I think that there's this historical aspect of, you know, this gets into the deeper theories and concepts of religion and I think the history that we currently know. And that kind of spins off into another topic of, you know, you have the modern day Bible, you have this aspect of books of the Bible that have been removed that explain and kind of touch on these topics. And I think that we're in a time and age where you have such a vast amount of information that we have access to via social media, via your cell phone, via the internet. And so it's really changing the way that we understand, you know, the origins of life and the spiritual reality that we know.

Luna had a knack for rambling without saying much or providing evidence. So Rogan pressed her on what evidence there might be to prove that UAPs are actually beings from another dimension. She kept giving vague answers, but insisted that she's seen evidence. Sadly, she just can't tell you what it is.

Rep. Luna: Yeah, so look, have I seen a portal open? No. Have I seen a spaceship? Personally no. Have I seen evidence of this? Yes. Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? Yes. Is there historical significance to this? Yes. multiple events that go back to, I would argue, maybe even before the time of Christ that have documented this in text? Yes.

Luna acknowledged throughout the interview that the U.S. government may have advanced technology that could explain some of the UAP sightings, but she kept coming back to this idea that there was something supernatural about it all. And she floated conspiracy theories about how these kinds of beings had been censored in the editing of the Bible, specifically invoking the idea that the Book of Enoch had not been included as part of the Bible for shadowy reasons.

Luna, who said she's read the Book of Enoch “multiple times,” insisted that she wasn't saying these mysterious beings were angels, but noted there were “other creations that God made,” according to her understanding of Christianity.

Luna said she's seen classified photos in a SCIF that she can't talk about, something that clearly frustrated Rogan. “I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind,” Luna said.

The congresswoman made other wild claims during the interview about the CIA discovering the Ark of the Covenant in the 1980s and strongly suggesting that remote viewing is a reality. She also mentioned that some autistic people had telepathic abilities, a reference to a popular podcast called the Telepathy Tapes. And everything she mentioned was cloaked in this conspiratorial thinking as she insisted that powerful people were hiding the truth from the American people.

“It seems crazy that people have access to information that shows that there's something outside of us that is more intelligent, at least more capable than we are. And they hide it from everybody else,” Rogan said.

Crazy indeed, Mr. Rogan. Crazy indeed. Did you guys hear about those Epstein files?

Researchers have found plastic in almost every corner of the human body, from our brains and poop to blood and testicles (at least it's not making our stomachs crunch yet). Is this plastic contamination bad for us?

While the answer to that question might seem like a no-brainer—and certainly no one is crazy enough to theorize that microplastics in breast milk are a good thing—there haven't been any human trials to confirm that microplastics are detrimental to human health. Some research has simply linked microplastics to health complications, which isn't nearly definitive enough.

So what are we waiting for? To be clear, it's not simply a matter of getting it done. To understand how or if micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are toxic for human health, we first need to quantify and analyze their concentration and composition in samples from living organisms. Spoiler alert—there is no guidebook on how to do this. After surveying the existing scientific literature on the matter, however, a team of researchers has outlined some best practices that could finally get us started in the right direction.

“Most detection techniques are better suited for microplastic and nanoplastic (MNP) identification in ideal media (such as water) and face limitations when analysing biological samples,” the researchers wrote in a study published last month in the journal Nature Reviews Bioengineering.

Part of the problem is that different biological samples have different compositions. Apples, for example, are fibrous, while our bodies also have fats and proteins, and trees and plants have lignin, Baoshan Xing, an environmental and soil chemistry professor at UMass Amherst and lead author of the study, said in a university statement.

“Strategies for digestion [preparation], separation, enrichment and detection of MNPs need to be optimized depending on the category of organism under investigation,” the researchers explained in the study. Currently, there is no standard approach for this, an unfortunate fact that Xing described as a “headache” in the statement.

You Don't Want to Know Where Scientists Just Found 27 Million Tons of Plastic

Another complication is that most studies in this context presume MNPs to be spherical-shaped. That might not be the case, which carries important implications, given that particle shape can impact how MNPs travel through a system. Plus, toxic substances might collect in tiny niches or cavities. As such, the team argues that researchers need protocols for analyzing the polymer types and shapes, as well as MNPs' surface characteristics.

If that sounds like a whole lot of features to analyze, you're not wrong. Luckily, “machine learning algorithms can greatly reduce the labour time and cost of MNP identification and characterization,” the researchers pointed out in the study.

“The day is not far off when we'll be able to accurately detect, characterize and quantify MNPs in biological samples,” Xing concluded in the statement.

In the meantime, though, stop chewing gum. Just in case.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major source of cancer that's now almost entirely preventable through vaccination. But sobering research out today shows that Americans are largely in the dark about HPV and its many health risks, much less the HPV vaccine.

Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina conducted the study, which examined nationally representative survey data. A third of Americans don't know that the virus exists, they found, while most who do know are still unaware it can cause more than one type of cancer besides cervical cancer. People in certain regions of the country, particularly Midwest and Southern states, were even less aware of HPV, which likely helps explain why vaccination rates are lagging in these areas, the researchers say.

“Some of these states have the lowest HPV vaccine coverage in the nation, which could be a reason why we are observing these differences,” lead study author Ashvita Garg, a public health researcher at MUSC, told Gizmodo.

There are over 200 different types of HPV, which is spread through skin contact (including sexual contact), and HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Some types are low-risk, only causing unseemly but harmless warts along our skin or genitals. Other high-risk types can linger in the body and cause damaging changes to normal cells that raise their risk of becoming cancerous.

HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer, accounting for nearly all cases. But high-risk HPV infections are also primarily responsible for several other kinds of cancer, including vaginal and vulvar cancers in women, penile cancer in men, and oral cancer in both men and women. In fact, HPV-related oral cancer is more common in men than it is in women. All told, about 40,000 HPV-caused cancers occur annually in the U.S.

Today's vaccines can prevent up to nine different high-risk types of HPV, but the vaccination rate remains relatively low in many parts of the world, the U.S. included. The researchers sought to better understand just how aware people are about the virus and the value of vaccination.

The researchers studied data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a project run by the National Cancer Institute that regularly measures Americans' knowledge of health and cancer-related information. Their sample ultimately included almost 23,000 responses collected between 2017 and 2022.

Based on the survey data, around 34% of Americans nationally were ignorant about the existence of HPV, and 37% were ignorant about the HPV vaccine. Of those who did know about the virus, 71% didn't know that it can cause oral cancer, and 28% didn't know it caused cervical cancer. Ignorance of HPV and the vaccine was especially high (over 40%) in seven states, including Kansas, Nebraska, and Illinois in the Midwest, as well as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama in the South. These same states have some of the lowest HPV vaccination rates in the country, and about 62% of all HPV-related cancers occur in the Southern and Midwestern U.S., the authors note.

“Additionally, the gap between awareness that HPV causes oral cancer was notably larger compared to the awareness that HPV causes cervical cancer, highlighting the undervaluation of the importance of HPV vaccination in males,” Garg said. The team's findings were published Thursday in JAMA Oncology.

Some countries have already started to effectively eliminate cervical and other HPV-related cancers through widespread HPV vaccination, but the U.S. is still lagging well behind. Overall, only around 57% of American teenagers in 2023 received the HPV vaccine as recommended, well below the 80% target goal that health officials are hoping to reach by 2030. The researchers say that much more effort is needed to improve people's knowledge of HPV and its dangers.

“Improving HPV awareness would require a multifaceted approach, such as public education campaigns, improving patient-provider communication, and community and school-based outreach programs,” Garg said.

Unfortunately, the federal government may not be so interested in HPV prevention these days. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current health secretary, has regularly spread misinformation about the HPV vaccine and even referred to Merck's HPV shot, Gardasil, as the “most dangerous vaccine ever invented.”

All that said, Garg and her team at MUSC are still dedicated to improving HPV vaccine coverage in their neck of the woods.

“Beyond examining the HPV-related cancer burden and mortality, we are also investigating the uptake and delivery of HPV prevention modalities and understanding prevention behaviors across the US,” she said. “MUSC is also actively involved in public health outreach, particularly in South Carolina, where initiatives like the HPV Vaccination Van are helping to improve education and access to HPV vaccination.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Marvel's Best Movie of the Year is Coming to Streaming Soon","https://gizmodo.com/marvel-thunderbolts-streaming-release-date-disney-plus-2000643040","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:00:38 GMT","

Whether you call them Thunderbolts or New Avengers, you can also call it home for dinner because one of the best, if not the best, Marvel movies of the year is headed to Disney+ later this month.

Earlier today, Marvel announced Thunderbolts will make its way to the streaming platform on August 27. As noted in Marvel's press release hyping its streaming debut, its pilgrimage to the premiere destination for all things MCU comes after the film built up a surprising amount of momentum in its theatrical release, putting to rest all talk of superhero fatigue that has plagued the genre. Not only did the film round out with an 88 percent Certified Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score, but it also restored the feeling that Marvel was finally back in its groove in the messy wake of Captain America: Brave New World‘s release in February. A feat all the more daunting to clear, given the more grounded superhero film had the pressure of releasing before The Fantastic Four: First Steps and DC Studios' Superman, movies billed to be even bigger blockbusters that'd steal the limelight this summer.

The film, which assembles characters from fringe Marvel projects like Black Widow, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and The Falcon and Winter Soldier, sees Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and John Walker (Wyatt Russell) go from being collateral damage to humanity's last line of defense with the arrival of Sentry/the Void, AKA Bob (Lewis Pullman). In contrast to other films, which seem unable to tell a story without veering into catastrophic skybeams, Thunderbolts' tale looks inward with an interpersonal story about its heroes' struggle with their own mental health and imposter syndrome as they dare to punch above their weight and be genuine heroes.

In io9's review, we said the Jake Schreier-directed film is Marvel back to doing what it does best, writing, “When Marvel brings characters from multiple projects together on the big screen, it has an earned reputation and expectation to deliver massive spectacle. Thunderbolts isn't that. It's a film that has action, excitement, and one of the best end credit scenes in recent years, all while never losing its smaller, indie soul. The characters, like the movie, are underdogs. But one that, a few tiny blips aside, ends up a winner.”

Thunderbolts releases on Disney+ on August 27.

Arguably, the entire selling point of Zelle as a platform is that it is owned by big banks that ostensibly are invested in making sure that your money is safe. Turns out security was not the priority that you might imagine, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a lawsuit against the money transfer, the top prosecutor for New York State claims that customers have lost more than $1 billion to fraud on Zelle, which was enabled by a lack of sufficient protections.

In the suit, James alleges that Zelle has been insecure since it first launched in 2017, and its parent company, Early Warning Services (which is owned by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and other major financial institutions), has mostly ignored the problem. “EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks,” the AG's office said in a statement.

As evidence of this point, James points out that Zelle didn't include a sufficient verification process to make users confirm their identity, making it easy for scammers to spoof others. Because transactions on Zelle can't be reversed, there is shockingly little friction between transactions to keep people from falling for impostors. The issue was so bad that Congress pressured Zelle into refunding victims of impostor scams back in 2023 after learning that users of the app had lost $440 million to such fraud that year. Not great for a platform that actively advertised itself as “safe.”

Another beef James has with Zelle: It allegedly didn't respond to consumer complaints about fraud. “Even when EWS did receive reports of fraud, it failed to promptly remove the fraudsters from the Zelle network or require banks to reimburse consumers for certain scams,” James alleged, stating that when the app launched, the parent company didn't even require banks to report scams, which theoretically could have prevented network-wide abuse.

New York's lawsuit picks up where the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau left off. The agency had announced it was suing JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo in December 2024, alleging similar charges of fraud and failure to protect users. That case was dropped almost immediately by the Trump administration, which proceeded to fire the head of the bureau and attempted to shutter it entirely. Trump probably can't shut down the state of New York, so this case should likely continue.

The Onion could finally get its hands on Alex Jones' far-right media empire Infowars.

On Wednesday, a Texas state judge ordered Infowars' parent company's, Free Speech System, assets be handed over to a court-appointed receiver, who will oversee their sale. The proceeds will be used to pay Jones' massive debt to the families of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

The families won a $1.3 billion defamation case in 2022 against Jones, who spent years peddling false claims that the massacre was staged and that the grieving parents were crisis actors. His followers harassed the families for years.

Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted the receiver broad authority over Free Speech Systems' assets including the power to change locks on their properties, access storage units and safe-deposit boxes, and take control of their websites.

“Today's order brings us a critically important step closer to achieving the goal that the Connecticut families have spent years fighting for: holding Alex Jones accountable for years of harm,” said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the Connecticut families, in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “The receiver is now authorized to liquidate his business assets, and we look forward to the corrupt media empire that Jones built finally being dismantled.”

Mark Bankston, an attorney for the families based in Texas, told NPR, “The families are relieved that the court has placed Infowars' parent company into receivership, a step that will finally hold Alex Jones accountable for his monstrously cruel harassment.'”

Infowars did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

Last December, a federal bankruptcy court judge in Texas blocked the proposed sale of Infowars to The Onion. He ruled that the bankruptcy auction process was flawed and that the satirical media company's bid was too low.

The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, had offered $1.75 million in cash for the site, a bid supported by the families of the Sandy Hook victims. Bidding against them was First United American Companies, a group affiliated with Jones that helps manage his dietary supplements business, which submitted a $3.5 million offer.

The Onion's original plan was to relaunch Infowars this year as a parody of itself.

“The Onion's goal with the acquisition is to end Infowars' relentless stream of disinformation used to sell supplements and replace it with The Onion's own relentless stream of humor for good,” the company said in a press release before the sale was blocked.

With the state court's latest ruling, The Onion's chance to snatch up Infowars is back on the table. The company didn't immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

An early matchmaking fix involves updating to the most recent client

EA has confirmed that the Battlefield 6 open beta, which launched for its second weekend on Thursday, is missing DLSS and DLAA, and is also throwing up matchmaking issues for players.

Battlefield 6's second open beta weekend kicked off on August 14, promising all of the maps from weekend one, plus the new Empire State map. Players can also expect all the weekend one modes as well as Rush, Squad Deathmatch, and closed weapon versions of Conquest and Breakthrough.

However, early players anxious to get in on the fun have been hit with a couple of technical issues, notably, DLSS is missing on PC.

DLSS is missing from the Battlefield 6 client, it was there last week. A friend of mine just installed this week and mentioned DLSS was not an option so I fired the game up to check and DLSS was there but after restarting the game it was gone. @Battlefield @DRUNKKZ3 @Lex_mateAugust 14, 2025

""The team have identified the root cause of this issue and is working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta,"" Battlefield Comms stated on X, ""We anticipate this to be resolved later today (Thursday), and will update accordingly.""

EA says it is also battling some matchmaking problems with the beta: ""The team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues for some of our players when attempting to matchmake on playlists,"" the same account said. In the first suggested fix, EA says users should ensure they have the most recent client update, and also suggest using the 'Repair' functionality in the EA app, which can be found via the 3-dot menu button.

Matchmaking Update 01 --If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update.EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair.The team continues to assess this. https://t.co/dy6jN88lMiAugust 14, 2025

So if you're trying to enjoy the Battlefield 6 open beta and are experiencing either of these issues, you're not alone. We'll continue to keep this post updated with any further developments, especially fixes for the problem. Users have also reported other issues, including audio problems. If you've had any of these problems or any quirks not reported here, feel free to let us know in the comments or on social media.

Battlefield 6 is set for official launch on October 10, and represents something of a make-or-break title for the storied franchise. Battlefield boasts iconic titles like Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, but its most recent installment, Battlefield 2042, received an extremely poor reception.

With a successful beta weekend earlier this month and some strong PR work involving numerous content creators, figures reported claim that on PC alone, the upcoming release has reportedly garnered over 600,000 pre-orders and more than 2.7 million wishlists. While those numbers are unconfirmed, what is confirmed is the fact that the open beta clocked over 521,000 concurrent players at its peak, eclipsing Call of Duty before it even launches.

Nvidia wants no part in the story.

Update Aug 14 6:30 am ET: The opening of this story has been updated following a statement from Nvidia in response to accusations of chip tracking levelled at the Federal government. 

Nvidia has issued a flat denial of the existence of tracking chips in its hardware, following reports that the Federal Government allegedly placed tracking devices in shipments of AI server tech thought to be at risk of diversion to China. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that anonymous sources claim U.S. authorities are employing this tactic as part of their investigation into the alleged smuggling of banned AI chips into China. In a statement to Tom's Hardware, an Nvidia spokesperson simply stated, ""We don't install secret tracking devices in our products."" While the story in question lays the tracking at the feet of Washington, rather than any companies whose products are involved, Nvidia's staunch denail reflects a desire to distance itself from reports as it prepares to resume selling H20 chips in China.

According to the report, the alleged tracking doesn't impact all shipments, but only ""targeted"" shipments believed to be at a high risk of being diverted to China. Despite the affordability and ubiquity of trackers, it will be prohibitively expensive to place several in all servers that are going through customs. It's more likely that the authorities are allegedly doing this to aid in a specific investigation. Although placing a tracker on a package typically requires a court order, Reuters notes that export enforcement agents may sometimes do so with administrative approval only.

It's unclear when this alleged practice started for semiconductors, but those involved in the AI chip supply chain seem aware of these actions. These trackers are reportedly often added to the shipping containers, the packaging of individual servers, or even within the server racks themselves. The report cites individuals who claim that they had seen images and videos of trackers being removed from Dell and Super Micro servers, some of them as large as smartphones.

Smugglers also apparently know this, with court documents in a recent case of smuggling millions of dollars' worth of chips to China revealing that a suspect instructed their co-conspirators to “pay attention to see if there is a tracker on it.”

The U.S. Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, and the FBI didn't issue a statement when asked by Reuters, although the sources confirm that these agencies are typically involved in these situations.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently denied that the company's most advanced AI chips are being diverted to China. However, multiple outlets confirm that there's a strong black market for these cutting-edge silicon, with a reported billion dollars' worth of Nvidia products being openly traded into the East Asian country in just the last quarter.

Washington is trying to hamper China's progress in AI, especially as it's considered a ‘dual-use technology' that is applicable in both civilian and military purposes. Because of this, the White House — across multiple administrations — has applied export controls on state-of-the-art semiconductors, including the most powerful AI chips from Nvidia and AMD. However, Huang has said that the U.S. export control was a failure, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary also saying that holding back China's chipmaking progress is a fool's errand.

Despite that, the Trump administration has doubled down on its efforts to control the flow of AI chips into China, even going as far as banning both the Nvidia H20 and the AMD MI308 in April 2025 — AI chips that have been especially designed to comply with the initial set of export controls released by the Federal government.

The U.S. has since backed down on this particular export control and has reopened the taps for these AI chips; the newer, more powerful variants of these semiconductors still aren't allowed to be shipped to China. In the most recent twist in the saga, AMD and Nvidia have struck a deal to share 15% of related sales revenue with the government in exchange for export licenses for its H20 and MI308, an unprecedented arrangement.

The U.S. has been clamping down on the alleged smuggling of high-end semiconductors. American allies such as Singapore are taking action to stop the flow of these AI chips through their borders. Furthermore, a bill has been filed in Congress to force American AI chip makers to add geo-tracking technology into their products. Nvidia is against this, though, saying that these ‘permanent flaws' would make their devices vulnerable to hackers. These developments have nonetheless led the Chinese government to question the integrity of the company's chips and have even discouraged their use.

Native Xbox games for Arm-based Windows 11 PCs is finally here


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has announced an update for its Xbox app for Arm-based Windows 11 devices, allowing users to download and play games natively. Arm users, including those on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X-powered machines like the Surface Laptop 7, were previously limited to streaming titles through Xbox Cloud Gaming. The latest preview update will now allow select compatible games from the Xbox app to be installed and played locally on these devices.

To access the new functionality, users must be part of both the Windows Insider and Xbox Insider programs. Enrolled Arm-based Windows 11 PCs in the PC Gaming Preview will receive the updated Xbox PC app (version 2508.1001.27.0 or higher) via the Xbox Insider Hub. Those who are not enrolled can join by downloading the Xbox Insider Hub from the Microsoft Store. Simply sign in with your Microsoft account, navigate to the “PC Gaming” option under “Previews,” and select “Join.”

Additionally, Microsoft mentioned in its blog post that it is working on new features to ensure game compatibility on Arm-based Windows PCs and expand the number of playable titles in the coming months. This has been one of the biggest reasons why gaming on Windows PCs with Arm processors has long been a major headache. Since a majority of PC games are designed for x86 chips from Intel or AMD, Arm devices rely on emulation. This usually leads to a drop in performance and sometimes restricts games from launching at all, especially those with strict anti-cheat mechanisms.

On top of that, Arm-based SoCs (System on Chip) typically rely on integrated GPUs, which aren't exactly performance powerhouses. Yes, Apple has shown promising improvements in gaming on its latest M4 chips, but they're still a long way from matching the capabilities of discrete GPUs or even the latest integrated graphics solutions from AMD and Intel.

Interestingly, Microsoft's latest push to improve native gaming on Arm could also be an indication of bigger hardware plans in the future. We all know Nvidia is co-developing an Arm-based SoC for Windows PCs with MediaTek, which many expected to debut at Computex 2025 before its reported delay to late 2026. Last month, an alleged engineering sample of the N1X Arm-based SoC was spotted on Geekbench, suggesting a 20-core CPU and a Blackwell GPU with 48 streaming multiprocessors and 6,144 CUDA cores, which matches the desktop RTX 5070.

If Microsoft is indeed laying the groundwork for improved game compatibility on Arm, it could position Windows to fully support such upcoming hardware from Nvidia, as well as systems from OEMs like Asus, Dell, and Lenovo that are reportedly developing devices around the new chip.

Is it Windows or Linux?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The hunt for Linux-based alternatives is ongoing, and I've tried quite a few. One of my latest tests involves Linuxfx Winux (abbreviated to Linuxfx for brevity), which is based on the latest Ubuntu LTS. Linuxfx closely resembles the Windows 11 user interface, and for good reason; this is a distro for those who want the Windows experience as they move from Windows 10 or 11 to the world of Linux.

As many of us already know, Windows 10 will go End-of-Life on October 14, 2025, and yes, you can purchase a support package to keep your Windows 10 install going. But if you don't pony up the cash, then you don't get the support. Updates will end, and your once precious OS will soon fall foul of nefarious users. So your options are to pay up, switch to Windows 11, or perhaps give Linux a try. After all, many of us spend 90% of our working day in a browser, so the underlying OS doesn't really matter.

I took the latest version of Linuxfx (11.25.07.1 LTS) for a spin on both real and virtual hardware, and here is what I experienced.



The core OS is based on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, released in 2024. This release of Ubuntu has Long Term Support (LTS) until April 2029 and legacy support until 2036. It comes with Linux Kernel 6.14 and KDE Plasma 5.27, but you won't see much of it, as the Windows 11 theme is quite convincing.



Linuxfx is aimed squarely at those who want to move from Windows to Linux, but they're worried about the massive change that comes with swapping operating systems. With Linuxfx, there isn't a need to “relearn” how to use an operating system. Linuxfx looks and behaves like Windows.

When I moved from Windows to Linux (back in the late 90s/ early 2000s), the change was chasmic. The user interface was a little different, and I was used to downloading .exe files, not installing software from a central repository. I was also confused about what KDE and GNOME meant. It took a while, but I got there. It seems that over the years, other people have hit these challenges, and their experiences have become lessons that have been learned and applied to modern distributions.

The other potential users for Linuxfx are those who just want a lightweight Linux distribution for their older hardware. As someone who still cherishes his Lenovo X220, a lightweight Linux distro is always a welcome sight. The hardware requirements are low. All you really need is a dual-core CPU, a minimum of 2GB RAM, and 20GB of storage. The ISO image can be used on real hardware and in a virtual machine. I tried both. My virtual machine was configured via VirtualBox, and I gave it 8GB of RAM. It worked well, but it felt better on real hardware.

I'm going to use the exact same criteria as my alternative Linux for Windows users live blog.

The criteria being

The USB flash drive, easily created in Rufus, booted my Lenovo X390 with 8GB of LPDDR4 and a Core i5 CPU. I started testing my hardware using the Live USB before committing to an install. Everything worked, so I started the installation.

The installation process was extremely simple, probably one of the simplest installs that I have ever done. Everything flowed; nothing tripped me up. In fact, the installation process reminded me of Corel Linux, albeit with a much more modern interface.

A quick reboot and I was in Windows 11, I mean Linuxfx. It even has the Windows 11 splash screen when the system is booting!



Because it is based on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, Linuxfx has excellent hardware support. Everything just worked. Bluetooth file transfers, webcam, sound, Wi-Fi all just worked with no hassle.



Yes, it does look just like Windows. I shared a screenshot with my colleagues in our team's Slack channel, and many said that it looks just like Windows 11. You could drop this into an office, coffee shop, or school, and everyone would think you were using Windows 11. The menu, notifications, weather details, and even the login screen are identical to Windows 11. Seriously, they are. Even the look and feel of the main menu will make diehard Windows fans happy.



Linuxfx even displays the UAC dialog when we attempt to perform actions that only an administrator or someone with that level of access should be able to do.



If you miss the Windows 10 user interface, Linuxfx has the option to switch via the Customization menu. For Windows 10 and 11, we have light, dark, and twilight themes. But it is the Redsand themes that offer a familiar Windows feel, but with a little more color and some rather lovely icons.



To the bottom left, just next to the weather app, are widgets. These are KDE mini-apps that reside on your desktop and provide useful features such as clocks, disk status, battery status, and many other handy tools. I'm not a huge fan of them, but I have used them in the past, and there is a selection that I would consider to be useful.

The most useful widget for me is the System Monitor Sensor widget. Here, I can configure the widget to display the current CPU temperature, speed, and other relevant information. This is handy for benchmarking and for keeping an eye on your system as a whole.

While we have a Windows 11 / 10 doppelgänger, underneath it all, there is a competent Ubuntu Linux distribution using the well-established KDE desktop environment.



Not only do we get a Linux distro pretending to be Windows, but we also get an Android virtual machine, which we can use with Android apps. I like the Powertools Android integration addition, but it was rather flaky on my test system. Even opening Google Chrome took an age, and then it crashed.

Rather than use Waydroid (like Bazzite and AnduinOS), Linuxfx uses QEMU to run an emulated system on your host machine. QEMU is a great choice, but the steps to get things working can be a bit confusing. When you get things working, Android is an interesting addition, but I'm still not sure how others will use it.



In the app menu, there are entries for Microsoft Office 365. Clicking on any of these, I chose Excel, will open the Microsoft Edge browser to the chosen application. A pretty neat solution for those tied to Microsoft Office. If you prefer LibreOffice, fear not, as the LibreOffice suite is also included.

Software can be installed via the Discover software center, similar to the Microsoft Store, but the apps are more Linux-centric. The Discover software center is very easy to use, and newcomers will have no trouble installing applications. Software can also be installed via Flatpak or Ubuntu's Snap software sources. I installed my test applications, GIMP, Inkscape, Google Chrome, and Slack, all without needing the terminal.If you really want or need to install a Windows application, then you can use exe and msi files with Linuxfx, but don't expect stellar performance. I installed GIMP using the Windows installer, but the app never opened. No errors occurred; it just launched the splash screen, checked all its requirements, but never opened. I'd consider using exe and msi files as a last resort. If the application that you need to install doesn't have a Linux version, then you have no choice. But your mileage may vary.

If you want to use AI, then fear not, as Microsoft Copilot is also present. The icon is in the bottom right corner of the screen, and clicking on it will open a browser window to the Copilot page. From there, we can type or ask a question to Microsoft's AI. It worked as expected, but AI is still not for me.



Linux gaming has come on leaps and bounds thanks to the Wine and Proton communities, along with a large amount of support from Valve's Steam Deck. There are now many games that can run natively on Linux, but for those that can't the aforementioned Wine and Proton will do all the heavy lifting.

Installed as standard on Linuxfx, there is Steam and Heroic Game Launcher, which are the same launchers as I used in my recent Bazzite Linux gaming PC project. Set up your Steam, Epic, GoG, and Amazon gaming accounts, and then select a game. The launcher will do the work and in a short while you will have your game ready to play.

I wasn't able to fully test a game on this test hardware, it is far too old (six years) to play many games from my Steam library. I know this because I tried to play Hades on the same laptop using AnduinOS, and the results were awful. If you've got a gaming rig, then you will have the spec to game. That said, while Linuxfx does offer the tools with which to play your game, personally I would plump for Bazzite as it has a much better selection of gamer-centric features. Linuxfx is more of a desktop OS for getting work done than a gaming OS.

I'm using the free version of Linuxfx, but for a $35 donation there is a pro version which offers a few more features.

I didn't appreciate the pop-up notification or the full-screen browser window that asked me to purchase a serial key. Ok, this is a lifetime key, so $35 isn't a bad price, but the confusion between purchase and donation leaves a sour taste.

In all honesty, the free version is more than enough for most users. It fulfilled every test that I threw at it, and never left me wanting to spend money. Unless you really need the extra features or want to donate to the project, keep that $35 in your wallet.

Linuxfx isn't alone in trying to put users at ease. I've recently tried out Bazzite, ZorinOS, and AnduinOS, all of which offer an easier introduction to Linux. From a purely aesthetic point of view, Linuxfx wins. For the best of both worlds, AnduinOS would be a good choice. If you crave speed and performance, with a little Windows familiarity, go for ZorinOS.



Linuxfx looks just like Windows, and for many, this will be their entry into the world of Linux. It is simple to install, and mimicking the Windows workflow means that users will not get confused or lost as they learn. Underneath it all, there's a solid Ubuntu base, and that means access to a myriad of apps and support. Linux purists may not like the merging of Windows with Linux, but we all have to start somewhere. If Linuxfx helps users make the switch, I am all for it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Could lithium hold the key to treating Alzheimer's disease?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/alzheimers-is-linked-to-low-brain-lithium-levels-study-shows","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT","

Lithium is a mineral that can be found in nature. Very small amounts of lithium can also be found in the body by ingesting certain foods or drinking water with a high mineral content. 

Because lithium is a mood stabilizer, it is sometimes used as a medication to treat mental health conditions like mania, bipolar disorder, and depression. 

Past research has also shown that lithium seems to have a protective effect on the brain, potentially helping to defend against mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia. 

Now, a new study published in the journal Nature provides additional evidence of lithium's potential neuroprotective effect.

The study has shown, for the first time, that lithium occurs naturally in the brain and plays a major role in normal brain function.

Scientists also discovered that a loss of lithium in the brain may be an early warning sign for Alzheimer's disease because it binds to amyloid-beta plaques, currently considered one of the hallmarks of the condition.

For this study, researchers used a combination of testing postmortem brain tissue and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 

Using brain tissue samples from deceased participants with a mix of healthy cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and advanced Alzheimer's disease, scientists discovered that of the 27 different trace metals in the brain, lithium was the only one that had significantly different levels across the groups. 

Researchers found that changes to lithium amounts in the brain started at the earliest stages of memory loss, and levels of the mineral were very low in samples from participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. 

Next, the research team used a mouse model to further confirm their hypothesis. When healthy mice were fed a lithium-reduced diet, scientists found they aged more rapidly, and experienced brain inflammation and cognitive decline.

In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, scientists observed that lower lithium levels sped up the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and activated inflammatory cells called microglia in the brain. 

However, when mice were provided with a lithium compound called lithium orotate, Alzheimer's disease-related damage to the brain was reversed and memory function was restored. 

“The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,” Bruce Yankner, MD, PhD, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and senior author of this study, said in a press release.

“You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,” Yankner cautioned, though he emphasized that “so far the results are very encouraging.”

“My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients' lives,” the study author said.

Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center, told Medical News Today that this discovery is significant because it offers a new way of looking at Alzheimer's.

“For years, the fight against Alzheimer's has been dominated by a single-target approach, focusing almost exclusively on clearing amyloid plaques,” Parulekar, who was not involved in this study, explained.

“But as dementia specialists, we know this is a multifaceted disease that affects the entire ecosystem of the brain. This study suggests a depletion of a natural element, and how restoring that balance could potentially impact all the major hallmarks of the disease — the plaques, the tangles, and cognitive function itself,” she added.

Parulekar said that these findings could potentially lead to new ways to both treat and detect Alzheimer's disease, but in very different ways.

“Think of it like starting a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you start early, it can prevent heart disease. But even if you've already had a heart attack, starting that same healthy plan can still help you. It won't undo the past damage, but it will make your body stronger and help slow down future problems. Similarly, lithium seems to make the brain healthier and more resilient. So, it could be used as a treatment to protect the brain cells that are still healthy and slow down the progression of the disease in people who already have it.” 

– Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

MNT also spoke to Peter Gliebus, MD, a neurologist, and director of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this research.

Gliebus, who was not involved in the recent study, said his first reaction to its findings is one of cautious optimism.

“The study's findings indicate that lithium exhibits a substantial impact on brain health and may mitigate the early molecular alterations associated with Alzheimer's disease,” he said.

“The study underscores the potential of lithium replacement therapy as a preventive or therapeutic intervention. This discovery holds a promise as it presents novel avenues for addressing the disease at its earliest stages, potentially slowing or even halting its progression,” Gliebus explained.

“These findings have the potential to contribute to the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future,” he continued. The study shows lithium deficiency as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, potentially serving as a biomarker for early detection. Measuring lithium levels in the brain could enable the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing the disease.”

“Moreover, the therapeutic application of lithium orotate, which circumvents plaque sequestration, demonstrates promise in reversing or preventing pathological alterations in animal models,” Gliebus added. “If these findings are validated in human studies, lithium replacement therapy could emerge as a viable treatment option, particularly for individuals experiencing early cognitive decline or at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease.”

DISCLOSURES August 14, 2025  

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women due to anatomical and behavioral factors. Half of all women experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Approximately 25% of patients develop recurrent UTIs, defined as three episodes in the past 12 months or two episodes in the past 6 months, with at least one confirmed by urine culture.

At the 25th Annual Congress of the Argentine Society of Infectious Diseases (2025), Sandra Aronson, MD, general practitioner, geriatrician, and infectious disease specialist at Hospital J.A. Fernández and Hospital Italiano in Buenos Aires, Argentina, noted that 5% of recurrent UTIs occur within 2 weeks of the initial episodes. These are usually caused by microorganisms persisting in areas where antibiotics cannot reach or by inappropriate antibiotic use. The remaining 95% were reinfected with new strains.

Recent international guidelines recommend the initiation of nonantibiotic strategies to prevent recurrence, reserving antibiotics as a last resort. “We have nonantibiotic tools available, some with proven efficacy and others with great promise,” Aronson said.

Speaking with Medscape Spanish, Aronson acknowledged that promoting behavioral changes or nonantibiotic measures can be more challenging than prescribing medication. “Patients often value a prescription more than advice to drink more water,” she said.

“It's similar to respiratory infections. It is much easier to give antibiotics to a patient with a cold than to explain why they are not necessary. These conversations take longer. But those of us who genuinely believe antibiotic resistance is or will become a problem aim to reserve these drugs for when they are truly needed.”

Aronson presented nine nonantibiotic strategies for the initial management of recurrent UTIs. She stated that the supporting evidence is uneven but stronger than in the past, making clinicians more likely to recommend these measures.

Recommendations include drinking at least 1.5 L of water daily, emptying the bladder regularly, maintaining good hygiene, urinating after sexual intercourse, and avoiding spermicides, diaphragms, tampons, tight clothing, and douching.

In a 2017-2018 study of 140 women with recurrent UTIs who drank less than 1.5 L of water daily, those who increased their intake by 1.5 L for 1 year had a 50% reduction in new episodes (1.7 vs 3.2) and in antibiotic use (1.9 vs 3.6).

Vaginal estrogens increase glycogen levels in the vaginal mucosa, which promotes Lactobacillus colonization, lowers pH, and prevents the growth of local uropathogens. A meta-analysis of eight studies involving approximately 5000 women found that vaginal estrogen significantly reduced recurrent UTIs compared to placebo (risk ratio, 0.42). Adverse effects, including vaginal discomfort, irritation, and itching, were mild. No benefits were observed with the administration of oral estrogen.

A recent US study of 40 primary care physicians reported that 96% prescribed vaginal estrogens for recurrent UTIs, with 58% doing so frequently. Vaginal estrogen is the leading nonantibiotic treatment option in clinical practice.

Cranberries may acidify urine, and their proanthocyanidins can prevent Escherichia coli and other bacteria from adhering to uroepithelial cells, particularly in postmenopausal women. “Not all cranberry products contain the same amount of this compound,” Aronson noted.

A 2023 Cochrane review found that cranberries reduced the risk for recurrent UTIs by approximately 25% in certain groups, including women. The European Association of Urology recommends cranberries to prevent recurrent cystitis, citing a favorable benefit-harm profile despite limited evidence. The recommended intake is 200-300 mL of juice daily for 6 months.

Probiotics may restore normal vaginal microbiota, create an acidic pH, and prevent bacterial adhesions. Evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews is mixed; however, some studies have reported up to a 50% reduction in the number of UTI episodes. “Not all lactobacilli are the same,” Aronson emphasized. “Preparations should contain Lactobacillus crispatus and certain other strains.”

D-mannose is a natural sugar that blocks the attachment of type 1 bacterial fimbriae to the uroepithelium. A meta-analysis of 390 patients found that it was effective in preventing recurrent UTIs compared with placebo, with efficacy comparable to that of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin. Another systematic review reported improved quality of life, fewer recurrences, and longer infection-free periods. “Evidence is still limited, and more studies are needed, but side effects are few, none of which are serious,” Aronson said.

Methenamine hippurate or mandelate hydrolyzes formaldehyde and ammonia, creating an acidic bactericidal environment by denaturing bacterial proteins. 

A 2021 meta-analysis suggested a “trend toward benefit” in preventing recurrent cystitis, although no significant differences were observed compared with other approaches. A subsequent clinical trial involving 240 patients showed that methenamine hippurate administered twice daily for 12 months was noninferior to antibiotic prophylaxis, with similar rates of adverse events.

MV140 is a sublingual vaccine containing inactivated E coli V121, Klebsiella pneumoniae V113, Enterococcus faecalis V125, and Proteus vulgaris V127 strains. It is one of the most studied immunomodulatory options and has shown promising results. Three cohort studies found that MV140 reduced cystitis compared to antibiotic prophylaxis.

Protein extracts from 18 uropathogenic E coli strains have also shown some benefits, but Aronson noted that further studies are needed before they can be recommended with any level of evidence.

The evidence is stronger for combining hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate than for using either alone. A systematic review of 13 studies involving 764 women found that a combination of gentamicin (80 mg) was effective in managing recurrent UTIs. Aronson recommended reserving this approach for specific cases.

Phage therapy uses bacteriophage viruses that cause rapid bacterial cell death and alter the microbial population. It is used more frequently for treatment than for prevention. “Anything that helps us avoid antibiotic use is welcome,” Aronson concluded.

Aronson reported no having relevant financial relationships.

A new study casts doubt on international guidelines advising up to a week of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Pooled data from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found a high probability that no or shorter durations of antibiotic prophylaxis are not worse than longer durations in preventing death from any cause in these patients.

The findings suggest that recommendations for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper GI bleeding “should be reassessed,” the authors said.

They acknowledged, however, that the studies were of low-to-moderate quality and higher quality randomized clinical trial data are needed.

The study, with first author Connor Prosty, MD, Faculty of Medicine, Quebec, Canada, was published online in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Antibiotic prophylaxis became standard decades ago, when up to 60% of variceal bleeds were complicated by infections, which were thought to increase the risk for rebleeding and death. 

Yet, the evidence to support the recommendation remains limited, and a recent RCT called into question the necessity of prophylaxis. The study showed no statistically significant difference in mortality or infection among patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis randomized to receive no prophylaxis compared to third-generation cephalosporin.

While generally perceived as safe, antibiotics have potential adverse effects and can select for resistant superinfections, Prosty and colleagues pointed out.

They also noted that shorter courses of antibiotics have been proven to be as good, if not better, than longer courses across numerous other infectious indications. Recommendations for primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are being reassessed due to a weak evidence base, lack of mortality benefit, and potential for harm.

To revisit antibiotic prophylaxis for upper GI bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, Prosty and colleagues did a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 RCTs involving 1322 patients.

Two of the trials compared longer (5-7 days) with shorter (2-3 days) antibiotics, and 12 compared any antibiotic prophylaxis (1-10 days) to none.

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 5% on the risk difference (RD) scale. Secondary outcomes included early rebleeding and bacterial infections.

Overall, shorter antibiotic durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority to longer durations for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [CrI], -2.6% to 4.9%).

Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI, -4.2% to 10.0%) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD, 15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0%-25.9%). However, the authors cited methodological concerns about the definitions of these infections in the included studies.

The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for mortality, early rebleeding, and bacterial infections were higher in studies published after 2004.

“Our findings re-open the discussion surrounding the long-standing and firmly held belief that antibiotic prophylaxis has a mortality benefit in patients with cirrhosis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeds,” Prosty and colleagues wrote.

They cautioned, however, that the study quality was “low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events. Higher-quality RCTs are needed to determine the benefit and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the modern era of advanced interventions.”

The authors of a commentary published with the study noted that management of upper GI bleeding in cirrhosis patients has “greatly improved” since the 1990s, when some of the trials included in the analysis were conducted.

Catherine Mezzacappa, MD, MPH, and Guadalupe Garcia-Tsao, MD, with the Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, agree that it “may be time to revisit whether prophylactic antibiotics continue to provide benefit in patients with cirrhosis and upper GI bleeding, and if so, in which patients.”

They caution, however, that the current level of evidence is “inadequate to answer whether it is time to stop this practice, which has become the standard of care.

New trials for shorter duration and no antibiotic prophylaxis “should be designed in specific patient populations to compare sequelae of antibiotic prophylaxis, including subsequent infections and all-cause mortality,” Mezzacappa and Garcia-Tsao concluded.

The study received no specific funding. The authors and commentary writers had no relevant disclosures.

Communication failures between hospitals and community services after patient discharge can lead to serious medication-related harm, a new report has warned.

The Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) found that gaps in patient records, poor information sharing, and insufficient post-discharge support can delay or prevent medication being taken, with potentially life-threatening consequences.

The investigation examined the case of a 53-year-old man whose diabetes medication was changed during a hospital stay. 

Although he received some education on self-administering insulin, he later said he struggled to remember the instructions. A referral for district nursing support was made via his GP, but the district nursing team was not informed. 

Seventeen days after discharge, he told a nurse that he had not been taking insulin. His glucose levels were dangerously high, leading to an emergency hospital readmission.

The HSSIB identified several failings:

The report calls for local-level learning prompts covering hospital care, discharge planning, and community follow-up to prevent similar risks.

It stressed the importance of ensuring patients are confident in managing their medication before leaving hospital and improving interoperability between hospital and community electronic systems.

Rebecca Doyle, safety investigator at HSSIB, said that improving information flow and patient support at discharge is more than an administrative task.

“It's a matter of patient safety,” she said. “While individual cases can be complex, this incident clearly highlighted persistent challenges with information sharing – an issue we continue to see in investigations that explore communication and the interaction of digital systems. This information sharing is critical to keep people safe at home, managing their medical conditions, and avoiding readmission to hospital.”

The report is the third and final in a series of HSSIB investigations exploring why medications intended to be given to patients were not given.

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibition with pembrolizumab led to durable remission in 31.3% of patients with early acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Mixed CD3 chimerism predicted response, but 37.5% developed severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

“PD-1 inhibition led to durable remission in one third of the patients experiencing early relapse after HCT, suggesting that this approach may augment the GVL [graft-vs-leukemia] response. Responses were exclusively observed in the setting of mixed CD3 donor chimerism. Immune toxicities (GVHD) were a barrier to successful treatment outcome,” the authors of the study wrote.

“The results of the study highlight the challenge of attempting to dissect the graft-vs-leukemia effect from immunologic toxicity in patients with HCT,” Roman M. Shapiro and Robert J. Soiffer, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, said in a press release.

The study was led by John M. Magenau, Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was published online on August 12 in Blood Advances.

According to the authors, the small sample size limited their ability to determine the extent to which pembrolizumab could separate graft-vs-leukemia effects from GVHD. The researchers note that, while some patients achieved response without GVHD, the limited cohort size may have confounded interpretation of significant variables, including response patterns in patients with high blast percentage, very early relapse, monosomal karyotype, or TP53 mutations.

Magenau declared receiving support through a National Institutes of Health career development award (K23AI123595) and a Rogel Cancer Center Scholarship. The study was supported by a research grant (54053) from the Investigator-Initiated Studies Program of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC.

AI is detecting tumors more often and earlier in the Dutch breast cancer screening program. Those tumors can then be treated at an earlier stage. This has been demonstrated by researchers led by Radboud university medical center in a study published in The Lancet Digital Health. The use of AI could reduce workload and save millions of euros annually.

Previous research in Sweden had already shown that AI detects breast cancer on mammograms more frequently than radiologists. Moreover, AI can reduce the workload for radiologists. Now, it appears that AI can also replace the second radiologist in the Dutch breast cancer screening program. This even leads to the detection of more tumors-and at an earlier stage-which later turn out to be clinically significant.

Researchers, led by breast radiologist Ritse Mann of Radboudumc, analyzed 42,000 breast scans. These mammograms were taken as part of the Dutch screening program in the Utrecht region. Traditionally, two radiologists review these scans, as is standard practice in breast cancer screening. In this study, the researchers also evaluated the scans using AI developed by ScreenPoint Medical. Additionally, they followed the women whose scans were analyzed for nearly four and a half years, with multiple scans available for many of them.

The study showed that one radiologist working with AI detects more tumors than two radiologists alone. Tumors are also identified earlier when AI is involved. 'Sometimes the AI detects a tumor that the radiologists don't yet recognize as such. We call this a false positive. But often that tumor appears in a later scan after all. Therefore the AI was right earlier', PhD candidate Suzanne van Winkel explains. 'By the time the radiologist raises the alarm, it often concerns larger invasive tumors, which definitely need treatment, as early as possible.'

In Sweden, AI is already being used to analyze screening mammograms. 'They replace the second radiologist with AI. Only if the AI is uncertain does a second radiologist step in', Mann explains. 'We see that radiologists work well with AI, which leads to more tumors being detected without a significant increase in unnecessary follow-up checks for women.'

The current study shows that AI is also good enough in the Dutch setting to replace the second radiologist in screening scan analysis. This could save several million euros per year. Yet AI is not currently being used in the Netherlands. 'In Sweden, screening is organized regionally, while in the Netherlands it's organized nationally. That makes implementing AI more logistically challenging here', says Mann. 'The IT infrastructure in the Netherlands is not yet ready. That requires funding.'

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness, which, when untreated, prevents infants with the most severe form from gaining motor development - never gaining the ability to sit - and typically leads to death before 2 years of age. The oral drug risdiplam benefits symptomatic patients with improved motor function and increased survival, but had only been Food and Drug Administration–approved for use in patients aged 2 months and older. An international consortium, co-led by Richard Finkel, MD, of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, formerly of Nemours Children's Health, reports today that giving risdiplam as early as 16 days of age, before symptoms arise, is safe and effective. The phase 2 clinical trial results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""The impact of giving risdiplam soon after birth is quite dramatic,"" said co-first and corresponding author Finkel, who is now the Center for Experimental Neurotherapeutics director and Department of Pediatric Medicine member at St. Jude, but started the consortium and participated in the study as a faculty member at Nemours Children's Health. ""By age 2, we saw most of the children who we had treated were walking and in good general health.""

Babies with the genetic mutations that cause SMA were all started on daily risdiplam in the first six weeks of life, before definitive features of SMA appeared, and were followed for two years. The trial took place at multiple sites worldwide, including Nemours Children's Health in the U.S., with 23 patients completing the study. Of the eight children genetically predisposed to the most severe form of SMA, type 1, seven were able to sit at 12 months, and five could walk by the end of the study's two-year reporting period, with no fatalities. Of the 18 children who had a mutation predicting less severe disease, all achieved sitting by 12 months and walking by 24 months, with most reaching these milestones in timeframes comparable to typically developing children. None of the children experienced any major treatment-related adverse events.

""For families facing a diagnosis of SMA, the results of this study offer real hope. Treating children before symptoms appear - when they are still developing normally - can change the entire trajectory of the disease. We are no longer just managing symptoms; we are preserving strength, function and quality of life from the very start,"" said contributing author Aledie Navas, MD, FAAP, FCCP, of Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando. 

We demonstrated in this study that with treatment shortly after birth, risdiplam maintained a good safety profile and generated a favorable clinical response. I'm pleased to say that data from this study led the FDA to change the label for risdiplam's use, extending it to younger children.""

Richard Finkel, MD, of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

SMA causes the loss of a specific neuron that activates muscles. Without those neurons, the muscle tissue begins to atrophy. Risdiplam and similar treatments work by preventing the atrophy from accumulating over time. By giving the drug earlier, the researchers hope to avoid more muscle loss and, therefore, delay or prevent disease progression even more than current approaches.

""We've learned that it's crucial to start the drug as soon as possible. Literally every day counts,"" Finkel said.

While risdiplam slows disease progression, no current pharmaceutical treatment is curative. However, the success of this approach in newborns suggests that early interventions can still be very beneficial. This RAINBOWFISH study is ongoing. It is sponsored by F. Hoffman–LaRoche and continues the path established in their earlier risdiplam studies in older infants, children and adults with SMA, demonstrating a strong safety profile and clinical benefit of this drug, which is taken orally daily.

""The treatment of babies right after birth is an important milestone,"" Finkel said. ""But we will continue to investigate potentially even better ways to give these kids a chance at a normal life.""

To that end, Finkel has already begun testing the drug even earlier in life, in the prenatal environment, which showed promising results in a phase 1 clinical trial published earlier this year, also in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Triglycerides identified as direct cause of abdominal aortic aneurysms","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250814/Triglycerides-identified-as-direct-cause-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms.aspx","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:28:00 GMT","

High levels of triglycerides, the most common type of fat in the body and the foods we eat, directly cause abdominal aortic aneurysms, according to a study in mouse models led by Michigan Medicine.

Researchers identified triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and proteins that regulate triglyceride metabolism, including APOC3 and ANGPTL3, as causal drivers of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The study challenges the longstanding belief that triglycerides are merely biomarkers of vascular disease and instead demonstrates that they play a direct and pathogenic role in aneurysm development, growth and rupture.

The results are published in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.

We have known that hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm, but this multidimensional study pinpoints hypertriglyceridemia as an essential contributor to the development and growth, as well as dissection and rupture, of aortic aneurysms.

Our findings suggest that managing triglycerides could become a powerful therapeutic strategy.""

Eugene Chen, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author, Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at University of Michigan Medical School

Using three different mouse models of hypertriglyceridemia, the research team demonstrated a triglyceride dose-dependent effect on aneurysm severity.

Moderate elevations in triglycerides accelerated aneurysm formation, while higher levels led to aortic dissection.

Mice with severely elevated triglyceride concentrations developed more severe complications consistent with aortic rupture.

Further investigation revealed that elevated triglycerides and related fatty acids, particularly palmitate, impaired the maturation and activity of lysyl oxidase, a critical enzyme that maintains the structural integrity of the aortic wall.

This enzyme dysfunction weakened connective tissue and promoted aneurysm progression.

By overexpressing LOX in the aorta, researchers effectively blocked the damaging effects of hypertriglyceridemia in the mouse models, confirming the mechanism.

Standard lipid-lowering therapies, such as niacin, didn't sufficiently reduce triglyceride levels to a protective range.

However, investigators found success with experimental antisense oligonucleotide therapy. The drug candidate targets the ANGPTL3, which is secreted in the liver and affects how the body breaks down fats.

The treatment dramatically lowered triglyceride levels by up to 50% and prevented aneurysm formation and dissection in multiple mouse models.

""This therapy holds great potential as a treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and our research lays the groundwork for future clinical trials,"" said co-senior author Yanhong Guo, M.D., Ph.D., research assistant professor of internal medicine at U-M Medical School and member of the U-M Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center.

65LAB has awarded US$1.5 million (approx. S$1.9 million) to Professor Enrico Petretto to advance a breakthrough drug discovery platform developed at Duke-NUS Medical School. The project aims to deliver first-in-class antifibrotic therapies for lung and kidney diseases-conditions that currently have no effective treatment.

The platform, known as Systems Genetics, integrates computational biology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and is being enhanced with emerging quantum computing approaches.

65LAB is a unique partnership of global investors ClavystBio, Leaps by Bayer, Lightstone Ventures, Polaris Partners and the Polaris Innovation Fund, as well as global life science company Evotec, set up to drive scientific advancement and create new biotech ventures from Singapore. 65LAB Expert-in-Residence Stephen Courtney will provide venture-building guidance to Professor Petretto to develop a commercialisation strategy and advance the project towards company formation.

This award is further supported with a US$390,000 (approx. S$500,000) investment from Duke-NUS' early-stage innovation fund and incubation programme, LIVE Ventures, which helps bridge the gap between academic discovery and commercial development.

Fibrosis, the formation of damaged and scarred extra tissues, can lead to organ failure. Conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a type of lung disease) affect an estimated 1 in 10,000 people in Asia-Pacific, while chronic kidney disease is a growing health burden, projected to affect one in four residents in Singapore by 2035. Professor Petretto's innovation directly addresses this huge unmet need by identifying molecules that can potentially be developed into new antifibrotic drugs.

We are heartened by the results of our pre-clinical studies, which show at least a 50 per cent reduction in fibrosis in scarred tissues treated with our newly discovered molecules. These compounds work by blocking the activity of a key gene that drives tissue scarring in various diseases. 65LAB's award and the additional funding from LIVE Ventures will enable my team to accelerate the development of these molecules as antifibrotic drugs for clinical testing and future therapeutic use.""

Enrico Petretto, Professor and Director, Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School

 

Prof Petretto's work builds on his previous discovery of WWP2, a key gene driving tissue fibrosis in multiple conditions, including lung, heart, and kidney disease. The discovery was made using his pioneering Systems Genetics approach.

His team has since integrated Artificial Intelligence for large-scale high-throughput in silico screening, which allows them to sieve through more than 15 billion molecules. He is also advancing the integration of quantum computing to further enhance this powerful drug discovery platform.

Dr Chen Huimei, Principal Research Scientist at Duke-NUS' Centre for Computational Biology and co-Principal Investigator on the project, said:

""Using our computational platform, our team can quickly identify optimal drug targets for complex diseases. We can also widen our candidate pool, improving our chances of discovering molecules that can effectively block the WWP2 gene.""

Next, Prof Petretto's team aims to work with partners to test and develop their small-molecule inhibitors into antifibrotic drugs. Prof Petretto's commercialisation aspirations are actively strengthened by Duke-NUS' Centre for Technology and Development, which is protecting the novel drug targets and new molecular entities through strategic patent filings.

The award by 65LAB underscores the importance of close partnerships between academic institutions and industry leaders in accelerating the commercialisation of promising innovations. 65LAB, coupled with early-stage venture funding from Duke-NUS's incubator LIVE Ventures, creates a robust ecosystem to nurture scientific advancements into new therapeutic companies from Singapore, addressing critical health challenges globally.

Prof Petretto's project was selected through a competitive evaluation process and received unanimous support from 65LAB's investors and partners.

Dr. Pei-Sze Ng, Chair of 65LAB Joint Steering Committee and Investment Director at Leaps by Bayer said:

""This award enabling Professor Petretto to advance his groundbreaking work is central to 65LAB's mission. By combining world-class academic research with targeted funding and industry expertise, we're not just accelerating drug discovery; we're actively fostering the growth of Singapore's biotech venture ecosystem and bringing innovative therapies closer to patients who desperately need them.""

Associate Professor Christopher Laing, Vice-Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Duke-NUS, said:

""The investment is testimony to the commercialisation potential of Enrico's Systems Genetics pipeline. This project could bring a new therapy to market to treat patients with chronic diseases marked by fibrosis. It is also an affirmation of a robust platform for AI-driven target discovery, which promises more investible opportunities in the future.""

The first award by 65LAB was made in July 2024-Associate Professor Lena Ho, also from Duke-NUS, received funding of US$1.5 million for her project developing microproteins into therapeutic targets to treat chronic inflammation.

Older adults taking pregabalin for chronic pain had up to an 85% higher risk of heart failure than gabapentin users, raising fresh caution for prescribing practices in high-risk groups.

Study: Initiation of Pregabalin vs Gabapentin and Development of Heart Failure. Image Credit: Vector_Leart / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers compared heart failure (HF) incidence between users of gabapentin and pregabalin.

Non-opioid medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are gabapentinoids (analogs of gamma-aminobutyric acid) prescribed for chronic pain disorders. They are preferred over opioids for chronic non-cancer pain treatment due to the higher risks of overdose, addiction, and death associated with opioids. Non-opioids are specifically indicated for older individuals, as they are among those with the most risk for adverse effects related to opioids.

Both gabapentin and pregabalin bind specific subunits of N-type and P/Q-type voltage-gated neuronal calcium channels, reduce neurotransmitter release, and exhibit antinociceptive effects. However, adverse cardiovascular effects, including peripheral edema and HF, have been associated with gabapentin and pregabalin due to their additional effects on α2δ subunits of L-type calcium channel subunits on ventricular cardiomyocytes and arteries.

Moreover, the risk of adverse effects may be higher with pregabalin compared to gabapentin due to its higher potency and receptor binding affinity. However, there are only a few studies that assessed the comparative HF risk between gabapentin and pregabalin users. In addition, most of these studies did not focus on older individuals, limited their analyses to neurological indications, or lacked a rigorous HF definition.

To address these gaps, the researchers used a target trial emulation design, a framework that mimics a randomized controlled trial using observational data to estimate causal effects more robustly. They adjusted for 231 covariates using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize confounding.

In the present study, researchers compared the incidence of HF among individuals prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin for chronic non-cancer pain. A 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries between January 1, 2015, and December 21, 2018, was included. The cohort comprised beneficiaries aged 65–89 and was limited to those with outpatient medical care, prescription drug, and hospitalization coverage. Patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage (Part C) were excluded due to incomplete claims data.

Patients with a chronic pain diagnosis and a new prescription of gabapentin or pregabalin were included in the cohort. Individuals with terminal illnesses, a history of HF, hospitalization on the day of prescription, hospital stay more than 29 days, or a stay more than 29 days at a long-term care facility were excluded. Subjects were followed up until an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization for HF, death, or the end of the study.

The primary outcome was an ED visit or hospitalization for a primary HF diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included outpatient encounters with a primary HF diagnosis and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for gabapentin and pregabalin were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The models were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on a propensity score that incorporated 231 demographic, clinical, and medication-use variables. Further, stratified analyses were performed by sex, race, ethnicity, and history of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The cohort comprised 246,237 Medicare beneficiaries, with a median age of 73. Of these, 92.4% used gabapentin and 7.6% used pregabalin. Most participants were female (66.8%) and White (79.9%). Neuropathic, back, and musculoskeletal pain were the most common diagnoses associated with gabapentin and pregabalin prescriptions. Gabapentin and pregabalin users had overall comparable frequencies of diagnoses of cardiovascular and other conditions.

Nevertheless, pregabalin users had an increased prevalence of fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, greater use of duloxetine and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and a lower proportion of White individuals. Overall, 1.3% of the cohort developed HF during a follow-up of 114,113 person-years. HF incidence per 1,000 person-years was 12.5 for gabapentin users and 18.2 for pregabalin users.

Pregabalin was associated with a higher HF risk compared to gabapentin in females, White individuals, and those with a CVD history. Further, the risk of outpatient HF was significantly higher for pregabalin users compared to gabapentin users. However, all-cause mortality did not significantly differ between these groups.

In a negative control analysis using hip fracture, a condition unrelated to the exposure or outcome, no significant difference was observed between the two drugs, supporting the specificity of the HF findings. Additionally, E-values were calculated to assess robustness to unmeasured confounding.

In sum, pregabalin initiation was associated with an increased risk of incident HF compared to gabapentin initiation in older individuals with chronic pain. This risk was especially pronounced among individuals with pre-existing CVD, supporting current recommendations for caution when prescribing pregabalin to older people with CVD.

The study's limitations include a sample skewed toward female and White individuals, sample restriction to those aged ≥ 65, exclusion of Medicare Advantage enrollees, and limited power for ethnic and racial minority groups. Furthermore, unmeasured confounders such as body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and socioeconomic status were not available in the Medicare dataset but were partially addressed through negative control and E-value analyses. Overall, clinicians should assess ongoing cardiovascular risk factors and provide adequate risk-benefit counseling to older people before prescribing pregabalin for chronic pain.

A new study in the peer-reviewed journal Tissue Engineering, Part A demonstrates the potential to produce cellular spheroids, from a clinically relevant embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cell (ES-MSC) source, to generate scaffold-free chondrogenic or osteochondrogenic graft tissues. 

Darryl D'Lima, MD, PhD, from the Shiley Center for Orthopaedic Research and Education at Scripps Clinic, and coauthors, describe how the ES-MSC cellular spheroids were cultured in chondrogenic medium and seeded into a customizable closed chamber system, in which they fused and formed a single tissue construct.

""To engineer osteochondral tissues, cellular spheroids were matured in the [chamber system] for only 7 days before implantation into ex vivo human cartilage defects,"" stated the investigators. Cellular spheroids cultured in the chamber system developed into neocartilage tissues expressing cartilage associated genes and staining positive for cartilage matrix molecules. The cartilage-like constructs that were implanted into cartilage defects created in ex vivo osteoarthritic tissue resulted in repair tissue that was histologically integrated with the explant tissues.

""This study introduces a novel approach leveraging cellular spheroids to generate scaffold-free chondrogenic and osteochondrogenic neotissues that integrate with host tissues, addressing a key challenge to clinical translation,"" says Tissue Engineering Co-Editor-in-Chief Antonios G. Mikos, PhD, Louis Calder Professor of Bioengineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Rice University.

New research from Michigan State University finds that microbes play an important role in shaping early brain development, specifically in a key brain region that controls stress, social behavior, and vital body functions.

The study, published in Hormones and Behavior, used a mouse model to highlight how natural microbial exposure not only impacts brain structure immediately after birth but may even begin influencing development while still in the womb. A mouse model was chosen because mice share significant biological and behavioral similarities with humans and there are no other alternatives to study the role of microbes on brain development.

This work is of significance because modern obstetric practices, like peripartum antibiotic use and Cesarean delivery, disrupt maternal microbes. In the United States alone, 40% of women receive antibiotics around childbirth and one-third of all births occur via Cesarean section.

At birth, a newborn body is colonized by microbes as it travels through the birth canal. Birth also coincides with important developmental events that shape the brain. We wanted to further explore how the arrival of these microbes may affect brain development.""

Alexandra Castillo Ruiz, lead author of the study and assistant professor in the MSU Department of Psychology

The research team focused on a brain region called the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which plays a central role in regulating stress, blood pressure, water balance, and even social behavior. Their previous work had shown that mice raised without microbes, or germ-free mice, had more dying neurons in the PVN during early development. The new study set out to determine whether this increased cell death translated to changes in neuron number in the long run, and if any effects could be caused by the arrival of microbes at birth or if they began in the womb via signals from maternal microbes.

To find out, the researchers used a cross-fostering approach. Germ-free newborn mice were placed with mothers that had microbes and compared them to control groups. When the brains of these mice were examined just three days after birth, results were striking: All mice gestated by germ-free mothers had fewer neurons in the PVN, regardless of whether they received microbes after birth. They also found that germ-free adult mice had fewer neurons in the PVN.

""Our study shows that microbes play an important role in sculpting a brain region that is paramount for body functions and social behavior. In addition, our study indicates that microbial effects start in the womb via signaling from maternal microbes,"" said Dr. Castillo-Ruiz.

Rather than shunning our microbes, we should recognize them as partners in early life development,"" said Dr. Castillo-Ruiz. ""They're helping build our brains from the very beginning.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Griffith University launches groundbreaking treatment trial for spinal cord injury","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250813/Griffith-University-launches-groundbreaking-treatment-trial-for-spinal-cord-injury.aspx","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 02:47:00 GMT","

A Phase 1 human clinical trial to treat chronic spinal cord injury, the first of its kind in the world, has commenced to test the efficacy and safety of a revolutionary new treatment using nasal cells.

The Griffith University trial has been three decades in the making and involves taking olfactory ensheathing cells, which are specialised cells involved in our sense of smell, from the nose as they have numerous therapeutic properties for repairing and regenerating nerves.

Lead researcher Professor James St. John, Head of Griffith's Clem Jones Centre for Neurobiology and Stem Cell Research and Principal Researcher at the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, is carrying on the legacy of the late Professor Emeritus Alan Mackay-Sim AM.

""Once the cells have been removed from the patient's nose, they are then used to create an innovative nerve bridge which is about the size of a very small worm,"" Professor St. John said.

""The nerve bridge is then implanted into the spine at the site of the injury, offering what we think is the best hope for treating spinal cord injury.

""To help stimulate regeneration, patients will undergo intensive rehabilitation for three months prior to the transplantation and then for eight months after the transplantation.

""While primary assessments are to ensure the therapy is safe, we will also be measuring numerous aspects to assess if there are changes in functional outcomes that are important to people living with spinal cord injury.

""The ability to regain some sense of function, whether it's regaining independent function of their bladder or bowel, regaining movement in their fingers, or the ability to stand and hug a loved one again can improve quality of life.

""Regaining some form of independence can open the world up to people living with a chronic acquired spinal injury.""

The trial, to be conducted at Gold Coast University Hospital, is a blinded and randomised control study with preclinical research demonstrating the olfactory nerve bridges are effective in repairing spinal cord injury in animal models.

CEO of the Clem Jones Foundation, Peter Johnstone, said the latest milestone illustrated how long-term philanthropic support could foster ground-breaking research with the potential to change lives for the better. 

The Clem Jones Foundation has supported this world-leading project from day one alongside other philanthropic groups and individuals which meant it also attracted state and federal government funding commitments. 

All of the funding partners recognise that results from medical research never happen overnight but rely on long-term funding as well as the long-term application of the knowledge, skills, and hard work of the talented team of researchers at Griffith University.""

Peter Johnstone, CEO of the Clem Jones Foundation

Founder of the Perry Cross Spinal Research Foundation, Perry Cross AM, who became a ventilated quadriplegic at age 19 from a rugby accident, has dedicated his life to advocating for a cure.

""This clinical trial represents a long-awaited breakthrough that speaks to the enduring strength of those impacted by spinal cord injury and the extraordinary belief of those who support us,"" Mr Cross said.

""For too long, individuals living with paralysis have been told that recovery lies beyond the horizon of possibility.

""Today, we challenge that notion with evidence, ambition and above all, hope.

""It is proof that philanthropy, when guided by purpose and vision, can accelerate real change. Every contribution has mattered, and each gesture of support has brought us closer to this point.

""For someone like me, who knows all too well the permanence of spinal cord injury, this trial offers not just the possibility of improved function, but a renewed sense of independence and dignity; qualities that define the human experience.""

Professor St. John said: ""To have a cell transplantation therapy progressing to clinical trial after only eight years is testament to the benefits of the strategic translational research program the team has used.

""To be able to develop the therapy in Queensland is thanks to the incredible support from our funding partners, in particular the Motor Accident Insurance Commission as the major funder, the Clem Jones Foundation, the Perry Cross Spinal Research Foundation, National Health and Medical Research Council, Medical Research Future Fund, and the dedicated spinal injury community which has been the inspiration and driving force behind the therapy development.""

The trial is funded by the Medical Research Future Fund, Perry Cross Spinal Research Foundation, The Clem Jones Foundation, Queensland Government, Nicola and Andrew Forrest, Brazil Family Foundation, Terry and Rhonda White, and Griffith University.

The International Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research (IADR) and the American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research (AADOCR) have announced the publication of a new study in JDR Clinical & Translational Research that demonstrates that arginine dentifrices reduce dental caries in children with active caries as much as, or more than, a sodium fluoride dentifrice, depending on the arginine concentration.

Dental caries remain a significant oral health burden globally. Scientific evidence has demonstrated the dose-dependent, anticaries action of fluoride; however, more effective, comprehensive, and alternative prevention strategies should be investigated. The study, ""Arginine Dentifrices and Childhood Caries Prevention: A Randomized Clinical Trial"" by Wei Lin, Sichuan University, et al. carried out a two-year, phase III, double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial from April 15, 2019 through March 12, 2022 across three centers in China. Six thousand children aged 10–14 with two or more active caries lesions were assigned one of three study dentifrices: 8.0% arginine, 1.5% arginine, and 0.32% NaF as a positive control. The primary efficacy outcomes were incremental DMFS (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces) and DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) caries indices scores after two years of product use.

After two years, the 8.0% arginine-containing dentifrice demonstrated a statistically significant 26.0% reduction in DMFS and 25.3% in DMFT scores vs. the 0.32% NaF control. No statistical difference was measured between the 1.5% arginine-containing dentifrice and the 0.32% NaF control in DMFS and DMFT. This clinical study confirms that depending on the concentration, arginine dentifrices are as effective, or more effective, than a sodium fluoride dentifrice in providing anti-caries protection in children with active caries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Christian Pulisic And The USMNT Are Becoming Extremely Unlikable At Worst Time Possible","https://www.outkick.com/sports/christian-pulisic-usmnt-unlikable-world-cup","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:07:52 GMT","

The USMNT have somehow become more unlikable than ever ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The hype and excitement for the U.S. men's national soccer team should be at an all-time high at the moment. The keyword there is ‘should.'

There has never been a more talented USMNT roster with a squad filled with players competing for some of the biggest clubs on the planet. The USMNT has also never employed a more accomplished manager than Mauricio Pochettino, who was hired in September of last year. 

Those two facts, not opinions, should have American soccer fans counting down the days until the start of the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in North America with 78 of the 104 matches set to be played on U.S. soil.

It is not an exaggeration to say that next year's World Cup is the biggest, most important soccer event in the history of United States soccer. 

The largest soccer event in the country's history, coinciding with the USMNT never being more talented, is a nice luxury. It's exactly what the federation was meant to build ahead of 2026. Outside of a disastrous performance when the tournament begins in June, it's a scenario that's seemingly impossible to mess up.

But when there is a chance, even a slim one, to disappoint, the USMNT is going to find a way to do so.

The USMNT continues to disappoint. (Photo by Manuel Velasquez Figueroa/USSF/Getty Images for USSF)

What's surprising about this situation, however, is that it's captain Christian Pulisic delivering self-inflicting wounds and making the USMNT far easier to hate than to like.

Hey USA Soccer, This Is An Absolute Joke. If You're Trying To Give Us 'Hope' For World Cup, You Are Failing

Pulisic opted out of competing for the USMNT during the Gold Cup earlier this summer, choosing to take the time to recover from a lengthy club season with AC Milan. Other big-name regulars on the USMNT skipped the competition as well, but when you wear the captain's band and happen to be the biggest star in U.S. soccer history, you get scrutinized a bit more.

Pulisic, however, is not taking that scrutiny well. Instead of acting like a thick-skinned leader who has hoisted a Champions League trophy and many more in his still-young career, he's decided to bitch and moan about the outside noise in his self-titled documentary series.

In the most recent episode, Pulisic and U.S. teammate Tim Weah aimed at the media and the USMNT players who came before them. Pulisic's father also jumps in on the trash talk in what is a 59-second clip of pure cringe.

Weah pointing out that the national teams before them haven't won anything as if his generation has done something remotely impressive on the world stage is mindboggling. 

In another clip, Pulisic mocked the media for reporting and speculating about him opting out of competing in the Gold Cup. Again, this is the captain of the USMNT we're talking about.

Pulisic has an arrogance about him, just like the vast majority of other superstar athletes around the world, and on the club level, he has earned the right to display it when sitting in front of a camera. When we're talking about Pulisic in the context of the USMNT, however, that arrogance should be reserved for inside the white lines and motivating a team that has never been relevant on the world stage.

Every American sports fan should want to embrace this USMNT ahead of the World Cup, but instead of anticipation and excitement building, it's dread and disinterest that are building.

EPL

No doubt, Fulham will feel a bit up against it heading into the club's Premier League opener, away at Brighton.

The 2024-25 season saw Antonee Robinson cement his place as one of Marco Silva's most vital charges, arguably the best pure left back in the Premier League. Nicknamed “Jedi,” he's proven capable of containing Bukayo Saka and Mohamed Salah on one end before dependably squaring crosses right into his striker's stride. He gutted out an injury to his right knee until season's end, finishing third in the fan-voted Player of the Season pageant after a 10-assist campaign.

On Thursday, 48 hours before a trip to the AmEx, Silva confirmed that Robinson would not be available for selection as he works back from an offseason surgery on that vital plant-leg knee. So, too, would Ryan Sessegnon, leaving the Portuguese manager without his two top options at left back.

Mauricio Pochettino may still be envying Silva's situation. At least the Fulham boss has a viable alternative in the role to Robinson.

It's hardly a new phenomenon that the U.S. men's national team is dangerously thin at left back. In fact, the program went over a decade with makeshift solutions, forcing players like DaMarcus Beasley and Fabian Johnson to own the role despite spending their careers up until that point further afield. While U.S. Soccer can't take credit for Robinson's development, his commitment was a clear end to holding the left side of the back line together with duct tape and chewing gum.

While Robinson has amassed a tidy 50 caps to date, he's been absent for the last four camps under Pochettino, a 12-game sample from which the coach has learned plenty about his player pool. He's had his initial trust in Diego Luna validated by a star-making turn at the Gold Cup. That same tournament gave reason to think Matt Freese could be a shot-stopping alternative to Matt Turner in goal.

There have been frustrating realizations, too. Mexico is back on the ascent, although that's a bit more of a subplot than usual as both nations will abstain from World Cup qualifying this cycle. His faith in the core that helped qualify for the 2022 installment has potentially been rocked by Christian Pulisic and others opting out or missing out on the Gold Cup. And, more relevant to today's news via Silva: he doesn't have a clear alternative to Robinson at left back.

Unlike other USMNT mainstays like Gio Reyna, Pochettino and Robinson have already logged a bit of collaboration. The left back was on Pochettino's first squad last October, and started both legs of the Concacaf Nations Leg quarterfinal against Jamaica the following month. In the second, Robinson assisted on the second goal of a 4-2 win that sent the U.S. through to the final four.

Since then, however, Pochettino has had to play alternatives to Robinson. When an ailment kept Robinson out for the Nations League's business end in March, it became a calamity: Panama targeted out-of-position Max Arfsten and, later, Joe Scally, exploiting the latter's lack of awareness to score a last gasp winner in a 1-0 semifinal upset. Scally went on to start the third-place game, putting in such a poor shift that he got a halftime hook.

In the 12 games that have passed since Robinson's last U.S. appearance, four players have been called upon in his absence. Arfsten has been Pochettino's most relied-upon alternative, appearing in nine of that dozen, most often as starter. John Tolkin, of recently relegated Holstein Kiel in Germany, has made five appearances, while Scally and DeJuan Jones have each appeared twice in the role. None have made a terribly compelling case for further looks.

Throughout the Gold Cup, Arfsten and Tolkin — as indicated by their higher utilization — were the two options on Pochettino's squad.

Arfsten, a winger with the possession-dominant Columbus Crew, has fared about as you'd expect for a player who usually sees the game from a vastly different perspective. His attacking contributions were that of an ideal wingback, logging assists and chipping in goals as an auxiliary threat from wide. His defensive performances were riddled with the kinds of mistakes coaches have to drill out of defenders in the youth ranks, taking the bait and making needless fouls (like one just inside the box against Costa Rica that resulted in a penalty).

Tolkin, largely as a substitute, has at least spent his career in the role since debuting with his boyhood New York Red Bulls. His issues more closely mirror the struggles recently seen from young left backs George Bello, Kris Lund and Sam Vines: bona fide left backs, but unable to prove themselves at the international level.

There's a paucity of alternatives, too. Unlike other spots, there's no alternative who hasn't been tested and is flying under the radar. The closest to matching that mold is Caleb Wiley, the Chelsea prospect who earned three caps in 2023 and 2024 but hasn't been in a national team camp since Pochettino took charge. While it's impressive for a 20-year-old to have amassed 135 club appearances, mostly with Atlanta United before the club from London came calling, his first loan with Strasbourg was inconclusive. He's at Watford now, and could very easily work into the fold in the months to come.

The other alternatives to Scally are, in the program's grand tradition, playing out of position. There's Arfsten, still tapping into his winger's instincts at the expense of his team's defending. There's Scally shifting over from right back (and Sergiño Dest before him, the first-choice option in that spot), who fancy themselves to put in a shift on the left. Even then, it weakens the right back contingent that is seemingly three players deep: Dest, Scally, Alex Freeman.

If Robinson's recovery timetable will keep him out of the next international camp spanning from Sept. 1-9 (the fifth-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup), those speculative alternatives may get another chance to log starts and fortify their cases for inclusion. Pochettino and a fanbase starved for optimism will rightfully hope for a pleasant surprise.

As it stands right now, it's a bleak reality for the USMNT: against ideal operational standards, this is a Jedi without a worthy padawan.

Trio made comments in new docuseries episode

Pulisic: Critics ‘disrespected me in a lot of ways'

Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic and his father, Mark, delivered searing takes on ex-US men's national team players who criticized the team during their recent run of bad form, with Weah calling the pundits “evil”.

The trio made the comments in the latest epsiode of the Pulsic docuseries on Paramount+, the final episodes of which were released this week. The new episodes cover the national team from the 2024 Copa América, in which the US underperformed by exiting at the group stage, up through the 2025 Nations League final, where the US lost against Panama and Canada en route to a disappointing fourth-place finish in a competition they had won in each of the previous three editions. Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he announced that he would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team's last competitive tournament before next year's World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a second-straight 50-game season with Milan.

Pulisic's decision elicited strong critiques from ex-US players such as Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad and Herculez Gomez.

“In my opinion [they] disrespected me in a lot of ways, and completely forgot about what I've done for this national team for 10 years,” Pulisic said in the docuseries.

The series also includes segments focused on Pulisic's personal life, and the role his family plays within his inner circle. His father, Mark, is a former professional soccer player, and he spoke up forcefully for his son.

“These [pundits] want clicks, social media, ‘subscribe to my channels,' ‘listen to my podcasts' or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,” he said. “It's jealousy. People want to be in his shoes, and they'll find any reason to bring him down. But Christian doesn't give a shit what anyone says.”

Christian also repeated a retort he used earlier this year, in an appearance on CBS Sports' Call it What You Want podcast, which had been heavily critical of his decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup.

“I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all pundits say ‘they didn't want it,' ‘they didn't have the heart,' ‘back in our day we would fight and we would die on the field,'” he said, insisting again that national team results affect him deeply.

The most scathing retort, though, came from Weah.

“I think those guys are chasing checks, and for me I just feel like they're really evil,” he said. “They've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Those are the same guys that'll turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to.

“But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either. … Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak negative on us.”

Pulisic finished last season as one of Milan's best players in a season when the team won the Supercoppa Italiana but lost in the Coppa Italia final, lost in the knockout round of the Champions League, and finished eighth in the Serie A table. The team will not play in European competition this year, with Pulisic missing time in preseason due to an ankle injury.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

The European summer transfer window has just under three weeks remaining, and the U.S. men's national team will report in four weeks for a pair of international friendlies. Across the past few weeks, there have been several transfer developments for players with high hopes for the 2026 World Cup.

Defender Alex Freeman, a breakout performer at the Gold Cup, has caught the attention of clubs in Spain - but Orlando City aren't keen to sell. Could a move abroad propel him into the picture for next summer? Or is he better suited in MLS - where another player in Benjamin Cremaschi, is now pondering his future as well. The U20 World Cup hopeful questioned his playing time this week, and throughout the Spring calendar, multiple European clubs were reportedly monitoring his status.

Meanwhile, in Europe, Josh Sargent is reportedly back on the radar of Leeds United. The newly promoted Premier League side is looking at the Norwich ace to bolster their attacking ranks ahead of the campaign.

This article is part of our My Game In My Words 2025 series, an exclusive set of interviews with USMNT players where they talk us through how they do what they do on a soccer pitch.

It's been a whirlwind summer for Damion Downs.

Last November, Downs appeared for Germany Under-20s against England, called up as a bit-part player for Koln in the 2.Bundesliga. By the following May, he was preparing to suit up under Mauricio Pochettino in the red, white and blue at the Gold Cup after winning promotion to the Bundesliga, scoring 10 league goals from 21 starts.

Now he's preparing for a second successive term in a European second tier, this time for Southampton, who suffered relegation from the Premier League to the Championship last season. After securing a move to England for a fee of around £7million, Downs made his debut last weekend from the bench, helping to inspire Southampton's opening-day comeback 2-1 victory over Wrexham.

“A lot of players want to play in England, and I'm one of them,” says Downs, leaning back into his chair at Southampton's training ground. “The Premier League is probably the biggest league you can play in. Obviously, it's my goal to win promotion and help the club into the Premier League. I'm just really looking forward to it.”

If you've followed the USMNT over the past two decades, Downs' family story will sound familiar. Like former U.S. internationals Jermaine Jones, John Brooks and Timothy Chandler, Downs was born in Germany to an African-American father and a German mother. He moved to the States when he was a year old, before returning to his birth country at nine.

Had he spent the entirety of his childhood in the United States, it's not unlikely that he'd have been an exciting American football prospect. At 6ft 4in (193cm) tall with eye-catching athleticism, it's not difficult to envision him as a dual-threat quarterback for a Division 1 college football programme in Texas, the state where he spent his early childhood.

After all, Downs, who speaks English with an American accent fused with a slight but noticeable German twang, didn't kick a (round) football until he returned to Europe — remarkably late for someone who would go on to win their first international cap 12 years later.

“I was so young when I went to the States, and obviously football and basketball were a lot bigger than soccer,” Downs tells The Athletic. “So I started playing football, and when I moved back to Germany and came back to the village where my mom is from, it was probably an hour's drive to play football. I was too young at that age to make it worthwhile at that point, so I just tried another sport.”

Naturally, he turned his hand to soccer. Now, he's a fully-fledged international with the talent to emerge as an outside candidate for the hotly contested USMNT striker spot.

Downs had been involved in various age-group training camps with both Germany and the USMNT. As recently as last summer, he was called up to a training camp in Kansas ahead of the Olympics but was not named in the final squad for the games.

He committed his allegiance to Mauricio Pochettino in the spring and joined up for a training camp with the main roster ahead of their post-season friendly fixtures against Turkey and Switzerland, making his debut off the bench against the latter. He impressed the Argentine enough to win a place on the Gold Cup roster, featuring four times as the United States reached the semi-finals.

He featured mainly as a substitute for Patrick Agyemang, who has also made a summer switch to the Championship, joining Derby County from Charlotte FC in MLS. Despite having few opportunities to make an impact from the start, Downs was characteristically ice-cool when the pressure was on.

Having never taken a penalty in his professional career, the opportunity arose for Downs to score the winning spot-kick in a quarter-final shoot-out against Costa Rica.

“I was pretty calm at that moment,” says Downs. “We talked about who's gonna go sixth, who's gonna go seventh, and they wanted me to go seventh. But I spoke with another player, and he just said, ‘You go ahead. ‘ I was confident. I mean, it's another part of finishing, no? I was pretty calm in that moment.”



Watching the way Downs swiped the ball into the bottom left corner, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way, you'd be hard-pressed to suggest his “calm” demeanour is a bluff. He describes the immediate elation as “a great, great feeling”. For Downs, finishing, whether from a stationary ball 12 yards from goal or in open play, is his strongest and most natural attribute.

As The Athletic loads a clip, he gives a knowing smile, perhaps something to do with its label: “excellent goal, Karlsruher”. With Koln already 1-0 up against Karlsruher (in a match that eventually finishes 4-4), the ball finds its way from the goalkeeper to left-back Leart Paqarada. Downs, who is occupying both Karlsruher centre-backs, is already preparing for the following action.



Asked if he's calling for the ball immediately, Downs replies, “Yeah. He's got a great left foot; he was probably one of the best passers we had on the team.

“I was in a great position, in between both centre-backs, because the one on the far side can't really pick me up and I'm in the back of him (near side centre-back). He probably thinks he's got me, but at the same time, if the ball comes perfectly over his back, he can't really do anything about it. Yeah, that's a position I like to be in.”



Downs plucks out the inch-perfect pass over the defence with an excellent touch, taking the ball into his stride.



“I worked a lot on that when I was younger — just getting used to the speed of the game. I think I could still work on it a bit more now. I knew that if I let the ball go, he could still defend it, but with a touch like that, he's out of the game. It meant I could put the shot up straight away.”

Aesthetically, it's about as pleasing a goal as you'll see. A perfect pass, perfect touch and classy finish through the goalkeeper's legs to top it off.



Well, actually…

“I wanted to send it between his arms and legs,” he chuckles. “I mishit it a bit… but it looked good!”

Analysis of the 11 goals Downs scored in all competitions last season demonstrates a healthy mix of right and left-footed goals. His stronger foot is his right, but Downs feels capable and comfortable finishing around the box with either foot.



“As soon as I'm in the 18-yard box, anywhere around there, I just feel like I can score from pretty much any angle,” he says. “I have trust in both of my feet. That's just something that's much more of an instinct now.”

While Downs can occupy central defenders on his own, his instinct is to drop deep and link with midfielders and wide players. He grew up in Germany playing mostly as a winger or an auxiliary striker (sometimes known as a second striker or shadow striker), and has only developed into a leading No 9 in recent years. Having that interaction with team-mates helps him build rhythm and ensure he's in the zone, should a chance come along.

Like here, where he drops deeper before making his move into the box late.



“I'm just trying to get a feel for the game. Be connected with the game. Sometimes, if you're just up there (on the last line), you just don't get the ball. So I drop to get a touch on the ball and have a good feeling, so when actions come in, you feel ready for it.”



The Athletic suggests he was definitely ready…

“Yeah,” he laughs. “I just saw the movement of the other centre-backs and midfielders going towards the goal, so I tried a counter move. We already had two of my team-mates going into the box. I wanted the ball before that, obviously got it later, but I was still free. It's a finish I like.”

Downs sees himself in a similar mould to Premier League strikers Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike as a rangy forward capable of contributing to the team with much more than just goals. From his understanding, that's how Pochettino currently sees him, too. In the Gold Cup, his head coach rarely played Downs as an out-and-out striker, preferring to use his qualities to help with the team's build-up behind more traditional No 9s Agyemang and Brian White.



“When I subbed in, he didn't even sub me in as a striker,” says Downs, who replaced central midfielder Luca de la Torre in the 78th minute. “He was much more focused on me being a second striker, kind of like a 10. It's probably something he sees in my game.

“I see myself as really flexible, to be honest. I can adapt to whoever's on the pitch at the time. If you have a big striker who is really physical and needs to be in his nice spot, I can move as a second striker. I can move as a 10 and even as a winger, which is probably not my best position, but I can make it work.”

While there are big clubs in Germany's second tier, including Hamburg and Schalke, it's difficult to assess how ready someone is for elite international football without frequently watching them against that level of competition. Drawing Bayer Leverkusen in the DFB-Pokal quarter-final last season was an opportunity for Downs to test himself against a Champions League side, and he shone. He opened the scoring in the first half through sheer persistence, eventually firing low and towards the near post to beat Matej Kovar in the Leverkusen goal.



And there was a moment that showed his technical quality, leaving his marker, Germany defender Jonathan Tah, stranded with a deft touch before sliding a weighted pass into a team-mate to break beyond their defence.

“I just saw the centre-back, (Timo) Hubers, there, and I could see he was looking upwards,” says Downs. “I was trying to give him a better angle (for a pass), so that's why I came outside (to the right wing).



“Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw their centre-back coming to close me down, so I tried to use his momentum against him with the touch.



“Luckily, it worked that time. Then I saw Linton (Maina) going deep, and the pass was an instinct move.”



Leverkusen edged past Koln 3-2 to reach the semi-final, proving Koln were capable of performing against elite opposition and lifting spirits within the dressing room to push on and win 2.Bundesliga. It was also a timely confidence booster for Downs, who carried on his goalscoring form to grab the winner in a 1-0 result against Schalke three days later. He describes confidence as “the biggest make or break for a striker”, and building on an encouraging opening display under Will Still will help it to grow.

Still, he's under no illusions about the difficulties of the Championship. Improving his pressing ability, which he says is a “non-negotiable” in the modern game, is “something he's still working on”. There's also the aerial side of the game, which he recognises “should be a major part of his game” due to his frame, but concedes it's not a natural strength.

Underlining his mentality, though, is his response.

“It's not the best part of my game,” he says. “But at the same time, it's a blessing because it's something I have to work on.”

In a World Cup year, it would take an outstanding term to push ahead of Pochettino's current striker options to represent his nation at next summer's tournament. Fellow Championship forwards Daryl Dike (West Bromwich Albion), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Josh Sargent (Norwich City), and Agyemang are more established, known quantities within the system. Not to mention Folarin Balogun at Monaco and Ricardo Pepi at PSV.

Still, who'd want to write off a confident goalscorer who has already proven his ability against elite European competition?

Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah have well and truly stoked the fire of debate as the divide between the U.S. Men's National Team of old and new appears well and truly at odds, with Alexi Lalas taking to social media to call out the duo's blunt response to critics.

In recent months, the current generation of USMNT stars, led by Mauricio Pochettino, has been under the microscope, attracting major criticism from some of the stars of old, including Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey, and Lalas, for what they have perceived as a lack of drive, competitiveness, and misplaced priorities.

These sentiments came to the forefront following the USMNT's abysmal CONCACAF Nations League title defense in March, which saw them lose to both Panama and Canada, before Pulisic and AC Milan teammate Yunus Musah both controversially opted out of summer call-ups for their Gold Cup run.

But while such criticism had died down of late, with the USMNT having last played on July 6, losing 2-1 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final, the flames of debate have been fanned by Pulisic and Weah, after their comments calling out their critics were publicized in the Paramount+ docuseries, Pulisic.

“I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when, especially, all pundits want to say, ‘They didn't want it. They didn't have the heart. Back in our day, we would fight and we would die on that field,'” Pulisic said.

After a clip of Donovan criticizing the USMNT was then played, Weah, who recently completed a loan move to Olympique Marseille from Juventus, opted for a more pointed response, saying, “I think those guys are chasing checks and for me I just feel like they're really evil honestly because they've been players and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed and those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day.”

He went on to add how their USMNT predecessors “didn't win anything either.”

“Few things: 1. They're evil…but you respect them?” Lalas wrote in response. “2. Landon Donovan was on best U.S. World Cup team in history. 3. Don't bring your dad to a fight. 4. This makes you look soft…the thing you're whining about being criticized for. 5. Click…well played.”

Fans quickly weighed into the conversation, with one labeling the current generation “the most unlikeable USMNT in my lifetime,” to which Lalas replied, “This is the real problem.”

“Read the room. We're ~300 days from a home World Cup,” he added. “At a time when we should be excited/confident about what next summer can bring, instead there's apathy/concern re this USMNT. Learn the lessons from USWNT. America want to like you...so let them.”

Lalas also took the opportunity to fire back after one follower suggested the media covering the USMNT was “made up of nothing but overly negative old guys.” He said he had done his utmost “to guard against being ""grumpy old man"" stereotype of ex-player turned media. I've done OK.”

“There's balance between homer/curmudgeon. Takes time to calibrate. We all have ego, hubris, & envy. I want USMNT to succeed, but not at expense of being honest.”

And when asked what “your teams” won during his USMNT career, Lalas simply said, “Hearts and minds.”

The USMNT is scheduled to return to action on September 6 when they host South Korea in the first of two friendlies, with Japan taking on Pochettino's side three days later.

Chelsea will donate a share of the Club World Cup bonuses being paid to their players to the family of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, the club have confirmed.

The Blues were crowned world champions last month in the United States after defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final in New Jersey. That triumph earned them an estimated £84.4million in prize money overall.

Around £11.4m has been allocated to go to Cole Palmer and Co, worth close to £400,000 per player as the kitty will be split equally between all those who represented Enzo Maresca's side in the States.

The club and the squad have also agreed together that they should send an equal share to the Jota and Silva family. The Liverpool attacker and his brother passed away in a car accident on July 3, midway through the Club World Cup.

That tragedy hit the Chelsea team hard, including Pedro Neto, his former Wolves and Portugal team-mate. Maresca gave Neto the choice during the tournament as to whether he wanted to continue playing. He did so and helped the team to victory while dedicating his participation to Jota, along with a number of other players who used their goal celebrations to pay tribute to the Portuguese forward.

Liverpool announced last month that they were permanently retiring the No 20 shirt at all levels of the club in memory of Jota.

Chelsea's gesture received much praise from fans of various clubs.

Mark Goldbridge, for instance, wrote: 'Absolute class by Chelsea players to donate such a large amount of money to Jota's family.'

A Liverpool supporter wrote: 'The gesture that Chelsea has showed for Diogo Jota is exceptional'.

In addition, another Liverpool fan wrote: 'That was class Chelsea! Lovely gesture towards Andre and Jota's family.

'Football should unite not divide'.

A Chelsea fan also commented, writing: 'My club, classy as always'.

Premier League clubs will pay tribute to Jota and Andre Silva on the opening weekend of the season.

A moment of silence will be held at all games, while players will wear black armbands and tributes will also be shown on screens at grounds.

Across his spells with Wolves and Liverpool, Jota made 190 appearances in the Premier League in total and scored 63 goals, while he provided 24 assists.

He was part of the Liverpool squad that won the league title last season.  

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk stated that togetherness between players and fans will be crucial as the club continue to mourn Jota.

‘It will be a very difficult season but we are all in this together,' said van Dijk. ‘As a team, fans, club, it was always going to be a tough season with everything that happened with Diogo over the summer, but the only way to overcome it is togetherness and the collective.'

Chelsea have made a stunning move to tie their leadership team to new long-term contracts following the club's remarkable success last season.

According to the Telegraph, the Blues have handed bumper six-year contract extensions to co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart as well as recruitment chiefs Joe Shields and Sam Jewell.

The new deals will run until 2031. It's a massive show of faith and confidence in the quartet's vision and the progress the club has made under their guidance.

Chelsea are using the same contract blueprint they apply to players and coaching staff.

The extended contracts are heavily performance-based, which aligns with the club's philosophy of rewarding success and results.

The quartet were initially tied to the club until 2028, but they now have a tenure that matches the length of deals often handed to the club's talented additions.

Since the arrival of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly in 2022, Chelsea have invested north of £2 billion in transfers, while recouping around £900 million through sales.

Winstanley and Stewart took up their co-sporting director roles in January 2023 and orchestrated a massive shift in the club's recruitment strategy alongside Shields.

The idea is to stockpile the most promising young talents around the world and tie them to long-term deals. They've also developed the academy and reshaped the women's team.

Jewell joined the bandwagon a year after Winstanley and Stewart, bringing his experience and expertise to the operation, which has become the envy of most Premier League clubs.

After a rocky start to life at Chelsea, the project has finally started delivering positive results.

Chelsea have parlayed their faith in a number of their leadership team by handing key members of the club hierarchy contract extensions. 

The Blues are experiencing an upswing in momentum after a positive end to the last Premier League season saw them finish fourth - and return to Champions League football after three terms - and secure the UEFA Conference League trophy. 

The west London side then jetted to the United States to play the Club World Cup in a continuation of their season, securing the revamped trophy and an enormous £84.4million prize pot with a thumping 3-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey last month.

Enzo Maresca has been hard at work reshaping the team to his preferred image in the transfer market, recruiting stars such as Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, and Jorrel Hato to join his revamped side. 

But the club have managed to secure critical outgoings too, with Armando Broja, Joao Felix, Noni Madueke, and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall among those to have moved on. 

Amid this purple patch, a number of Stamford Bridge's major deal-makers have been rewarded for the work they have carried out over the last few seasons.

Recruitment chiefs Sam Jewell (left) and Joe Shields have been at the fore of the west London side's dealmaking

Sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, and recruitment heads Joe Shields and Sam Jewell have all signed new agreements which are set to keep them in west London until at least 2031. 

The six-year extensions are thought to reflect their commitment to the club's mission and the new deals, as with their previous contracts, are believed to be filled with performance incentives as the Blues continue to chase down trophies following their period in the wilderness. 

Winstanley and Stewart's January 2023 start-date came relatively soon after the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital takeover in May of 2022, with Shields the first to join up with the new regime later than year. 

Jewell joined the club's leadership group in 2024, and under the aegis of the four men, the club's new strategy of sustainability in recruitment and development is now in full effect. 

As per Telegraph Sport, since the summer of 2022, Chelsea have spent a staggering £2billion, but around £800-900m has been earned in player sales in the opposite direction. 

Standout signings spearheaded by the Blues' leadership team have included Cole Palmer, Moises Caicedo, and Enzo Fernandez, as well as women's team manager Sonia Bompastor, and Enzo Maresca. 

Chelsea have carved out a reputation for handing players bumper multi-year deals, and another cornerstone of the strategy that the leadership team have created is centred around the 'three pillars' of quality, mentality, and playing experience. 

Although the Blues got their hands on the Club World Cup this summer the hierarchy is hungry for more success

Bringing important figures such as Enzo Maresca and Cole Palmer to Stamford Bridge has been a key part of their new strategy

The Blues have been a markedly young side for a number of seasons, with Tosin Adarabioyo the proverbial veteran in the squad at the age of just 27.

However, a number of younger stars like Palmer have now accrued vital Premier League experience, helping fuel Chelsea's belief in signing emerging talents. 

Among those to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer is teenager Estevao Willian, who was signed for the club last summer, but played his final at Brazilian side Palmeiras before joining up with Chelsea after his 18th birthday.  

Maresca's side will be keen to back up a strong - if shortened - pre-season in their opening match of the season on Sunday, against Community Shield winners Crystal Palace.

Chelsea will use a portion of Club World Cup bonuses paid to players to make a financial donation to the family of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva.

The west London club were crowned champions of FIFA's newly-expanded tournament in July, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Their success in the tournament earned the club an estimated $114.6million (£84.4m).

Chelsea have subsequently allocated a $15.5m (£11.4m) fund to be distributed equally between the players who represented Enzo Maresca's side during the tournament, with a decision made jointly between club and players that an equal payment will also be made to Jota's family.

The overall value of each portion tallies more than $500k before it's subjected to currency conversion costs from US dollars into UK pound sterling, alongside relevant employer costs, taxes and social security costs.

Liverpool forward Jota and his brother Andre Silva, a footballer at Portuguese club Penafiel, both died in a car accident in the Spanish province of Zamora on July 3, 10 days prior to Chelsea's Club World Cup final victory.

Liverpool recently unveiled plans for a memorial sculpture at their Anfield stadium as the focal point for a permanent tribute to Jota, who scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club.

The club's players will wear a ‘Forever 20' emblem on their shirts and stadium jackets for the duration of the 2025-26 season while the LFC Foundation, the club's official charity, will launch a grassroots football programme in the Portugal international's name.

A special fan mosaic and a minute's silence is planned for Arne Slot's side's first game of the Premier League season against Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday.

Liverpool announced last month that they were permanently retiring the No. 20 shirt at all levels of the club in memory of Jota, who joined the club from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020.

Sports streamer relied on MediaKind's MK/IO platform for the tournament

DENVER, Colo.—Sports entertainment platform DAZN relied on the MediaKind MK.IO elastic, cloud-native streaming platform to support high-quality streaming of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, which concluded last month.

DAZN held the exclusive global broadcast rights to the inaugural tournament, which featured 32 of the world's top soccer clubs competing in 63 matches across 12 stadiums in the U.S. and was streamed live to hundreds of millions of viewers in more than 200 markets.

The tournament was the first major live sporting event DAZN streamed with its newly deployed, multiregion MK.IO service from MediaKind.

MediaKind was DAZN's exclusive cloud-based live event delivery partner on Azure. With its API-first design, real-time adaptability and cloud elasticity, MK.IO enabled DAZN to deliver consistently low-latency, broadcast-quality video at scale, regardless of geography, platform or device, the company said.

“Broadcasting the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 to soccer fans around the world requires reliability and agility,” James Pearce, senior vice president of broadcast and streaming at DAZN, said. “MK.IO supported DAZN in scaling effortlessly, adapting in real time and delivering a seamless streaming experience. The service simplified our operations and helped us make world-class soccer more accessible than ever across all devices to fans worldwide with complete confidence.”

MK.IO allowed DAZN to orchestrate end-to-end video workflows from ingest to playback while dynamically scaling in response to match schedules and peak global demand. The upgrade to MK.IO has assisted DAZN's growth and unified operations and delivery on a scalable, resilient and cloud-agnostic service.

In addition to supporting the tournament, DAZN has also selected MediaKind's cloud-connected technology as the sole solution for its 24/7 linear channel processing. The initial deployment supports 40 channels and runs on-prem on DAZN's own infrastructure, with additional scaling planned, it said.

Chelsea are set to donate funds earned from the recent FIFA Club World Cup to the family of late Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, it has emerged.

Both players tragically died early last month in a car accident in northern Spain, with tributes continuing across England when the new Premier League season opens this weekend.

Liverpool have already vowed to support the family, intending to pay out the remaining two years on Jota's contract. It is also thought that the club will cover education costs for each of his three young children over the coming years as a further gesture.

But the Reds are not alone in pledging their financial assistance. Chelsea are reported by The Athletic to be planning on making a donation to the family, paid out of Club World Cup prize money.

While the $114.6 million (£84.4 million) windfall from winning the tournament is paid to the club, Chelsea have set aside £11.4 million for equally distributed player bonuses. A Jota donation will come from that pot, agreed between the club and players that it will be an equal share.

It is thought that could be a pre-tax amount in excess of $500,000 (£367,953).

At Premier League games played from Friday night—when Liverpool begin the defence on their title against Bournemouth—through to Sunday afternoon, a moment of silence will be observed in memory and tribute to the brothers. Teams will wear black armbands and messages and images will be displayed on screens inside stadiums. In addition to Liverpool, Jota's former club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, have planned their own special tributes, including a tifo at Molineux.

Chelsea players have decided to donate a portion of their Club World Cup bonuses to the family of Diogo Jota and André Silva, according to The Athletic.

Jota and Silva were killed in a July car crash in Spain.

The decision, made jointly between the players and the club, will see a $15.5 million fund distributed equally among the players, with an equal payment made to Jota's family. According to The Athletic, ""the overall value of each portion tallies more than $500k before it's subjected to currency conversion costs from US dollars into UK pound sterling, alongside relevant employer costs, taxes and social security costs.""

Pedro Neto, who was teammates with Jota with Portugal and Wolverhampton Wanderers, signed with Chelsea in 2024.

Chelsea won the expanded FIFA tournament last month after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The team's run in the event brought in an estimated $114.6 million to the club.

The soccer world began paying tribute to the brothers following their tragic deaths in early July. Moments of silence were held at matches, including the Women's EUROs and Club World Cup.

Other tributes were seen at Oasis' first reunion concert in Wales and by players around the world performing Jota's video game celebration.

Ahead of Friday's Premier League opener against Bournemouth, Liverpool have announced It will dedicate the cover of its match-day program to Jota, who played 123 times for the club, and Silva. All players across the league will wear black arm bands this weekend and will take part in a moment of silence.

Jota will also be immortalized with a statue at Anfield, Liverpool's home ground, and players will wear a ""Forever 20"" emblem on their jerseys this season in reference to his number. The No. 20 has also been permanently retired by the club, the first time that honor has been bestowed on a former player in club history.

Jota's death led to a poignant moment of silence at the Club World Cup match between Fluminense and Al-Hilal last week, as Al-Hilal defenders Rúben Neves and João Cancelo — two of Jota's Portugal teammates — became emotional. The next day, Neves and Cancelo flew back to Portugal for Jota's funeral, in which Neves served as a pallbearer.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

DALLAS — Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux has traveled nearly 8,000 miles to Qatar this week for meetings ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, sources tell WFAA. 

The chief, who just completed his first 100 days in office, is speaking with Qatari security officials about security for the World Cup next year, the sources said. The Gulf state hosted the previous World Cup in 2022. 

A Dallas Police spokesperson declined to comment on the chief's calendar. WFAA has submitted a public records request for the information. 

The chief brought several other officers with him to Qatar for the meetings, the sources said. A Dallas City Hall source said FIFA paid for the trip. 

North Texas will host more matches in the 2026 World Cup than any other city, including a much-anticipated semi-final. The matches will be played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. 

An Arlington Police Spokesperson said no one from that department was traveling to Qatar this week. The spokesperson said the department sent a member of its event management team to the nation during the 2022 World Cup to ""learn more about security operations and to meet with FIFA officials.""

Chief Comeaux is overseas during a busy week at Dallas City Hall. On Tuesday, the city's Community Police Oversight Board met and debated its response to its June inquiry about DPD cooperation with federal immigration authorities. They decided to ask Comeaux to come to their September meeting to once again face questions. 

Dallas City Manager Kim Tolbert unveiled her budget Friday and proposed a 5.7% increase in funding for public safety -- the majority of which would flow to Comeaux's department. She held her first budget workshop with Council members on Tuesday. 

It is unclear when Comeaux is due to return to Dallas. ","{'href': 'https://www.wfaa.com', 'title': 'WFAA'}","soccer"

                        Argentina back-rower Marcos Kremer (inset) and the All Blacks performing the Haka.                    

Los Pumas back-row star Marcos Kremer has drawn a comparison between the All Blacks and Argentina's 2022 World Cup-winning football side ahead of this weekend's Rugby Championship clash between the nations in Cordoba.

The 28-year-old is among several players who will make their first Test appearances of the year after being included in Argentina's squad for this year's prestigious Southern Hemisphere tournament.

Kremer, who currently plies his trade with Top 14 outfit Clermont Auvergne, is set to return to Los Pumas‘ matchday squad in Saturday's clash with the All Blacks, whom he rates highly.

“What I admire about the All Blacks is their culture, their passion for rugby,” he told Reuters ahead of the eagerly anticipated encounter at the Estadio Mario Kempes.

“So, as Argentines, even if you're in better form than them, you'll always respect them because they're the All Blacks.

“It's like what any football team must go through with Argentina.

“It's going to be a great match. We're at home, with our people, in Cordoba, a place where rugby is a thing.

“I think right now it's going to come down to the final minutes with a small difference between the teams, depending on how things go and how each team's mindset and mentality work during the week.

“That's going to be the key.”

Rugby Championship preview: ‘Highly motivated' Argentina braced for tough campaign despite 2024 success

Kremer has been struggling with a knee injury since last year's Rugby Championship and is relishing the opportunity to return to the international arena.

“Playing in this jersey after not having played for two or three months, I don't think there's going to be much change,” he said.

Argentina head into their clash with the All Blacks after sealing a solid victory over Uruguay in their final mid-year Test, but prior to that, they suffered back-to-back losses on home soil against England.

However, they have been bolstered by the return of several stars, with Juan Cruz Mallía, Santiago Chocobares, Bautista Delguy, Mateo Carreras and Ignacio Ruiz joining Kremer as players who have been called up to head coach Felipe Contepomi's squad for the first time this year.

Meanwhile, Contepomi has also been boosted by the return of Tomas Albornoz, Gonzalo Garcia, Franco Molina and Joel Sclavi, who all started in Los Pumas' memorable 28-24 victory over the British & Irish Lions in June but were rested during the two-Test series with England in July.

In other news, Benjamín Grondona, Emiliano Boffelli and Thomas Gallo were not be considered due to injury.

“We have to go all out, put those nerves aside, and focus on playing rugby, which we know how to do. We have what it takes, we have the players,” added Kremer.

“We know that if the forwards are performing well, we have players at the back that will allow us to fly a little bit more, so we'll see on Saturday.

“In the meantime, we have to stay calm. There's work to do, so we have to fine-tune the details and be ready for the weekend.”

Drops Spring 2026

During the most recent Paris Fashion Week®, streetwear juggernaut BAPE® shared early-looks at some unreleased Adidas Originals collaborations. Although the project's sole proposal was a camouflage-covered Adistar HRMY, other products have surfaced via sample lookbook and internal launch descriptions—all prepped in anticipation of the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Complex has shared unauthorized photos of the latest linkup between BAPE® and the Three Stripes, a partnership that's been in motion for more than 20 years. The aforementioned Adistar HRMY running shoe dons the most eye-catching makeover of the newly-surfaced footwear trio, as Adidas Samba and Campus 00s offerings keep things understated in mostly ""Off White"" and ""Core Black"" looks, respectively. The chunky Campus silhouette features ""Gold Metallic"" details throughout the upper, which indulges in a football-reminiscent paneling. STA™ emblems take over sidewalls on both Originals styles.

Distinct from its expansive catalog of lifestyle collaborations, the Adistar project by BAPE® delves into the world of performance running. An unshakeable trend at the moment, running gear and its aesthetic has taken over inline and collaborative projects from some of the biggest sportswear brands. The special edition Adistar HRMY goes all-out with streetwear inspiration, donning a trefoil-modified ABC Camo in green across the upper. Shark-reminiscent teeth land throughout the sole unit, which features a REPETITOR cushioning solution and plastic plate wedged in-between.

In addition to limited edition footwear, BAPE® is expected to release a handful of different apparel items and accessories in celebration of the North America-hosted football tournament. Jerseys inspired by those worn by the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) and Japan National Football Team during the 1994 World Cup should be accompanied by lifestyle gear perfect for match day. The project is fitting given the '94 event was the last time FIFA's tournament was hosted in the U.S.

Enjoy early-looks at the Adidas-backed project by BAPE® ahead. All World Cup-inspired items should release via Adidas.com in the first-half of 2026.

Gianni Infantino wants you to be part of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America—just not on the payroll. The head of soccer's global governing body is looking for 65,000 volunteers to help run the biggest tournament in the sport, all without getting paid a dime.

The application process for the FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program is now open, and Infantino's message is simple: come work for the most profitable organization in global sport, get a free shirt, and call it an “experience of a lifetime.”

You don't need to have volunteer experience, but you must be 18 or older and legally allowed to work as a volunteer in one of the three host countries—the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Language skills are a plus:

If selected, you'll be invited to “Volunteer Team Tryouts” starting in October 2025, followed by training in March 2026.

FIFA says volunteers will support 23 different functional areas at stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels, and other key locations. In their words, volunteers are “the heart, soul, and smile” of the tournament—though it's worth noting they're also the unpaid labor force making sure operations run smoothly.

The logic is simple. Why pay for something when you can get it for free? The NFL does it for the Super Bowl, and FIFA takes the same playbook—staff the event with unpaid workers, give them a hat and a pat on the back, and call it a win-win. But when you're talking about an organization that pulled in billions in revenue from the last World Cup, the optics are… well, let's just say not great.

Infantino insists it's about pride, not paychecks. “Volunteers get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament, and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event,” he says.

That may all be true—but it's also true that FIFA gets world-class event staffing without opening the checkbook. And when the final whistle blows in 2026, it's the paid executives who will be counting the profits, not the volunteers who put in the hours.

The package will include access to the World Cup, English Premier League, UEFA Champions League, LaLiga, Liga MX, and NWSL.

US media giant Comcast, parent company of the Xfinity television platform and NBCU network, has launched a soccer-focused package for its customers as it prepares to air next year's men's FIFA World Cup national teams tournament.

The World Soccer Ticket offering, priced at $85 per month, includes almost 60 broadcast, cable news, and sports channels, along with a premium subscription to Comcast's Peacock streaming service – giving customers access to nearly every major club and international soccer competitions.


                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

Specifically, the base plan will include access to ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Telemundo, Univision, UniMas, ESPN, FS1, ESPN Deportes, Fox Deportes, Universo, and TUDN.

Comcast's access to Fox's channels comes via a broad carriage deal struck in 2020 that covers Fox's 28 local TV stations serving 11 markets, as well as the Fox Business and sports cable channels FS1, FS2, BTN, and Fox Deportes.

Jon Gieselman, Comcast's chief growth officer, has said: “Figuring out where to watch your favorite team or match is often a painful game of chance. Now, with World Soccer Ticket, there's no better way to watch the beautiful game than with Xfinity.

“It's easy, we did the work for our customers and pulled together the most coveted leagues and tournaments – from Premier League, La Liga, and Champions League to the World Cup – and put them in one place. We added some magic to the experience with innovations like Multiview, 4K, and Sports Zone, all easily accessible with one simple click or voice command.”

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

The offering comes as the US prepares to host the men's FIFA World Cup – alongside Canada and Mexico – with World Soccer Ticket set to provide access to every match of the tournament in English via Fox, and in Spanish via NBCUniversal's Telemundo, Universo, and Peacock.

As well as the World Cup, customers will gain access to live coverage of major soccer competitions, including England's Premier League, the pan-European UEFA Champions League, Spain's LaLiga, Mexico's Liga MX, women's soccer's NWSL, and the Concacaf Champions Cup tournament.

The package will also include coverage of other major sports leagues, including American football's NFL and basketball's NBA.

Customers can access the new package via Comcast's X1 set-top box and Xfinity Stream TV app on supported platforms, including Apple TV and iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Xumo streaming devices.

This scheme from Comcast has been unveiled just days after US media giants Disney and Fox announced an accord that will see them bundle their upcoming direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services together.

Both services will be bundled together for a monthly price of $39.99 (a $10 discount on the combined price of both services individually).

Both services will launch on August 21, with the bundle to go on sale on October 2.

The countdown has officially begun!

With 305 days to go until the start of the FIFA World Cup 2026™ in Miami, the Miami Organizing Committee has launched a truly local 305 campaign with a call to action for the city's creative community.

Versión en Español

To celebrate this milestone, the Organizing Committee is issuing an open call for South Florida creatives to help shape the city's World Cup identity. The campaign invites artists, writers, designers, and dreamers to submit a slogan that captures the essence of Miami: a unifying phrase that will be used in campaigns, content, media, and products.

“This campaign seeks to connect with our community in a way that reflects the spirit and diversity of Miami,” said Alina T. Hudak, executive director of the Miami Organizing Committee. “This is a unique opportunity for Miami's creatives to share their voice and be part of our city's global showcase.”

With seven FIFA World Cup™ matches scheduled for Miami Stadium, this moment marks the city's official countdown to welcoming the world to South Florida in 2025. It is also an opportunity for local voices to take center stage.

“We want the world to feel what we already know: that Miami is the global capital of passion, culture, and soccer,” said Janelle Prieto, Director of Marketing and Community for the Miami Host Committee. “What better way to do that than by asking those who live and breathe this city to help tell its story?”

The submission period is open now through August 30, 2025, and finalists will be recognized by the Host Committee and invited to help bring the campaign to life.

The 24-year-old reflects on a year in the States, why she played just seven days after the Euros final and how success has changed her outlook

For most England fans, Euro 2025 was a stressful watch. The Lionesses stared elimination in the face at various points in Switzerland, navigating three lots of extra time and two penalty shootouts before eventually defending their European title. Esme Morgan, though, was always calm. That's because she had a feeling it was going to be England's year – a feeling that has yet to let her down.

“Sometimes I get these gut feelings,” Morgan explains, speaking to GOAL while the triumph is still less than three weeks' old. “Whenever I feel that we're going to win, it's never before been wrong.” It came to her before the quarter-final victory over Sweden, in which Morgan was a vital sub as England turned around a 2-0 deficit, and again prior to the semi-final meeting with Italy, where she played a key role as a starter. Then, after learning that it would be Spain in the final, it returned. ""I woke up that next morning and I just knew we were going to win,"" she recalls. ""So for the next three days, I was just telling all the girls, 'We're going to do it. I can feel it'. It's not something you can really explain. It's not something tangible; it's just a sense. So I never really reached the point of panic in any of those games. I just maintained the belief and stayed calm all through it.”

Whether due to Morgan's prophetic predictions – which star winger Lauren Hemp became particularly “dependent” on – or not, the entire England team was clearly possessed by the same tranquillity, something which undoubtedly played a big role in the remarkable escapology Sarina Wiegman's side were able to perform on their way to a second successive continental crown.

For most individuals in the Lionesses' squad, it was a perfect way for their 2024-25 season to end. For the likes of Hannah Hampton and Lucy Bronze, it came after a treble-winning campaign with Chelsea, while it was a second European title of the summer for Arsenal stars such as Alessia Russo and Leah Williamson, who helped the Gunners beat Barcelona in the Champions League final just two months prior.

Morgan, though, plies her trade in the United States, where her season with the Washington Spirit began in March and will end in November – and, as her return to action at club level just seven days after the European Championship final shows, success with England has only made the 24-year-old more determined to end the year on a high, by winning the NWSL Championship.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

ATP world number one Jannik Sinner might be set to miss out on a big financial boost, as a combination of his doping suspension from earlier in the 2025 season combined with a couple of key tournament misses meaning he will now likely be ineligible to receive a cut of a massive 15.5 million pound Bonus Pool on offer for the men's tennis stars.

As per a new ATP initiative that began in 2023, the thirty men's players who score the most points in the tour's Masters 1000 series are eligible to receive a portion of a 15.5 million pound prize pool. However, with only 9 of these events across a calendar year, participation and involvement in as many of these tournaments as possible is essential.

Sinner sits all the way down in 16th in the rankings, having missed five of the tournaments so far, with the seventh tournament currently ongoing at the Cincinnati Masters. Thus far this season, Sinner has only participated at his home tournament at the Rome Masters, where he reached the final, and now in Ohio.

However, matters get bad to worse for Sinner: to ensure participation of the top names, the ATP has ensured that players who miss four of the mandatory events in the Masters Series are ineligible for the bonus pool. Sinner, having missed the Masters events in Miami, Indian Wells, Madrid, and now most recently in Toronto, will therefore be out of the running for the bonus prize pool.

The first three tournaments in that list took place during Sinner's high-profile suspension from tennis, in which he missed no grand slams but did miss a string of important tournaments. Most recently, a pair of long tournaments at the French Open and his title-winning bid in Wimbledon forced Sinner to withdraw from the Rogers Cup in Toronto, marking it as his fourth missed mandatory event.

He also missed the Monte Carlo Masters, although that event is not classified as mandatory due to its smaller draw size. Sinner was the winner of the Bonus Pool's top spot after his unprecedented 2024 campaign, but will be out of the running for this year's award.

At the moment, Carlos Alcaraz has a comfortable 500-point lead in first place in the Bonus Pool standings, ahead of Brit Jack Draper and Italian Lorenzo Musetti.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Two men's quarterfinals will be played on Thursday at the ATP 1000 event in Cincinnati, with just over a week remaining before the start of the US Open. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner will look to snap a losing run against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime, while Holger Rune will have to face Terence Atmane, who has broken through on the ATP Tour this week. LWOT previews the two matches below.

Head-to-head: First meeting

It's been a dream week for Atmane, which peaked Wednesday after the Frenchman stunned Taylor Fritz 3-6 7-5 6-3 for his first Top 10 win. Atmane is a qualifier at this tournament, and he will debut in the Top 100 as a result. Rune is defending semifinalist points at this event, and he's been steady this tournament with three straight-set wins. The latest win, in the third round over Frances Tiafoe, was courtesy of a retirement from the American.

The Dane might be a little more refreshed and should ultimately be the favorite. Neither players have been able to make a ton of first serves in their previous matches, hovering around 50-60%, so that shot will be critical. Rune has the tendency to break down physically in hot conditions, but he hasn't played a ton of matches, and it may be tough for Atmane to back up a big win. Expect a tough two-setter, though Atmane can cause the upset if he can extend the rallies.
Prediction: Rune in 2

Head-to-head: Auger Aliassime 2-0

Auger-Aliassime could use a big tournament result in Cincinnati, and it's already been a strong event for the Canadian should he lose in this stage. He's just inside the Top 30, and typically plays his best tennis on these types of hard courts. However, Sinner is on a nine-match winning streak, and he hasn't dropped a set here. The Italian was vulnerable at times in a 6-4 7-6(4) win over Adrian Mannarino in the fourth round, and Auger-Aliassime did defeat the Italian at this very event in 2022. Sinner's consistency has greatly improved since then, something that Auger-Aliassime still struggles with. Because of that, Sinner should be the strong favorite to get through this match, but I won't rule out a three-setter here.
Prediction: Sinner in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","The ATP player who won the same elite junior event as Roger Federer has been given a wildcard to play at the US Open","https://tennishead.net/the-atp-player-who-won-the-same-elite-junior-event-as-roger-federer-has-been-given-a-wildcard-to-play-at-the-us-open/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The US Open wildcards have been announced, and there is one particular name that has caught the eye.

Venus Williams, the five-time Wimbledon Ladies Singles champion, will continue her unbelievable comeback story at the US Open after competing at the Washington Open and Cincinnati Open.

The 45-year-old defeated compatriot Peyton Stearns in the first round of the Washington Open, while also picking up a victory alongside Hailey Baptiste in the Ladies Doubles competition.

Alongside Williams, a wealth of young talents have been handed a wildcard for the US Open singles tournaments, which are due to start on August 24.

One of these players has just cracked the ATP top 100 and previously emulated Roger Federer at the junior level.

Nishesh Basavareddy has enjoyed a breakout season on the ATP Tour.

While a junior player, the American won the prestigious under-14 boys singles competition at the Orange Bowl, emulating the achievements of Roger Federer, Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi, who all won the competition at various age brackets.

During his younger years, Basavareddy, who was born in Newport Beach, California, won the World Junior Team Finals in the Czech Republic while playing for the US under-14 team.

The 20-year-old, who was a blue-chip prospect while playing for Stanford University, has gone from strength to strength on the ATP Tour.

While currently ranked 109, the American star cracked the ATP top 100 in June, reaching a ranking of 99.

Basavareddy, who is coached by Bryan Smith and Nishanth Basavareddy, won his first ATP Tour match at the 2024 Next Gen Finals, defeating Shang Juncheng.

He then stunned Novak Djokovic in the first round of the 2025 Australian Open, snatching a set off the 24-time major winner before eventually losing in four sets.

Basavareddy, who has won two Challenger titles, has picked up four more ATP Tour main draw wins in 2025, defeating Francisco Comesana, Alejandro Tabilo, recent Canadian Open quarter-finalist Alex Michelsen and Aleksandar Vukic.

Most recently, Basavareddy lost to Alexander Zverev in the Cincinnati Open second round, after defeating Vukic in the first round.

The final Grand Slam of the calendar year is right around the corner. Some of the biggest and best tennis players from around the world will converge on New York with the hope of creating history.

US Open qualifying will run from August 18 to August 21. Therefore, the US Open men's and women's singles draws are expected to be announced on August 21.

Last year's winners, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, will be back at Flushing Meadows hoping to repeat their successes of 2024.

However, the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek may have a big role to play in determining this year's champions.

...

Terence Atmane was struggling in March.

His ranking had fallen to 180 as he failed to build momentum on tour. But after notching some results starting in April, he slowly began to climb.

On Aug. 13, he broke into the projected top 100 rankings after logging the biggest win of his young career, taking down ATP No. 4 Taylor Fritz to move on to the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Open.

Atmane, who entered the tournament as a qualifier, came back from a set down to take the match 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.

""That's a crazy win for my young career,"" Atmane said. ""So, definitely out of words right now. I was just believing in myself. I believed that I could beat Taylor Fritz tonight on Court 3, and this is what happened.""

Atmane, 23, has toppled Italian world No. 22 Flavio Cobolli and Brazilian ATP No. 52 Joao Fonseca after making it out of qualifiers en route to his best-ever ATP Masters 1,000 run.

Atmane had only won five tour-level matches before arriving in Mason, Ohio, but after beating Fritz, he has nine. He is projected to rise to No. 93 in the next ATP rankings.

Beating the American was the highest-ranked victory Atmane has ever claimed. For Fritz, on the other hand, losing to the Frenchman is his lowest-ranked defeat of the season.

Near the match's end, Atmane led 5-3, needing to hold his serve to secure the match. After double-faulting once, he won the game to take the set.

""I was just trying to forget the score, trying to forget the pressure, trying to forget a lot of things, and just trying to be myself, trying to be me,"" Atmane said. ""And I think that's what worked at the end of the day.""

Atmane said the rankings position and prize money will help him progress his career and invest in his team. He said the quick speed of the courts allowed him to hit winners across the court, propelling him to victory.

Next, the Frenchman will face ATP No. 9 Holger Rune as the last match on Center Court Aug. 13.

""This is just the beginning, and I need to work hard to stay consistent to rise in the rankings and keep going like this,"" Atmane said.

From career-defining victories to impossible mid-match turnarounds, these are the greatest comebacks that have captivated the world of tennis.

by Alejandra Razo

Tennis is a sport of resilience, where a match can turn on a single point. But some comebacks transcend the game itself, becoming legendary tales of determination and mental fortitude. These are the moments when players defied all odds, battled back from seemingly insurmountable deficits, and etched their names into the annals of tennis history. 

From incredible tournament runs to miraculous mid-match victories, here are the 10 most memorable comebacks in tennis history.

Goran Ivanišević's 2001 Wimbledon victory is the ultimate underdog story. Ranked 125th in the world and struggling with injuries, the Croatian received a wildcard entry. He had lost in the Wimbledon final three times before, but in 2001, he battled through a rain-delayed semifinal and then won an epic five-set final against Pat Rafter to become the first and only wildcard to ever win the prestigious title.

Andre Agassi's 1999 French Open win was the culmination of an incredible career resurgence. After falling to No. 140 in the world in 1997, Agassi fought his way back. In the final, he was down two sets to love against Andrei Medvedev but staged a heroic comeback to win in five sets. This victory not only completed his career Grand Slam but also cemented his legacy as one of the game's greatest fighters.

Rafael Nadal's 2022 Australian Open triumph was a comeback for the ages. At 35 years old, and fresh off a foot injury that had threatened his career, Nadal was down two sets and a break in the final against Daniil Medvedev. He found another gear, battling for over five hours to win an astonishing five-set match and secure a men's record 21st Grand Slam title.

Ivan Lendl's comeback in the 1984 French Open final against John McEnroe is a classic. McEnroe was a heavy favorite, having not lost a match all year and winning the first two sets easily. But Lendl, a relentless competitor, refused to give in. He turned the match around with his powerful baseline game, ultimately winning in five sets to claim his first Grand Slam title and set the stage for a legendary career.

Jennifer Capriati's journey was a powerful story of redemption. After a tumultuous career, she returned to the top of the sport. In the 2002 Australian Open final against Martina Hingis, Capriati was down 6-4, 4-0 and facing four match points in scorching heat. She saved them all, enduring cramps and exhaustion to win the second set in a tiebreak and dominate the third, completing a miraculous and emotionally charged victory.

The 2012 Australian Open final was an epic battle of attrition between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. After nearly six grueling hours of play, Djokovic emerged victorious in a match that is considered one of the greatest finals in tennis history. He came back from a break down in the fifth set, showcasing his incredible fitness and mental toughness to win his third Australian Open title.

Mary Joe Fernández's comeback in the 1993 French Open quarterfinal against Gabriela Sabatini is legendary. Fernández was down 1-6, 1-5 and facing five match points before mounting a dramatic turnaround. She saved every match point and went on to win the three-hour, 36-minute marathon match, a testament to her fighting spirit on the clay courts of Paris.

At 41 years old, Pancho Gonzales defied his age in a first-round match at Wimbledon in 1969. He was down two sets to love and saved seven match points against his 23-year-old opponent, Charlie Pasarell. The match, which lasted over five hours and was played over two days, is one of the most famous in the tournament's history and is a powerful symbol of his sheer will to win.

Thomas Muster's career comeback is one of the most inspiring in sports. After being hit by a drunk driver and suffering a serious knee injury in 1989, many believed his career was over. But he trained tirelessly, even hitting balls while sitting in a chair with his leg in a cast. Six years later, in 1995, he reached the pinnacle of his career, winning the French Open and becoming one of the most dominant clay-court players of his generation.

In 2017, Serena Williams won the Australian Open in a remarkable comeback from her own personal challenges. She was pregnant at the time, yet she dominated the tournament without dropping a set, defeating her sister Venus in the final. This victory marked her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, breaking the Open Era record and demonstrating her unparalleled greatness and resilience.

Chelmsford's Kamran Arif and Kai Seed were over-the-moon to lift silverware on the manicured lawns of Wimbledon last week in what was an unforgettable experience at SW19. 

Arif and Seed, 14, who both attend King Edwards Grammar School and live in Chelmsford, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Arif, who described Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz as his tennis idols, soared to victory in the boys' U18 doubles finals alongside close friend and schoolmate Seed and revealed it was an experience he will never forget.

He said: ""I was just quite happy to be here so it feels really special to win.

""There is no one I would rather win with here than Kai. We are both quite relaxed and it's always better playing with someone you know.

Seed added: ""It was a really good atmosphere and it's really busy which makes you a little bit nervous but apart from that it's good.

""It's really good to be here and to win with someone like Kam because he is so good.

""I'm really happy to get the overall prize.

""I came last year for a school trip and a few years ago with my family.

""It was never really a big dream of mine but I used to want to be a professional tennis player. I really hope it can help with my composure and learning how to handle pressure in everyday situations.""

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Arif representing Hampton Sports and Leisure Tennis Club.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett OBE and Gordon Reid OBE were in attendance to cheer on the players at SW19 and offer their experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing,” said Hewett.

“Play Your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while. 

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

Thursday features fourth round singles action, as well as the beginning of the quarterfinals in men's singles.

In the championship match of last year's Wimbledon, Barbora Krejcikova defeated Jasmine Paolini 6-4 in the third to claim her second Major singles title.  On Thursday, we get the rematch, and Paolini gets a chance to avenge that heartbreaking loss.

Also on Thursday, two of the ATP's strongest hitters collide in a fourth round contest, as recent Toronto champion Ben Shelton takes on Jiri Lehecka.

Plus, multi-time Major champs Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff will both be in action.

Throughout the tournament, this preview will analyze the day's two most prominent matches, while highlighting the other notable matches on the schedule.  Thursday's play gets underway at 11:00am local time.



Jasmine Paolini (7) vs. Barbora Krejcikova – Not Before 1:00pm on Center Court

Paolini has not dropped a set through two rounds, despite arriving in Cincy having lost three of her last four matches.  And three of the four sets she's contested have been decided by tiebreaks, so she's playing her best at crucial moments.  Jasmine owns 30 wins this season, as she now vies for her second Cincinnati quarterfinal within the last three years.

By contrast, Krejcikova has already contested a trio of three-setters this past week, which includes a notable win over Elina Svitolina.  The start of her season was delayed until mid-May due to injury, so she's only 8-5 on the year.  Like Jasmine, Barbora has previously achieved one quarterfinal in Cincinnati, back in 2021.

The Wimbledon final is their only prior encounter, outside of a qualifying match seven years ago at the Australian Open, which also went Krejcikova's way.  But as per Tennis Abstract, Barbora has only faced one top 10 player this year, and lost to them, so she is not accustomed to opposition of this magnitude at this time.  I favor the more match-tough Paolini to get some revenge from last year's Wimbledon, and advance to her second Cincinnati quarterfinal.

Ben Shelton (5) vs. Jiri Lehecka (22) – Not Before 4:30pm on Grandstand

This is the lone fourth round match yet to be played in the men's singles draw.  Shelton is now 34-16 during 2025, and is currently on an eight-match winning streak.  His title run last week in Canada included victories over four top 20 players (Cobolli, de Minaur, Fritz, Khachanov), to earn the biggest title of his career.  And he hasn't lost a set through two rounds in Cincy, where he was a quarterfinalist a year ago.

Lehecka is 30-16 on the season, but the majority of his wins have come at lower-level events.  Even with his two victories this week, he's just 5-6 this year at Masters level, and just 6-3 at Majors.  The now-23-year-old was a semifinalist last year on the clay of Madrid, yet hasn't advanced beyond this round at a Masters tournament since that run.

Their only previous meeting occurred two months ago on grass in Stuttgart, where Shelton was victorious 6-4, 6-4.  On a similarly-fast surface in Cincinnati, and in his home country, I like a confident Ben to prevail again on Thursday.  In a matchup where both possess similar styles, confidence and home court advantage will be crucial differences.



Other Notable Matches on Thursday:

Lucia Bronzetti vs. Coco Gauff (2) – Gauff received a walkover in the last round from Dayana Yastremska due to illness.  Bronzetti is another woman to already survive three third-sets, and has upset two seeds (Kasatkina, Ostapenko) to equal her best-ever result at a WTA 1000 event.  Coco is 2-0 against Lucia, with two straight-set victories.

Jannik Sinner (1) vs. Felix Auger-Aliassime (23) – Sinner is now on a 24-match winning streak on hard courts, after a straight-set triumph on Wednesday against Adrian Mannarino.  He's actually 0-2 against Auger-Aliassime, though they haven't played since this same event three years ago, and both are very different players in 2025.  Felix hasn't lost a set to this stage, yet this is the farthest he's been at a Masters 1000 tournament in over a year.

Tennis legend Venus Williams is the latest figure to join Barbie's Inspiring Women collection, with a new doll celebrating her 2007 Wimbledon victory and fight for equal prize money.

Launched in 2018, Barbie's Inspiring Women series pays tribute to historical figures who have made extraordinary contributions to society. 

Spanning aviation, civil rights, science, sport and the arts, it has honoured icons including aviator Amelia Earhart, civil rights leader Rosa Parks, NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, tennis champion Billie Jean King and artist Frida Kahlo, with each celebrated with a doll capturing their achievements and lasting legacy.

Williams' doll, which goes on sale on Friday for a suggested retail price of $38 (£30), recreates the outfit she wore when she lifted her fourth consecutive Wimbledon trophy — and fifth Grand Slam title — in 2007.

That year proved to be a turning point in tennis history. Her victory marked the first time a female player at Wimbledon received the same prize money as her male counterpart, following her outspoken advocacy for pay equality. Just months earlier, the All England Club had agreed to award equal purses in all events, ending decades of disparity.

Mattel's tribute shows the 44-year-old in classic Wimbledon white, complete with a green gem necklace, white wristband, tennis racket and ball. The design captures her powerful yet poised on-court presence, reflecting both her sporting achievements and influence beyond the baseline.

Williams said she was “honoured” to join the Inspiring Women line, which spotlights figures who have made lasting contributions to society. “To be recognised in this way, alongside women I've long admired, is truly humbling,” she added.

This isn't her first Barbie. In May 2024, she was one of nine pioneering female athletes — including gymnast Rebeca Andrade and boxer Estelle Mossely — celebrated with dolls for Barbie's 65th anniversary. That collection honoured women who have “broken boundaries and inspired the next generation to believe they can be anything.”

Over nearly three decades, Williams has helped transform women's tennis, while also building a reputation off court as a leading advocate for gender equality, a successful entrepreneur and a role model for aspiring athletes worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Alfie Hewett pinpoints what went wrong at Wimbledon ahead of US Open hat-trick bid","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/alfie-hewett-pinpoints-what-went-35733408","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:27:00 GMT","

Alfie Hewett insists he has all eyes on remedying his Wimbledon mistakes as he bids to clinch a consecutive hat-trick of US Open crowns.

The Norfolk wheelchair star, 27, grabbed New York glory in both 2022 and 2023 and following a break in the calendar last season due to the Paris 2024 Paralympics, returns to Flushing Meadows with a thrilling three-peat on the cards.

Hewett won a career 10th Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in January, adding doubles victory alongside long-time partner on the court Gordon Reid in both Melbourne and at Roland Garros.

Now, coming off the back of defeats in the men's wheelchair singles and doubles finals at his home Slam at Wimbledon, Hewett admits that he is ready to get back to winning ways on the other side of the Atlantic.

""I think I've moved on [from Wimbledon],"" he said. ""There is always a tournament round the corner and so my attention is now on the US Open.

""My Wimbledon memories are still good, we would have liked to get the trophy but we've analysed the performance and we will work on those reasons moving forward.

""Being a Brit at Wimbledon is always the pinnacle of the calendar for us anyway. Whenever I turn up to a tournament, I want to do the best I can in both singles and doubles.

""We are all very highly motivated at the moment and [the US Open] is the final major pillar of the year so we want to do well there.""

Hewett and Reid were in attendance at the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition, Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, last week.

The duo were there to cheer on the youngsters at SW19 and offer experience and advice, and Hewett noted the importance of the event in providing inspirational opportunities within grassroots tennis across the UK.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

""For wheelchair players, there is not a lot of opportunity to play on the grass until you get to the higher levels so to play at Wimbledon is such a good eye opening experience.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while. It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.""

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

A 13-year-old from Poole enjoyed an ""unforgettable experience"" at Wimbledon.

Kensi White, a pupil at Lytchett Minster School, competed in the national finals of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon event.

She was among thousands of players who participated in the qualifying stages this year.

This led to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners moving on to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts.

Although White did not progress to the latter stages of the tournament, she was thrilled to attend Wimbledon.

She said: ""I'm just happy to be here and I've worked very hard to get here.

""I know my family are very happy and excited.

""I would like to come back to Wimbledon.

""I watched Ons Jabeur and Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court here a few years ago and that was really cool.

""This year we got ground passes, and we got to see Grace Watson.""

The tournament, powered by Vodafone, provided more than 10,000 playing opportunities this year.

Thousands of singles and doubles players participated across 800 venues, culminating in the national finals at the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from Sunday, August 3 to Saturday, August 9.

The competition aims to inspire people of all ages and abilities by providing the chance to play at Wimbledon.

Categories include 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles, adult doubles, wheelchair competitions and learning disability and visually impaired competitions.

World number one wheelchair doubles partners Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid attended the event to support the players.

Hewett said: ""We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing.

""Play Your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.""

Reid added: ""We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

Former semi-finalist Matteo Berrettini will not compete at the upcoming US Open. The Italian has not played since falling to Kamil Majchrzak in the Wimbledon first round. He skipped Toronto and Cincinnati, hoping to recover in time for the season's last Major.

However, Matteo lost the battle against time and withdrew from the US Open. Thus, he will miss the main draw action in New York for the first time since 2017 when he fell to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second qualifying round.

The Italian enjoyed a great streak at Majors in 2021 and 2022, reaching four consecutive quarter-finals and challenging Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final. Since Roland Garros 2022, Matteo has withdrawn from seven Major events, struggling to remain injury-free.

Matteo Berrettini firing 🚀's out there! @Heineken_US Serve of the Day | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/pJCheaMATz

Berrettini was the US Open semi-finalist six years ago, besting five rivals before falling to an eventual champion, Rafael Nadal, in straight sets after a solid resistance.

He was the quarter-finalist in 2021 and 2022, suffering losses to Novak Djokovic and Casper Ruud. Matteo experienced early losses in New York in the previous two years to Arthur Rinderknech and Taylor Fritz.

Former world no. 6 is 13-11 in 2025. He was the quarter-finalist in Doha, Dubai and Miami, including a memorable win over Novak Djokovic. The Italian experienced a massive setback at home at Foro Italico.

He trailed 7-5, 2-0 against Casper Ruud before retiring due to abdominal issues, leaving the court devastated following another setback. Berrettini felt pain in his abdominal muscles ahead of the match.

Still, he decided to step onto the court and battle in front of the home fans. He fought well in the opener before feeling discomfort in the closing stages. Ruud broke him a couple of times, and the home player decided to end his misery and retire.

Matteo withdrew from Roland Garros and his tournaments on beloved grass in Stuttgart and Queen;s. Former Major finalist returned to action at Wimbledon and lost to Kamil Majchrzak in five sets. 

It remains Berrettini's most recent match, as he withdrew from Toronto, Cincinnati and the US Open. Injury-prone player will try to recover for the closing stages of the season and gain at least some boost.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","The son of a two-time Grand Slam champion has just received a wildcard for the US Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/the-son-of-a-two-time-grand-slam-champion-has-just-received-a-wildcard-for-the-us-open/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

The US Open has announced their wildcards for the 2025 tournament that includes the offspring of a former champion.

Venus Williams is one of the US Open wildcards, as she continues her comeback to tennis at 45 years old.

There are also some notable omissions, with former US Open champion Stan Wawrinka missing from the list.

While this other ATP player has not created many headlines with his announcement of his wildcard, he is actually the son of a former two-time US Open champion.

That player is Brandon Holt, who is actually the son of former world number one and two-time US Open champion Tracy Austin.

Austin won the US Open in 1979 and 1981, with both title victories coming when she was just a teenager.

These days Austin voices her opinion on tennis as a pundit and commentator, but she will have a more personal interest in the US Open this year.

Her 27-year-old son, Brandon Holt, is a professional tennis player and is currently the world number 106.

It has been a breakthrough season so far for Holt, who began the 2025 season ranked outside the top 200.

Holt has won two ATP Challenger titles this year, and actually broke inside the top 100 for the first time in June.

As a result, he has been awarded a wildcard for the men's singles draw alongside Nishesh Basavareddy, Darwin Blanch, Tristan Boyer, Stefan Dostanic, Emilio Nava, Valentin Royer and Tristan Schoolkate.

In reaction to the announcement, Holt wrote on Instagram, “Thank you @usta let's go @usopen.”

While this is a big moment for Holt, it will actually not be his first appearance in the main draw of the US Open.

Holt made his first appearance at the US Open in 2022 after coming through qualifying.

The Californian made full use of his Grand Slam main draw debut, with Holt stunning his compatriot Taylor Fritz in the first round.

Despite having a US Open champion mother, it appears that Holt is no different to most sons, as he revealed after his win over Fritz that he could not really remember what Austin told him before the match.

“Apparently not because I don't remember what she told me,” Holt said in his press conference after beating Fritz. “I don't know what she said. Probably just go have fun. I don't know. The same stuff. Enjoy it.

“And I did. I found myself in some difficult situations, maybe I didn't play quite as well as I could have in certain times, but then I played very well in other times.

“Yeah, that's tennis. Things are going to be up and down. Sometimes it was down, sometimes it was up. At the end of the day it fell my way so I couldn't be happier.”

Holt would lose his subsequent match in five sets to Pedro Cachin, and has not returned to the main draw of the US Open since.

It has now been confirmed that he will be at the New York major again, but Holt still could actually receive direct entry as he is the first alternate which would free up a wildcard for someone else.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

While his main rivals are chasing the Cincinnati Masters crown, Novak Djokovic is training in Montenegro. The 24-time Major winner took an extended break following the Wimbledon semi-final loss.

The veteran enjoyed with his family in Croatia, Montenegro and Greece, withdrawing from Toronto and Cincinnati and taking time off the court to recharge batteries.

Novak will seek his 25th Major crown at the US Open. If he manages to achieve that, he will write another page of tennis history, as no one has done that in his style!

The four-time champion will travel to New York without playing a single match on North American hard courts this summer. It's a risky move that puts him in a unique position historically.

Since the US Open switched to hard courts in 1978, no player has managed to go all the way in New York without playing at least one tune-up event in hard in July or August.

The smallest lead-in came in 2020, when Dominic Thiem played one match before capturing his lone Major title in a thrilling final over Alexander Zverev. However, it was a pandemic year and not a perfect example.

John McEnroe struggled in the pre-US Open events in 1980, playing only three matches in Toronto and Atlanta before conquering the home Major over Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg!

Andy Murray clinched his only US Open crown in 2012. The Briton claimed the Olympic Games gold medal at home at Wimbledon and enjoyed the moment without pushing too hard in Toronto and Cincinnati.

Murray withdrew from Toronto after one match and fell to Jeremy Chardy in Cincinnati. However, he saved his best tennis for the US Open, prevailing over Novak Djokovic in the final for his first Major crown.

Like Murray, Carlos Alcaraz lifted his first Major title at the US Open in 2022 after a short tun-up process. The young Spaniard fell to Tommy Paul in Montreal before losing to Cameron Norrie in Cincinnati.

However, those four matches were enough for a teenager to gain a boost and compete at his best in New York. Carlos prevailed over Marin Cilic, Jannik Sinner, Frances Tiafoe and Casper Ruud en route to his first magical moment.

Now, Novak Djokovic will seek the US Open glory after skipping all the lead-up events. If anyone can accomplish that, it's Novak! He has already made a career of defying odds and rewriting record books.

Aryna Sabalenka has been asked about her US Open mixed doubles participation now that her partner has pulled out.

Sabalenka will be one of the US Open favourites this year as the defending champion and the world number one.

However, she was also supposed to play in the revamped mixed doubles event alongside Grigor Dimitrov, who has since withdrawn due to injury.

There had been some suggestions of ATP players who Sabalenka should have as a new partner, and she has now confirmed where she stands on the event.

After beating Jessica Bouzas Maneiro to continue her title defence at the Cincinnati Open, Sabalenka was asked about the mixed doubles event.

Sabalenka has now suggested that playing mixed doubles at the US Open this year is no longer on her radar, as she would rather stay loyal to her original partnership with Dimitrov.

When speaking to press, Sabalenka did reveal that she has received requests from other players, but will likely be turning them down.

The Belarusian said, “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.”

New:WTA #1 Aryna Sabalenka says she does not plan on playing US Open mixed doubles with a new partner after her original partner Grigor Dimitrov pulled out, mentioning being “loyal” to Dimitrov.“Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.”

With Sabalenka one of the players expected to go deep at the Cincinnati Open, this could be just the start of a problem for the US Open mixed doubles event.

As she looks to turn her attention back to the Cincinnati Open singles tournament, Sabalenka will now face a challenging quarterfinal test in former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.

Sabalenka and Rybakina are very familiar with one another, as they have played 11 times before, including a Grand Slam final at the 2023 Australian Open.

Although it is Sabalenka who leads the head-to-head, they have equally split their eight previous meetings on hard courts.

Sabalenka beat Rybakina the last time they played at the Berlin Tennis Open on grass, but she had to save four match points to do so.

Their quarterfinal match at the Cincinnati Open will take place on Friday, August 15.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

 Frances Tiafoe suffered a setback to his U.S. hard-court summer on Wednesday at the Cincinnati Open. The home favourite was forced to retire from his fourth-round match at the ATP Masters 1000 event against Holger Rune due to a lower back injury. 

 The 10th-seeded Tiafoe at one point led 3-0 in his third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Rune, but after relinquishing that lead he received treatment on his lower back at 4-5. With Tiafoe unable to serve at full pace, Rune had moved into a 6-4, 3-1 lead when the American retired. 

Get well soon Frances 🙏@holgerrune2003 is through to the quarter-finals as Tiafoe retires due to injury.

Final score: 6-4 3-1 RET.@CincyTennis | #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/cKVtZEXBSa

 Tiafoe, who reached his maiden Masters 1000 championship match in Cincinnati a year ago, will hope to recover quickly before heading to New York for his home Grand Slam at the US Open. The 27-year-old is a two-time semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows, including last year when he fell to his countryman Taylor Fritz. 

 The No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rune stepped on court Wednesday hoping to avenge his 2024 semi-final defeat to Tiafoe. The Dane will take on French qualifier Terence Atmane in the quarter-finals this year. 

 “From 4-4, when I got the break and at 5-4 when he had the medical timeout, that's when I felt something was not right with him and after obviously, I could see he was struggling a little bit,” said Rune. “As the game is, I tried to move him as much as possible. It's never nice to finish a match like this and I wish him the best recovery.”

The 23-year-old left-hander Atmane served 13 aces and won 82 per cent of first-serve points as he stunned fourth seed and 2024 US Open finalist Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. Atmane, who took out Joao Fonseca in the third round, converted three of six break points against Fritz, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

World No. 136 Atmane is the first qualifier to advance to an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final since Max Purcell at 2023 Cincinnati (also Mannarino) and lowest-ranked Cincinnati quarter-finalist since No. 152 Coric won the 2022 title. Up to No. 93 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Atmane will make his debut in the Top 100 at the end of the tournament.

Damir Dzumhur turned a moment of potential chaos into pure highlight-reel magic at last month's Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, claiming July's Hot Shot of the Month award in spectacular style.

In his quarter-final clash against Titouan Droguet, the Bosnian star found himself in a split-second scramble at the net. After carving a delicate backhand slice, Dzumhur watched as Droguet unleashed a daring ‘tweener from deep in the court, which kissed the net cord and sharply changed direction. But with incredible reflexes and a lightning grip adjustment, Dzumhur pounced and landed a clean winner.

Dzumhur deals with 'tweener trouble in style: 

The rally was classic Dzumhur, who is known for blending speed, anticipation, and court craft into moments that leave fans gasping. The No. 56 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has built a reputation for thriving in cat-and-mouse points, where quick thinking is just as important as quick feet.

ATP has announced a record $18.3 million to be distributed to players through profit sharing from the 2024 ATP Tour season. The ATP's 50-50 profit-sharing formula splits profits generated at ATP Masters 1000s – above on-site base prize money – equally between players and tournaments. 

First introduced in 2022, profit sharing is a central part of ATP's OneVision strategic plan, designed to align the financial interests of players and tournaments and give both parties an equal share in the sport's success. The $18.3 million, which represents a 2.7x increase on the previous season, will be distributed to players based on performance at the ATP Masters 1000s in 2024 – a bonus of 25% on top of base prize money already paid at those events. 



ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do: ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside. $18.3 million is a huge milestone. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value. We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour.” 

Reforms under OneVision have driven substantial increases at the ATP Masters 1000 level. The expansion to 96-player draws has increased earning opportunities for more players, widening the number of those able to make a sustainable living from tennis. It has also unlocked a wave of infrastructure investment, with Madrid, Rome, Cincinnati, Shanghai and Paris, among others, raising the bar with upgraded venues that have enhanced the player and fan experience and strengthened the long-term future of the sport. 

Profit-sharing results are announced well into the following season, as the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments undergo three financial audits to give players full transparency over the economics of the Tour's top events. 2024's results raise player compensation across the ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (prize money + profit share) by 18% vs 2023. This comes in addition to a $20.5 million Bonus Pool in 2024.



Profit-sharing also takes ATP player compensation to a record $261 million for the 2024 season – for a total of $378 million when combined with Grand Slam prize money. In 2025, ATP is on track to deliver further compensation records, including $28.5 million in Challenger Tour Prize Money (+28% vs 2024) and a $3 million ATP 500 Bonus Pool (+131% vs 2024).

Carlos Alcaraz sprinted into the Cincinnati Open quarter-finals Wednesday night with a convincing 6-1, 6-4 win over Italian Luca Nardi

The World No. 2 won 13 of the first 14 points of the match and closed out the first set in just 27 minutes, making up for a late start to his feature night match, after the Centre Court schedule was impacted by an extended rain delay earlier in the day.

 It was a contrasting story in the second set, with Alcaraz trailing 2-4 before tallying four consecutive games to advance after 80 minutes. The 22-year-old won a lengthy, eight-deuce game at 4-4, during which Nardi double faulted on back-to-back points to allow the second seed to serve for the match.

“I think this match was the best so far for me in this tournament,” Alcaraz said in his on-court interview. “At the beginning of the tournament, I just really wanted to get better every day, after every practice and every match. I think I'm doing it, which I'm really proud about. I'm just really happy with the way I felt the ball today and the way that I moved.”

The Spaniard, who is seeded to meet World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final for the fourth consecutive tournament in which they have both featured, next plays ninth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Francisco Comesana 6-2, 6-3 to avenge last year's Wimbledon first-round loss to the Argentine. Rublev dropped six points behind his first serve and overwhelmed Comesana with his firepower to advance in 64 minutes.

A 21-time tour-level titlist, Alcaraz is seeking his first Cincinnati crown. He reached the final in 2023 and held championship point before rival Novak Djokovic stormed back to lift the trophy. Alcaraz holds a 51-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, including five titles.



Alcaraz leads Rublev 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including a Wimbledon fourth-round encounter last month won by the Spaniard in four sets. Their Cincinnati clash will mark their first meeting on outdoor hard courts.

Third seed Alexander Zverev led 14th seed Karen Khachanov 7-5, 3-0 when the Toronto finalist retired after 70 minutes of battle. Khachanov beat Zverev last week in Toronto, where he saved a match point to escape the German. Zverev, who won the Cincy title in 2021, awaits Toronto champion and fifth seed Ben Shelton or 22nd seed Jiri Lehecka.

 Ohio rain may have kept Ben Shelton waiting across the past two days at the Cincinnati Open, but the in-form American was poised and ready to clinch a fourth-round spot when the opportunity came. 

 In a match originally scheduled for Tuesday's night session at the ATP Masters 1000, Shelton overcame Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6(3), 6-3 after another rain-interrupted day on Grandstand. The fifth-seeded Shelton clinched the opening set in a tie-break on Wednesday and then rebounded strongly after a two-hour rain delay at 2-1 in the second set to close out the match.

“The rain delay was a little reset for me,” Shelton said. “I came out playing much more aggressive tennis, my brand of tennis, and I'm happy how I finished it.

 “I don't think I did a great job [handling the match postponement last night]. We were here late last night and I wasn't able to wind down and get to sleep right away. It was tough to get up this morning and be ready for a 1 o'clock match. It was a tough day at the office for sure.” 

 With his one-hour, 49-minute victory against Bautista Agut, Shelton improved to 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and extended his winning streak to eight matches. The 22-year-old, who lifted his maiden Masters 1000 title last week in Toronto, is now 28-1 for the season after winning the first set. 

 Renowned for his powerful, hard-kicking lefty serve, Shelton nonetheless faced real peril early against Bautista Agut. He fended off three break points in the opening game of the match and two more in the third game, but after pulling through those tests he went on to dominate the first-set tie-break and assume control. 

He stepped up his aggression after the resumption, finishing the match with 16 aces and 12 forehand winners according to Infosys ATP Stats. He also saved all eight break points he faced in the match and won 71 per cent of the Spaniard's second-serve points.

 Now 34-16 for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Shelton is two victories away from hitting new heights in the PIF ATP Rankings. Competing in Cincinnati as the World No. 6, he would rise to a career-high No. 5 by reaching the semi-finals. Shelton is also fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and in strong contention to seal a debut appearance at the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals. 

 Standing in the American's way in the fourth round will be 22nd seed Jiri Lehecka. Shelton triumphed in straight sets in the pair's only previous tour-level meeting, in June on grass in Stuttgart.

MASON, Ohio—The Cincinnati Open spent $260 million to renovate its facility this year. The tournament doubled its footprint. It constructed new buildings and dug sunken courts from scratch. It expanded its draws and offered $5 million more in prize money.The one thing the event couldn't upgrade was the weather. That part of the Ohio experience in August is the same as it ever was—i.e., stifling heat giving way to torrential rain, without much middle ground in between. Fans this week have spent a fair amount of time hiding from both beneath the many new shaded tables that the tournament added. The sky is immensely beautiful here, but it brings trouble.Those shade umbrellas have come in handy, and so have the off days that were built into the longer schedule this year. Even after several truncated sessions, the tournament isn't too far behind schedule as we head toward the quarterfinals.Here's a look at a Wednesday that got off to a slow start, but finished with a flurry. By 6:00 or so, we finally had tennis weather.

What's Medvedev still doing here?

There's no rest for the weary in tennis, or even for those who lose early. On the practice courts, it's not uncommon to see players who have already made their exits from Cincy, but aren't ready to move on to New York. They can find good partners and good hard courts here.On Wednesday, Daniil Medvedev and Tomas Machac, both of whom lost their opening-round matches days ago, were out dueling in the humid, 80-degree air. Neither has had a good season, or looks like any kind of a US Open contender, but you wouldn't have known it from watching them play practice points. They were lasering pancake-flat ground strokes back and forth, and painting the lines. Their contact was so smooth it almost looked like they weren't making contact at all—the ball was flying of its own accord.You could watch them and lament your own mediocrity. Or you could look on the bright side and realize that the pros succumb to pressure just like the rest of us.

Tiafoe's loss, by retirement, began a brutal day for top Americans in mostly brutal conditions.© Anita T. Aguilar

Should I just call it?

It started so well for Frances Tiafoe. He came out crisp and in charge against Holger Rune. He won the first three games. He looked energized to be in the stadium court, where he reached the final a year ago. But it all slipped away just as fast. Rune took control with his forehand, and Tiafoe couldn't find his way around it.Then life went from bad to worse. At 4-4, he hit a winning backhand, but instead of celebrating, he winced. He felt something on his left side and wasn't the same again. Tiafoe called the trainer and downed a few Tylenols, but by the start of the second set he was asking his coaches if he should stop.When the full realization of what was happening hit him, Tiafoe stood still, screamed out an f-bomb, and belted a ball out of the stadium. His runner-up defense in Cincy was over, and a second straight trip to the semis at the US Open looks like a long shot now.

Mannarino remains an opponent few, even a world No. 1, relish facing.

Ay yi-yi-yi-yi!

That's all Adrian Mannarino could say after drilling another of his ultra-flat ground strokes into the tape. The 37-year-old Frenchman had played the top seed, Jannik Sinner, as well and as close as possible for close to two hours. But now, with a chance to send it to a third set, he couldn't deliver the killer blow when he needed it. The shots were there, the court was open, but the ball ended up in the net.That said, Mannarino, with his deceptively easy swing and unprepossessing body, did something not many of Sinner's opponents have managed to do in the last two years: He got a rise out of him. Sinner was visibly annoyed when a fan delayed his serve at one point, and he shot his coaches, including Darren Cahill, a sarcastic thumbs up after Mannarino won a big point at the end of the second set.That's tantrum-level stuff from the normally icy Italian, but as mentioned above, Mannarino couldn't capitalize on his chances.Sometimes you play like you're No. 1. Other times your opponent plays like you're No. 1.

That's him!

There are plenty of players who draw big crowds for their matches. But Carlos Alcaraz is the only one I've seen this year who can make fans run, as fast as they can, to watch him practice. If you see a stream of people sprinting across the grounds, you'll probably find Alcaraz at the end of the rainbow.On Wednesday, after a brutal 24 hours of heat and rain, the air cooled, the sun came out, the clouds—white, not dark this time—massed overhead, and Alcaraz appeared. He's even more like himself in practice. He floats a little lighter around the court, and picks the ball off the short hop even more nonchalantly. He doesn't go for as many spectacular running winners, opting for safe and heavy topspin instead. But he doesn't skimp on the drop shots.Practicing next to him was Ben Shelton, who had just finished winning a match, but looked like he wanted to rip a few forehands for good measure. The fans were happy to see Ben, but practicing next to Alcaraz is a little like standing next to the sun.

You got this, Madi!

Madi, it turned out, did not have this.Tiafoe's defeat was just the start of a day to forget for the U.S. contingent. By evening, three other top Americans, Jessica Pegula, Taylor Fritz and Madison Keys had followed him out the exit door.Was it the long wait and multiple rain delays? Pegula had her momentum stopped cold by a thunderstorm on Tuesday night, and Fritz was exiled to Stadium 3 late on Wednesday.

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

Was it the extra desire to do well in the States, with the Open coming up? Was it just a random bad day for a group who has had a strong season overall?Having taken a peek at all three losses, I had the sense that Pegula's, Fritz's and Keys's opponents were all hungrier than they were, and may have felt like they had a little less to lose playing an American in Cincinnati. Magda Linette was basically a better, more aggressive version of Pegula. Elena Rybakina, perhaps inspired by her recent reunion with her longtime coach, played with more grit than usual in making a second-set comeback past Keys. And Fritz's foe, 118th-ranked Terence Altmane, flat out took it to him.Onward to New York for all of them. For the rest of us left in Cincy, the business end of the tournament, and hopefully more good weather, awaits.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

Kimi Antonelli has been getting used to life in Formula 1 after a rapid rise through the single-seater ranks.

Mercedes have praised Kimi Antonelli for the progress he has made during his rookie F1 season so far, believing the teenager is now “finding his feet more quickly” at race weekends after approaching early rounds “with a degree of caution”.

Antonelli climbed from F4 to F1 in just over three years with his 2025 promotion to a race seat at the Silver Arrows, where he has been competing alongside experienced, multiple Grand Prix-winner George Russell.

While the 18-year-old Italian made an instant impression via a brilliant charge from 16th to fourth at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he found himself battling to get up to speed at several events that followed.

Then, dotted around a spell of incidents and retirements, came two breakthrough results – Antonelli storming to a maiden pole position during Sprint Qualifying in Miami and scoring his first F1 podium in Canada.

Following that podium finish, Antonelli admitted that he had potentially “overreacted” to his dramatic Free Practice debut crash at last year's Italian Grand Prix and was “a bit too safe” in his approach moving forward.

Assessing Antonelli's start to life in F1 shortly before the summer break, Mercedes Technical Director James Allison shared that theory, while highlighting how the team have been trying to help build his overall confidence.

“We talk about this a bit internally, and it may just be more gossip than reality, but the trip into the barrier at Monza, I think that may have just left him approaching the weekends with a degree of caution as a result,” Allison told select media, including F1.com.

“We've been encouraging him to sort of trust [his] talent: ‘You can lean into that more than you think you can'. As he gets the confidence to do that, he's finding his feet more quickly during the weekend.”

As it stands, Antonelli sits seventh in the Drivers' Championship on 64 points, while the aforementioned Russell holds fourth on 172 – the Briton having scored a race win and five further podiums this year.

Given Russell's speed and knowledge, with the 27-year-old making his F1 debut back in 2019 and being a long-time member of the Mercedes family, Allison described the situation as “a brilliant apprenticeship” for Antonelli.

“George has barely put a foot wrong,” Allison said of Russell's season. “He's been on the money in Qualifying. Where we've given him a car that he's able to work with, he's done everything we could have hoped [for] with it, so bravo to him.

“That's obviously giving Kimi a very high standard to shoot for. I'm pleased with the fact that Kimi, generally speaking this year, has been able to get close to George as the weekend's gone on. As the year's gone on, perhaps you could say he gets in the groove a bit swifter.

“But George is setting a very, very high bar. It's a brilliant apprenticeship for Kimi to have someone as swift as George to shoot for.”

Antonelli's quest for progress has also been boosted by Mercedes reverting to an older specification of suspension following their failed mid-season switch – the youngster returning to the points in Hungary and declaring that he was “getting the confidence back”.

In a new series of features, Formula 1.com is delving into the F1 driver bubble to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of Grand Prix racing. In this piece, Aston Martin Head of Performance Optimisation Ben Michell explains how the key relationship between driver and race engineer works.

Modern Formula 1 teams are huge companies with hundreds of employees all working hard to try to be the best in the sport. But within these vast organisations there are the teams within a team – the small cadre of people centred around helping each driver perform at their maximum.

In a new series of features, Formula 1.com is delving into those bubbles to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of F1. In this piece, Aston Martin Head of Performance Optimisation Ben Michell explains how the key relationship between driver and race engineer works…

Every time a driver climbs into the cockpit they are ensconced alone in one of the world's smallest offices. But back in the garage – and at their respective factories – they have a team of specialists studiously working to ensure that every ounce of performance is extracted from both the driver and their machine. And the link from the driver to all that expertise, data and experience is the race engineer – the person we hear talking to them over the team radio when they're out on track.

The seven-member girl group was trained and formed by veteran music executive Katie Kang, an instrumental part in the casting and training of Girls Generation, SHINee, EXO, NCT, Red Velvet and The Boyz. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	In a year full of debuts in the world of K-pop, Titan Content's first girl group, AtHeart, has made a strong first impression.


	The group, formed and trained by veteran music executive Katie Kang, have released their first EP, Plot Twist, a deliciously catchy and melodic five-track pop album, which includes a lead single of the same name and a previously released single, “Good Girl (AtHeart).”




	AtHeart – comprised of members Michi, Seohyeon, Aurora, Katelyn, Bome, Arin and Nahyun (Aurora is currently on hiatus due to health-related reasons and had limited participation in the group's debut EP) – has been in the works for years, with members hailing from Korea, Japan, the Philippines and the U.S.

	Michi, 18, was the first member of the group cast by Kang and Titan during a global audition in Hawaii. “When I saw her, I had that feeling that she was the one, and I can now finally start putting together a group around her,” Kang previously told The Hollywood Reporter. Kang focused on many aspects of training when preparing AtHeart for debut, including singing, dancing and mental training to deal with the outside-of-performing elements that come with a career in K-pop.


	AtHeart spoke with THR about training for their debut, getting Girls' Generation's Sooyoung to guest star in their music video teaser and which K-pop acts have inspired them.

	











Why did you feel that “Plot Twist” was the perfect single for your debut? Are you excited about it?


MICHI Our debut title track, “Plot Twist,” kind of exemplifies what people our age are going through — trying to figure themselves out, finding their own path and navigating that confusion of emotions you feel when something unexpected happens. I feel like it really showcases what we're experiencing right now as we prepare to debut. Since we're at that age ourselves, it feels like the perfect song to share as our first impression. I'm excited, and I really hope we can share something relatable with anyone who's listening.


It's very different from your pre-release “Good Girl (AtHeart),” which is fun. Does anyone have a favorite song on the EP?


BOME My favorite track of the EP is the 3rd  track, “Dot dot dot…,” because I think it's a story about AtHeart, about the members, and I feel like the R&B genre really suits us. I also think it showcases the true voice of each member well.


NAHYUN My favorite song is the second one, “Push Back.” I think this song fits summer perfectly, especially the vibe and the genre of the track – Amapiano – also makes this song special and easy to listen to. I also think this song captures the emotional state of teenagers – that feeling of being pushed and pulled.


What was it like shooting the music video for “Plot Twist?”


ARIN During the music video shoot, there was a scene where I was put on a wire to simulate flying. Before the shoot, I was extremely nervous, but once the filming actually started, I didn't feel nervous at all. In fact, I really enjoyed it. That moment ended up being a very memorable experience to me.

	











You had Girls' Generation's Sooyoung in your music video teaser. What was that experience like? Did you get any advice from her? 


KATELYN Having Sooyoung sunbaenim [Korean honorific for a senior in one's field] with us was such an honor, especially knowing that she took time out of her busy schedule to guest star in our music video [teaser]. It means so much to all of us. She's a role model for everyone, along with her group Girls' Generation. During the shoot, I was so nervous that I couldn't speak and was almost frozen because seeing her in real life was truly unbelievable. Despite the nerves, it was also a lot of fun. She's such a warm and kind person.


ARIN Sooyoung sunbaenim showed her support to us, and she told us to keep it up [and that] we are doing great. [She said] if you continue to do what you're doing, you'll find success soon.


What has the training for your debut been like? How do you feel it's prepared you for this next step? 


SEOHYEON We've been continuously practicing vocals and singing and dancing. It still hasn't quite hit me yet that we're debuting as members of AtHeart. The whole process feels surreal. During [our training], all I could do was focus on practicing, recording and choreography, often skipping other activities. I'm just incredibly excited. I'm really looking forward to the debut and eager to share our EP and talents with the world. I can't wait to debut as soon as possible and am especially excited to meet fans in person.

	











I know you've been training under Katie [Kang], who's quite a known figure in the K-pop industry. What has that been like? 


KATELYN Working with Katie has been so much fun. Since she has so much experience in the K-pop industry, it makes all of us feel more comfortable and confident that we will be well taken care of. She's  always been there for us during every “first.” [She's] always present and supportive. Even with her busy schedule, she makes an effort to attend our projects and photo shoots. Having her by our side means a lot, especially since this is our first time, and we're still learning how everything works. Her presence makes me feel very comfortable.


Do you have any artists that have inspired you during this journey? 


NAHYUN I'm particularly inspired by Jang Wonyoung of IVE. Wonyoung first caught my attention during her time on the Mnet survival competition show Produce 48, and from that point on, I've been deeply moved by her passion for her craft and her persistence. Those two qualities, her dedication and determination, really inspired me throughout my own trainee days.


ARIN For me, it was Jennie of Blackpink because I think Jennie knew what she wanted to do since she was young, and she kept challenging herself and keeps moving forward towards her goal. That really inspired me.


Do you have any hopes or goals for the coming year after your debut? 


MICHI This year, we hope to experience many new things and explore different opportunities. As a newly debuted group, there's still so much ahead of us. We're in the process of discovering our own sound and identity. With this first album, we hope to capture people's attention, but as we continue making music, our goal is to grow, define who we are as artists and create songs that truly resonate with listeners.

	











How do you want people to see AtHeart? How do you want to be known as group? 


MICHI Our group is made up of so many different members who come from different places, have different backgrounds and different personalities. But when we all come together, we kind of have this harmonious relationship that produces a stronger outcome [for] our music and kind of how we're perceived as a group. I think we all carry such different specialties and talents, so if we can show that it'd be great.


KATELYN I just hope that once we debut, people will notice us and, of course, hopefully support us and love us. More importantly, I hope they understand that who we are on camera is who we truly are in real life. We're showing our real selves, and I really hope people will love us for exactly that, for being authentic.

Ellison and his top executives hosted a meet-and-greet with journalists on the storied Melrose Lot Wednesday to further discuss their plans for Paramount Picture and the TV side of the aisle.



		By Pamela McClintock, Aaron Couch 

	August 13, 2025 1:49pm	




	Growing up, David Ellison spent every Sunday going to the movies with his mother and his sister, Annapurna founder Megan Ellison. As an adult, he spent more than 15 years pursuing his wish to run a legacy Hollywood studio. Now, his dream has become reality and all eyes are on the young mogul to see if he can right a movie studio that has been all but run into the ground.


	On Wednesday, Ellison, the ambitious and introspective son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison showed off his new throne — metaphorically speaking — when hosting a meet-and-greet for journalists on the storied Melrose Lot in Hollywood, home of the newly minted Paramount-Skydance. The gathering of he and his C-suite followed a similar event in New York held Aug. 7, the day the $8 billion merger officially closed. The L.A. presser focused more on the movie and TV side, which includes CBS, its cable channels and Paramount+.

	At the event, Ellison called Top Gun 3, the sequel to the $1.5 billion grosser Top Gun: Maverick, a top priority at the studio, and said he would be in the Tom Cruise business as long as the A-list star — with whom he has made ten films in Ellison's former life at Skydance — wanted to tell stories with him.


	“One of our biggest priorities is restoring Paramount as the No. 1 destination for the most talented artists and filmmakers in the world,” Ellison said. “Great filmmakers make great movies.”


	Ellison, who said he intends to make movies exclusively for theaters, now has full control over a number of film franchises he already worked on at Skydance. Many of them have been dormant on the big screen for years (Star Trek, G.I. Joe) or have had trouble finding their footing in recent years (Terminator, Transformers). 

	











	Co-film chief Josh Greenstein said these franchises would be a priority, noting the company hopes to release 15 films a year, and then up that to 20. He name checked Star Trek and Transformers, with a surprise being World War Z, the 2013 Brad Pitt zombie feature. He also indicated an interest in both horror (Paramount is home to A Quiet Place and Smile) as well as R-rated comedies. But he noted that originals were also a priority, pointing to the first greenlight under the new regime, the Timothée Chalamet, James Mangold project High Side.


Star Trek, which has not been in theaters since 2016, has largely been overseen by Alex Kurtzman with a lengthy list of Paramount+ series. Execs said that Trek would be looked at holistically rather than siloed off between different parts of the company, such as film and TV. “We're going to make sure those conversations are happening together so that we can do what's best for the brand as a whole,” said film co-chief Dana Goldberg.


	On the Paramount+ side, Ellison acknowledged the uber importance of Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan for the health of the streaming service. “He is literally a singular genius with a perfect track record,” said Ellison. “If we can make this his home as long as he wants to tell stories, we want to do that.”


	Newy tapped Paramount+ chief and former Netflix exec Cindy Holland — speaking publicly for the first time about her intentions — didn't mince words when later backing up Ellison's focus on making films for theatrical, versus the small screen, since they have different roles. “Streaming movies are not a priority for me,” said Holland, who played a key role in Netflix's ascent to power when serving as EVP of scripted at Netflix, bringing in such marquee series as The Crown and Orange is the New Black, among other projects.

	











	“We want to entertain all audiences around the world on Paramount+,” said Holland. And for that to happen, the menu of content has to be expanded beyond current options. “But we're seeking to expand that and make sure that we're offering programming for everybody, not just occasionally and not just for the one thing they want to come back for.”


	When asked if Ellison would give her the content budget she needs, she respondedwith  a quick yes.


	Ellison arrives at Paramount well-prepared in terms of using his creative acumen in the flailing entertainment conglomerate, which has been peddliSumner Redstone family for more than three decades. Instead of choosing outsiders, he's relying on Hollywood veterans who have, between them, worked at almost every major studio. 


	Other notable C-suite names include Andy Gordon, who had been leading RedBird Capital's Los Angeles office, who is COO of the company. RedBird, which is providing financial capital to support the Skydance deal, has also most recently employed Shell.


	George Cheeks, who has also been leading the CBS business, will remain with the company as chair of TV media, adding oversight of the company's cable TV channels.


	Ellison's longtime confidante and Skydance chief content officer Goldberg has been tapped alongside former Sony Pictures exec Greenstein to lead the new Paramount Pictures studio as co-chairs (they each have additional duties as well). Goldberg said Paramount would emphasize family films, citing movies like Goonies and The Night at the Museum franchise as north stars. “We're going to run towards those movies,” she said.

	











	Holland, Greenstein and Goldberg were not at the New York press event, so Wednesday provided the first chance to hear from them. For Greenstein, it's a homecoming. Prior to Sony, he ran marketing and distribution at Paramount, where Ellison's Skydance had a co-producing and co-financing deal. He, Ellison and Goldberg formed a close friendship that endured.


	Ellison fielded a number of other topics, batting away speculation that he was interested in acquiring TikTok and declining to discuss specifics on new voices he might like to bring into CBS News. He also noted that he intended to hold onto BET, after speculation that the previous Paramount regime flirted with selling.


	As he has reiterated repeatedly, Ellison emphasized that technological efficiencies will help Paramount prevail in the years to come.  


	“Legacy media kind of swam out to the middle of the lake, but wasn't exactly sure how to get to the other side. Some people wanted to go back and burn the boats,” Ellison said, adding that he intended to “get to the other side of the lake.”

Star hairstylist Mark Townsend — who also works with Parker Posey, Aubrey Plaza, Riley Keough, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen and others — is a fan of Dr. Groot's thickening shampoos and conditioners.

	Korean beauty brands aren't just changing the skin care space — they're using innovative formulas in hair care, too.


	Scalp health is the focus of Dr. Groot (no, not that Groot), which launched in the U.S. in 2023 and is among Korea's bestselling hair care brands. Hollywood hairstylist Mark Townsend (whose clients include Dakota Johnson, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Aubrey Plaza, Riley Keough, Parker Posey and other stars) is a fan of the company's three-step volumizing Scalp Revitalizing Solution line of shampoo, conditioner and an in-shower treatment, which are designed to be used together to get rid of the gunky buildup on your scalp from oil, other hair care products and dry skin.

	The Korean hair care brand's three-step hair thickening regimen starts with the shampoo, then Miracle in Shower Treatment and finally the conditioner. Clinical studies found that 100 percent of users reported improvement in scalp dryness and redness, while 76 percent said the shampoo helped remove buildup on their scalp's pores. However, we experienced the results for ourselves last fall at Mare Salon in West Hollywood, where Townsend gave us the A-list tress treatment with Dr. Groot's products. We left our appointment with the full Scalp Revitalizing Solution line to test out — and about six weeks later, our hair was completely transformed.

	











	After about a month and a half of using the shampoo, in-shower treatment and conditioner (in that exact order), we noticed that our hair felt bouncier and thicker, our scalp was less itchy and our hairline started sprouting new strands. The secret is in Dr. Groot's proprietary formula that includes prebiotics to nourish the hair follicle and improve the scalp environment, and biotin to promote keratin production and prevent hair loss. Other active ingredients include rosemary oil to stimulate the hair and scalp and caffeine to deliver more nutrients to the hair follicles.  


	The Scalp Revitalizing Solution line is also safe for all hair textures and scalp types. The brand's products are dermatologist-tested, safe for color-treated hair made without parabens, silicones or sulfates. Dr. Groot also offers the Professional Bonding System range for revitalizing and repairing damaged hair and anti-dandruff products.


	For National Hair Loss Awareness month, the company is offering its bestselling hair thickening trio in a travel-ready set with a handy storage pouch for only $30. Plus, use code HAIR20 at checkout to save an extra 20 percent off all Dr. Groot products and get free shipping on orders over $50 through Aug. 31.


	Founded in 2017, Dr. Groot is owned by LG's beauty division and pulls from its parent company's more than 50 years of research to develop salon-quality products. Per the brand, the label is backed by “a powerhouse team of scientists and dermatologists [who] have researched hair and scalp issues for over 50 years to develop proprietary technologies.

The showrunner and DC Studios co-head premiered the second season of 'Peacemaker' alongside star John Cena in NYC. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	The second season of Peacemaker debuted in New York on Wednesday night, and James Gunn came ready to drop some hints on the show's role in the future of the DC Universe. 


	The HBO Max series, which stars John Cena as the titular character and has Gunn as showrunner, is back for its second season three and a half years after its first, with Gunn now co-head of DC Studios alongside Peter Safran. As a result, season two will help lay out the pair's vision for what's coming up in the DCU.



""I don't think there's anything I've ever done that I love more than this season"" – James Gunn talks about how #Peacemaker Season 2 sets up his larger vision for the DCU pic.twitter.com/lHWDLGZbpE


	“It's a big part, definitely Superman leads directly into Peacemaker; it should be noted that this is for adults, not for children, but Superman leads into this show and then we have the setting up of all of the rest of the DCU in this season of Peacemaker, it's incredibly important,” Gunn told The Hollywood Reporter on the carpet. “Lots of guest stars coming up, lots of characters that are showing up that we've already met in Superman. I don't think there's anything that I've ever done that I love more than this season of Peacemaker, so I'm so excited for people to see it.”

	Cena confirmed that this season “is about furthering the narrative. Instead of stand-alone properties, all of the DCU is now connected, as you saw Peacemaker show up in Superman. I think what you see in season two is just a forward of that narrative. That whole DCU throughline — it takes the 11th Street Kids through their next adventure, but it also has a lot to do with the DCU going forward.”

	Gunn also gave a little tease for what's next after the success of Superman — which he wrote and directed — revealing, “I've already finished the treatment for the next story in what I'll call the ‘Superman Saga.' The treatment is done, which means a very, very worked-out treatment. I'm working on that and hopefully going into production on that not too far away from today.”

The actor has won two Academy Awards throughout his career.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Denzel Washington didn't become an actor to win shiny gold trophies, admitting, “I'm not that interested in Oscars.”


	Though the veteran actor has 10 Academy Award nominations, including two Oscar wins for his incredible onscreen work, he recently said on Jake's Takes, “I don't do it for Oscars.”




	“I don't care about that kind of stuff,” the Highest 2 Lowest star explained. “I've been at this a long time, and there's time when I won and shouldn't have won and then didn't win and should've won. Man gives the award. God gives the reward.”

	Washington continued, “I'm not that interested in Oscars. People ask me, ‘Where do I keep it?' Well, next to the other one. I'm not bragging! Just telling you how I feel about it. On my last day, [Oscars] aren't going to do me a bit of good.”

	When interviewer Jake Hamilton replied, “I don't think God ever asks how many Oscars do you have,” the actor then quipped with a laugh, “He [God] might go, ‘That's why I gave you an extra week.' [As] long as he says, ‘Now, get on up here,' I'm all right.”


The Equalizer 3 actor previously won two Academy Awards, for best supporting actor for 1989's Glory and best leading actor for 2001's Training Day.


	Not that Washington was too concerned given his stance on awards — he was notably snubbed earlier this year from another Oscar nomination for his role in Gladiator II. When previously asked by the New York Times if he cared about not receiving an Oscar nod for Ridley Scott's film, he responded, “I was sitting there smiling, going: ‘Look at you. On the day you didn't get a nomination for an Oscar, you're working on Othello on Broadway. Are you kidding me?'”

	











	He then sarcastically said, “Awww. Oh, I'm so upset,” before adding, “Listen, I've been around too long. I'm getting wiser, working on talking less and learning to understand more — and that's exciting.”

""I'm glad I fought for it and stuck to my guns,"" the actress says.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	When Jennifer Aniston really wants something, even as simple as a wig, she is willing to go to battle over it.


	The Emmy-winning actress recently shared during an interview for Vanity Fair‘s “Rewatch” video series that she fought with Warner Bros. to be able to wear a brunette wig in 2011's Horrible Bosses, as they preferred her beloved blonde hair.




	“I fought for that wig, by the way. That was not an easy battle,” Aniston said. “I wanted [my character] to look different. The argument from the studio, and I am sorry to call you out, was that, ‘We're just afraid it won't look like you.' And I said, ‘That's kind of the point!' I still think it might look a little bit like me. But I'm glad I fought for it and stuck to my guns.”

	The Friends alum played Dr. Julia Harris in Horrible Bosses, which followed three friends who conspired to murder their awful bosses when they realized they were standing in the way of their happiness. The R-rated comedy also starred Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis and Kevin Spacey. They all, including Aniston, also returned for the 2014 sequel, Horrible Bosses 2.

	Aniston added that she “loved” both of the Horrible Bosses films because they helped her pivot from her “girl next door” archetype.


	“I was always, sort of, seen as a girl next door, you know, the ingenue,” The Morning Show actress explained. “It was really fun to play somebody like this because it's so far away from anything that I am. And I think that's what the director liked — this is so not what you would expect from this gal. That was the fun of it. I think that's what made it more creatively exciting for me obviously.”

The K-pop company's second quarter was boosted by concerts and merchandise revenue, including tours from DAY6, Xdinary Heroes and NEXZ.

	Glenn Peoples



Surges in concerts and merchandise led JYP Entertainment's revenue to jump 126% to 215.8 billion KRW ($157 million) in the second quarter, the K-pop company announced on Wednesday (Aug. 13).


	With operating expenses held in check, operating profit rose 466% to 52.9 billion KRW ($39 million) and net profit skyrocketed more than 2,700% to 36.2 billion KRW ($26 million). 


	Concert revenue rose 342% to a record high of 62.0 billion KRW ($45 million), helping soften the blow of the 26% drop in the first quarter. Stray Kids performed 23 concerts in the quarter, including 12 in the U.S. and two in Mexico, which completed the group's record-breaking 54-show world tour. DAY6 commemorated its 10th anniversary by completing its third world tour, performing 16 concerts in six countries, including six shows in South Korea, in the quarter. Xdinary Heroes had eight concerts and NEXZ hosted seven performances. 


	Merchandise revenue of 66.9 billion KRW ($49 million), also a quarterly record, was up 356% due to concert sales and global IP licensing collaborations (including Stray Kids with Tamagotchi and TWICE with Sanrio's Japanese pop-up). 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Physical album sales jumped 100% to 27.1 billion KRW ($20 million) on the strength of a Japanese release by Stray Kids and new albums by iTZY, NEXZ and KickFlip. Streaming revenue fell 10% to 11.5 billion KRW ($8 million). 


	Appearance revenue rose 22.1% to a record 9.7 billion KRW ($7 million), and advertising revenue improved 22% to 11.3 billion KRW ($8 million).


	South Korea took the biggest slice of the revenue pie, accounting for 36% of JYP's total revenue, down from 41% in the prior-year period. Japan and China accounted for 21% and 2%, respectively. The rest of the world generated 41% of the company's second-quarter revenue, up from 31% a year earlier.

The tight end admitted that he was also weeping when he heard the news.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift still gets emotional when she thinks about the moment she reclaimed her master recordings after years of working to do so, as evidenced by her appearance on Travis Kelce‘s New Heights podcast.


	In the episode posted Wednesday (Aug. 13), the pop star teared up while recalling how she collapsed into her boyfriend's arms after receiving the news, which the world would only learn in May when Swift announced that she'd purchased the rights to her first six albums from Shamrock Holdings in a letter on her website. It was a big moment for both the star and her fanbase, as the 14-time Grammy winner had been vocal about her devastation with the initial sale of her masters to Scooter Braun in 2019 — which she said “ripped my heart out of my chest” on New Heights — shortly after which they changed hands again to Shamrock.

	











	“Since I was a teenager, I've been saving up money to buy my music back,” she recalled on the podcast as the tight end rubbed her hand affectionately. “I thought about not owning my music every day … It was like an intrusive thought.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	According to Swift, it wasn't members of her team who negotiated the deal with Shamrock — it was her mom, Andrea, and her brother, Austin. Andrea was also the one who broke the news that they'd closed the deal with the investment company in an emotional phone call with her daughter.

	











	“She was like, ‘You got your music,' and I literally hit the floor,” Swift said. “Bawling my eyes out, just weeping.”


	At first unable to believe that the news was real, the 14-time Grammy winner says she eventually went into another room, where Kelce was obliviously playing video games. “I'm like, ‘Just go tell Travis in a normal way,'” she said, cracking up at the memory of how her voice broke as soon as she started speaking to the Kansas City Chiefs star, despite trying to keep her composure.


	Swift added that her boyfriend immediately ditched his console and wrapped her in his arms, at which point she started “absolutely heaving.”


	Kelce admitted that he was also sobbing in the moment, noting that his superstar girlfriend was “just dead weight” in his arms.


	Though fans are hopeful that they'll still get a re-release for Swift's debut album — and possibly even Vault tracks for the never-finished Reputation (Taylor's Version) — the purchase of her masters marked something of an end to her yearslong re-recording project. Over the past six years, the musician has released revamped versions of Fearless, Speak Now, Red and 1989, which Swift said on New Heights was a process she “defiantly” decided to embark on.


	While re-recording her albums, Swift also added on New Heights that she was able to fall back in love with one of them. “Red was very special,” she said, noting that Vault track “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” is “maybe my favorite song I've ever written.”


	“I've always loved Fearless and 1989 in a very pure way,” she added. “Red I've always gone back and forth … but the re-record really made me love that album.”


	Elsewhere on the podcast, Swift shared more details about her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, which she announced Tuesday (Aug. 12) via a teaser clip from her guest New Heights episode. Arriving Oct. 3, the LP will mark her first full-length since reclaiming her masters three months ago.

	During her wide-reaching conversation with boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason Kelce, on the New Heights podcast Wednesday (Aug. 13), Taylor Swift opened up about her new album, The Life of a Showgirl — which she says is a deep dive into what was going on “behind the scenes” of her life while she was on The Eras Tour.


	After more than an hour of discussing reclaiming her masters, falling in love with Travis and taking care of her father after heart surgery, Swift finally pivoted to the subject of her 12th studio LP (arriving Oct. 3) toward the end of the new episode. Revealing that she crafted all 12 songs on the project while she was on her global Eras trek, the 14-time Grammy winner also said that she would often fly to Sweden to work with producers Max Martin and Shellback — her only collaborators on Showgirl — whenever she had a few days off from performing.

	











	“I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she gushed. “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it.”

	“We've made songs that I'm so proud of,” she continued of herself, Martin and Shellback. “We've never actually made an album before where it was just the three of us, there's no other collaborators. It felt like catching lightning in a bottle. These guys, they're just geniuses. Working with them again was absolutely incredible.”


	Swift added that all 12 songs are “bangers” — akin to past hits she made with the Swedish pop pioneers, such as “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space” — and that they detail “what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.” 


	The premise of Showgirl documenting Swift's life over the course of her two-year Eras run will certainly intrigue fans. In addition to setting numerous records and captivating millions of fans each night on the road, the pop star went through several changes in her personal life — from breaking up with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn to sparking up a romance with Travis — during the tour.


	And, as opposed to last album The Tortured Poets Department, which spent 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Swift asserted on the podcast that Showgirl will feature no bonus tracks — although the “crisp” and “vivid” lyrics on the 12 songs that are featured, plus a Sabrina Carpenter duet on the title track, will surely keep fans satisfied regardless. “There's no other songs coming,” she emphasized. “This is 12. There's not a 13th … there's not other songs coming. This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time.”


	As Travis nodded excitedly, Swift added, “I care more about this record more than I can even overstate.”

This will be his first time as the show's solo host after co-hosting in 2022 with Nicki Minaj & Jack Harlow.

	Paul Grein



LL COOL J is set to host the 2025 MTV VMAs, which will air live coast-to-coast from New York's UBS Arena on Sunday, Sept. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.


	This will be his first time as the show's solo host. He co-hosted in 2022 with Nicki Minaj and Jack Harlow. (The VMAs have favored hip-hop stars as show hosts in recent years. Minaj solo-hosted in 2023. Megan Thee Stallion did the honors last year.)

	











	LL has a rich VMAs history. He won best rap in 1991 for “Mama Said Knock You Out” and was the first rapper to receive the Video Vanguard Award in 1997. He also performed on the last two VMAs telecasts – he participated in an all-star salute to hip-hop's 50th anniversary in 2023 and led a 40th-anniversary salute to Def Jam Recordings in 2024. The latter segment also featured surprise guests Chuck D and Flavor Flav from Public Enemy.




			Trending on Billboard		







	This year, LL's single “Murdergram Deaux” (feat. Eminem) is nominated for best hip-hop. The song was taken from his 2024 album THE FORCE.


	LL has emceed many awards shows, most notably the Grammys, which he hosted for five consecutive years from 2012-16.


	Additional performers, presenters and special guests will be revealed in the coming weeks.


Lady Gaga leads the nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards with 12 nods, followed closely by her “Die With a Smile” duet partner Bruno Mars, who has 11 nods. Other top contenders are Kendrick Lamar (10), ROSÉ and Sabrina Carpenter (eight each), Ariana Grande and The Weeknd (seven each) and Billie Eilish (six).

	











	MTV has yet to announce this year's recipient of the Video Vanguard Award, but Billboard's Andrew Unterberger listed eight likely candidates – in ascending order of perceived likelihood. (Last year, he correctly predicted Katy Perry as the Vanguard recipient, so he knows what he's talking about.)


	This will mark the first time the show has been broadcast by CBS. It will also simulcast on MTV and stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	The 2025 MTV VMAs are executive produced by Bruce Gillmer, Den of Thieves co-founder Jesse Ignjatovic, and Barb Bialkowski. Gunpowder & Sky CEO Van Toffler is producer. Alicia Portugal is co-executive producer. Jackie Barba is executive in charge of production. Wendy Plaut is executive in charge of celebrity talent. Lisa Lauricella is executive in charge of music talent.


	This marks Toffler's return to the show following a decade-long absence.

""I would bet that there's an Aerosmith show left,"" guitarist Joe Perry told Boston's WBUR.

	Tyler Jenke



Aerosmith‘s Joe Perry claims he's unsure of what the future holds for the band, noting Steven Tyler lacks the desire and ability to head out on tour.


	The co-founding guitarist made his comments while speaking to Boston's WBUR, affirming his belief that the veteran rockers may take to the stage once more.

	“I would bet that there's an Aerosmith show left,” Perry explained.


	Questions about the band's future have swirled since the announcement of their 2023 farewell tour. While performing in Elmont, NY on Sept. 9 of that year, Tyler fractured his larynx, necessitating the postponement of shows on their Peace Out tour. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Ultimately, these shows were canceled entirely when the band announced their retirement from touring in Aug. 2024. That same month, bassist Tom Hamilton refuted claims the band were over completely, noting Aerosmith were “still alive” despite the recent retirement news.


	In his recent discussion with WBUR, Perry revealed that he and Tyler had recently spent time together to discuss the band's plans, including a possible documentary at some point. However, fans may need to temper their expectations on the topic of full-scale touring.


	“He just doesn't want to tour and he can't tour. It's tough,” Perry explained. “I'm not sure I would want to go out and book another 40-city tour. It's a long way to the top and staying there takes it out of you, especially an Aerosmith tour.”

	











	Perry didn't entirely rule out the notion of a less strenuous live undertaking, such a Las Vegas residency in the same vein as their Deuces are Wild concert series which took place throughout 2019, 2020 and 2022.


	“I'll never say never, but I wouldn't bet on it — no pun intended,” Perry said. “You really have to want to be out there and we're all at that point of: How do you want to live? How do you want to spend the next however long you've got?”


	Since Aerosmith's retirement from touring, Tyler has only performed live a handful of times. The first of these was at his annual Jam for Janie Grammy Awards Viewing Party in February, with his most recent appearance taking place as part of July's Back to the Beginning benefit concert in England.

	Christina Ricci isn't the only character from Wednesday Season 1 to return unexpectedly in Season 2.


	In the newly released trailer for Part 2 of Season 2, which arrives on Netflix September 3, Gwendoline Christie's Principal Larissa Weems is back, at least in Wednesday's post-Episode 4 regaining of consciousness, asking her if she's ready for her sponge bath.


	The titular main character asks if she's in hell, but no.


	In a shocking turn of events, Weems is Wednesday's new spirit guide, or figure from beyond death who will help Wednesday with her psychic visions. Jenna Ortega portrayed Goody Addams, Wednesday's father's ancestor who helped her with her ability in Season 1. The good news is: Wednesday's not dead.

	











	“Tyler's still out there. He has plans to kill both of us. I'm going to fix it,” Wednesday tells Enid (Emma Myers), her werewolf roommate whose death came to Wednesday in a vision alongside a crow with a vitreous eye.

	“You're the reason he escaped,” Enid says to Wednesday back in their dorm room.


	“She's got a point,” Weems says walking around the pair, to which Wednesday responds “Stay out of this.”

	Enid asks who she's talking to because she can't see Weems.


	“Every family has dark chapters, Wednesday,” Wednesday's mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tells her daughter.

	











	“If there's never a time to unburden yourself with the truth, now is it,” Wednesday says. “A life hangs in the balance.”


	“If you don't hurry, you'll have nothing left to save,” Weems' word linger until one last sentence is uttered.


	“Beware, there will be a price to pay,” an unknown voice says in the trailer's final moments. While there's still no sign of Lady Gaga, could it be her speaking these words? Come Sept. 3, viewers will find out.

TV Reporter


Peacock has finally revealed when to expect its upcoming Sarah Snook-led series All Her Fault. 


	The series will premiere with four episodes on November 6, followed by two new episodes every Thursday through November 20, the streamer said Thursday. In addition to the premiere date, Peacock also released a first-look image from the series.


	In the image above, Snook sits on the couch looking distraught as her co-star Dakota Fanning kneels in front of her.


	Adapted from the best-selling novel of the same name by Andrea Mara, All Her Fault opens on a plausibly terrifying situation that eventually unearths the deep secrets of a community. Marissa Irvine (Snook) arrives at 14 Arthur Avenue, expecting to pick up her young son Milo from his first playdate with a boy at his new school. But the woman who answers the door isn't a mother she recognizes. She isn't the nanny. She doesn't have Milo. And so begins every parent's worst nightmare.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


Mubi CEO Efe Cakarel has published what he has described as an open letter to the filmmaking community in response to the mounting public criticism of his company's ties to the private equity firm Sequoia Capital. Scroll down to read the letter in full. 


	Cakarel begins the letter by thanking those who have contacted him over the last few weeks to discuss the matter, before promptly clarifying the company's position. 


	“Following the investment from Sequoia, some have suggested that we are complicit in the events occurring in Gaza,” Cakarel writes. “These accusations are fundamentally at odds with the values we hold as individuals and as a company. The profits Mubi generates do not fund any other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. Our returns go to Sequoia's limited partners — institutions such as universities, foundations, and pension funds — not to other Sequoia-backed businesses such as Kela. Any suggestion that our work is connected to funding the war is simply untrue.”

	Cakarel continues to write that Shaun Maguire, the Sequoia partner at the center of much of this controversy, is not a “partner of any of the funds that invested in Mubi.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“He has no involvement with our company operationally, strategically, or in any capacity,” Cakarel writes of Maguire. “He is not on our board, has no relationship with our team, and played no role in our partnership with Sequoia. We neither support nor endorse Shaun's views, and we have voiced our strong concerns about his public statements directly to Sequoia.” 

	











	Cakarel confirms that as a minority investor, “Sequoia has minimal involvement in Mubi,” and he as CEO remains the “largest shareholder and maintains full control over all business and curatorial decisions.”  


	“Sequoia has no oversight or authority over our programming, editorial, or financial decisions,” Cakarel concludes. 


	On the specific events happening in Gaza, Cakarel writes: “We condemn all acts that harm innocent civilians and reaffirm the right of all people to live in peace and safety. The immense suffering, displacement, and starvation of the Palestinian people is a humanitarian catastrophe that must end. We stand firmly against war and tyranny in all forms, and in support of the dignity and freedom of all people.” 


	Moving forward, Cakarel says Mubi will introduce an Ethical Funding and Investment Policy that will “set clear criteria for future funding partners, establish safeguards that separate investor interests from editorial and commissioning decisions.” Cakarel says Mubi will establish an Independent Artists Advisory Council to shape that policy. The council will include “filmmakers, artists, and cultural voices from different regions alongside a human-rights due diligence expert.” 


	“We know some in our community will want us to go further, and others may feel we have gone too far,” Cakarel ends the letter. “Our responsibility is to protect a space where filmmakers and audiences can meet. That means being transparent about how we are funded, explicit about how we protect artistic independence, and humble about what we still need to learn.” 


	Mubi has been one of the most popular pillars of contemporary arthouse cinema for some time. Travel to any major city and you're likely to catch one of the company's popular cobalt blue totes over someone's shoulder. News of the company's $100 million investment deal with Sequoia changed its public perception after it was uncovered that the Silicon Valley-based private equity firm had close ties to defense-tech startup Kela, founded in 2024 by a group of Israeli intelligence veterans in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. Reports have said Kela is currently developing a battlefield operating system that will enable military units to integrate AI and commercial tech. Last month, a group of Mubi-affiliated filmmakers, including Radu Jude and Joshua Oppenheimer, published an open letter calling on the company to reconsider its investment from Sequoia. 


	Titles set for release via Mubi this year include Lynne Ramsay's Die My Love and Mascha Schilinski's Sound of Falling. 


Efe Cakarel's Full Letter:


	To our community,


	I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to reach out over the past few weeks. Your words, your questions, and your concerns have all been heard and taken to heart.


	I've spent these weeks in deep reflection, talking with our team, filmmakers, producers, and partners around the world. We have been exploring how to take thoughtful and decisive action while upholding the values that have always guided us.


	What's happening in Gaza is unbelievably tragic and devastating. The loss of civilian lives, including thousands of children, the destruction of homes, hospitals, and cultural institutions, and the deliberate targeting of an entire population's ability to survive and thrive are unconscionable. We condemn all acts that harm innocent civilians and reaffirm the right of all people to live in peace and safety. The immense suffering, displacement, and starvation of the Palestinian people is a humanitarian catastrophe that must end. We stand firmly against war and tyranny in all forms, and in support of the dignity and freedom of all people.

	











	I also want to clarify our relationship with Sequoia Capital and Shaun Maguire. Following the investment from Sequoia, some have suggested that we are complicit in the events occurring in Gaza. These accusations are fundamentally at odds with the values we hold as individuals and as a company. The profits MUBI generates do not fund any other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. Our returns go to Sequoia's limited partners — institutions such as universities, foundations, and pension funds — not to other Sequoia-backed businesses such as Kela. Any suggestion that our work is connected to funding the war is simply untrue.


	Shaun Maguire, the Sequoia partner at the center of much of this controversy, is not a partner of any of the funds that invested in MUBI. He has no involvement with our company operationally, strategically, or in any capacity. He is not on our board, has no relationship with our team, and played no role in our partnership with Sequoia. We neither support nor endorse Shaun's views, and we have voiced our strong concerns about his public statements directly to Sequoia.


	Finally, as a minority investor, Sequoia has minimal involvement in MUBI. As the founder and CEO, I remain the largest shareholder and maintain full control over all business and curatorial decisions. Sequoia has no oversight or authority over our programming, editorial, or financial decisions.


	That said, we recognize that how we fund our work matters, and we are sharing initiatives we are undertaking to ensure clarity around our funding process in the future. We are formalizing an Ethical Funding and Investment Policy that will set clear criteria for future funding partners, establish safeguards that separate investor interests from editorial and commissioning decisions, and outline a process to review and address any concerns that arise. The policy will be published on August 15, 2025 for public consultation, inviting feedback from filmmakers, artists, audiences, festivals, civil-society groups, and all who care about MUBI's mission. We will review all submissions and publish the final policy on October 15, 2025.


	We are also forming an independent Artists Advisory Council, to be established by September 15, 2025. This group will include filmmakers, artists, and cultural voices from different regions alongside a human-rights due-diligence expert. It will advise on the Ethical Funding and Investment Policy, endorse the final policy, and continue on an ongoing basis to provide independent guidance on matters relating to MUBI's values and responsibilities.


	Separately, we are expanding our support for artists at risk through a dedicated Artists At Risk Fund. Over the next three years, we will fund commissions, residencies, and restoration projects administered at arm's length by an independent panel, focusing on filmmakers working under conflict, displacement, or censorship, including Palestinian filmmakers. Full details will be provided by October 30, 2025.


	We know some in our community will want us to go further, and others may feel we have gone too far. Our responsibility is to protect a space where filmmakers and audiences can meet. That means being transparent about how we are funded, explicit about how we protect artistic independence, and humble about what we still need to learn.


	Looking ahead, we remain committed to the same mission that has guided us for the past 18 years: elevating great cinema and making it accessible to audiences around the globe. We will continue to champion bold and diverse voices, stay true to the values that define us, and ensure that exceptional filmmaking reaches the widest possible audience.

	











	Warmly,


	Efe Cakarel


	Founder & CEO

Netflix is expanding its adult animated comedy slate with new series Strip Law, from Cullen Crawford, Underground and Titmouse. It's set to premiere February 20, 2026 on the streamer.


Adam Scott (Severance), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Keith David (Platoon) Stephen Root (Barry) and Shannon Gisela (M.I.A.) are set as the lead voice cast. 


Strip Law revolves around uptight lawyer Lincoln Gumb, who is too boring to win cases in Vegas until he teams up with local magician/hedonist Sheila Flambé to bring some flash and pizzazz to the stupidest cases the city can throw at them.

	











	Crawford serves as creator and executive producer. Steven Fisher and Trevor Engelson also executive produce with Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, Ben Kalina and Antonio Canobbio for Titmouse Inc.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Current Smithsonian drama now stopping us from getting a Weird Al exhibit","https://www.avclub.com/weird-al-smithsonian","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 03:50:00 GMT","

Today, dumped on the ever-growing “Nice things, and why we can't have them” pile: Weird Al Yankovic has said that he's put a pause on plans for a Smithsonian exhibit focused on his career, amidst the chaos and drama currently encircling the national set of museums. Specifically, Yankovic told Vulture this week that he'd been planning to donate a number of pieces of memoribilia to the Smithsonian—including the orange Hawaiian shirt he wore for the bulk of his cult-classic comedy film UHF—for a planned exhibit about his work, but, “I'm putting that on hold because, as you may have heard, the Smithsonian is going through some changes right now, and I'm waiting until the dust settles.”

On the one hand, there's something perversely funny about the idea of Donald Trump's recently emboldened culture cops having to go through and evaluate all of Yankovic's various accordions and lyrics to try to decide if there's something subversive buried inside “Your Horoscope For Today” or “Hardware Store.” (“We regret to inform you that ‘Everything You Know Is Wrong' doesn't align with President Trump's views of history”—although he'd probably get a surface-level kick out of “Frank's 2000-Inch TV.”) The upshot is that visitors to the Smithsonian—Yankovic doesn't indicate which of the organization's various museums was planning the exhibit, although National History feels like a decent candidate—will now have to live without getting to enjoy Yankovic's wonderfully oddball impact on the national conversation.

Elsewhere in the profile, Yankovic reiterates previous comments suggesting that 2014's Mandatory Fun will probably be his final album. (“I decided to quit when I hit No. 1 on the charts and my record deal was over. I thought, ‘Well, this is a good mic drop, and I'm kind of tired of having to top myself.'”) He also addresses the occasional calls for him to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, taking a typically Yankovic-ian chill attitude to the whole thing:

The Rock Hall is going to do what they're going to do. They're obviously expanding the boundaries of what constitutes rock and roll when they make their decisions. If they're going to ever pick a comedic entry, I'd like to think I'd be considered for that. If they pick another accordion-playing parody writer ahead of me, I'd be upset. I don't lose any sleep over having not been nominated. Right now, there are millions of people saying, “Why isn't he in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?” And I'd prefer that to having millions of people saying, “Who let that jerk in there?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys are pretty crappy neighbors in first look at The Beast In Me","https://www.avclub.com/the-beast-in-me-first-look-claire-danes-matthew-rhys","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:23:00 GMT","

There's a certain style of prestige-flecked TV drama that powers itself almost entirely on the idea of, “Yeah, I'd like to see those two performers face off, possibly with some sexual and/or murderous tension in the mix.” That's certainly what seems to be driving our initial interest in Netflix's new show The Beast In Me, in which Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys play neighbors with what sounds like the kind of relationship that makes you make faces like this all the time.

Per the series' logline (available over at Tudum, Netflix's personal press site with the name that you just have to shrug and accept), the show centers on Danes as a bestselling author plunged into writers block after the death of her child, Cooper Morris-Wiggs. (No cause of death is being given for the fictional eight-year-old, but terminal Bad Name Having seems like a possible culprit.) Danes' character, Aggie, finds herself revitalized when Rhys' Nile Jarvis moves in next door. Jarvis, see, is “a famed and formidable real estate mogul who was once the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance” that Aggie immediately becomes both “fascinated and repulsed by.” Meanwhile, if you had “three sentences” as your wager on how long this description would take to use the phrase “a game of cat and mouse,” congratulations, you're clearly ahead of the game.

Howard Gordon, who worked with Danes on Homeland, will serve as the showrunner for the series, which also co-stars Brittany Snow, Natalie Morales, David Lyons, Tim Guinee, Hettienne Park, Jonathan Banks, and Deirdre O'Connell. (Lately great in both The Penguin and Eddington.) But, if we're being honest, we're really just here for Danes and Rhys, who we can only assume will be sharing an absolutely huge number of meaning-filled looks that either mean “I am planning to expose/murder you,” “I am obsessed with you,” or, most likely, both.

The Beast In Me arrives on Netflix on November 13, 2025.

Following the death of Brandon Blackstock, his obituary revealed that he had a girlfriend, Brittney Jones, who once worked for his ex-wife, Kelly Clarkson. Few details are known about their relationship, but according to a new report, the couple was very private.

In an August 2025 report from Us Weekly, a source told the outlet that Jones was a “big part” of Blackstock's life before his passing.

“Brandon and Brittney were in a relationship and his family was very happy and supportive,” the insider shared. “His children spent a lot of time with her and had grown close to her.”

Blackstock shared children River and Remington with Clarkson, and Savannah and Seth with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth.

According to Jones' LinkedIn profile, she worked as a production assistant for Clarkson in 2016 and also worked as an executive management assistant for the “Idol” alum from 2018 to 2020. She moved to work with Blackstock in June 2020, the same month Clarkson filed for divorce.

The source shared, “Brittany moved to Montana to work with Brandon. After leaving the entertainment industry, she worked with him to build Valley View Rodeo.”

The insider added, “Brandon was very private, especially after leaving the entertainment industry — but his family embraced his relationship with Brittney.”

According to the source, “Brittney worked with Kelly during Kelly and Brandon's marriage, so Kelly has a lot of history with Brittney.”

The tribute shared by Axelson Funeral & Cremation Services notes, “Narvel Brandon Blackstock peacefully passed to be with the Lord on the morning of August 7th, 2025, after a brave and courageous 3-year battle with cancer. He was surrounded in his home by his family, who comforted him and lovingly handed him off to his grandparents in heaven, who welcomed him home.”

The obituary includes details of his career in the music business as well as his other pursuits.

“After more than 20 years in the music business, Brandon found his way back to the mountains and the cowboy way of life he always wanted to live,” the obituary explains. “He found a homestead and a love in Butte, Montana.”

The tribute also mentions Jones. “Brandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.”

On August 8, Jones' father paid tribute to Blackstock in a Facebook post. He described Blackstock as “my daughter's soulmate,” and said he “considered him my son,” People reports.

Cameron Mathison is currently portraying Drew Cain, one of the most hated men on “General Hospital.” It has been new territory for the actor, who is used to being cast as really nice guys in the majority of his projects. Even this week on the soap, Drew is manipulating everyone in his path and even threatened to have his young nephew arrested, just to get even with his brother. Many soap fans agree that Drew's comeuppance will likely appear in the form of a body bag.

Redemption for Drew Cain seems like an impossibility, but Cameron Mathison's co-stars are taking turns singing his praises. Katelyn MacMullen (Willow Tait on GH) recently chatted with Michael Fairman TV about working with Mathison.

Katelyn MacMullen's character of Willow Tait has been along for the ride with Drew Cain for the last year. She left her marriage to Michael Corinthos and lost her children, before finally seeing the real man that everyone had warned her about. Willow may hate the man that she just left at the alter, but Katelyn adores playing out this story with Cameron.

“He's truly phenomenal, and then obviously his work is just incredible. I feel like I learned a lot from working with him because he's been doing this for a while, and he's so kind to me, and supportive, and always makes sure that I'm feeling okay,” she told Michael Fairman.

“It's been cool to navigate this storyline with him because we both have been like, ‘What is happening next? What are we doing?' We've kind of had to dive in together. I feel very grateful.”

MacMullen isn't the only one speaking up about Cameron's character. Bradford Anderson, who plays Spinelli on GH, praised him on the “That's Awesome with Steve Burton and Bradford Anderson” podcast.

“He's such a kind, on-the-level kind and considerate. So when he's playing the Drew stuff, like he'll do something nuts and then just come out of character, so different,” Anderson expressed. “It's just so funny cause they are so far apart, reality, and on-screen is so far apart. I think, like anybody, he's used to being liked, and he's an eternally likeable fella. It has to be a new experience, and I think he's handling it so well,” says the actor.

When it comes to playing Drew, Anderson says, “It's so funny, He [Mathison] really seems to be like ‘alright let's go,' there's no protecting this anymore. It's so funny to see him at work with kind of like a, and I say this in the best possible way, just kind of like an F-it attitude. Like, let's go. Whatever.”

It's been over two years since “Succession” signed off, and now Sarah Snook is making her return to television. Above is a first look of her in the new Peacock drama “All Her Fault,” based on Andrea Mara's 2021 novel of the same name. The show will premiere its first four episodes on November 6, with two episodes each dropping the following two weeks, to wrap on November 20. 

It seems like a good thing this release is compressed, because this show looks like a masterclass in anxiety. As in Mara's novel, Snook will play Marissa, a mom who arrives to pick up her son Milo from his first-ever play date. When the door opens, the woman greeting her is not at all the mother of Milo's friend Marissa's expecting — and she's never even heard of Milo at all. As the official logline reads, “And so begins every parent's worst nightmare.”

Megan Gallagher of “Wolf” and “Suspicion” is writer, creator, and executive producer on “All Her Fault,” which comes from Carnival Films, the Universal Studio Group shingle behind “The Day of the Jackal” and “Lockerbie: A Search for Truth.” In addition to Snook, the cast includes Jake Lacy, Dakota Fanning, Michael Peña, Sophia Lillis, Abby Elliott, Daniel Monks, Jay Ellis, Thomas Cocquerel, Duke McCloud, and Kartiah Vergara.

But it's Snook's return to TV that “Succession” fans will particularly be excited to see. Since the HBO show went off the air in May 2023, she's been seen on the big screen in the Sundance Midnight section thriller “Run Rabbit Run” and in “The Beanie Bubble,” the 2023 film about the '90s Beanie Babies craze. She also voiced Grace Pudel in the acclaimed animated film “Memoir of a Snail.” 

Her most distinguished post-“Succession” role, however, was on the stage. Starting on the West End in 2024 and then moving to Broadway this year, Snook starred in Australian writer Kip Williams' take on Oscar Wilde's “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” playing a whopping 26 characters, including the title role. She won the Tony for Best Actress in a Play as a result.

Now, fans of her extraordinary small screen work only have to wait a few more months before she puts us all through the wringer with “All Her Fault.”

“All Her Fault” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Peacock.

Following a world premiere at Cannes, Ethan Coen held the North American premiere for “Honey Don't!” at Metrograph in Manhattan on Wednesday, August 13. The dark comedy follows Honey, played by Margaret Qualley, who is investigating a local cult. Aubrey Plaza, Charlie Day, and Billy Eichner co-star in the film, co-written with Tricia Cooke.

IndieWire caught up with Plaza on the red carpet, where she detailed getting ready to play Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss, who ran the “world's largest high-end prostitution ring” and counted actors, politicians, and other leading men among its clients in the '90s. “I've been on this track for a while,” she told IndieWire.

“I got it in my head that I wanted to play her a couple of years ago and I've never played a real-life person before. It's a different kind of scale, challenge, that I'm really excited about, and I just think she's an incredible person, incredible character. The story is insane. She's done something that probably nobody else has ever done, and she's still going. I think she's the ultimate badass icon and she deserves the royal treatment. We shall give it to her.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As for whether Plaza has talked with Fleiss, she said, “I have not spoken with her, [but] I hope so. I hope to make a little trip to her place in the desert at some point. Spiritually I feel her. I've heard she's very excited about it. We're in early stages.”

Plaza will be reuniting with Coen next month in “Let's Love!,” an Off-Broadway play he wrote, with performances starting on Thursday, September 25 and opening on Wednesday, October 15. “He actually came into my trailer when we wrapped ‘Honey, Don't!' and he was like, ‘I wrote this play. I think I wrote it for you and didn't realize it. Will you do it?' And I was like, ‘I'll literally do anything you tell me to do.' So here I go.” 

As for Qualley, the Golden Globe-nominee tapped into her musical side for the first time, creating alter ego Lace Manhattan around this film. While she has appeared in music videos for the likes of Bleachers and Rainsford, her vocal chops soar in two songs for the film, produced by husband Jack Antonoff and co-written by director Coen. “It was so fun,” she said.

“Me and my friend Talia Ryder got together to make these videos as if we were pop stars and there's not much to explain other than girls having fun.” As for whether any of Antonoff's collaborators, which include Lana Del Rey and Sabrina Carpenter, to name a few, gave her any musical advice, she said, “Oh, no. I wasn't even involved with the music making. I'm just acting the part.”

 










She will soon be seen in Ridley Scott's post-apocalyptic thriller “The Dog Stars,” which filmed earlier this year alongside Jacob Elordi and Josh Brolin. “It was cool,” Qualley said of working with the director. “He's such a well oiled machine. It was a scale of movie making I hadn't really experienced before.”

“Honey Don't!” premieres August 22 in theaters from Focus Features. Check out the trailer here.

MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel has addressed the ongoing controversy over the company's recent $100 million investment from Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that was found to have ties to several companies connected to the Israeli military. In a lengthy statement shared with the press Thursday, August 14, Cakarel clarified the profits MUBI generates do not fund other companies in Sequoia's portfolio, and a suggestion that their work is funding the war in Gaza is “simply untrue.” 

Cakarel also wrote that Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire, who has come under fire for social media posts accused of being Islamaphobic, has no involvement with MUBI operationally or strategically, that the company does not endorse his views, and have expressed concerns to Sequoia. He also shares that Sequoia is merely a minority investor without oversight over programming, editorial, or financial decisions. Cakarel remains the majority shareholder in MUBI.

 








Related Stories ‘Angel's Egg' Trailer: ‘Ghost in the Shell' Director's Early Work Gets 4K Restoration ‘It Was Just an Accident' Trailer: Jafar Panahi's Palme d'Or Winning Moral Dilemma Comes to Theaters 

Cakarel's letter stops short of returning Sequoia's investment, a demand from some that would be near-impossible without Sequoia agreeing to sell its minority stake in the arthouse film distributor. But the CEO wrote that MUBI will put in place an “Ethical Funding and Investment Policy” to establish future criteria for funding partners, as well as an artist advisory council of filmmakers and other cultural voices to inform the funding policy. 

 










That policy will be published on Friday, August 15, and MUBI is even inviting the public to give feedback on those guidelines, the final version of which will be published October 15.

“We know some in our community will want us to go further, and others may feel we have gone too far,” Cakarel wrote in part. “Our responsibility is to protect a space where filmmakers and audiences can meet. That means being transparent about how we are funded, explicit about how we protect artistic independence, and humble about what we still need to learn.”

In addition to an open letter signed last week by 63 different filmmakers demanding the company condemn Sequoia and remove partner Andrew Reed from MUBI's board, IndieWire has learned that nearly half of MUBI's 400+ employees anonymously signed a letter calling on management to return Sequoia's investment. 

The internal letter, obtained by IndieWire, demanded MUBI and Cakarel return the $100 million investment from Sequoia Capital, remove Reed from MUBI's board, and “decline any future funding that implicates MUBI in the business of murder.” It said the company's ties with Kela, a defense startup founded in 2024 by Israeli intelligence veterans following the October 7 terrorist attacks, as well as two other Israeli defense companies, makes MUBI complicit with genocide in Palestine and puts the “company's future at serious risk.”

 










Though the letter was signed anonymously, 201 staffers across nine departments at MUBI endorsed the letter that was then sent to Cakarel and management. The letter was sent on June 16, two days after MUBI first issued a statement on Instagram addressing online backlash. A pair of insiders who spoke to IndieWire said the letter came about after they felt the June 14 Instagram statement was inadequate and “dismissive” of the online criticism. Those who signed also objected to leadership in the very early days of the backlash referring to critiques as “trolling” and mis-informed. 

“Already, key collaborators — including filmmakers, artists, writers, and other partners — have expressed disappointment and concern over the Sequoia investment and questioned their own future engagement with MUBI, some withdrawing planned contributions as a result,” the letter reads in part. “There are mounting calls to boycott MUBI; members are canceling subscriptions, and filmmakers may soon begin to remove their films from the platform and database … the Sequoia investment will inevitably continue to harm our reputation and our work, threatening our partnerships and our mission. Subsequent statements from MUBI leadership have been inadequate, failing to address the fundamental contradiction this investment presents.”

 










“The reaction to the statement was mainly anger, disappointment about a lack of accountability that it showed,” one member of MUBI's global content team told IndieWire. “The fact that it was not meaningfully engaging with any of the criticism but rather justification was a disappointment. Just seeing the alignment with the investment rather than with the community, engaging with what could be steps towards dealing with this in a more ethical way moving forward, was something that I found very disappointing.” 

On June 18, two days after staffers sent the letter, Cakarel convened the entire staff over Zoom and acknowledged the letter “reflects real pain, fear, and frustration that I do not take lightly,” according to a transcript account of the meeting shared with IndieWire.

“I hear you. And I see you. And I do speak for the entire management team when I say that,” Cakarel said in the meeting. He explained that in the company's history, it had not traditionally made political statements, including the war in Ukraine, the Black Lives Matter movement, or Brexit, but that's because “we believe our platform should speak through our films.” 

“That said, I need to emphasize we are not neutral about humanity, we stand for dignity, for empathy, for freedom of expression, and for the value of every human life,” Cakarel added. 

 










He further echoed comments made in Thursday's public statement, including that Maguire has no involvement with MUBI, and that MUBI's profits do not fund any other Sequoia investments nor do they shape editorial decisions. 

For a chunk of employees who signed the initial letter, Cakarel's clarification answered their questions, eased their concerns, and felt their fellow staffers should move on.But the two employees who spoke to IndieWire about the letter and company meeting still felt unheard, and they believe they're in the majority among their colleagues. 

The insiders said they felt unsupported by management in how to appropriately address the controversy when dealing with partners or clients. They also bristled at a survey sent by management that required identifying themselves with a company email address, fearing that speaking out could have blowback for their jobs. An individual with knowledge of the situation told IndieWire the emails were only requested as a means of starting a dialogue with concerned employees. 

“There were people who were working with partners and who were feeling very exposed, like that the company's failure to respond substantively had then trickled down to the individual workers who were now representing the company in our own professional relationships that of course the company relies on and and derives value from, but that we weren't supported in understanding how to how to manage those relationships through this very controversial decision,” a second member of MUBI's content team told IndieWire. 

 










The insiders would still like to see Sequoia's investment returned, but it's been clear to them for some time that such a step would be highly unlikely. One of the employees expressed a desire for an ethical framework much like the one Cakarel laid out on Thursday, as well as the company taking a stand against Maguire's comments. 

Above all, they want to see the company's values reflected in the actions MUBI's leadership makes.

“We keep being told that this investment is not going to affect our values, but we don't understand anymore I think what those values are,” the second content team staffer said. “I think most people would imagine that the values of a company are reflected in their business decisions. If MUBI is going to be this flagship producer and distributor of art house film, which is a part of the culture that we all have deep investments in and care deeply about, we want to be sure that it can be a responsible steward for that work and that our own efforts aren't going to waste or aren't in service of of a company that doesn't ultimately care about the work in the way that we do.”

Read Cakarel's full statement issued on Thursday, as well as the internal message from staffers sent on June 16, below:

To our community,

I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to reach out over the past few weeks. Your words, your questions, and your concerns have all been heard and taken to heart.
 










I've spent these weeks in deep reflection, talking with our team, filmmakers, producers, and partners around the world. We have been exploring how to take thoughtful and decisive action while upholding the values that have always guided us.

What's happening in Gaza is unbelievably tragic and devastating. The loss of civilian lives, including thousands of children, the destruction of homes, hospitals, and cultural institutions, and the deliberate targeting of an entire population's ability to survive and thrive are unconscionable. We condemn all acts that harm innocent civilians and reaffirm the right of all people to live in peace and safety. The immense suffering, displacement, and starvation of the Palestinian people is a humanitarian catastrophe that must end. We stand firmly against war and tyranny in all forms, and in support of the dignity and freedom of all people.

I also want to clarify our relationship with Sequoia Capital and Shaun Maguire. Following the investment from Sequoia, some have suggested that we are complicit in the events occurring in Gaza. These accusations are fundamentally at odds with the values we hold as individuals and as a company. The profits MUBI generates do not fund any other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. Our returns go to Sequoia's limited partners — institutions such as universities, foundations, and pension funds — not to other Sequoia-backed businesses such as Kela. Any suggestion that our work is connected to funding the war is simply untrue.
 










Shaun Maguire, the Sequoia partner at the center of much of this controversy, is not a partner of any of the funds that invested in MUBI. He has no involvement with our company operationally, strategically, or in any capacity. He is not on our board, has no relationship with our team, and played no role in our partnership with Sequoia. We neither support nor endorse Shaun's views, and we have voiced our strong concerns about his public statements directly to Sequoia.

Finally, as a minority investor, Sequoia has minimal involvement in MUBI. As the founder and CEO, I remain the largest shareholder and maintain full control over all business and curatorial decisions. Sequoia has no oversight or authority over our programming, editorial, or financial decisions.

That said, we recognize that how we fund our work matters, and we are sharing initiatives we are undertaking to ensure clarity around our funding process in the future. We are formalizing an Ethical Funding and Investment Policy that will set clear criteria for future funding partners, establish safeguards that separate investor interests from editorial and commissioning decisions, and outline a process to review and address any concerns that arise. The policy will be published on August 15, 2025 for public consultation, inviting feedback from filmmakers, artists, audiences, festivals, civil-society groups, and all who care about MUBI's mission. We will review all submissions and publish the final policy on October 15, 2025.
 










We are also forming an independent Artists Advisory Council, to be established by September 15, 2025. This group will include filmmakers, artists, and cultural voices from different regions alongside a human-rights due-diligence expert. It will advise on the Ethical Funding and Investment Policy, endorse the final policy, and continue on an ongoing basis to provide independent guidance on matters relating to MUBI's values and responsibilities.

Separately, we are expanding our support for artists at risk through a dedicated Artists At Risk Fund. Over the next three years, we will fund commissions, residencies, and restoration projects administered at arm's length by an independent panel, focusing on filmmakers working under conflict, displacement, or censorship, including Palestinian filmmakers. Full details will be provided by October 30, 2025.

We know some in our community will want us to go further, and others may feel we have gone too far. Our responsibility is to protect a space where filmmakers and audiences can meet. That means being transparent about how we are funded, explicit about how we protect artistic independence, and humble about what we still need to learn.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to the same mission that has guided us for the past 18 years: elevating great cinema and making it accessible to audiences around the globe. We will continue to champion bold and diverse voices, stay true to the values that define us, and ensure that exceptional filmmaking reaches the widest possible audience.
 










Warmly,Efe CakarelFounder & CEOMUBI

16 June 2025To Efe Cakarel and MUBI management:

We write as MUBI staff members in response to recent changes to the company's ownership structure. Like many of our subscribers and partners, we are deeply troubled by the news thatMUBI has accepted a large investment from Sequoia Capital, whose investments also include Kela, an Israeli defense contractor; Mach Industries, a weapons manufacturer partnered with an Israeli firm; and Neros, another manufacturer of weaponized drones. This investment comes at a time when Israel stands formally accused of genocide and war crimes by both the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.

Our work is now remunerated in part by this investment, and the value we create for the company may well be put toward the Israeli war machine when that investment yields returns. This makes MUBI, and each of us, complicit in the ongoing genocide of Palestinians by the Israeli government, and puts the company's future at serious risk. We call upon MUBI to return the investment from Sequoia Capital, to reverse the recent appointment of Sequoia partner Andrew Reed to MUBI's board of directors, and to decline any future funding that implicates MUBI in the business of murder.
 










We remain dedicated to MUBI's project of bringing the best in film and cinema culture to audiences around the globe, and we know how important sustainable growth is to our continued success. We object to the Sequoia investment, in part, because it compromises our company's core values and endangers our growth. MUBI's principled support of independent cinema from diverse, international filmmakers has attracted and inspired our industry collaborators and audiences. It is part of an ethic that distinguishes us from other technology and media companies, and that ethic is what makes us so committed to our work. This recent business decision goes against our guiding ethos, betraying our partners and the passionately engaged community we have fostered over the last eighteen years.

Already, key collaborators—including filmmakers, artists, writers, and other partners—have expressed disappointment and concern over the Sequoia investment and questioned their own future engagement with MUBI, some withdrawing planned contributions as a result. There are mounting calls to boycott MUBI; members are canceling subscriptions, and filmmakers may soon begin to remove their films from the platform and database. The first company-wide internal communication described such appeals as “trolling” and expressed hope that the situation “quiets down soon,” but we share the concerns of our audiences and collaborators and wish to amplify them. The Sequoia investment will inevitably continue to harm our reputation and our work, threatening our partnerships and our mission. Subsequent statements from MUBI leadership have been inadequate, failing to address the fundamental contradiction this investment presents.
 










In addition to urging that the Sequoia investment be returned, that Andrew Reed's appointment to the board be reversed, and that MUBI commit to never accepting funding from the global war machine, we ask management for transparency on the following points:

— Did management take due diligence to understand Sequoia Capital's full portfolio before accepting its investment in MUBI?— If so, did management raise concerns about its investments in Israeli war-tech companies, either while negotiating the terms of the investment or since?— What internal transparency procedures will be implemented to ensure that staff areinformed and confident about the business decisions of the company?— Management has insisted in official statements that “MUBI remains an independent founder-led company,” and that “recent fundraising does not affect that independence, our values, or our code of conduct.” How has management ensured that the interests of investors will have no bearing on business, programming, and editorial decisions?— Despite statements to the contrary, investments in a company are a material reflection of its values. How will MUBI correct course to more accurately reflect its values in its ownership structure?

We hope this letter is received with the good faith in which it was written. We care deeply about MUBI and believe this moment is an opportunity to develop a better company culture. We respectfully request a written response by the end of the working day on Wednesday, June 18.
 










Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns.

Signed,201 concerned MUBI staff members from across 9 departments

When Jafar Panahi‘s “It Was Just an Accident” debuted at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, it was the culmination of a brutal journey. The Iranian filmmaker has been banned from filmmaking (though it seldom stopped him) and imprisoned multiple times for opposing his home country's government, most recently in 2022, when he had to rely on others to read messages on his behalf at global film festivals that screened his film “No Bears.” 

He was eventually released following a hunger strike in February 2023, and returned to work on a blistering moral dilemma film about an Iranian man who kidnaps the man who once tortured him in prison and, along with the man's other victims, is forced to make a decision about whether or not to kill him.

“It Was Just an Accident” premiered to rave reviews and a Palme d'Or victory at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, with critics praising Panahi's deeply personal connection to the material and the nuanced moral dilemma that the film portrays.

“From the plot description alone, it's obvious that “It Was Just an Accident” finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while ‘banned' from making films — a period that saw his long-standing penchant for metafiction become considerably more pronounced, as he was forced to make himself the subject of iPhone/camcorder masterpieces like ‘This Is Not a Film,'” IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote in his Cannes review. “This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.”

 










“It Was Just an Accident” is written and directed by Jafar Panahi. The film stars Vahid Mobasseri, Maryam Afshari, Ebrahim Azizi, Hadis Pakbaten, Majid Panahi, Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr, Georges Hashemzadeh, Delmaz Najafi, Afssaneh Najmabadi.

Neon will release “It Was Just An Accident” in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 15, with a national rollout to follow. Watch the trailer below.

lost americana starts with mgk nodding to the keys from the Who's “Baba O'Riley,” and doesn't let up from there. The lyrics of Guns N' Roses, George Thorogood, Semisonic, the Black Crowes, and many more are invoked, sometimes obliquely but mostly just by name. “Semi-Charmed Life” is semi-covered, and the melodies from Goo Goo Dolls and Kate Bush songs are repurposed. He does to the Strokes' “Last Nite” what it did to Tom Petty's “American Girl,” and he calls it “Sweet Coraline” because that is a title that allows him to make not one but two other references. Its lead single, “cliché,” is spiritually a zillennial take on the conceit of Alanis Morissette's “Ironic,” but sonically, it is a stab at grafting a hyperpop sheen onto John Cougar Mellencamp.

This is no doubt a deeply cursed record, a Hold Steady album that instead of referencing Youth of Today aspires to educate today's youth about the existence of Alice Deejay's “Better Off Alone.” But while lost americana isn't good, per se, there's something about mgk's dedication to the bit, his quality-agnostic enthusiasm for the idea of popular rock music as a form, and the brutal honesty he embeds within its nonsense that makes it genuinely fascinating to listen to, and at times even successful when you take it on its own terms. It's mgk trying to take on the great modern rock songbook while also going into painstaking and sometimes excruciating detail about how he fucked up his life last year. Who else would even think to make that swing?

mgk, real name Colson Baker, made this album after what can be lightly described as a rough patch. In November 2024, he and his partner, Megan Fox, announced they were expecting their first child together and then broke up two weeks later, allegedly due to Baker's infidelity. Shortly after that, he relapsed after more than a year of sobriety and wound up in rehab, only to emerge to discover that the Los Angeles wildfires had destroyed his preferred studio.

So, as Baker tells it, he hunkered down with his touring band in his living room and self-produced a record that both aims for the big-tent pop-rock canon and near-Maoist levels of self-criticism. He announced the album with a trailer narrated by Bob Dylan of all people, which, despite his well-documented love of doing extremely random shit, was so out of left field that one would be forgiven for initially believing it was AI. It turned out to be very real, and came as a result of Dylan posting an old video of mgk freestyling on his Instagram, which seemed to mystify even Baker himself before he gathered the good sense to reach out to link and build with the Bard himself.

Before this current album, mgk lodged a major hit alongside Jelly Roll with “Lonely Road,” essentially a rewrite of John Denver's “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” whose success perhaps explains Baker's approach on lost americana. So many big songs these days are just shameless rehashes of past hits that it's barely worth making the point, but if your record is going to wear its influences on its sleeve tattoos, you might as well draw from a Pinterest board full of bulletproof melodies. The Pavlovian goodwill elicited by mgk borrowing the sound of “Running Up That Hill,” on “indigo” is so powerful that he nearly gets away with rapping, “Living fantasy like J.K. Rowling/I'm J.R.R. Tolkien these spliffs.” When he talk-sings, “I been up for day-ay-ay-ay-ays/Choppin' up the yay-ay-ay-ay-ay” on the pre-chorus of the “Semi-Charmed Life” flip, confusingly named “starman,” it's almost impossible not to be at least semi-char—uh, perversely amused—by his knuckleheaded ability to fall ass-backward into successfully putting his own stamp on a classic pop song about meth.

Sometimes, Baker tries to do too much at once without offering a sense of purpose. “dont wait run fast” sounds like a lost collab between Def Leppard and Motion City Soundtrack, and the only other thing you need to know about it is it's the official song of ESPN's College GameDay. “miss sunshine” is like Red Hot Chili Peppers' “Road Trippin'” run through a Sugar Ray preset, and attempts to evoke a vision of an idyllic, consequence-free youth that, charitably, could be read as mgk attempting to set up the record's darker second half, but mostly feels vapid and out of place. Elsewhere, he has the inverse problem: “vampire diaries,” which is mercifully one of the few times Travis Barker pop-punks up on the album, is written from the perspective of a vampire. (There's no metaphor there—he's just imagining what it would be like to be a vampire.) As a musician, mgk doesn't necessarily do one genre particularly well, but he does so many of them, each with equal enthusiasm. The gamut of styles on lost americana suggests that if mgk weren't famous, he'd be the musical director/frontman of a particularly kickass and notably versatile cover band.

One of the remarkable things about lost americana is its consistent, knowing nods to cocaine use, which can be read as a nod to Baker's very publicly no-good late-2024. “I miss my drugs, they've been my friends since 21,” he sings on “Outlaw Overture,” before the beat switches and he continues, “All of the pages are blank till my life goes to shit/I know I do that on purpose just to write again.” The record's two best tracks, “goddamn” and “tell me whats up,” continue this confessional mode. The former sounds more like Lil Peep than it doesn't, and mgk nails the assignment, speeding up his metronomic flow to match the urgency of the lines, “I've been drowning in something, I'm a downer on substances/I'm a functioning junkie turning my life around.” It's a melding of lyric and delivery that suggests Baker might be turning a corner as a songwriter, able to embrace the idea that substance and form are complementary concepts.

“tell me whats up” is one of the few tracks on the record that feels sui generis and, as a result, leaves room for Baker to be unflinchingly personal, rapping plainly about being robbed as a kid, conspiracy theories, his musical ADHD, and the isolation of addiction. It's a theme that continues on “treading water,” in which Baker accepts responsibility for his breakup with Fox and sings about how his addiction has affected his family (“While I pack up suitcases, I just ruined their holiday”) before rapping the next verse from his perspective while he was in rehab, “fixated on the gossip that I know is happening while I'm just being left out of the conversation,” wishing he could tell the public “for me, y'all can feel pure hatred, but just keep our baby out the situation.” That this is all happening amid a musical backdrop that sounds distractingly like the “Iris” by the Goo Goo Dolls is, frankly, bizarre, but it approaches something akin to a music world insider's take on outsider art. Let's just say it doesn't not work, and if nothing else, it's worth crediting Baker for spilling his guts when he knows it's more grist for the content mill he's writing in opposition to.

mgk is certainly trying hard on lost americana, but effort only gets you so far. It's kind of silly to ding an artist for having “bad taste” at a time when a group like Frost Children is openly reclaiming festival EDM, but unlike mgk, they have a coherent vision of what they're trying to accomplish. Without a razor-sharp point of view, mgk far too often fails to synthesize his very real pain into something truly artful, instead falling back on the crude tools of rote songwriting and borrowed melodies, which he occasionally manages to build out into something arresting thanks to his instinct for what resonates with his audience.

With lost americana, he's not competing for a New Yorker write-up as much as he is to be the go-to artist for kids looking for a contemporary musician with a harder edge than, like, Benson Boone. That everyone now has access to unlimited music from every style and era, and kids on TikTok are just as likely to obsess over a rediscovered Outer Limits song as they are to perform the marketing-approved choreo for whichever new pop singer's new single, does not contradict or diminish mgk's wager, but instead presents a crucial opportunity: Through his curation of influence, he's able to make an argument about what quintessentially American rock music is at a time when information overload has eroded our ability to place things in any coherent order. And if his self-crafted lineage happens to include some British songs, well, jacking for beats is as American as it gets.

When Joseph Badejo was a teenager, he closely studied Tyler, the Creator, a paragon for confused kids with contrived exteriors. A decade later, Badejo's stage name, wolfacejoeyy, pays tribute to Tyler—the “wolface” isn't “Wolf Face,” but “Wolf Ace,” a nod that almost feels at odds with his music. That the two artists seem so wildly different today is not only a testament to Badejo's craft, but the way times have changed. In the early 2010s, Odd Future proffered a guarded take on romance, macking exclusively in ways that preserved their risque cool: Swag first, sex—if at all—second. As wolfacejoeyy, Badejo poses a thirsty-ass counterpoint to this model, and thank God, because the last humans do not need to be Supreme resellers. Sexy drill is, coastally and rhetorically, the dialectic opposite of last decade's Los Angeles loiterers: shameless New Yorkers whose egos come second to their libidos. Fucking is more fun than pretending not to give one.

Case in point: Midway through “KIKI,” a standout of his new album, SUMMERSONGS, wolfacejoeyy gets so desperate, so shameless, that he crosses into delusion. “I know you like girls, boo,” he whines, staring down another rejection. “I like girls too!” It shouldn't work, because it's very stupid. But he knows this, and that's what makes it so wonderfully absurdist: Desire and dignity are negotiating, and desire is beating dignity's ass. Badejo has long mastered his performance of the relentless club rat, a slick-mouthed character whose persistence is so annoying it's endearing. For a while, this effect was inextricable from his youth. When he rapped about being too young for the club, it gave him a bratty vibe, the air of a swagged-out kid with a fake ID flirting with everyone he saw. Some of this snark remains on SUMMERSONGS, a low-stakes LP for showing some skin to. But more so than his other projects, Badejo's latest feels like a grown-up record, which is saying a lot for someone who name-drops porn stars.

It's true: The horny 21 year-old who made “Alexis Texas” is hornier at 22, and yet, somehow, a bit easier to take seriously. SUMMERSONGS trades the overcrowded, strobe-lit nightclub feel of his earlier work for the intimacy of a back-patio kickback—congas, staccato rhythms, slower BPMS, the occasional guitar lick. It's a snug fit for his sleazy sing-rap, but materially, the looser palette also gives him more room to refine his seductive craft: no longer an out-of-breath pickup artist but a self-assured charmer, buzzing from a margarita and feeling invincible. Take the sexy-drill slow-dance “4 ME,” which makes his dirty-macking feel like a business offer. “Don't play me like 2K,” he warns at one point, “I might spend it on your sweater.” Even if it's corny, it's effective, because he's deadass: a shameless player willing to spend, even if it means he'll have to buy 2k26 on Klarna. The laid-back cadence of “THE BIRTHDAY SONG” aptly suits its premise of a hopeless romantic—lightly drunk, highly disciplined—sweet-talking his way into your sweater. His delivery camouflages his desperation, masterfully concealing his bug-eyed lust.

Drill music is fundamentally kinetic, and in Badejo's New York, that energy has adopted a certain look: tattered jeans, subway-surfing nihilists, mayoral PSAs, vape smoke. SUMMERSONGS maintains that contact-sport ethos, but imagines the contact differently—less Timbs-to-asphalt than skin-to-skin, mouth-to-ear. In its simplicity, it strikes a crucial balance between the chaos of desire and the vulnerability of acting on it. When you hear Badejo's drunken drawl on “KANYE KIM,” or his fly-to-fuck fantasies on “TRIP,” you can practically smell the beer on his breath, feel the words warming your face. The more I hear SUMMERSONGS, the more I imagine a golden-hour backyard party, all clattering glasses and loose arms slung over sweat-slicked shoulders. For the first time in his career, wolfacejoeyy sounds more like the host than the kid who snuck in.

August 14, 2025

GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND is a collaboration between a shaman and a man tentatively allowing magic to creep back into his work. The first is Arrington de Dionyso, frontman of the feral blues-punk band Old Time Relijun, whose artistic practice includes communicating with trees, performing sacred mushroom songs, and emergency rituals to avert nuclear war. The second is Phil Elverum, one-time Old Time Relijun drummer and erstwhile Microphones and Mount Eerie mastermind. Although his recent output has largely rejected the mysticism of his earlier work, the clicking of rocks and sticks formed a recurring motif on Mount Eerie's recent Night Palace, like a spell to spur new growth in the scorched spaces in his songs.

Maybe the leap of faith required to believe in magic is also a prerequisite for getting into GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND, which consists of Elverum turning the knob on a homemade gong-subwoofer contraption while Dionyso unleashes all manner of woodwinds. This is not music that required a lot of elbow grease to make, beyond the construction of the instrument itself—which is the kind of thing that'd merit a human interest story in the local paper even if these guys weren't already famous. If you find something inherently comical about noise music, Giant Mouth will not dissuade you; if you find something mystical about it, a fulfillment of the promise that music can invoke a presence bigger than the sum of its parts, you might listen with pangs of genuine awe.

The album opens with an onomatopoeic scream, “AAAWAAHAAAL,” which almost certainly comes from Dionyso, unless Elverum has a killer hair-metal vibrato we didn't know about. (The two are karaoke buddies, and it was in fact Dionyso who recorded Elverum singing “Got Money” in one of the crucial pieces of Elverum lore.) “Ear Home” follows with a choir of woodwinds blowing madly, including a flute used in spirit possession rituals by the Kaili people of Sulawesi, to summon whatever it is the gong is supposed to represent: some kind of primal force, something big and ancient bearing down on you. That sound doesn't let up for the next 20 minutes, and though sometimes its shrieks are so pained as to seem ridiculous, there's always a low-end thrum tugging the music back towards the earth. It doesn't just drone: It circles, stalks, and paces the stereo field. You don't always know what channel it's going to come from.

Dionyso and Elverum recorded this music in 2014 and let it sit for more than a decade, giving the music time to ferment like a pungent brick of tea, picking up funky new undertones upon ripening. For Elverum fans, the distance is crucial for another reason: This is the first music he's released since the passing of his wife, Geneviève, in 2016, that is not informed, either explicitly or implicitly, by her death. That shattering of Elverum's life led to a shattering of his musical assumptions, not least the metaphorical treatment of death in his work and the association of the vastness of nature with a memento mori. Even Night Palace, which was informed by nature-worshipping masterpieces like The Glow, Pt. 2 and Clear Moon, seemed conflicted about assigning meaning to the windswept vistas to which it traveled.

GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND, meanwhile, roots unapologetically in the dirt like a truffling pig for the greater spiritual truth that has so many names in Elverum's work: the Glow, the Gleam, the lone bell echoing in the hills, the second lake that has never been seen. On The Glow Pt. 2 it's the infamous foghorn, the most haunting sound in indie rock this side of John Darnielle's boombox hum. Here, it's—well, a GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND. If the choice to bestow such a grandiose moniker upon a collection of tracks that take as long to listen to as they did to record doesn't make clear the disproportionately exalted intent behind this music's creation, the play-by-play on Elverum's increasingly essential Substack (“the earth folds in on itself”) certainly should.

It feels like an acknowledgement of a truce with his younger and more credulous self that Elverum would release this music so casually, on his own label, with so little apprehension beyond his frank acknowledgment that this isn't something people who learned “You'll Be in the Air” on ukulele would necessarily want to pair with their morning coffee. It'd be easy enough to write off GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND as a byproduct of friends “just trying to blow each others' minds,” as Elverum described on The Microphones in 2020, but if you approach it with the sense of wonder with which its creators approached its making, you might start to feel the magic seep into your bones.

Lana Del Rey has shared a snippet of a song known to fans for a lyric directed at Ethel Cain. A video clip posted on her Instagram page yesterday shows Del Rey driving as the song plays in the background, starting with the lyric in question: “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post/Think it's cute reenacting my Chicago pose.” Watch it on her Instagram page.

While bits and pieces of the song have leaked over the years, this is the most substantial chunk yet of what appears to be a formal recording. Fans have surmised that the lyrics relate to Cain's apparent involvement with Salem's Jack Donoghue, Del Rey's ex. The mention of an Instagram post in the lyrics seemingly refers to a pair of posts, by the respective artists, in 2022: Del Rey with Donoghue outside a prison; Cain with him by a dam. Another portion of the song, in which she sings the line “The most famous girl at the Waffle House,” is a quote of the headline of an Ethel Cain profile in The New York Times. (Del Rey subsequently took a pretend shift at a Waffle House in Alabama.) Cain is also thought to have alluded to Lana Del Rey on social media in the past.

Del Rey recently debuted new music at Stagecoach festival. The new songs are believed to be in line for a new album that has been referred to either as Lasso or The Right Person Will Stay.

Taylor Swift was living for Bad Bunny‘s comedic timing in Happy Gilmore 2, just like the rest of us. During her interview on New Heights with Travis and Jason Kelce, Swift shared how funny she thought the Puerto Rican star was in the Adam Sandler film, which also stars her boyfriend, Travis.


	“Bad Bunny? He absolutely delighted me in that movie,” said Swift on the podcast.


	“He was so good!” responded Kelce.


	“His comedic timing is so good,” Swift continued. “His character name is Oscar, and it's like, his brother gets hit by the golf ball. And they look over and they're like, ‘Who did that? You did that?' And there's a face that Bad Bunny makes, and they do the kind of like the pan or zoom. I was like, ‘Who thought of that? How did they know he could be that way!' I watched it five times.”


	“He's so funny. He's so good. I felt so much for his character,” she added.

	The Bad Bunny conversation came about after Swift was asked to clarify silly rumors that she plays the costumed bear in Happy Gilmore 2. (The animal is in a major scene alongside Travis Kelce in the film.)

	











	“I can deny! This is one of those ones where we'll send it to each other … Of course they think I'm inside of a bear costume, like, I'm honored to be thought of in that context, because I loved that movie so much,” she said. “Whoever did the bear's acting was exquisite.”

	Upon its release, Swift encouraged her friends and fans to go watch the movie on Netflix. “Happy Gilmore 2 had me cackling and cheering the whole movie!” Swift wrote on Instagram at the time. “An absolute must watch, 13/10, go watch it on @netflix as soon as humanly possible.”

	











	Also during the New Heights podcast appearance, Swift unveiled the title, track list, and cover art of her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl. The album was produced with Max Martin and Shellback, and was made as she went on her Eras Tour in Europe last summer.

	A month after a Florida judge said Priscilla Presley's 2024 financial elder abuse claims would take the lead over a related 2023 lawsuit accusing her of breach of contract, the former business partners facing off against Priscilla in both cases are expanding their legal war.


	On Monday, memorabilia dealer Brigitte Kruse and investor Kevin Fialko filed a new $50 million fraud and breach of contract lawsuit against Presley in Beverly Hills that re-ups many of the same causes of action recently placed on the back burner in Orlando. But the new complaint doesn't stop there. It also escalates the acrimony with the eye-popping claim that Priscilla hastened her daughter Lisa Marie Presley's tragic death in January 2023 for financial gain. And it adds Stan Lee's ex-manager, Keya Morgan, as a new co-defendant tied to claims that he interfered with the partners' contracts with Priscilla.


	Regarding its most shocking new claim, the complaint attaches Lisa Marie's advanced health care directive as an exhibit. On the document, Lisa Marie wrote her initials and two exclamation points next to the line that said she wanted her life to be “prolonged as long as possible within the limits of generally accepted healthcare standards.” In the new lawsuit, Kruse and Fialko allege that Priscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and took control of her daughter's care when Lisa Marie suffered a small bowel obstruction in January 2023 as a complication from weight loss surgery.

	











	“Despite Lisa's clear directive to ‘prolong her life,' Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, and before her granddaughter, Riley [Keough] was able to get to the hospital,” the new lawsuit alleges. The complaint says Priscilla then demanded that Kruse issue a media statement announcing the death. According to the complaint, “Priscilla knew that Lisa's death neutralized the threat of Lisa's efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisa's irrevocable life insurance trust, and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland.”

	In a lengthy statement sent to Rolling Stone, Priscilla's lawyer, Marty Singer, blasted the new lawsuit as “one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious, and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice.”


	“Accusing a grieving mother of contributing to her daughter's death is not savvy advocacy; it is malicious character assassination and should be broadly condemned. These fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed,” Singer wrote in his statement. He went on to slam the lawsuit as a “sad and vicious attempt to falsely tarnish the reputation of an eighty-year-old woman in blatant retaliation for bringing a lawsuit to redress the wrongful conduct of Brigitte Kruse, Kevin Fialko, and their coconspirators.”


	According to both the Florida case and the new Los Angeles County-based complaint, Kruse and Fialko allege that after Lisa Marie's death, Priscilla's fortunes changed, and she subsequently walked out on a series of companies they had formed to exploit her name, image, and likeness. They allege they invested heavily to pull Priscilla back from the brink of insolvency and were later shunned, in violation of their agreements.


	As Rolling Stone previously reported, a few weeks after Lisa Marie's death, Priscilla challenged a 2016 amendment to her daughter's Promenade Trust that removed Priscilla as a trustee and replaced her with Keough. The change meant Priscilla lost influence over her daughter's assets, including Graceland mansion, its archives, and Lisa Marie's 15 percent interest in Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that owns and manages Elvis' name, image, and likeness. Priscilla wanted the court to declare the amendment “invalid.”

	With a potential legal war looming, Keough reached a generous settlement with her grandmother in a matter of months. Under the deal, Priscilla received a $1 million lump-sum payment off the top of Lisa Marie's $25 million life insurance policy. Keough also agreed to pay Priscilla $50,000 to resign as co-trustee of the irrevocable trust whose sole asset was the life insurance policy. And Priscilla was awarded an annual salary of $100,000 for 10 years for her new role as a “special advisor” to the Promenade Trust.


	Five months after she settled with Keough, Priscilla was hit with the first breach of contract lawsuit over the Kruse and Fialko partnership. The author, actress, and ex-wife of Elvis quickly sought to dismiss the complaint. Then last summer, she filed her bombshell claims of financial elder abuse.

	











	In her July 2024 complaint, Priscilla claimed Kruse and Fialko “manipulated and defrauded” her out of more than $1 million. She said the pair placed a “stranglehold” on her finances with contracts that gave Kruse a controlling 51 percent interest in Priscilla's intellectual property in perpetuity. She said another related venture gave Priscilla only a 20 percent share. Priscilla and her lawyers called the deals too “egregious” and “unconscionable” to be enforceable. 


	In the July 9 ruling that stayed the Florida litigation in favor of Priscilla's elder abuse lawsuit, the Orlando-based judge said he was placing the breach of contract case in a holding pattern because it didn't make sense to “enforce rights under agreements” when the “validity” of the agreements remained “squarely in dispute in the California case.” That ruling set the stage for Kruse and Fialko to file their claims on the West Coast.


	“My clients are very adamant they want to get to the merits of the case. They want the truth out, and they want to be vindicated,” Kruse and Fialko's lawyer, Jordan Matthews, tells Rolling Stone. “They want their day in court.”

	While Priscilla maintains she was duped into signing the business contracts with Kruse and Fialko, the former partners say she understood everything. Video unearthed by Rolling Stone shows Priscilla signing the contracts at Kruse's house with a lawyer present.


	In a statement sent to Rolling Stone late Wednesday, Morgan defended his work with Priscilla. “I've known Priscilla Presley and her family for many years, and she has a heart of gold, is an incredible human being, and a true legend and American icon [who] should be protected,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, I've read a lot of malicious lies recently which are not true, and the truth will ultimately prevail.”

Goose stopped by The Tonight Show to showcase their new single, “Madalena.” The song comes off the band's surprise LP, Chain Yer Dragon, which dropped at midnight. 


	The Connecticut group offered an emotionally-resonate performance of the mid-tempo jam-rock tune, which follows on the heels of their recent single, “Royal.” 


Chain Yer Dragon is Goose's first new music since Everything Must Go, which arrived in April. Everything Must Go marked Goose's fourth studio album, following 2022's Dripfield. It was produced by D. James Goodwin, who was also behind the boards for Dripfield. It was also the first Goose studio album to feature new drummer Cotter Ellis, who joined the band last year. In March, the band parted ways with percussionist/multi-instrumentalist Jeff Arevalo.

W
e're going to miss this show.” 


	I'm in the passenger seat of a new-model Mercedes that's basically parked in Paris traffic. Steve Lacy sits in the back on aux duty, running through a playlist featuring the French electronic duo Air, M.I.A., and Faye Webster. We're heading to the Bourse de Commerce, where Yves Saint Laurent's Spring Summer 2026 presentation is about to start. Except, we're not making very much progress. The journey from Lacy's hotel to the venue should only take a few minutes, but we've been moving at the speed of dial-up. Our driver cuts down an alley, a ruelle in the local parlance, only to run into more gridlock. Making matters worse, a car emerges in the rearview, boxing us in. If we want to get to the show in time, we'll have to walk. Fast. 


	Lacy was named a brand ambassador for YSL back in 2023 and attends its menswear presentation, typically held in Paris, every year during fashion week. On this sweltering Tuesday afternoon in June, he wears a full YSL outfit replete with slim-fitting leather pants, tall black leather boots that almost serve as pants in their own right, and a crisp, white, geometrically tailored button-up, all from previous years' collections.

	











	Once our driver stops to let us out, Lacy bolts from the car in what appears to be a single, fluid motion. I notice a few necks crane in astonishment — your eyes are not deceiving you, that is indeed Grammy-winning musician Steve Lacy speed-walking down the streets of Paris in thigh-high Saint Laurent boots, looking exactly like a rock star. 




	Lacy is perhaps best known for his chart-topping 2022 single, “Bad Habit,” one of the first bona fide hits of the post-pandemic era. Everywhere you looked, swiped, or scrolled, you heard that chorus — “I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit” — capturing the specific regret of not taking a chance with a crush. The song's candidly self-deprecating hook — “I wish I knew you wanted me” — helped make it stick, connecting with something universal, even a bit profound, while maintaining a featherlight sense of levity. “That's literally how conversations with me go,” Lacy says. “It's like, a thought here and something profound there, and then a joke right after that.”

	As the second single from his sophomore album, Gemini Rights, the track had an immediate, nearly alchemical quality. Its buoyant drums clomping beneath equally rambunctious guitar riffs hit like a scientific fact. It would be nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2023 Grammys, along with Gemini Rights, for which Lacy won Best Progressive R&B Album.


	Before he became a solo artist, Lacy, 27, made music as a member of the group the Internet, alongside singer-songwriter Syd and producer Matt Martians, who were then established names within the L.A.-based Odd Future collective. He served as co-executive producer on the group's breakout album, Ego Death, which earned him his first Grammy nomination, in 2016, while he was still in high school. “I love the first thing I ever worked on being called Ego Death,” he says. “I came in egoless.” 


	The story of how Lacy's career started is like something out of a VH1 biopic: A shy and talented teenager from Compton who'd lost his father to cancer meets a group of gifted young musicians who take him in and nurture his skills before he becomes a superstar. “When Steve was young, his mom was really protective of him. We were the only people that she trusted Steve to be out the house with when he was 15, 16,” Martians recalls. At some point during the Ego Death sessions, Martians needed a bass line for a track and asked to hear some of the music Lacy had been working on. “He started playing me a lot of the stuff that he had been making on his phone at the time. And I was blown away. I was like, ‘This is the type of music you make? This is insane,' ” Martians says. “He was really shy. He didn't realize how good he was.”

	Cue the montage showing Lacy's mastery of every instrument under the sun. Not only guitar, but drums, bass, and, as of late, synthesizers. Of course, he can sing, too. In the music video for “Playground,” from his debut album, Apollo XXI, he's in a band composed entirely of other Steve Lacys, which seems fitting. 


	Shortly after the release of Ego Death, Lacy met Kendrick Lamar, who he would eventually work with on “Pride,” from Kendrick's 2017 album, DAMN. Naturally, Lacy remembers his first encounter with the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper in cinematic fashion. “I come in, I got all this shit on me, and Kendrick's like, ‘I seen your face in some music videos,' ” Lacy recalls. “I said, ‘Hey, yours too, man.' And then he laughed.” Lacy timidly offered to play Lamar some of the music he'd been making at the time, and one of those tracks would go on to become “Pride,” which earlier this year joined “Bad Habit” and “Dark Red” on the list of Steve Lacy productions to top 1 billion streams on Spotify alone. 

	











	It was Gemini Rights that solidified Lacy among his generation's greats. The album's fluidity of genre — skating between funk, pop, rock, R&B, and hip-hop with the ease of a Spotify playlist — spoke to a cultural sensibility among Gen Z'ers, whose experience with music has so far been defined by infinite everything all of the time. The record also seemed to naturally strike a chord on TikTok, where in addition to “Bad Habit,” the album opener, “Static,” became ubiquitous as the go-to audio for the viral trend “English or Spanish,” where users stood stone frozen, backed by Lacy's iconic opening lines — “Baby, you got something in your nose. Sniffin' that K, did you fill the hole?”


	“I find a lot of music today online and stuff. I don't really believe in the whole attention-span conversation,” he says, referring to the belief that platforms like TikTok are depleting his generation's ability to focus. “I think people gravitate toward the strongest moments of things.”


	We arrive at the Bourse de Commerce — a concentric palace, once home to France's open-air wheat exchange and now dedicated to the arts — in the nick of time, albeit at the wrong entrance. Korean pop star Cha Eun-woo draws squeals from the crowd of fans gathered out front, while security ushers Lacy through a small throng of civilians on the side of the building, up to where he's supposed to have his photo taken. Once we get inside, greeted by artist Céleste Boursier-Mougenot's installation “Clinamen,” featuring a basin filled with crystalline water and speckled with floating white ceramic bowls, it's a flurry of double-cheek kisses and about three dozen “Hey, how are you's?” Lacy flashes a mischievous grin and tells me he “might” have taken an edible earlier. “I don't know if I did. Or if the edible took me,” he tells me after the show. I ask if having to walk to the event in 90-degree heat bothered him. “I don't overthink these things.” 


	Nowadays, Lacy is mostly thinking about music. His new album, slated to drop in the near future, is called Oh Yeah? and features cover art that calls to mind a fictional beverage mascot known for bursting through walls. “I took his face out the glass. Hopefully I don't get sued,” he jokes. Lacy's been teasing the project in plain sight, wearing merch for the album in photos on his socials, all while fans clamor for new music. As for what inspired him to call his album Oh Yeah?, all Lacy says is “the question's important.” For how tongue-in-cheek it all seems, the record is undoubtedly Lacy's most confident work yet. “This one has taken a lot of time and thought,” he says. “I keep using the word ‘design.' It feels like fully designing a new language for myself.” 

“For a while, words were just kind of secondary. But   now I'm like, ‘OK, I want to say shit how I would say shit.' ”


	Despite his penchant for memorable lines (“Dark Red,” opens with “Something bad is about to happen to me”), Lacy says this album marks the first time he's consciously thought about lyrics. “When I first started making shit or producing stuff with the Internet, I would always make the beat, make a hook, and just give it away,” he says. “That was my process for a while, so words were always just kind of secondary. I'm like, ‘If my beat hard, this bass line hard, the chords hard, what else do we need?' But now I'm like, ‘OK, I want to say shit how I would say shit.' ”


	The day before the YSL show, I'm in the car with Lacy, who is, of course, in charge of music, this time playing the latest version of songs from the album. We're en route to a video shoot on the Seine, and along the way, we're served an up-close view of Parisian landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. You get a fuller sense of music when listening in the contained private amphitheater of a good car stereo. The subtleties and texture in the vocals, the tactile rumble of drums, and the almost effervescent guitar melodies. The tracks I hear strike a personal, introspective tone, as if Lacy's taken the perceptive and cunning lens he's used to observe life and love from 10,000 feet, and turned it inward. He inhabits these songs emotionally, exploring themes around his racial identity, his relationship to love and trust, and his own sexual fluidity, all with the halfway comedic, occasionally devastating style of observation he's built a career on. “I feel like I could just say shit, but also have little pokes at real human shit that you need to know and realize,” he says. “It's a mix of stupid shit and real-ass bars.” 


	Lacy self-produced Oh Yeah? Sonically, the album is adventurous, diving into sounds like trip-hop and electronic while also building classic rock ballads fit for stadiums and arenas. In the past few years, Lacy's taken an interest in synthesizers, which you can hear on his new songs. Famously, Lacy's favorite band is Stereolab, and on his latest record he channels the Anglo-French group's playfully melodic sensibility. The result is the type of all-encompassing pop album that artists like Prince (to whom Lacy is frequently compared) used to make. “When I heard the album, I said, ‘You really made a pop album. And not pop in the sense of current-day pop, but pop what it used to be as far as greats,' ” Martians says. “He is getting into areas that I feel like are very reminiscent of a pop of yesteryear, which is very good.”


	Lacy plays me “Nice Shoes,” which he describes as a “trailer” for this new moment in his career. He says he plans to release the song alongside this story — it's out at midnight tonight, in fact. The track, as yet untitled, rides a drum-and-bass-style breakbeat that could best be described as filthy. The lyrics volley between playful and insightful, with Lacy musing on his dick getting hard at the thought of holding hands with his new crush — “romantic boners,” as he describes it to me — as well as the sometimes subtle nature of melancholy. “Crazy how you could be sad and not notice,” he sings. “All I need is my guitar and serotonin.” 

	











	Indeed, fans needn't worry that Lacy has abandoned the guitar for electronics. Toward the song's end, the bpm cuts in half, and he's back on the six-string, plucking a quintessential Steve Lacy melody before his vocals glitch out, segueing into the break. Just like how he wants his lyrics to reflect the way he talks, Lacy is ready for his music to showcase parts of his personality and tastes he hasn't let us in on yet. 


	BACK AT HIS hotel, in one of those tiny elevators that apparently plague the city of Paris, Lacy tells me how he's become jaded about fashion week events. He finds the small talk and obligatory niceties draining. Also, he doesn't quite see himself as a celebrity. Incidentally, that's why he feels so comfortable in Paris, a city with a far less pervasive obsession with fame than most places in the U.S. Lacy's been traveling to Paris on and off from his home in Los Angeles to record the album. The weekend before we meet, Lacy went to Beyoncé's tour stop in the city (where Jay-Z would join her onstage for a Kanye-less rendition of “Ni**as in Paris”). He wasn't backstage or in a VIP section, but in the crowd alongside his pal, musician Moses Sumney, whom he met at a pre-Grammy brunch around 2016. “We went as fans, took the train, we're in the crowd, and I'm like, ‘In L.A. that would be crazy,' ” he says. “But here, it was so cool and chill.” 

“I don't drink the Kool-Aid. I'm a student before anything.”


	Lacy has mastered a kind of low-key fame, in which his fans are legitimately obsessed with him, and the music's always good enough to make a splash in the mainstream — enough for him to get invited to fashion shows in Paris. He cites artists like Frank Ocean, Tyler, the Creator, and Solange as having the type of career he can see for himself. “They never conformed to the shape of pop music. But they can probably do whatever they want and headline whatever festival,” he says. “They all designed their own worlds, and people come to them.”


	It's par for the course among the current generation of superstars. Everywhere you look these days, the biggest names in music are looking to shed the artifice of celebrity in search of more authentic audience connections. It's Charli XCX hosting raves, or Drake linking up with young streamers and content creators like Kai Cenat, or Justin Bieber's new album, Swag, where he ditches his polished heartthrob image for a more unfiltered and down-to-earth persona influenced by his actual personal taste. 

	











	Lacy embodies this naturally, which often means treating fame more like an annoying sibling following him around than a fact of life. “I don't drink the Kool-Aid because I'm a student first before anything,” he says. “I remember when I was first popping and people were talking crazy at me online. I remember bitching to my mom like, ‘Why the fuck is anybody bothering me? I just want to make music.' She was like, ‘Steve, you're blessed with this platform. You need to be grateful.' ” Lacy says he's been able to pass on that knowledge to up-and-coming stars like PinkPantheress, who said in an interview in i-D that he helped her navigate the sudden onset of viral fame. “Matt Martians was like that to me,” Lacy says. “So it's cool that I can pay it forward and be that person for the other youngsters.” 


	In 2022, as “Bad Habit” reached peak virality, live venues began easing Covid restrictions, making for a long-awaited return of concerts. As he toured in support of Gemini Rights, Lacy went from being a relatively obscure act with a devoted fan base to a mainstream star with thousands of screaming teenage fans. He caught some heat after smashing a camera a fan threw onstage during one of his shows; a clip of the incident went viral. He brings up how many outlets got the facts of the story wrong. “That's when I kind of understood what fame was,” he says. “The story was that I broke this [guy's] phone and I ended the show. I was like, ‘Oh, wow. Niggas just lie.' I finished the show. I was like, ‘Just make sure that person gets kicked out.' Because why the fuck are you throwing shit at me?”


	Going viral right at the start of his tour was a learning experience for Lacy. “It was a culture shock for me because I was so used to being niche, a cool music-nerd person,” he says. “I think going on the road post-Covid and going viral at the same time invited a lot of rambunctious kids who are going to concerts for the first time. So at first, my body rejected it. And then I think by the end, I was so happy with their rambunctiousness because I'm like, ‘Oh, this is their first show. I'm showing them how to be at a concert, so I want to embrace that energy myself.' ”


	After that tour, Lacy went relatively quiet, a move that's somewhat atypical for an artist who just had a Number One hit and the biggest song of his career. “Anyone else in my position would be like, ‘Ride this wave,' but I know I'm going to be here for a little bit. I ain't worried about that shit,” he says. He sees vindication for his approach in the devotion of the Internet's fans, who still obsess over clues around possible new music, seven years after their last album. (Lacy says the group has been “hanging out” and that we can expect new music soon.) 

	











	“Time is crazy, man, it really tells you. And I think this is why I feel so confident in my choices and my timing, because everything has been so slow and drawn out,” he says. “ ‘Dark Red' went platinum five or six years later. So I don't feel super stressed or entitled to quick virality. I remember even when I first signed to RCA, they were like, ‘So what do you want?' I was like, ‘Man, I want to be as big as I should be. I don't want to be bigger than I need to be.' ”


	Now, after scoring a chart-topping single and a Grammy-winning album, just how big should Steve Lacy be? Outside the YSL show, the 20-year-old singer-songwriter Sombr, real name Shane Michael Boose, comes up to Lacy and tells him he's one of his heroes. You could say that Sombr is among the first artists to emerge from the generation most directly influenced by Lacy's music. The budding pop sensation is having a Lacy-esque rise himself. In the past year, he's nabbed two Top 40 singles, in part thanks to the hyperactive powers of TikTok's algorithm. For his part, Lacy can sometimes feel unmoored by the age difference between him and some of his fans. “This one girl was like, ‘Man, we need the music. I had just graduated high school since the last thing came out,' ” Lacy says. “I was like, ‘Why the fuck do you got to say it like that?' ” 

“My little ass was gassed the fuck up. I needed to be humbled. It was good for me.”


	One of the reasons Lacy wanted to attend the YSL show, beyond his love of the clothes, was to formally introduce his new hairstyle, a sharp, clean-cut fade, which he says is the first part of his new era. For years, he sported medium-length braids. “I always change my hair right after I'm done with some shit,” he says. “I couldn't imagine what else I could do from those braids.” Lacy has the same barber as Tyler, the Creator, and ran into him at one of Tyler's listening parties in Los Angeles last year, after spending several days contemplating the change. Taking the encounter as a sign, Lacy went ahead with the cut, though the transition was intense. “It was so emotional. I cried on the way,” he says.


	Lacy has an easy, sun-soaked California cool. Even when dressed to the nines, he carries an air of comfortable grace, like a dancer. The haircut uncovers his face, chiseled and boyish, like a young Michael Jackson. Before he heads to the show's afterparty, we stop for a drink at a nearby restaurant, where Lacy explains how he stopped smoking a few years back in service of his voice. A stoner at heart, he's taken to edibles as his high of choice. It's all part of a more intentional ethos that's been guiding Lacy since the release of Gemini Rights. He says on this new album he “understand[s] energy more than I did on the last one.” 


	One theme that stands out on the album is romance — or a lack thereof. Lacy's new music maintains his sly sense of humor, but with a barefaced melancholy that pushes it to new emotional depths. “I remember I was playing the songs for the label a couple of months ago,” Lacy says. “They were like, ‘All right, now play some happier ones.' And I was like, ‘Fuck.' ” He attributes much of the doom and gloom of those early tracks to a breakup last fall that, for a while, had him reevaluating his relationship to love. 

	











	Thankfully for Lacy — and the label — he has been making happier songs, too. Lately, in fact, he's feeling very romantic. A few weeks before he left for Paris, he met someone. They met “how the kids meet,” he says coyly, by which he means “digitally.” 


	“On our third date, it was his birthday, and he wanted to see me, and he was with all of his friends rolling deep as fuck with maybe eight or nine people,” Lacy recalls. “I've stopped talking to people I was dating because they wanted me to hang out with their friends, but with him, I met all his friends, and I even hosted the afters for him. That's how I know I'm crushing hard, because I don't do that shit for anyone.” Lacy's ex was even seated near him at the YSL show, though he was emotionally prepared this time as opposed to last year, where their presence at the same event arrived like a “jump scare.” He partially credits his new romance with his current sense of peace with the situation. 


	He's found a renewed love for music as well. On one of his trips to Paris this year, he found a particular guitar that managed to rekindle his passion for the instrument. Up to then, Lacy had been feeling like the sound was becoming cliché. “I went to Paris, and I bought this Gibson from 1990, and it's got me playing guitar again, so that's pretty exciting,” he says. “For a while, I was just on this synth and on my bass, but I feel like a rock star again, a guitar rock star.” 


	LACY WAS BORN in Compton, the California city he describes as equal parts magical and misunderstood. “I don't have to worry about putting Compton on the map,” he says, citing the city's history of producing legendary artists. “There's a lot of negative stuff, but there's also so much positive stuff to come out of the city.”


	Lacy's mother is Black, and his dad was Filipino. They met at work — Lacy's mom was a nurse and his father was a handyman at the hospital where she worked — before getting married and having two kids, Steve and his younger sister. (His mother had two daughters from a previous marriage.) Lacy's parents split when he was young, and when he was 10, his father died of lung cancer. He says he never got to engage much culturally with his dad's side of his identity. “It's slipped away from me,” he says. “I have to rely on stories of loved ones to give me more information.” 

“I grew up around lots of death. It affects the way I treat life.” 


	Growing up in Compton with identifiably Black features, Lacy remembers friends asking him who his dad was. “When I was younger, I just looked Black,” he says. “My Filipino features came in as I got older. So I was like, ‘Somebody's lying to me. Who the fuck is this man picking up my sister and I?' ”


	Lacy only saw his father sporadically growing up, so when he died, Lacy was unsure how to feel. He remembers crying once. “It was so abstract to me. I remember questioning how sad I could be with someone who was so occasional,” he says. “And then as I grew up, I understood that there are just things that you learn from your father that I just don't have. I think the saddest part is kind of just finding out for yourself what those things are. But he still be around, though. I got a relationship with the dead. I feel him sometimes.” 

	











	Having family overseas taught Lacy about different levels of poverty around the globe. Even after his father died, his mom would send money to his family in the Philippines. “We grew up in a three-bedroom with one bathroom, and we would pass up on McDonald's,” he explains. “She was still communicating with [his family] via Facebook and sending MoneyGram for like 50 bucks. She's like, ‘In the Philippines, you're rich, so you got to remember that.' ” Lacy mentions never seeing his parents show intimacy. He sees his current relationships as “trying to, like, correct their wrongs somehow. I guess I just want to prove to myself that I'm not them.”


	Lacy comes from a musical family. His mother was once an aspiring singer and has sung background vocals on Lacy's songs, along with his sisters. When he was around 10 years old, Lacy started playing guitar after watching the band in his church. “At the end of the service, they would just shred, and I would sit there and watch with my jaw to the floor, not moving,” he says. By then, he'd already become enamored with the guitar thanks to hours playing Guitar Hero. “When I was 10, I was obsessed with the instrument. I wanted to touch it. I wanted to be around it. I wanted to hear it,” he says. Before long, he'd start lessons. 


	When Lacy was in high school, his mother encouraged him to join the jazz band, which he did. Around 2012, his friend and classmate Jameel Bruner (Thundercat's younger brother) would fatefully introduce him to Matt Martians and the rest of the Internet, just as Odd Future started taking off. He started hanging around the bandmates, who were all much older than him, as they rehearsed. “It's kind of like the first freedom I got as a teenager because I grew up super sheltered. But my mom started to let me chill a little bit. I would go there, just watching. And I was really quiet. They called me Lil Steve.” (“I literally just changed his contact in my phone a couple months ago from ‘Lil Steve,' ” Syd tells me.)


	Martians wanted to ensure that Lacy was well positioned to launch his own career. “I would start telling him, ‘Look, we need to put together an album. Doesn't have to be long, doesn't have to be crazy, convoluted, but the world needs to be presented you by yourself,' which is why on Ego Death, he's in the band, but I chose to put him as a feature on ‘Palace/Curse.' I wanted to set up that transition to him being known as his own entity.”


	In 2017, right before he turned 19, he released Steve Lacy's Demo, recorded largely using GarageBand on a beat-up iPhone. Even early on, his songwriting skills stood out. Demo includes the sleeper hit “Dark Red,” a bouncy earworm that to date has racked up nearly 2 billion streams on Spotify alone and feels almost like a precursor to the equally infectious “Bad Habit.” 


	John Troutman, chair of the Smithsonian's division of culture and the arts, heard about how Lacy recorded the EP after reading about it in Wired. “It sounded like one of those stories that is just so incredible on so many different levels because it reflects his extraordinary talent at such a young age musically and as a producer,” Troutman says. 

	











	Troutman and his team were putting together an exhibit called “Entertainment Nation,” and they reached out to Lacy in 2017 to acquire the legendary iPhone. The show opened in 2022. “We opened right when ‘Bad Habit' was top of the charts, so the young folks who came through knew exactly who he was and were so surprised and delighted to see the iPhone,” says Krystal Klingenberg, a curator at the Smithsonian. 


	“We've seen teenagers bowing down in front of his phone,” Troutman adds.


	In 2019, Lacy sang about his queer identity for the first time, on his debut studio album, Apollo XXI. On “Like Me” he opens with a sort of preamble: “This is about me and what I am/I didn't wanna make it a big deal/But I did wanna make a song.” 


	Lacy says he “kind of waited” to come out. “I hid everything until I started doing things,” he says. “For example, I really love dance, all styles, contemporary, tap, hip-hop. I love modern dance. But growing up, I couldn't explore that 'cause I never wanted anyone to call me gay before I told them I was anything, gay or whatever, you know? It'd probably be easier if it were just like, ‘I'm g-word,' but I'm not g-word. It's fluid, and queer is a lot harder to explain than just being a gay dude.”

“For a while, I was just on this synth and on my bass, but I feel like a rock star again, a guitar rock star.”


	Lacy maintains a mischievous relationship with social media. He's liberal with how much he posts to his main feed on Instagram, and he'll occasionally pop out on TikTok, posting clips using current trends or showing up in videos with popular creators. And though he hasn't been doing it so much lately, Lacy's also known to clap back in the comments. Before officially coming out, fans on Tumblr and Twitter had already put together that he was queer. After a since-deleted tweet about racial dating preferences, a full-blown hate train emerged. Lacy says he learned from the experience. “I appreciate it now, I understand where it's coming from, and I have empathy for it,” he says. “I remember at the time it was really hard to hear,” he says.


	“I was just 18, that's how I came out, bro,” he says. “People found out about me kissing boys and girls from me getting canceled. But I needed that because my shit was too perfect. My little ass was gassed the fuck up. So I needed to be humbled. It was good for me.” As a queer Black artist, Lacy is cautious not to position himself as any kind of spokesperson. For Lacy, it's more important that all shades of experience see the light of day. “I feel like my whole mission is the humanization of Black people,” he says. “We have so many spectrums of emotions. I think it's so limited when it comes to what we can watch and ingest.”


	That idea is part of what made Kendrick Lamar's Pop-Out concert so special for Lacy, who appeared onstage alongside a host of West Coast rappers. “That was so beautiful and profound because I think when you're in Compton, you only see one type of music being blasted. So I never expected what I was doing to be respected or a part of the conversation of what Compton is,” he says. “So to be there and to feel that love and to be amongst other artists from Compton, who are doing the thing that Compton is too, was very special.” 

	











	Though his appearance at the event seemingly miffed Drake, who called him a “fragile opp” (something akin to being an enemy) on a stream with xQc last year, Lacy says he found the comment endearing: “I love Drake; I grew up listening to Drake and shit.” 


	A word that comes up a lot in our conversation is “fluid.” I get the impression that very little remains fixed with Lacy. “I love how my fluidity has just felt through the music,” he says. “I feel like a lot of people use the gay bug to market their shit. And I never did.” Music allows Lacy to express all of the different parts of himself. “It helps me form an identity somehow. Like the story writes itself, you know?” He says his favorite song of his is “Static,” from Gemini Rights, “because it was so honest.” The song finds Lacy unfiltered about his romantic frustrations. “Lookin' for a bitch, 'cause I'm over boys,” he sings. 


	“I was so pissed off when I wrote that song, and I remember listening to it back, and I was like, it feels like when you're so mad you want to cry.” His new music, he says, is fueled by the same level of transparency, “but more.” “I'm like, I want more emotion, raw emotion. And I want to just say it to you directly.” 


	“I think he's always been very open,” Syd says. “I think that's one of his superpowers. His ability to be himself no matter what anybody else thinks.”


	Some of Lacy's directness comes from his relationship with death. “I grew up around lots of death,” he says, citing not just his father but also the violence in his neighborhood. “I think it affects the way that I treat life and people. I don't feel so entitled to people's time. I just kind of want to make the most of it.” 

	











	After Lacy heads to the YSL afterparty (I'm not invited), I meet up with a friend in town and head to a party hosted by a local gallery. As it happens, I run into Lacy there. He tells me the official afterparty was boring and seems to be enjoying this function, a far more low-key affair, much more. He mentions he's now run into two exes on this Paris trip — the one from last fall and his first ex, from when he was 19. Not only that, but these two exes have apparently become friends. (He jokes later about “putting that dick on the map.”) It's a scenario that would send me running for the Seine, but one that seems not to bother Lacy, as he exchanges friendly conversations with both. 

“I love how my fluidity is just felt through the music. I feel like a lot of people use the gay bug to market their shit. And I never did.”


	It's a little after midnight, and the party has migrated from the sweaty dance floor to the sidewalk, where cigarettes and nondescript party favors exchange hands with clandestine rhythm. Lacy greets me with a hug, though I can tell he's being careful not to get too loose in front of a journalist. “You're gonna be a part of this moment, you know,” he tells me. I joke with him about the lyrics to his new song: “If there were ever a time to let it out, it'd be now.” He sings the unreleased lyrics in a stirringly perfect pitch before someone taps him on the shoulder to chat. 


	The next day, we're back in Paris traffic, this time headed to L'art de L'automobile, a private garage that's more like a winding concrete shrine to classic sports cars. It's owned by Lacy's friend Arthur Karakoumouchian, known among artists as a purveyor of the finest and rarest European sports cars. The two had a mutual friend in the late designer Virgil Abloh, whom Lacy met at an Apple event before walking in Abloh's first Louis Vuitton show. (“I had a sad realization the other day,” he remembers. “The only gift that I ever got from Virgil was a clock that went backwards.”) 


	While not totally a car guy, Lacy has an affinity for Porsches and remembers driving a Tesla when he got into an accident back in 2020. Living in Topanga at the time, Lacy was navigating a curve when a drunk driver hit him head-on. “They were coming in my fucking lane, bro,” he recalls. “I had a thought, ‘Man, we put so much trust in these lines in between us.' ” Lacy, thankfully, wasn't hurt, but “saw the black flash,” he says. “It was intense, and my brain was going so many different places. I remember afterwards being like, ‘If you were to die in that moment, would you have been satisfied with everything?' And I remember being like, ‘I think the only thing I would've changed was I want to be more transparent.' That was my only note for myself.” 


	This reminds me of something he told me earlier that day, about the time he met Jay-Z, not long ago. They were backstage at an event and Jay was watching one of his kids, halfway paying attention to the people around him. “I have nephews and stuff, so I know when I'm bored with adults, I'm going to focus on the kid, you know? He was kind of doing that — watching the kid, but sitting around. And no one's talking to him. So I'm like, ‘I'm about to go sit and talk to Jay-Z.' ” 


	Does Jay-Z know who Steve Lacy is? 


	“I don't know. I don't think he did. So, I'm talking to him: ‘How you doing, man?' He was like, ‘I'm good, chilling.' I was like, ‘I like your fit. What's that jacket?' He's like, ‘The Row.' I was like, ‘Oh, shit,' and I showed him I'm also wearing the Row. I'm stoned also, but off the ones that make me talky.”

	











	Like any stoned person would in the presence of hip-hop royalty, Lacy decided to break the ice with a joke. “I was like, ‘Man, it's fucked up you didn't book Lil Wayne in New Orleans at the Super Bowl.' He's like, ‘Nah, it was all there. It would be crazy not to have Kendrick, you know?' And I was like, ‘Nah, I know. I'm just fucking with you.' ”


	So far, so good. 


	Feeling emboldened, Lacy mentioned one of his favorite Jay albums: “I told him I love 4:44. He's like, ‘Man, I'm happy you brought it up.' Then I was like, ‘Man, you a cool dude, bro.' Then after I walked away, I was like, ‘Why the fuck did I just tell Jay-Z he's a cool dude?' ”


	It's the type of transparency you get with Steve Lacy these days. You can be sure that whatever he's saying, he really means it.

	If you're hoping to see David Byrne reunite with his former bandmates in Talking Heads, you're not alone — but you probably shouldn't expect it to happen anytime soon. In his expansive new Rolling Stone Interview, Byrne let fans of his old band down gently. 


	“You can't turn the clock back,” he told Rolling Stone. “When you hear music at a certain point in your life, it means a lot. But it doesn't mean you can go back there and make it happen again.”


	Byrne is currently preparing to release an excellent new solo album called Who Is the Sky?, produced by Top 40 hitmaker Kid Harpoon. Speaking on the new album, which includes the singles “Everybody Laughs,” “She Explains Things to Me,” and “The Avant Garde,” he made it clear how excited he is by the creative work he's doing right now. 


	Byrne raised the subject of a Talking Heads reunion himself, in response to a question about his experience promoting the A24 rerelease of their classic 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense last year with bassist Tina Weymouth, drummer Chris Frantz, and multi-instrumentalist Jerry Harrison.

	











	“Did we feel more comfortable with one another?” Byrne said, acknowledging that those TV and film-festival appearances were the most time he'd spent with the other three Talking Heads in years. “Yeah. We felt more comfortable with one another, but I'm just going to anticipate your next questions. I didn't feel like, ‘Oh, yeah, let's go out on tour again.' Or, ‘Let's make another record.' Musically, I've gone to a very different place. And I also felt like there's been a fair number of reunion records and tours. And some of them were probably pretty good. Not very many. It's pretty much impossible to recapture where you were at that time in your life.”

	











	Talking Heads split up in 1991, and they have not performed in public since 2002, when they reunited for one night only at their induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Elsewhere in the interview, Byrne reflected on the ways he's grown in the decades since they made Stop Making Sense.

	“I had this vision of what this show could be,” he said. “And I probably wasn't the easiest person in the world to work with, because I was very single-minded about ‘No, the lighting should be like this. And the crew has to rehearse wheeling those risers out so that they're as much a part of the show as the band is.' It all worked, but I was not the easiest person to work with in those days. Now I know how to collaborate a little bit better. There's a way to do it where it doesn't hurt feelings.”


	In the rest of the interview, Byrne talked at length about writing his new album, living in New York in the 1970s, hanging out with Lou Reed, performing onstage with Olivia Rodrigo, how it feels to see younger generations embrace his music, and much more.

Pete Davidson wasn't a fan of the media attention he received during the early years of his career. During an appearance on The Breakfast Club on Wednesday, Davidson reflected on how he was perceived by the public and how it impacted his work on Saturday Night Live. 


	Davidson explained that being a tabloid fixture during his high-profile relationship with ex-fiancée Ariana Grande was often humiliating for him. “I brought a lot of pop culture into the show,” he said. “I made it [a] sort of tabloidly, trendy thing, unintentionally. And, also I was embarrassed by it because—now it's starting to change a little bit—but no one talked about any work I was doing. They were just like, ‘Oh, that's the fuck stick.' And that hurt so much.”


	The actor said that after a year or two of this going on “everyone saw how sad I was about it and embarrassed.” “I was never on Instagram, you know, flexing that sort of lifestyle at all,” he said. “I was very embarrassed by it. So I think after a while they understood… But I just want to be clear, no one was outrightly mean by any means.”

	











	Host Charlamagne Tha God asked, “What were you embarrassed by though? You was banging a lot of hot chicks and people knew you had a 10-inch penis.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“You know, on paper, that sounds great,” Davidson replied. “But it's embarrassing. Because first of all, it's Hollywood. Everybody fucks everyone. Everybody's dating everybody. Why are they focusing on me? It's because I'm not Glen Powell-handsome. I'm just this dude that tells dick jokes and is a drug addict.”

	











	He added, “Also, that stuff affects relationships. Seeing that and trying to move around and go on dates and just be a young dude who's trying to figure out who he is—I don't want to victimize myself in any way because I'm cool. But the sexualization of me—if that was a girl, people would be like, there would be a march for it. Seriously. You're just talking about my dick all day… They don't talk about girls like that professionally.”

	The host asked how the rumor about Davidson's “big dick energy” got started. “I think it was like the New York Times or something when I started dating someone that I guess they considered out of my league, which I think everyone is out of my league,” he replied. “They were like, ‘This guy must have big dick energy.' And then someone confirmed it.”

	Davidson said it was exhausting having his relationships be so public. “I got really tired of my whole career just being my personal life,” he said. “And living through that is sort of traumatic. Not to be like lame, but  it's traumatic to live in your own crap all the time.”


	Davidson is currently starring in two movies, thriller The Home and heist action comedy The Pickup, which also features Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer. The comedian and actor recently announced that he's expecting a baby with Elsie Hewitt. He told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, “For anybody who knows me it's my dream to be a dad, so I'm so excited. Elsie's excited. I'm excited to see her be a mom. So we're stoked.”

President Donald Trump delivers remarks to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act.

by JESSICA A. BOTELHO | The National News Desk

TOPICS:

U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna detailed her experience with what she described as an unidentified flying object (UFO) during an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. 

The Florida Republican said the sighting occurred when she was serving as a airfield manager in the U.S. Air Force. At the time, she was stationed at Portland Air National Guard. 

She said she saw an airspace incursion, which is the unauthorized entry of an aircraft into a designated area of airspace. 



She went on to say she grew up when the movie ""E.T."" and the TV show ""X Files"" were popular, so she wasn't frightened or freaked out. 

Still, she said based on her experience, as well as photos she's seen, there ""is definitely something that I can tell you with confidence that exists that we don't know how to explain currently."" 



Rogan asked why the pilots wanted to keep it a secret, as he wondered if it was an aircraft from another country. Luna said she got the impression it was a UFO due to the way one of the pilots was talking about it, noting that he seemed to fear there would be repercussions if he spoke to her about it.

Now, as a state representative, she said she and a few of other elected officials have talked to pilots about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) incidents. She said the pilots claimed they witnessed the activity at Eglin Air Force Base off the coast of Florida. 

In a 2023 report, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office noted that a ""reported UAP very likely was an ordinary object and was not exhibiting anomalous or exceptional characteristics or flight behaviors."" 



In February, Luna was appointed chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets. The Committee investigates government transparency on a variety of topics, including UAPs.  

She also serves on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, along with the Foreign Affairs Committee. 

Luna, meanwhile, promoted the podcast on social media. 



She also shared a few clips from the podcast on her X account, noting that they talked about banning insider trading, capping student loan interest, UAPS, JFK, and more. 



Luna, 36, is currently serving her second term as the Representative for Florida's Thirteenth Congressional District. She is also the author of two books, including ""Marrying the Beret: The Untold Stories of US Special Operations,"" and ""Bringing them Home: The Untold Cost of Putting Missions First.""

According to Luna's biography on her website, she was the first Mexican-American woman elected to the U.S. Congress to represent Florida. 

""Raised by a single mother in Southern California, Anna's tough upbringing taught her the importance of hard work and grit,"" her website noted.

Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a close ally of United States President Donald Trump and current chair of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, made massive claims about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Luna suggested that the US government possesses credible evidence pointing to the existence of what some have termed ""interdimensional beings.""

While refraining from disclosing classified information, Luna stated that she has personally viewed photographs of unidentified objects inside a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF).

While speaking in the podcast, Luna explained that these objects do not appear to be man-made and could involve advanced technology far beyond current human capabilities. She implied that these entities may not be extraterrestrial in the traditional sense but might instead operate in ways that challenge our understanding of space and time. Luna explained that certain credible witnesses have reported incidents involving movements that defy normal temporal and spatial limits. Although she did not elaborate further due to security restrictions, she noted that these accounts suggest the objects in question are capable of navigating through “time spaces” in ways that conventional science cannot yet explain. Luna has been involved in UAP-related investigations before, notably during the 2023 House Oversight probe into the US government's response to UAP sightings. That inquiry included analysis of incidents reported at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.



Highlighting the importance of transparency, Luna pledged to continue pushing for the declassification of government-held information related to UAPs. She argued that withholding such data undermines public trust and limits scientific inquiry into potentially groundbreaking phenomena. Her remarks comes days after similar statement by US Vice President JD Vance. He expressed strong interest in the subject of UFOs. Vance questioned the true nature of previously released government footage and emphasised the need for answers.

JD Vance revealed a few days ago that he is fascinated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and stated he plans to probe the matter during the upcoming congressional break. “What is actually up? What were those videos about?” Vance was quoted as saying. He acknowledged that in spite of his curiosity, he has not gotten to the bottom of it yet and added that the August recess will give him time to “dive into the whole UFO thing from last year”. His remarks came amid shift of interest into UAPs, following a year of drone sighting reports and congressional hearings about drone sightings.

Luis Walter Alvarez's career was marked by two explosions. The first was one the physicist enabled: a plutonium bomb, whose design he oversaw, destroyed the Japanese city of Nagasaki in August 1945. The second was one he theorised: the terrestrial impact 65m years ago of an asteroid sufficiently powerful to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. It may be for the asteroid theory—developed alongside his son and widely accepted after his death—that Alvarez is best remembered, rather than his groundbreaking contributions to the Manhattan Project.

Anna Paulina Luna details strange UFO experience while serving in the Air Force to Joe Rogan","https://nypost.com/2025/08/14/us-news/house-rep-anna-paulina-luna-details-strange-ufo-experience-while-serving-in-the-air-force-to-joe-rogan/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:10:59 GMT","

Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna detailed a bizarre UFO encounter involving an “airspace incursion” that left an experienced military pilot rattled while she was serving in the US Air Force.

Luna (R-Fla.) told Joe Rogan on Wednesday that she experienced an alarming event that she still questions today during her time stationed at the Portland Air National Guard Base as an airfield management specialist.

“There had been an airspace incursion that had taken place when I was still at the Guard, and I remember talking to some of the pilots about it, and I was like, ‘What was that?'” she said on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”

Luna served six years in the Air Force as an airfield management specialist, overseeing airfield safety and efficiency, including coordinating flight operations and frequently communicating with F-16 pilots.

However, when she asked the pilots, none of them were willing to talk about what they saw in the sky.

“They're like, ‘Eh, we can't really talk about it.' And no one really wanted to address it,” the 36-year-old Florida representative recounted.

After mulling it over, Luna said, she concluded that airspace incursion was likely an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP).

Rogan, 58, pushed back and asked how Luna didn't know it wasn't another military's aircraft or something highly classified that the pilots weren't willing to share with her.

Luna said one of the pilots appeared rattled given the way he spoke about the incident.

“From what I gathered, he didn't want to get taken off flight status, and was like, ‘I really can't discuss it,'” she said.

The F-16 pilot, however, did tell her that whatever it was, they couldn't “really identify it.”

“It essentially outperformed them,” she shared.

Luna further explained that there's a “crazy” stigma around those who report seeing UAPs, and for members of the armed forces, that could jeopardize their security clearance and reputation.

The Air Force veteran noted the US government has not always been transparent with the public, especially about UFOs.

“What I can tell you is, when you have thousands upon thousands of people from around the planet throughout time that have reported something, to say those people are crazy … that's a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” she told Rogan.

Luna, who leads a task force created by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigating the possibility of UAPs, called for more “transparency” from the US government.

“I'd like to see the federal government roll out some of the stuff we've been given access to because I think that information belongs in the hands of the American people,” she said.

She also believes the government is trying to replicate technology from craft believed to be made by extraterrestrial life.

“Without getting into classified conversations, there have been incidences where I believe very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space,” Luna said.

“Based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind.”

In 2025, there have already been more than 2,100 sightings of UAPs across the US reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, marking a significant increase from the 1,492 sightings reported throughout all of 2024.

The Pentagon has remained firm in saying that there is no evidence that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial life and disavowed the existence of any UFO retrieval programs.

Last week, a Harvard physicist asserted that new images of the Manhattan-size interstellar object rocketing through our inner solar system back his claim that it's not a comet, but instead possibly an alien probe that may “destroy us.”

“Here, the glow is actually in front of it. We've never seen such a thing. A comet doesn't glow in front,” Dr. Avi Loeb said after the object was discovered in early July.

(NewsNation) — GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna told Joe Rogan she has viewed evidence of interdimensional beings on Earth.

Luna, who leads a task force for the declassification of federal secrets created by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, joined Rogan on his eponymous podcast that was released Wednesday. 

The Floridian told Rogan she met F-15 pilots who had likely encounters with UAPs while she was working as an airfield manager at Portland International Guard.

While not viewing portals or UAPs herself, Luna said she had seen photographic evidence, historical evidence and spoken to Air Force pilots who alleged the Air Force was covering up UAP sightings.

“There's definitely something that I can tell you with confidence, that we don't know how to explain currently,” Luna told Rogan. 

Luna added she believes there are interdimensional beings that “can operate through the timespaces that we currently have.”

She also believes that the U.S. has reverse-engineered technology to replicate crafts made by those who are not mankind.

“Without getting into classified conversations, there have been incidences where I believe very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space,” Luna said.

“Based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind.”

The congresswoman critiqued the intelligence community for gatekeeping information relating to UAPs and adjacent issues.

“When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something, to say that those people are crazy, to say that the whole concept of just asking the question [may mean] that you are not psychologically sound, that in itself is a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” she said. 

“We know the U.S. government has not exactly been clean in a lot of what they've done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs.”

Luna added there is a “protective complex” from authorities, who believe the American people may not be able to handle the realities of the truth.

Astrobiology poses fundamental questions about life in the universe: How did it emerge? Is there life beyond Earth? In a recently published study in PLOS One, researchers from Leiden University investigated how the field was portrayed in the public sphere from 1996 to 2024 by shining light on what speculations and promises about the search for life elsewhere are circulating in the media.

Danilo Albergaria and his colleagues examined three kinds of sources of information about science: academic papers, press releases and news articles. They found that the most frequent speculations were about conditions or ingredients for life beyond Earth, followed by speculations on the existence of life. They also found speculations about the outcomes of the search to be uncommon, while speculative content on potential evidence pointing to life detection is rare.

The study found that expectations that technology will help find life beyond Earth are relatively high, appearing in roughly one-third of news articles, one-fifth of press releases and one-tenth of papers. The promise that astrobiology is making progress in the search for life was also quite common, with about one-fifth of press releases and news articles exhibiting this kind of content.

In contrast, they found that promises of life detection are very rare. ""Among news articles, we examined those covering studies published in peer-reviewed journals. In general, scientists don't seem comfortable setting expectations on the prospects of life detection when talking about their own research,"" says Albergaria, the first author of the study.

News articles presented more speculations and promises than press releases and papers, but press releases had slightly more speculative content when communicating about the significance of research results. ""This may reflect pressures for institutional communications to emphasize the impact of a study to grab media attention,"" explains Albergaria.

Papers showed much less speculations and promises than press releases and news stories, yet peer-reviewed articles also exhibited some speculative content, especially about conditions and ingredients for life beyond Earth.

The team also mapped how frequently speculations and promises appeared associated with authors of studies, with outside experts or without attribution to researchers. Press releases presented speculations most frequently in quotes of authors of studies, while in news articles speculative content appears more balanced between quoted researchers and without attribution to scientists. This underlines the role researchers play in the communication of the field.

The study also found that expectations about the search for life are more associated with exoplanet research than solar system exploration, and much higher than about the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

Albergaria ponders that speculations are not necessarily bad science communication. ""Speculative imagination helps to develop concepts and hypotheses that guide the search. There are many unknowns about life in the universe and that's why speculations in the communication of astrobiology seem almost inevitable. So, it's still difficult to clearly distinguish unwarranted speculative content and legitimate contextualization,"" he explains. ""We need more research on that.""

In total, 630 articles were subject to a quantitative content analysis. Most were published in English, but the analysis also includes news stories published in Portuguese and Spanish. Articles came from six reference newspapers: The New York Times (U.S.), The Guardian (U.K.), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal) and El País (Spain).

Media coverage of astrobiology frequently includes speculation, especially about conditions for life beyond Earth, with news articles showing the highest levels of speculative and promising content compared to press releases and academic papers. Expectations for technological advances and progress in the search for life are common, while explicit promises of life detection remain rare. Speculation is most often linked to exoplanet research and is considered an inevitable aspect of communicating astrobiology.

Jared Padalecki, who's known for starring in Supernatural opposite Jensen Ackles, has opened up about the details revolving around his reunion with Ackles in The Boys season 5. Padalecki has joined the cast of The Boys final season, alongside Misha Collins, who also appeared in Supernatural. Ackles was cast as Soldier Boy, the original American supe in The Boys season 3.

It is not yet clear who Padalecki will be playing in The Boys, but it was confirmed that he will be appearing as a guest star and he and Ackles will have a scene together, at least. In Supernatural, Ackles and Padalecki respectively played Dean and Sam Winchester, two brothers who hunt otherworldly beings. Both Padalecki and Ackles have appeared in all 15 seasons of Supernatural. 

During Fan Expo Boston, according to Collider, Padalecki was asked about his character in The Boys, and he revealed that his character will pop up in the new season's fifth episode. He also gave a warning to younger audiences not to check out the show's latest season. Check out his comments below:

I'll say this much — my character is very excited to meet Soldier Boy. It's Episode 5 of Season 5. I think they're putting out the first four episodes and then a little bit of time and then the final four episodes. And for those who are not yet 18, do not watch it.

Since Padalaki has revealed that he won't appear in The Boys until the middle of the season, Supernatural fans are going to have to sit tight for the moment Ackles and Padalecki are back on-screen together. No details have been revealed about Padalecki's character, but based on the casting of Collins as well, there could be an actual reference to Supernatural in the show. 

The Boys was first released on Prime Video on July 26, 2019.

Based on Padalecki's comments about how young audiences should not be tuning in for his episodes in the final season and that his character can't wait to meet Soldier Boy, it feels as though a potentially sexual or violent undertone to the character is being teased. Padalecki's answer to the question at Fan Expo Boston indicates that the season will be just as over-the-top as its predecessors. 

Padalecki is certainly teasing a great season of The Boys. The Boys is always outrageous, so the fact that the final season won't tone anything down is a relief to hear. Padalecki is definitely making expectations high, so the fifth and final season of The Boys must truly deliver to not disappoint fans.

Supernatural is an iconic show, so having these actors reunite on an equally iconic show like The Boys seems perfect. It is not clear if there will be a clear reference to Supernatural in The Boys, but one can hope for some tongue-in-cheek fun. 

Your comment has not been saved

The Boys is a gritty and subversive take on the superhero genre, focusing on a group of vigilantes who confront powerful superheroes abusing their abilities, exploring themes of corruption and moral ambiguity in a world where heroes are not always what they seem.

Sci-fi is always impressive on the big screen, but these shows prove that TV is the best format for epic space-operas or chilling dystopian visions.

Many of Stephen King's works have been adapted to TV, and there have been some characters (both heroes and villains) who have stood out.

Fantasy shows have always dominated the entertainment landscape, which makes the fact these gems flew under the radar all the more frustrating.

These fantasy TV shows come close to matching the epic scope, intricate worldbuilding, and compelling storytelling of The Lord of the Rings.

Intense martial arts action and fight scenes aren't limited to the big screen, as these incredibly martial arts TV shows all prove.

Detective series can risk being same-y while following a formula. However, the best detective shows of all time bring something new to the genre.","{'href': 'https://screenrant.com', 'title': 'Screen Rant'}","other"

Andhera review: Karanvir Malhotra leads the new horror show, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.  

No one, as far as I can imagine, wants to be left alone in this world. It is the fear of abandonment, yes, but also the fear of not being understood that drives us to be seen and heard. These are primary, urgent impulses that today's youth are concerned about. Andhera, the latest horror/sci-fi entry on Amazon Prime Video is concerned about the traumas and anxieties of the youth and their capacity to be understood in a world that is largely growing distant. It is the manifestation of these internal fears that this show is concerned about. Great on paper, but unfortunately, that does not translate on screen as Andhera walks within a timid, misguided circle of what is scary.

Andhera, which translates to darkness, starts off with quite a promise. The seedy lanes and corridors of Mumbai at night trace back to the frantic cries of a distressed woman running away from something, and seeking help from a certain Dr. Prithvi, inside a hotel room. That is of no avail as a dark matter emerges from the walls, creeps up to her, and seemingly, engulfs her. This leads to an almost failed police investigation, but Inspector Kalpana Kadam (Priya Bapat) is reassigned to the case, and this leads her to the woman, named Bani Baruah, who was presumed to have fallen, mysteriously, from the hotel window. 

In a parallel track, we also track the recurring hallucinations that Jay Sheth (Karanvir Malhotra) keeps having about the same woman and a sinister force of darkness that comes alive. It will be revealed that his brother Prithvi (Pranay Pachauri) is in a coma- and that Jay's visions are, incidentally, linked to the disappearance of Bani. Jay gets in touch with Rumi (Prajakta Koli), a YouTuber with a show on paranormal presence in Mumbai- a track only the makers can make sense because I failed to do so. Together, they have their own search for what this ‘andhera' means, and whether it is a bigger threat than what is imagined.

Andhera is clearly ambitious in its concept and design. Created by Gaurav Desai, Andhera sprawls over a range of characters and is interested in exploring the space between supernatural horror and sci-fi. The catalyst for these ideas to land is, however, thinly imagined, where this central entity of this ‘andhera' and whether this can be pulled into create another realm of human unconsciousness.

To land these ideas, it needed a tighter, more ruthless script that could push these characters to their extremes so that Jay's fear and emotional disconnect, in particular, would feel palpably real. It is not just internal horror but even external forms of fear as well, and the show seems heavily disconnected in cracking where to draw the line between the two. Even as Ketan Sodha's brooding music is quite effective here, the show quickly crumbles under its own weight. Chances are taken, but is that all there is to Andhera?

In a show where there is an element of suspense and intrigue, the viewer is already two steps ahead in calculating what might arrive next. In Andhera, Bani's disappearance is the focal point, and the viewer is not kept in secret about the fact that there are threads which will connect her case to Prithvi, and then to this healing centre called Aatma (herein comes Surveen Chawla as the manager, in a thankless role).

The point is, by the time the show connects these dots and arrives at the conclusion, the plot is lost in overwrought thrills and thankless suspense. The subtext of mental health issues, which starts from Jay's anxieties and panic attacks, leads nowhere after a point. It goes from a missing person case to a missing context case. The looming dread of AI is somewhere in the close vicinity, mainly with the experiment that Andhera focuses on later on, but even that is not given any vitality. The horror fails to land. The ambition starts to feel misplaced.

Fear is a very valid emotional response today, given the amount of misinformation, displacement, and violations that take place in the world around us. Is it not scary to see where the world is headed, driven by capitalism and greed? Of course it is. It appears that Andhera started off somewhere in these discussions and amalgamated into a stagnant mess, after which there were no answers. Andhera drags on, testing your patience.

ANA - Powering Africa's growth and development through content





As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas – the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth – it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas – bigger than Mount Everest – hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as “not natural”.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy –  Oumuamua and Borisov – and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding – things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by “Independent Media”.

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book “Beyond the Light Barrier”, published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the “Sunday Tribune” over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the “lightning bird” appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

So what was the object seen over New Jersey this week on Tuesday Night (8:56 p.m.)? Residents are asking after seeing a strange object flying over New Jersey skies.

 

 

In a Patch article posted this week, officials said there was a simple answer: ""The U.S. Space Force, working with United Launch Alliance, sent its Vulcan USSF-106 rocket into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida, sparking excitement and curiosity along the East Coast about what was streaking through the sky.""

 

 

It is not known what was contained aboard this rocket. While full details about the rocket's payload were not revealed, officials confirmed it carried an experimental military navigation satellite along with other equipment, all of which were successfully placed into orbit around Earth.

 

 

 

Did you see the rocket launch? Anyone out there grab a pic? We would love to see it.

 

 

 

One thing that was visible and identified was the ""conjunction"" in the skies over New Jersey. What is this? In simple terms, a conjunction in the skies is when two objects, like planets, the Moon, or a bright star, appear very close together from our point of view on Earth. They're not side-by-side in space; it's just a line-of-sight illusion, like two far-away streetlights looking next to each other from where you're standing.

Well, looks like I'm spending my evening rearranging furniture

A woman who claims she can speak to dead people has explained why you should never have a mirror facing your bed. Anyone else reading this currently sat on a bed… with a mirror facing it? Oh dear.

Leah, known as Psychic Leah on TikTok, is a psychic medium, demonologist and paranormal investigator. I know, what a line-up. She's had millions of views across her videos. Her pinned video, and one of her most watched of all time, explains the simple bedroom setup, and basically, why it's a terrible idea.

“I don't think I can actually stress this enough to people. Do not have a mirror facing your bed,” her video started. Leah then went on to say there are “multiple different reasons” behind this.

She continued: “Mirrors are one of the main reasons we have portals open in our homes. It's one of the most common reasons I have to go out to people and cleanse their houses. You will have unwanted spirits. You will have all types of spirits in your home and you don't want to be the one that I have to come out to, so I can clear something low vibrational – typically an entity that isn't particularly nice.”

I beg you 🙏 #paranormalactivity #paranormaltiktok #psychicmedium #psychicmediumtiktok #paranormal #fyp #spiritualist #demonologist #viral #psychicleah #viralvideos

Leah said if you're one of the people who does have a mirror facing your bed and since you've done that you've had “restless sleep”, this is because of the energy coming out of the mirror. “Especially if there are arguments going on in your home,” Leah added. “Mirrors literally suck in energy.”

She explained she gets called to “countless” homes of people claiming they have unwanted spirits in their houses. Straight away, Leah can tell them it's the mirror.

“What I suggest you do is you cover the mirror,” she continued. “You can keep it there, [but] cover the mirror with a cloth, blanket, whatever you want. Make sure you're doing protection prayers over that mirror, you're setting boundaries and you are also saging it. Please, I beg you, sage it. I'm doing this to protect you.”

Leah also suggested never buying a secondhand mirror, as they “withhold energy”. She said: “Whatever happened within that person's home, we don't know if it's negative, is coming into your home.” So that dusty one you picked up off Facebook Marketplace? You might want to throw it out. Immediately.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Brendan Rodgers Forced to Respond to Bizarre Celtic Conspiracy Theory","https://celtsarehere.com/celtic-rodgers-tie-gate-pittodrie-celtic/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 13:33:03 GMT","

The Celtic manager's choice of attire sparked chatter among a section of supporters already on edge over the lack of incoming transfers, with two weeks left before the window shuts. In the current climate, it seems every detail — even the manager's clothes — is under the microscope.

One of the more outlandish theories even made its way onto Superscoreboard, the Scottish football phone-in where a certain type of caller thrives on far-fetched conspiracies. The insinuation was that Rodgers, by removing his tie, was silently signalling dissatisfaction.

Rodgers today dismissed the speculation in a typically forthright fashion.

“It's unbelievable, someone has told me this here, it's like I'm supposedly sending messages, kidding, as if! It's unbelievable!” he told CeltsAreHere. “I'm basically like everyone else, see when it's really hot, you have to take off your jacket, your tie, and see when it's really cold, you wear a jumper.

“So I remember last year I wore a jumper, people said, what, he's sending a message — what message? Bloody freezing. I was wearing a jumper on in my big coat and it was up to there and I'm fine.

“I'm basically like everyone else, see when it's really hot, you have to take off your jacket, your tie, and see when it's really cold, you wear a jumper.

“And last week, there's two grounds I've realised in my career that are absolutely boiling if you get it at the time and the sun's hitting your dugout — Pittodrie and Preston. I went there once before and I got absolutely roasted on the day. And Pittodrie's the same. So I thought, well I've either take off my jacket or take off my tie. So I took my tie off.

“So I don't know what message that is, I'm just warm. So this is modern football, eh?”

Rodgers' comments underline just how heightened the atmosphere around Celtic is at present. With no fresh signings through the door and a Champions League playoff on the horizon, some fans are clearly overanalysing even the smallest details. For the manager, however, Sunday's look was nothing more than a reaction to the Pittodrie sun.

(NewsNation) — GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna told Joe Rogan she has viewed evidence of interdimensional beings on Earth.

Luna, who leads a task force for the declassification of federal secrets created by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, joined Rogan on his eponymous podcast that was released Wednesday. 

The Floridian told Rogan she met F-15 pilots who had likely encounters with UAPs while she was working as an airfield manager at Portland International Guard.

While not viewing portals or UAPs herself, Luna said she had seen photographic evidence, historical evidence and spoken to Air Force pilots who alleged the Air Force was covering up UAP sightings.

“There's definitely something that I can tell you with confidence, that we don't know how to explain currently,” Luna told Rogan. 

Luna added she believes there are interdimensional beings that “can operate through the timespaces that we currently have.”

She also believes that the U.S. has reverse-engineered technology to replicate crafts made by those who are not mankind.

“Without getting into classified conversations, there have been incidences where I believe very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space,” Luna said.

“Based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind.”

The congresswoman critiqued the intelligence community for gatekeeping information relating to UAPs and adjacent issues.

“When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something, to say that those people are crazy, to say that the whole concept of just asking the question [may mean] that you are not psychologically sound, that in itself is a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” she said. 

“We know the U.S. government has not exactly been clean in a lot of what they've done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs.”

Luna added there is a “protective complex” from authorities, who believe the American people may not be able to handle the realities of the truth.

If you're a millennial or Gen Zer with a penchant for scrolling Zillow, you've probably found yourself envying the boomer homeowners whose home values have ballooned to prices you could never afford. 

But many aging households — both renters and homeowners — are struggling with rising housing costs. As the number of older Americans, particularly those in their 80s and older, grows, their housing woes are intensifying.

About a third of 65-and-older households were cost-burdened in 2023, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing, according to a new report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. More than half of those were severely cost-burdened, spending more than 50% of their income on housing.

Business Insider is covering how older people are dealing with a shortage of housing and rising costs.

If you're 65 or older, fill out this form to contribute to our stories and read more here:

Household incomes tend to decline as people enter their 80s, when many lose their partners and have to support themselves on a single income. That can make what's often their biggest monthly expense — housing costs — even more difficult to manage. With the oldest baby boomers on the cusp of turning 80, this dynamic is expected to put a lot of additional pressure on accessible housing, long-term care, and other services older people rely on.

""We're on the precipice of a pretty big shift in demand,"" said Jennifer Molinsky, the director of Harvard University's Housing and Aging Society Program. ""The share of older adults 65-plus is going to tilt older, and I think a higher share will have cost burdens."" 

Older renters are worse off than homeowners. A majority of them — 58% — were cost-burdened in 2023, most of them severely, the Harvard report found. But homeowners are also increasingly struggling. 

A growing share of older homeowners — 31% of those in their 80s, as of 2022 — are still saddled with mortgages, and 43% of them are cost-burdened. That's more than twice the share of those without mortgages, the report found. But even those who own their homes outright are still dealing with other ballooning housing costs, including insurance premiums, property taxes, utilities, and home repairs.

The number of older households financially strained by their housing has grown from just over 10 million in 2019 to more than 12.4 million in 2023. Meanwhile, home prices have soared over the last several years, mortgage interest rates are stubbornly high, and smaller, more affordable homes that could be suitable for aging empty-nesters looking to downsize are a shrinking slice of the pie. Just 9% of new homes built in 2023 were under 1,400 square feet.

This dynamic is undermining a long American tradition: treating homes as retirement nest eggs.

Many homeowners bank on selling their home, downsizing, and living off their sale profits in their older age. But the housing shortage also means that even many homeowners sitting on valuable home equity who want to cash in are having trouble finding somewhere to go.

""There just aren't that many smaller condos or apartments that are less expensive that you're going to be able to make that trade off and stay in your community,"" Molinsky said.

US officials did not say who had the 16th-century page that was missing from Mexico's archives for decades

Nearly five centuries after Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés signed it and decades after someone swiped it from national archives, a priceless manuscript page has been returned by the FBI to Mexico.

The document contains a detailed accounting of the logistics related to Cortés's journey to what eventually became New Spain – a territory that stretched from Central America to modern-day Washington state.

“This is an original manuscript page that was actually signed by Hernán Cortés,” said special agent Jessica Dittmer, a member of the FBI's art crime team in New York. “Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history.”

Cortés landed in Mexico with a small army in 1519, when he formed alliances with local groups that opposed the Aztec empire, which helped him capture the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán – modern-day Mexico City – just two years later.

The document is dated 20 February 1527, just days before one of Cortés's top lieutenants was appointed co-governor of the conquered territory.

It was a key year for the formation of royal and religious institutions that would rule over the Indigenous peoples of Mexico until its 1810-21 war of independence.

The manuscript was initially stored in Mexico's national archives, but archivists microfilming the collection in 1993 found that 15 pages had gone missing. Based on its wax numbering system, the FBI said the document was probably stolen between 1985 and 1993.

Mexico requested the help of the FBI's art crime team last year for this particular page.

Investigators eventually narrowed the search to the United States and located the document, though the agency did not say who had it. The New York City police department, US Department of Justice and Mexico's government were all involved in the investigation.

Because the document has changed hands various times over the years, no one will be charged for the theft, the FBI said.

It is the second Cortés document the FBI has returned to the Mexican government. In 2023, the agency returned a 16th-century letter from Cortés.

“Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A drone struck the roof of a residential building in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Aug. 14, injuring at least 13 people, according to Russian officials, state media, and local Telegram channels.

Residents heard the sound of an incoming drone before an explosion, Telegram channels reported. The blast occurred in the city center near Voroshilovsky Avenue, according to the independent Russian Telegram channel Astra, which published images showing damage to a building.

Shot and Baza, Telegram channels linked to Russian security services, also published a video showing a fixed-wing drone crashing into the building. The footage cannot be independently verified. 

Acting regional Governor Yuri Slyusar said two of the injured were hospitalized.

""Several apartment buildings on Telman and Lermontovskaya streets in Rostov were damaged due to a drone attack,"" Slyusar said on his Telegram channel.

""Emergency services and Rostov administration officials have been dispatched to the scene.""

Rostov-on-Don lies roughly 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukrainian and Russian forces regularly exchange drone strikes amid Moscow's full-scale invasion.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses destroyed eight Ukrainian fixed-wing drones between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Moscow time — seven over the Belgorod Oblast and one over Kursk Oblast. The ministry did not mention Rostov-on-Don in its statement.

Ukraine has not commented on the alleged strike, and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

When Donald Trump looks into the eyes of Vladimir Putin this week and decides whether he is serious about peace, it will be in Alaska: the American state on the front line of a new Cold War between Moscow and Washington.

The US has increasingly been forced to scramble warships and fighter jets since the invasion of Ukraine, with Russia and its ally China venturing ever closer to Alaska's coast.

The Pentagon is looking at reopening its Cold War-era bases in the state in a move that would greatly expand its footprint in the region and signal a grasp for Arctic dominance.

“The Cold War is back,” said Mark Hayward, a former army medic who lives in Nome, on Alaska's Seward Peninsula. “And in many ways, it's hotter than the Cold War was.”

The Arctic's melting sea ice has opened up traditional chokepoints like the Bering Strait, which lies between Alaska and Russia. It has meant new trade routes, more opportunity for military movement by naval and submarine patrols, and sent superpowers scrambling to assert themselves in the region.

US officials openly admit there has been an increase in Russian and Chinese activity – the two often operate in tandem – off the coast of Alaska since 2022.

Late last month, Russian Tu-95 bombers and Su-35 fighters jets were intercepted by the US Air Force when they crossed into the Alaskan Air Defence Identification Zone (Adiz) – though they steered clear of US air space.

And that was only the most recent activity. There have been at least nine similar incidents across air and sea in the last two years involving Russia or China.

Notably, in September 2024, a Russian Tu-95 cut across the nose of an American F-16 in a “headbutt” manoeuvre that brought both pilots feet from disaster. The US took the unusual step of condemning the “unprofessional” behaviour.

“They're in our airspace all the time,” said Daniel Volland, an optometrist and member of Anchorage's assembly. “There's always a vigilance.”

Alaska belonged to Russia until the mid-19th century, when it was bought by the US following negotiations led by the secretary of state, William H Seward.

At the time, newspaper editorials condemned the decision as “Seward's folly” – now, with superpowers jostling for dominance in the Arctic, the Alaska Purchase is one of Seward's crowning achievements.

Mr Volland noted that those years of shared history had also brought suspicion among Alaskans of the imperial power of their westerly neighbour, which lies just three miles away at the narrowest points of the Bering Strait.

“We are very proximal to Russia. And there is a legacy of Russian colonialism, about history in Alaska, where they enslaved Alaska Native peoples,” he said.

“A lot of that had to do with the fur trade and the extraction of natural resources that Russia wanted to do here in Alaska. I think that that colonial legacy is part of the scepticism some Alaskans have toward Russia.”

Beyond regular incursions by the Russian military, Mr Hayward said his community in Nome had suffered regular fibre optic cable outages since the start of the Ukraine war in Feb 2022.

“It's somehow mysteriously cut itself at times when there's not any ice movement, and at depths where no one should be touching it,” he said.

“It's a small community up there – talking to people who do the emergency response, they'll say: ‘Look, this was not an accident. Somebody cut our cable, and they did it again, and they did it again.'”

Mr Hayward volunteered in Ukraine shortly after the outbreak of war three years ago, initially planning to help as a combat medic but eventually putting together a team of volunteers to train Ukrainians to use Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missiles.

Living in Alaska, with Russia increasingly making its presence felt, makes the conflict “very personal”, he said.

“The same Russia that is willing to invade its neighbour to the west with no provocation would be equally willing to sink our fuel barges and leave me and my friends to freeze to death in the dark in the Arctic winter,” he continued.

“They are doing what I would consider direct action missions against critical infrastructure in the Arctic. Nobody wants to call it what it is, but those are acts of war.”

The US is now seeking to assert itself in the Arctic and openly weighing up options for opening military bases that closed in the wake of the Cold War.

One of them is Adak, a former air facility located between the Bering Sea and Pacific Ocean that was used for submarine surveillance and reconnaissance against the Soviet Union before being decommissioned in the 1990s.

It boasts three piers, two 8,000-ft runways and one of the world's largest fuel storage depots, and was recently used in military exercises as part of the army's Exercise Northern Edge. Experts believe it could be converted into a working base relatively easily.

Another base under consideration is Eareckson Air Station, which like Adak is located on the remote Aleutian Islands chain.

Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, said in April that the military was evaluating how to reopen the facilities to enhance the US's presence in the Arctic.

Doing so would give Washington “time and distance” on any invading force, he told senators at a briefing, because they would “enable up to 10 times the maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft coverage of that key and increasingly contested space”.

Troy Bouffard, a former aide to Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, said reopening Adak would be a “brilliant” move.

“That island is in such a geographically strategic place. It's quite awesome… you can put lots of sensors there so you detect things way before they get to you,” said Dr Bouffard, now assistant Professor of Arctic Security at University of Alaska Fairbanks.

“And if you ever zoom in on that thing on Google satellites, you'll be surprised how much is on that island, including that long runway. It is really well developed.”

Putin will land in Alaska on Friday to meet with Mr Trump at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, according to CNN.

Mr Hayward believes the Alaska senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, understand the stakes of the summit and why emboldening Putin would be a disaster – for Alaska as well as Ukraine.

Of Mr Trump he is less certain.

“Russia is the biggest threat to world peace and the biggest threat to Alaska since the Nazis were sending ski teams up above the Arctic Circle during the Second World War,” he said.

Now, he continued, Mr Trump “needs to be extremely careful that Anchorage doesn't enter the lexicon of appeasement the way Munich did in 1938”.

Japan's famous onsen hot springs were long considered unexportable, until an idea struck Naoki Mita: What if he could condense them like espresso coffee?

Mita's Tokyo-based venture firm, Le Furo, has invented a technology it calls “craft onsen” — whereby hot spring ingredients are extracted and filtered into an ultra-high concentration.

Le Furo is seeking to use that patented technology to export Japan's hot springs overseas, with a view toward opening several onsen facilities in the Gulf region next year.

Transporting hot springs overseas long seemed logistically impossible because of the sheer volume of water involved, as well as their susceptibility to germs, but with Le Furo's invention, “just like you extract coffee as espresso, we grind the mineral resources to fine, sand-like powders,” Mita said.

Many commercially available “onsen powders” are synthetic and put an emphasis on mimicking the relaxing color and scent, and do not necessarily contain the necessary ingredients, the entrepreneur said.

Only after solid metals such as iron, magnesium and zinc dissolve into water does it become possible to chemically resemble onsen and recreate the therapeutic effect, he said.

Le Furo's technology sticks to the natural soil and minerals of hot spring sources, and uses a special method to make them soluble in water.

Its “craft onsen” concentrate comes in bottles or small tanks, which can then be distributed and poured into water in other countries to feel like the real thing.

Onsens — bath houses where patrons relax naked together in hot spring water of various temperatures — are a major domestic industry in Japan beloved by locals and tourists.

As of 2021, Japan was home to 28,000 confirmed hot spring sources, the Japanese Ministry of the Environment said.

Le Furo is setting its sights particularly on countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Saudi Arabia, where “water is considered a more precious resource than oil,” Mita said.

“Here in Japan, we have this culture of soaking ourselves in a good, long bath to attain better health — that's the kind of story that I believe [other countries] will show great interest in,” he said.

Former first lady Kim Keon-hee was arrested late on Tuesday on a range of charges including stock manipulation and corruption, prosecutors said.
Her arrest came hours after the Seoul Central District Court reviewed prosecutors' request for an arrest warrant against the 52-year-old.
The court granted the warrant, citing the risk of tampering with evidence, after prosecutors submitted an 848-page opinion laying out

President Donald Trump is reportedly considering offering Moscow access to Ukraine's natural minerals in the Russian-occupied territories, a move Ukrainians say would be illegal and damaging to Washington's reputation. The news comes as Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15 the war in Ukraine, without inviting Kyiv. According to the Telegraph, Trump's team is putting together proposals to incentivize Putin to reach a peace deal that include exploiting Ukrainian minerals, sanctions relief, and access to resources in Alaska, rich in oil and gas.The suggestion that Trump could greenlight Russia's exploitation of its resources in its mineral-dense regions has both baffled and alarmed industry experts in Ukraine. ""It will mean that international law does not exist anymore and global international relations will transform not even to realpolitik, but to Squid Game (the Netflix hit where contestants play lethal games for a huge cash prize),"" economist Volodymyr Landa told the Kyiv Independent. ""It will have consequences not only for involved countries, but also for other countries that may start wars for resources in the near future.""

 Washington could prepare another mineral deal with Moscow, like the one it signed with Ukraine in May, a source close to the matter told the Telegraph. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who coordinated the deal with Ukraine, is reportedly one of the figures behind the proposals.Moscow occupies some 40% of Ukraine's metal resources, including two of Ukraine's four lithium deposits. Russia is already plundering resources from the occupied territories of Ukraine, particularly iron ore, which it exports via the Kerch Bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia. Kyiv has previously expressed doubt the U.S. would join Russia in a scheme to exploit resources in Ukraine's occupied territories. It would violate international law and require Washington to recognize the occupied territories as part of Russia, which no other country has done, Taras Kachka, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told the Kyiv Independent in an interview published in July. ""This would not be favorable for America's reputation,"" Gennadiy Chyzhykov, president of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told the Kyiv Independent. He believes that Trump could be repeating his minerals deal playbook, where he first proposed to Kyiv a widely criticized ""colonial"" style agreement before negotiating down to a more mutually beneficial joint investment fund. He could be gauging where Ukraine and the international community's middle ground is by starting off with an “absurd” proposition, said Chyzhykov. 

Washington could more realistically offer up its Alaskan resources to Moscow. The proposal includes the 3-mile Bering Strait that separates Russia and the U.S., which is thought to hold vast quantities of undiscovered oil and gas reserves and would bolster Russia's presence in the Arctic. ""The Arctic is an area of common interest (between the U.S. and Russia). They could sign projects or review former development projects in the Arctic,"" George Popov, an investment analyst at Ukrainian firm BrightOne Capital, told the Kyiv Independent. Popov pointed to a previous deal between America's energy giant ExxonMobil and Russia's Rosneft in 2011 to drill for hydrocarbons in the Arctic. The plan was scratched in 2018 due to Western sanctions on Moscow. Following the Russia-U.S. summit in Saudi Arabia in February, Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's Direct Investment Fund, said that the two sides had discussed cooperating on energy projects in the Arctic, although he did not provide details. Russia makes up 53% of the Arctic coastline, but it lacks the resources to develop the region, while Western sanctions have hindered its lucrative Arctic oil extraction. Trump has a keen eye on the region too, particularly as China develops its own Arctic strategy, proposing to purchase Greenland for America's ""national security."" The Arctic's economic potential has set the stage for it to become a potential conflict area in the future, and Trump could be looking to normalize relations with Russia to curtail Beijing. ""If Trump wants to share Alaska resources with Putin, that may be a better option for Ukraine than Ukrainian resources in the Russian-occupied territories,"" said Landa.  ""But it is still dangerous as Russia is rewarded for its aggression.""

Toronto-based AI company Cohere has hired former Meta executive Joelle Pineau and announced another round of fundraising.thibault camus/The Associated Press

Cohere Inc. has raised US$500-million and hired a key executive from Meta Platforms Inc. META-Q as it seeks to compete against its much larger rivals and secure customers in the frenzied market for artificial intelligence.

The funding announced by Cohere on Thursday values the Toronto-based AI company at US$6.8-billion. 

Cohere has also hired McGill University computer science professor and former Meta executive Joelle Pineau as its chief AI officer. The appointment of Dr. Pineau, who left Meta in May, represents a coup in a fierce war for AI research talent.

Many of the investors in the latest financing have previously put money into Cohere, including Canadian funds Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital, both of which led the round. 

Other returning investors include AMD Ventures, Nvidia Corp., PSP Investments and Salesforce Ventures. The Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan invested for the first time.

Cohere, founded in 2019, is differentiating itself in the AI race by training models and building products for businesses instead of consumers, and focusing on security and privacy. 

This month, the company made its North platform available for wide release, which can access a company's internal data to draft documents and reports, and can be used to build AI agents to complete repetitive administrative tasks.

The company raised US$500-million just last year at a US$5.5-billion valuation. Rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, however, are reportedly worth hundreds of billions of dollars. 

“I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that,” co-founder Nick Frosst said. “I spend a lot more time thinking about the technology we're building.” 

The economics for Cohere are different than its competitors, he added.

OpenAI, Anthropic and others have consumer-facing chatbots that require large amounts of money to operate. Cohere's business customers, in contrast, pay for their own computation costs or run models on their own infrastructure. 

“We're able to add a ton of value for their business, and also be a sustainable business model for us. Some of the consumer applications have a pretty hard time doing that,” Mr. Frosst said.

The company has a path to profitability, Mr. Frosst said, but he declined to offer specifics. Cohere has also hired Francois Chadwick, a former Uber executive, as its chief financial officer.

Dr. Pineau starts in September and will be based in Montreal, where Cohere recently announced plans to open an office and partnered with Mila, one of the country's AI research hubs. 

She will also oversee Cohere Labs, the research arm focused on core scientific issues related to the technology. (Sara Hooker, who previously headed the lab, announced her departure earlier this week.)

At Meta, Dr. Pineau led the company's Fundamental AI Research lab, which worked on the open-source Llama large language models. 

Her hiring in 2017 was part of a wave of Canadian AI talent getting snapped up by American tech firms, including Sanja Fidler, who leads Nvidia's Toronto research lab.

Dr. Pineau's departure from Meta in May coincided with a push from founder Mark Zuckerberg to spend hundreds of millions of dollars courting top researchers to join the company to pursue artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which refers to systems that are as smart as humans.

“This isn't a vote of protest against AGI,” Dr. Pineau said. “I'm interested in real solutions, rather than a lot of talk and the hype.” 

She received many job offers after leaving Meta, she said, and she chose Cohere because of its focus on responsible AI deployment and in order to be part of a smaller, more agile team.

She suggested to La Presse in July that she was also not comfortable with the U.S. tech industry's shift to support U.S. president Donald Trump.

She was more circumspect on Thursday. 

“I was at Meta for eight years or so through various political cycles,” she said. “It was a combination of just feeling like I was done with the cycle there, and looking for opportunities.”

There are a number of fundamental research problems she hopes to tackle at Cohere, including how to evaluate the performance of AI agents and how these tools interact with one another.

Donald Trump will meet with Vladimir Putin “one-on-one” on Friday to discuss the war in Ukraine.

The highly-anticipated summit, which Ukraine has been shut out of, will be attended only by the two leaders and their interpreters.

The talks are scheduled to start at 11.30am local time (8.30pm BST) and will be followed by a press conference.

“This will be followed by negotiations between the delegations, which will continue over a working breakfast,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.

Putin and Mr Trump will then hold a press conference, during which they will “summarise the results of the negotiations,” Mr Ushakov added.

The leaders will come face-to-face at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.

Mr Trump has visited the military base a number of times since he first took office in 2017.

With Alaska's closest point to Russia being just three miles across the Bering Strait, the location appears to be a win for both leaders.

Mike Dunleavy, Alaska's Republican governor, described the northwestern state as a “bridge between nations”.

He said it is “the most strategic location in the world,” given its close proximity to Russia, and it “stands ready to host this historic meeting”.

Alaska also used to be Russian territory.

Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the US in 1867 for $7.2m (£5.4m), and Russian nationalists have long dreamed of reclaiming it.

Recommended

Putin is indicted by the International Criminal Court, accused of ordering the theft of thousands of children from Ukraine to be sold to childless couples in Russia.

Holding the meeting in US territory means he can avoid the risk of arrest, as the country does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC.

Recommended

The US president previously said that within two minutes of meeting the Russian leader he would know “exactly whether or not a deal can get done” to end the conflict.

Mr Trump added that he would seek an immediate second meeting, this time involving Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, after the initial talks.

“If the first one goes okay, we'll have a quick second one. I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they'd like to have me there,” he said.

Tempering expectations of a breakthrough, the White House insisted the summit was a “listening exercise” for Mr Trump.

However, the US president is preparing to offer Putin access to rare earth minerals to incentivise him to end the war in Ukraine, The Telegraph revealed.

The US president will present money-making opportunities, including opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow and lifting some of the American sanctions on Russia's aviation industry.

The announcement comes after a wave of countries announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, with conditions.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is advancing a longstanding illegal settlement plan in the occupied West Bank which would split the region and “permanently bury the idea of a Palestinian state,” the minister said.

Under the plan, Israel will build more than 3,000 homes on stolen Palestinian land in the E1 settlement area. The settlements would cut off East Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied West Bank, connecting Jerusalem to an existing illegal settlement, Maale Adumim. East Jerusalem is widely recognized by Palestinian authorities and allies as the site for the capital of a Palestinian state.

“This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize,” said Smotrich in remarks Thursday. “Anyone in the world who tries today to recognize a Palestinian state will receive an answer from us on the ground.”

The plan is expected to receive final approval next week. 

Palestinian officials have condemned the announcement, saying it comes in tandem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's backing of the idea of “Greater Israel,” in which Israel would annex the entirety of what remains of historic Palestine, as well as parts of other Arab countries.

“Israel's newly announced plan to build 3,401 settlement units in the contentious E1 area, located between Jerusalem and the Ma'ale Adumim colony, the continuation of genocidal war in the Gaza Strip, and the escalation of settler violence will only lead to further escalation, tension, and instability,” the Palestinian president said in a statement.

The E1 plan has existed for decades as a longstanding goal of Israel and allies like the U.S. for Israel to conquer Palestine. Such proposals have existed under the guise of historic pushes for a two-state solution, which advocates for Palestinian rights often criticize as a distraction that allows Israel to continue its construction of illegal settlements, de facto annexation, and now genocide.

“It falls within the framework of the extremist Israeli government's plans to undermine any possibility of establishing a Palestinian state on the ground, to fragment the West Bank, and to separate its southern part from the center and the north,” Ahmed al Deek, political adviser to Palestinian foreign affairs minister, told The Associated Press. He called Smotrich's announcement a “colonial, expansionist, and racist move.”

U.S. leaders have previously opposed the E1 plan, causing it to be delayed, while still allowing other illegal settlement projects to proceed. But Israeli officials have been advancing the plan in recent months, and rights groups indeed say that it could prove a major impediment to the establishment of a Palestinian state. 

The announcement comes as Israel has escalated its rhetoric in openly backing the annexation of Gaza and the West Bank — after Israeli officials have been working toward the de facto annexation of the Palestinian territories for decades. This comes despite the International Court of Justice ruling last year reaffirming that Israel's settlements are illegal and ordering Israel to return the land to Palestinians.

Smotrich's announcement comes as a direct result of Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K.'s announcements that they are planning to recognize a Palestinian state — without announcing moves to hold Israel accountable and even as all of these states placed conditions on the recognition that favor Israel. 

Smotrich has moved in direct retaliation to such announcements before, collectively punishing Palestinians for foreign governments' actions. In June, he moved to effectively paralyze the Palestinian economy by cutting off Palestinian banks from the global system after Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and the U.K. announced that they were sanctioning Smotrich over “repeated incitements of violence” against Palestinians in the West Bank.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 13 to enhance American drug supply chain resilience by filling and maintaining the strategic reserve for essential pharmaceutical ingredients, with a preference for American-made ingredients—a move designed to push production away from dependency on China-made ingredients.

“Nearly two-in-five prescription finished drug products are made in the United States, including many of the essential medicines,” the president's executive order stated. “However, when it comes to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), the biologically active components of finished drug products, only about 10 percent of the APIs by volume for the finished drug products used in the United States are made here.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
    


            There never is.
    


            Dahl Memorial's three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
    


            Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana's most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
    


            Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
    


            A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.
    


            The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn't proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.
    


            Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn't without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians' extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.
    


            The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
    


            Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
    


            “It's important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
    


            Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can't afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
    


            “In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
    


            “I'm not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.
    


            Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn't unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
    


            The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.
    


            But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
    


            None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
    


            But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
    


            Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state's northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
    


            Adelman said he supports such laws only where it's feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state's emergency physicians' organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn't shutter any rural hospitals.
    


            Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
    


            Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn't possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren't refraining just to save money.
    


            He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state's hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state's troubled health care system.
    


            Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
    


            Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
    


            The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
    


            Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
    


            Haddock said ACEP wouldn't want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
    


            Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
    


            She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
    


            She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn't enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
    


            Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn't had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there's a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
    


            People eating at Ekalaka's sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital's clinic all told KFF Health News that they've been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
    


            Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who've been treated for more serious problems.
    


            “We've got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            Sam Altman, the artificial intelligence hype master, is in damage-control mode.
    


            OpenAI's latest version of its vaunted ChatGPT bot was supposed to be “PhD-level” smart. It was supposed to be the next great leap forward for a company that investors have poured billions of dollars into.
    


            Instead, ChatGPT got a flatter, more terse personality that can't reliably answer basic questions. The resulting public mockery has forced the company to make sweaty apologies while standing by its highfalutin claims about the bot's capabilities.
    


            In short: It's a dud.
    


 The misstep on the model, called GPT-5, is notable for a couple of reasons.
    


            1. It highlighted the many existing shortcomings of generative AI that critics were quick to seize on (more on that in a moment, because they were quite funny).
    


2. It raised serious doubts about OpenAI's ability to build and market consumer products that human beings are willing to pay for. That should be particularly concerning for investors, given OpenAI, which has never turned a profit, is reportedly worth $500 billion.



            Let's rewind a bit to last Thursday, when OpenAI finally released GPT-5 to the world — about a year behind schedule, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, one thing this industry is really good at is hype, and on that metric, CEO Sam Altman delivered. 



            During a livestream ahead of the launch last Thursday, Altman said talking to GPT-5 would be like talking to “a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything, any area you need.”
    


            In his typically lofty style, Altman said GPT-5 reminds him of “when the iPhone went from those giant-pixel old ones to the retina display.” The new model, he said, is “significantly better in obvious ways and subtle ways, and it feels like something I don't want to ever have to go back from,” Altman said in a press briefing.
    


            Then people started actually using it.
    


            Users had a field day testing GPT-5 and mocking its wildly incorrect answers.
    

500 billion dollars and the robot can't even count to twelve[image or embed]


            The journalist Tim Burke said on Bluesky that he prompted GPT-5 to “show me a diagram of the first 12 presidents of the United States with an image of their face and their name under the image.”
    


            The bot returned an image of nine people instead, with rather creative spellings of America's early leaders, like “Gearge Washingion” and “William Henry Harrtson.”
    


            A similar prompt for the last 12 presidents returned an image that included two separate versions of George W. Bush. No, not George H.W. Bush, and then Dubya. It had “George H. Bush.” And then his son, twice. Except the second time, George Jr. looked like just some random guy.
    

At first I thought GPT 5 had got this right then I saw things like  ""Tonnessee,"" ""Mississipo"" and my personal favourite ""West Wigina."" Please do not respond just saying the different typos to me we can all read the joke, we all know about ""Distrricke""[image or embed]


            Labeling basic maps of the United States also proved tricky for GPT-5 (but again, pretty funny, as tech writer Ed Zitron's post on Bluesky showed).
    


            GPT-5 did slightly better when I asked it on Wednesday for a map of the US. Some people can, in fact, label the great state of Vermont correctly without a PhD, but not GPT-5. And this is the first I'm hearing of states named “Yirginia.”
    


            The slop coming out of GPT-5 was funny when it was just us nerds trying to find its blind spots. But some regular fans of ChatGPT weren't laughing. Especially because users have been particularly alarmed by the new version's personality – or rather, lack thereof.
    


            In rolling out the new model, OpenAI essentially retired its earlier models, including the wildly popular GPT-4o that's been on the market for over a year, making it so that even people who loved the previous iteration of the chatbot suddenly couldn't use it. More than 4,000 people signed a Change.org petition to compel OpenAI to resurrect it.
    


            “I'm so done with ChatGPT 5,” one user wrote on Reddit, explaining how they tried to use the new model to run “a simple system” of tasks that an earlier ChatGPT model used to handle. The user said GPT-5 “went rogue,” deleting tasks and moving deadlines.
    


            And while OpenAI's defenders could chalk that up to an isolated or even made-up incident, within 24 hours of the GPT-5 launch Altman was doing damage control, seemingly caught of guard by the bad reception. On X, he announced a laundry list of updates, including the return of GPT-4o for paid subscribers.
    


            “We expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once,” Altman said in a post. “But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”
    


            The CEO's failure to anticipate the outrage suggests he doesn't have a firm grasp on how an estimated 700 million weekly active users are engaging with his product.
    


            Perhaps Altman missed all the coverage — from CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal — of people forming deep emotional attachments to ChatGPT or rival chatbots, having endless conversations with them as if they were real people. A simple search of Reddit could have offered insights into how others are integrating the tool into their workflows and lives. Basic market research should have shown OpenAI that a mass update sunsetting the tools people rely on would be more than just a bit bumpy.
    


            When asked about the backlash to GPT-5, an OpenAI representative pointed CNN to Altman's public statements on social media announcing the return of older models, as well as a blog post about how the company is optimizing GPT-5.
    


            The messy rollout speaks to how the AI industry as a whole is struggling to prove themselves as producers of consumer goods rather than “labs” — as they love to call themselves, because it sounds more scientific and distracts people from the fact that they are backed by people who are trying to make unfathomable amounts of cash for themselves.
    


            AI companies often base their fanfare around how a model performs in various behind-the-scenes benchmark tests that show how well a bot can do complex math. For all we know, GPT-5 sailed through those evaluations.
    


            But the problem is that OpenAI hyped the thing so far into the stratosphere, disappointment was (or should have been) inevitable.
    


            “I honestly didn't think OpenAI would burn the brand name on something so mid,” wrote prominent researcher and AI critic Gary Marcus. “In a rational world, their valuation would take a hit,” he added, noting OpenAI still hasn't turned a profit, is slashing prices to keep its user numbers up, and is hemorrhaging talent as competition heats up.
    


            For critics like Marcus, the GPT-5 flop was a kind of vindication. As he noted in a blog post, other models like Elon Musk's Grok aren't faring much better, and the backlash from even AI proponents feels like a turning point.
    


            When people talk about AI, they're talking about one of two things: the AI we have now — chatbots with limited, defined utility — and the AI that companies like Altman's claim they can build — machines that can outsmart humans and tell us how to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our crops, all while entertaining and delighting us along the way.
    


            But the gap between the promise and the reality of AI only seems to widen with every new model.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department said Thursday it will seek the death penalty against a member of the cultlike Zizians group accused of killing a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont in the latest Trump administration push for more federal executions. 

Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Seattle, is among a group of radical computer scientists focused on veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence who have been linked to six killings in three states.  She's accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions.

Youngblut initially was charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon. But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming, and a new indictment released Thursday charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses.

“We will not stand for such attacks on the men and women who protect our communities and borders,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti said in a press release.

In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi mentioned Maland as an example when saying she expects federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of law enforcement officers. And Youngblut's attorneys recently said they had been given a July 28 deadline to offer preliminary evidence about why she should be spared such a punishment. Her attorneys, who declined to comment Thursday, asked a judge last month to delay that deadline until January, but the judge declined.

At the time of the shooting, authorities had been watching Youngblut and her companion, Felix Bauckholt, for several days after a Vermont hotel employee reported seeing them carrying guns and wearing black tactical gear. She's accused of opening fire on border agents who pulled the car over on Interstate 91. An agent fired back, killing Bauckholt and wounding Youngblut.




The pair were among the followers of Jack LaSota, a transgender woman also known as Ziz whose online writing attracted young, highly intelligent computer scientists who shared anarchist beliefs. Members of the group have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on a California landlord in 2022, the landlord's subsequent killing earlier this year, and the deaths of one of the members' parents in Pennsylvania.

LaSota and two others face weapons and drug charges in Maryland, where they were arrested in February, while LaSota faces additional federal charges of being an armed fugitive. Another member of the group who is charged with killing the landlord in California had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut. Michelle Zajko, whose parents were killed in Pennsylvania, was arrested with LaSota in Maryland, and has been charged with providing weapons to Youngblut in Vermont.

Vermont abolished its state death penalty in 1972. The last person sentenced to death in the state on federal charges was Donald Fell, who was convicted in 2005 of abducting and killing a supermarket worker five years earlier. But the conviction and sentence were later thrown out because of juror misconduct, and in 2018, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Officials in the northern Caribbean warned Thursday of heavy rains and dangerous swells as Tropical Storm Erin approached the region.

The storm is expected to remain over open waters and move north-northeast of islands including Antigua and Barbuda, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Erin was located about 890 miles (1,435 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. It had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and was moving west at 17 mph (28 kph).

Erin is forecast to become a hurricane by Friday and strengthen into a Category 3 storm by late Saturday, which would mark the first major storm this season.

In an AP interview, National Weather Service senior hurricane specialist Jack Beven says Erin is currently a tropical storm, and is expected to strengthen as it moves closer to the Leeward Islands and possibly the Virgin Islands.

“Erin is moving into an area of the Atlantic primed for rapid intensification. The waters are incredibly warm,” said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather.

Tropical-storm force winds could occur in parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend, forecasters said.

“There is still a greater than normal uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and Bermuda in the long range,” the hurricane center said.

Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said nearly all models have Erin turning “safely east of the broader U.S. next week.”




Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

Forecasters are expecting another unusually busy season for the Atlantic, with predictions calling for six to 10 hurricanes, with up to half reaching major status.

DENVER (AP) — A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.

The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.

Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago. 

The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.

The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.

News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.

Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins. 




But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.

The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.

All 800 National Guard members have now been mobilized in Washington, D.C. as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown, according to the Defense Department. 

The Guard members are not armed, according to Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson. They're supporting other federal law enforcement agencies and are serving duties that include ""monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities and officers, traffic control posts and area beautification.""

They are located near the National Mall, Union Station and near a U.S. Park building in Anacostia, D.C. 

""The scope of support may be adjusted based on the needs of our partners,"" Wilson said. ""This would be very similar to the [Los Angeles] mission, where we can temporarily detain someone and then turn them over to the law enforcement.""

400 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS DESCEND UPON DC; EXPANDED CRIME CRACKDOWN EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT

Personnel from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secret Service were spotted patrolling the streets of D.C. Wednesday night, largely in groups, around the city in central downtown locations: Metro Center, 14th Street, Logan Circle and Chinatown. Some even ventured into residential neighborhoods. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told ""Fox and Friends"" that 45 arrests were made overnight, bringing the total to around 100 since the operations formally began on Monday. In addition, 29 illegal immigrants were detained, and three illegal firearms were seized on Wednesday evening. 

At least 400 National Guardsmen have reported for duty as of Wednesday, and a total of 800 will be at the ready by the end of the week. They will patrol the city in rotations, with about 200 out at a time.  An additional 500 federal agents are a part of the White House's task force to crack down on crime in the district.

While operations began with a focus on nighttime, they are ramping up into a continuous 24/7 cycle. 

In addition, D.C. police will extend a juvenile curfew zone in the Navy Yard through Aug. 31, police Chief Pamela Smith announced Thursday. The zone was established after police say a juvenile opened fire in the direction of other minors with a stolen gun, though no one was injured. Police say as many as 100 teens have gathered at night and caused trouble in the Navy Yard throughout the summer.

Protests have popped up across the city opposing Trump's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and the presence of the National Guard. 

One man was charged with assaulting an officer after he threw a sandwich at a CBP agent and called the officer a ""fascist.""

""He thought it was funny,"" Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jeannine Pirro said of the incident. ""Well, he doesn't think it's funny today, because we charged with him with a felony.""

A police checkpoint stopping vehicles was set up on 14th Street on Wednesday night, and protesters surrounded the checkpoint and shouted, ""Go home fascists!"" 

D.C. crime statistics show that violent crime hit a 30-year low in 2024; down 35% from the previous year. And this year, it's down 26% from last year at this time. 

But some insist the statistics are inaccurate, and the reality on the ground tells a different story.

""Look at these 45 victims, all 19 and under, all killed by gunfire in the last 18 months in DC and tell me that crime is down and we don't need an emergency focus on crimes of violence,"" Pirro wrote on X, alongside a picture of the under-20 victims of gun violence. 

The D.C. police union chief, Gregg Pemberton, cast doubt on the statistics showing a massive drop in crime over a two-year period.

""There's potentially a drop from where we were in 2023. I think that there's a possibility that crime has come down. But the department is reporting that in 2024, crime went down 35% – violent crime – and another 25% through August of this year. That is preposterous to suggest that cumulatively we've seen 60-plus percent drops in violent crime from where we were in '23, because we're out on the street. We know the calls we're responding to,"" he told NBC News. 

MPD's 3rd District commander was suspended after MPD said he was changing crime statistics to minimize serious crimes.

Significant resources have been deployed amid the search effort for Grant Gardner, according to an Aug. 11 post on the Big Horn County Wyoming Sheriff's Office Facebook page about the Minnesota man who went missing while hiking in Wyoming and has not been heard from in more than two weeks.

""Since our last update considerable resources and man power have been deployed in the search for Grant Gardner,"" Sheriff Ken Blackburn noted in the post, noting that the effort ""has been very active.""

""To illustrate what is being done to search, the following is a partial list of assets and personnel who are currently, or have been working directly on this search,"" the post notes, before going on to list various resources, such as ""Drones with cameras, capable of identifying colors and minute disturbances,"" ""Drones, helicopters, and planes with FLIR capabilities,"" ""Multiple dog tracking teams,"" ""Horse and foot teams,"" ""Wyoming National Guard,"" ""Private pilots,"" and more.

Grant Gardner was last heard from on July 29 after reaching the top of Cloud Peak, according to the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office. (Big Horn County Sheriff's Office)

The post on Monday — which was the latest update on the Facebook page — described the area as ""unforgiving,"" and noted, ""The Cloud Peak Wilderness is deceptively expansive, remote, and snow is starting to fall at higher elevations above 10,000 feet. Very thorough searches of these areas have been performed. Mr. Gardner could plausibly be in several areas and routes, all of which have been extensively searched.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the sheriff's office to request comment on Thursday.

The last contact from Gardner was more than two weeks ago, on July 29, when he informed his wife that he had reached the summit of Cloud Peak, according to an Aug. 4 Facebook post from the sheriff's office.

""On August 1, 2025 the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office received information regarding an over due hiker in the Cloud Peak Wilderness area, and immediately began a search and rescue operation,"" the post noted. 

""Grant Gardner of Minnesota had planned on an approximate three day hike through the Misty Moon Lake area, eventually summiting Cloud Peak, and returning to his vehicle completing his journey. Gardner made contact with his wife on the evening of July 29, 2025 letting her know he'd made it to the summit. Since that time there has not been any contact with Gardner,"" the post stated. ""A text sent to his wife at the summit indicated the climb was more taxing than he expected and he was tired.""

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in a New Mexico county riddled with violent crime and drug trafficking, two days after President Donald Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and temporarily took over the local police department.

The emergency declaration applies to Rio Arriba County, the city of Española, and nearby pueblos, which are Native American villages. The county government requested the state's help in response to an uptick in crime that has overwhelmed local resources, contributing to homelessness and fatal drug overdoses in the local community.

Grisham's order authorizes up to $750,000 in emergency funding for New Mexico's Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to address the crime surge in Rio Arriba, which is located in the northern part of the state, about 25 miles from Santa Fe.

“When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,” Grisham said in a statement. “We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.”

Grisham did not mention a deployment of the National Guard, although the executive order authorizing the emergency declaration permits it.

“The Adjutant General shall order into service any elements of the New Mexico National Guard as are or may be needed to provide military support to civil authorities as needed for this emergency,” the order states.

Wednesday's action marks the second time this year that Grisham has declared a state of emergency in the state over crime rates. In April, Grisham deployed about 70 New Mexico National Guard members to Albuquerque at the request of the city's police department to combat juvenile crime and fentanyl. The National Guard was used to secure perimeters around crime scenes and manage traffic control in order to free up local law enforcement's resources.

The emergency funds granted to Rio Arriba are intended to help local law enforcement agencies with spending on overtime pay, equipment, and coordinated police response, according to a spokesperson for Grisham's office.

DC OFFICIALS SEE TAKEOVER AS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS

On Monday, Trump declared a crime emergency to wrest control of the Metropolitan Police Department in the district and deploy the National Guard and other federal agents. The administration's takeover of the police has been met with resistance from Democratic lawmakers and local residents, although Mayor Muriel Bowser has so far been complying with the federal oversight. Over 100 people have been arrested in the district so far this week.

Trump has hinted he will send federal law enforcement to other blue, crime-ridden cities, naming Baltimore and Oakland as examples. While Trump did not name any city in New Mexico, Grisham appears to be getting ahead of the president with her own crime response.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The grand irony of the day I was sexually assaulted in Washington, D.C., is that my skirt really was rather short, not that you could actually see it.

It was November 2019, and exactly one incriminating inch of skin was visible from my chin to my toes. I was wearing a turtleneck dress, my then-boyfriend's old peacoat, and a pair of thigh-high boots that covered my entire leg up to the bottom of the coat — unless you were searing for a sliver of skin in between my legs for a fraction of a second in between my steps.

I was not drunk. It was not late. I was not in a bad area. With permission, I was leaving the Washington Examiner office a little early, just after 3 p.m., to prepare for a joint birthday party I was hosting, walking east on L St. Northwest toward 13th St. toward my Chinatown apartment when I felt the jolt of pressure, then pain, of a stranger's fingers inside of me. I whipped around in a frenzy to see a tall man smiling at me as his hand wove under my coat and between my legs, flashing his ultra white teeth and almost a wink at his little stolen moment, and then he ran down the alley going north. I screamed and stumbled into the street. It was broad daylight, with two eyewitnesses who stayed to corroborate my story to the police. Later, a detective would tell me that there were multiple private security cameras on the block. But the man was never arrested, and I was never called back. The last thing the police told me was that if I ever saw him again, I could make a citizen's arrest.

I guess I should consider myself lucky, as far as crimes in D.C. go. Earlier that year, one of my best friends was maced by a group of teenage girls outside a Safeway, and a few years later, a mutual friend would be stabbed in broad daylight. My husband was the victim of a hit and run while he was on a jog, which the police saw but refused to pursue. And my fellow On Deadline cohost has had a gun pulled on him and his car stolen more than once. By the time Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R) 2021 victory liberated Virginia from COVID-19-era tyranny, Mr. Doescher's proposal of a move across the Potomac that came with one of marriage elicited more of a “Hell yes” than an “Oh well.”

I still take the metro into D.C. every week to work. I still walk down L St. Northwest. I still cavort across town for on-the-record meals and off-the-record martinis, and despite my better judgment, I still love D.C and want it not to be a wasteland of shuttered and boarded-up storefronts, silent but for gunshots and the wailings of the deranged and drug-addled lunatics who wander the city.

So, naturally, it should surprise me that the Democrats who dominate the district evidently do not agree.

When President Donald Trump announced he was invoking Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to federalize the D.C. police and crack down on the worst of the district's violent crime, Democrats and their media stenographers exuded more apoplexy than they had over the violent crime itself.

The ostensibly objective New York Times reporter Peter Baker insinuated that Trump, “citing a nonexistent crime crisis,” was a hypocrite for cracking down on violent crime because he “himself has been convicted of 34 felonies and is the first criminal elected president.” CNN's Dana Bash proclaimed that “the most violent moment in recent history in D.C. was Jan. 6,” and MSNBC's Ken Dilanian declared that crime in D.C. “is actually at historical lows.”

Jan. 6 was indeed a disgraceful day. The 174 law enforcement officers assaulted that day indeed outnumbered the 60 injured during D.C.'s race riots in May 2020, though nobody was murdered during either event. But crime in D.C. is nowhere near historic lows. In their effort to triple down on opposing everything Trump even suggests, Democrats have deluded themselves into defying the cold, data-driven reality that D.C.'s violent crime rate is a national disgrace.

It is true that D.C.'s homicide rate has fallen from its 20-year high in 2023. It is also true that the lower homicide rate in 2024 — 26.6 per 100,000 people — was the fourth highest of the nation's cities and more than twice as high as the murder rates of Bogota, Baghdad, Mexico City, and Nairobi. Both the 2024 homicide rate and the 2024 violent crime rate of some 500 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in D.C. are more than any other state in the union. That's, of course, if you believe the data isn't understating — the police commander has been suspended for allegations of intentionally downgrading the data.

The city's liberal elite may be subject to carjackings or sex crimes, but they can mostly ignore the worst of violent crime because it simply doesn't affect them. Nearly half of all violent crime victims in D.C. and more than half of its homicide victims are residents of Wards 7 and 8, where nine in 10 residents are black and a quarter are impoverished.

More than a quarter of sex crimes and two-fifths of murders went uncleared last year, as did the overwhelming majority of robberies and nonfatal shootings.

D.C.'s dark indigo electorate may not necessarily agree with Trump's solution, but they agree that violent crime is a crisis. Just last year, the Washington Post found that two-thirds of the district's residents consider local crime to be “extremely” or “very” serious, with fewer than a quarter considering themselves “very” safe from crime.

Within the confines of the Home Rule Act, Trump cannot solve all of (as former Vice President Kamala Harris liked to say) the root causes of the crime crisis. For example, officers widely attribute the 5% increase in juvenile crime in 2024 and the fact that juveniles are responsible for two-thirds of carjackings to the more than doubling of truancy at D.C.'s public schools. The 30% of middle schoolers and the majority of high schoolers who are truant have to be doing something all day, and the police suspect that said something is often violent crime. One of the 15-year-old Maryland girls who stabbed a DOGE employee over the weekend had “major truancy issues,” according to Judge Kendra Briggs. Section 740 doesn't fix the fact that the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education does not follow up on educational neglect reports, nor does it fill the 1,000-officer void in the Metropolitan Police Department, which has a staffing level of a half-century low.

All of this is why Republicans are considering bringing the half-century experiment of D.C. home rule to an overdue end. The Constitution mandates that Congress govern the seat of the federal government, but as with the depreciating U.S. dollar, Great Society, and the rest of our modern ills, the Home Rule Act was championed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The year was 1973, and D.C.'s population was larger than it is today.

WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT ON DC CRIME

The 2019 sexual assault was far from the worst thing that's ever happened to me, but the assailant is still out there, presumably at large. The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform estimates just 200 to 500 people are responsible for D.C.'s thousands of gun crimes, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that convicted sexual predators in general are three times as likely to be rearrested for repeat offenses as other criminals who serve their time. Presumably, the man who attacked me is still out there.

Hollywood starlets can flee Studio City for Cannes, and big bankers can trade Manhattan for Miami. But the Constitution demands that D.C. be in D.C., and Congress still reserves the power to federalize the D.C. police for the president. In a city of some 700,000 people, nearly 16,000 or over 2% have been the victim of a crime in the first eight months of this year, including 55 victims of sex crimes and 101 murders. Those numbers might not be too high for our media elite — but they are for Trump and for me.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Centuries-Old Quest for “Genius”","https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/definition-of-genius/683873/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:25:36 GMT","

Humans have long tried to understand a quicksilver quality that defies explanation.

This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic's archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

“When Paul Morphy plays seven games of chess at once and blindfold, when young Colburn gives impromptu solution to a mathematical problem involving fifty-six figures, we are struck with hopeless wonder,” J. Brownlee Brown wrote in 1864. His Atlantic article had a simple headline: “Genius.” Only seven years after the founding of this magazine, its writers were already addressing one of the greatest questions of the 19th century: How should we define genius, that everyday word we use to denote the extraordinary?

Brown's two geniuses are largely forgotten today. Morphy was a chess wizard from New Orleans who grew tired of the game and gave up playing seriously at just 22. He reportedly died in his bath at age 47. Zerah Colburn's story is even more tragic: As a child, he wasn't thought to be particularly gifted until his father overheard him repeating multiplication tables after only a few weeks' schooling. The little boy from Vermont was then dragged around Europe as a “mental calculator,” ruling on whether large numbers were primes or not, and sent to an expensive school thanks to the patronage of an earl. But like many child prodigies, his adult life was a comparative disappointment. He died of tuberculosis at 34.

While researching my new book, The Genius Myth, I spent a lot of time exploring how we tell stories of exceptional achievement, and what the changing definition of genius reveals about the history of Western thought. The word itself comes from Latin, where it was used to mean a person's spirit—the inner essence that gave them their unique characteristics. “Every man, says the oracle, has his daemon, whom he is bound to obey; those who implicitly follow that guidance are the prophetic souls, the favorites of the gods,” Frederic Henry Hodge wrote in The Atlantic in 1868. “It is this involuntary, incalculable force that constitutes what we call genius.”

Well into the 20th century, The Atlantic used this older definition, writing about people who possessed a genius, rather than those who were one. Individuals whom this magazine has described as being or having a genius include Richard Strauss, Leo Tolstoy, George Gershwin, Cormac McCarthy, Alice Munro, and Edith Wharton, that last accolade having been delivered by Gore Vidal. Oh, plus the 23-year-old hockey player Bobby Orr, the children's cartoon Rugrats, and the shopping channel QVC.

This proclamation makes for great copy, because it is deeply subjective. Christopher Hitchens was prepared to call the poet Ezra Pound a genius, but not the acclaimed mystery author Dorothy L. Sayers, whose work he dismissed as “dismal pulp.” (I know whose work I would rather read.) In 1902, a female writer for this magazine airily declared that there were no great women writers to compare with Juvenal, Euripides, and Milton. “George Eliot had a vein of excellent humor, but she never shares it with her heroes,” argued Ellen Duvall, adding that Jane Austen's male heroes were “as solemn as Minerva's owl.”

The science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Something similar is true of geniuses. An earlier age would have attributed Paul Morphy and Zerah Colburn's gifts to divine providence, but in the more secular 19th-century America, another explanation was needed. “We seek in vain for the secret of this mastery,” wrote Brown of his subjects. “It is private,—as deeply hidden from those who have as from those who have it not.”

For the genius-hunters, one encouraging source for exceptional talent was inheritance. At the time Brown was writing about Morphy and Colburn, academics throughout the Western world were wrestling with the theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin only six years earlier. The study of what would later be called genetics promised new methods of understanding genius, that quicksilver quality that seemed so resistant to explanation.

The first edition of Hereditary Genius, by Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton, was published in America in 1870. Galton's work aimed to classify all men into lettered bands, depending on their mental faculties and lifetime achievements. The Atlantic reviewed Hereditary Genius that year, noting that the difference between the men in the upper part of Galton's highest band and those in his lowest band “represents the difference between Shakespeare and the most degraded idiot mentioned in medical literature.” This was a coldly rational view of genius—more scientific in appearance, but also less humane.

Galton went on to coin the term eugenics. His unpublished utopian novel, The Eugenic College of Kantsaywhere, imagined a world where people were allowed to marry only after extensive tests of their fitness to reproduce, and where those who failed were shipped off to labor colonies. Thanks to the popularity of eugenics at the time, what started as an attempt to identify geniuses eventually led the U.S. Supreme Court to justify the forced sterilization of the “feeble minded” in Buck v. Bell in 1927. Thousands of Americans were subsequently denied the right to have children—an idea that also took hold in Nazi Germany, where an estimated 400,000 people were sterilized under the Hitler regime in the name of “racial hygiene.”

From the start, Galton's ideas about genius were presented in explicitly racial terms: He believed that Europeans were intellectually superior to Africans, and that ancient Athenians were superior to both. The Atlantic, a proudly abolitionist magazine, ran an article that contested this bigotry. In 1893, Havelock Ellis argued that many in the contemporary canon of geniuses had mixed ancestry, from what he called the “negro blood” that was “easy to trace in the face of Alexandre Dumas, in certain respects, to the Iroquois blood in Flaubert.” The popular novelist Olive Schreiner's heritage was “German, English, and Jewish,” Ellis observed, while Thomas Hardy believed his paternal great-grandmother to have been Irish. (Neither Jews nor Irish people would have been considered white, according to popular beliefs of the time.)

Today, most modern geneticists acknowledge that intelligence is partially heritable—it can be passed down by parents—but that does not account for the making of a genius. “We can no more produce a whole race of Newtons and Shakespeares than we can produce perpetual motion,” the anonymous author of the Hereditary Genius review wrote in 1870. A “genius” can pass on some of their genes, but not their personality—nor the social conditions in which their success happened.

That matters. While talking about my book, I've found that acknowledging the role of luck in success makes some people nervous. They think that any discussion of broader historical forces is a covert attempt to debunk or downplay the importance of individual talent or hard work. But even 19th-century Atlantic writers could see the importance of good timing. “A given genius may come either too early or too late,” William James wrote in 1880. “Cromwell and Napoleon need their revolutions, Grant his civil war. An Ajax gets no fame in the day of telescopic-sighted rifles.”

As we get closer to the present, a note of sarcasm creeps into the word's usage: In the 2000s, the writer Megan McArdle used the recurrent headline “Sheer Genius” for columns on businesses making terrible errors. But she was far from the first Atlantic writer to use the word sardonically. One of my favorite essays on genius from the archives is a satirical squib from 1900, which masquerades as an ad for a Genius Discovery Company. “This country needs more geniuses,” the anonymous author wrote. “Everybody knows it. Everybody admits it. Everybody laments it.” The article urged any reader who wondered whether they might be a genius to write in, enclosing a five-dollar fee, “and we will tell you the truth by return mail.”

Having studied the flawed and fickle way that we award the label genius, let me say this—that's as good a method as any other.

Taylor Swift says life on her record-breaking Eras Tour wasn't all glitz and glamour.

During an appearance on the ""New Heights"" podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce, the pop star spoke about the physical toll of performing on the stage night after night.

When asked how she felt after wrapping up her tour after months on the road, Swift said she felt ""great.""

""I miss it. I do miss it, but it's like it was perfect for what it was. Do you know what I mean? And it was a lot of physical therapy, and it was a lot of being in a state of perpetual physical discomfort — kind of like when you're in season,"" Swift told the brothers.

The singer added that she kept an acupuncture mat in the hotel room that she used after the shows.

The Eras Tour, which grossed over $2 billion, consisted of 149 shows held across 21 countries. Each concert lasted an average of three hours and fifteen minutes, depending on the set list and the weather.

Despite the grueling schedule, Swift says she misses her fans and the connection she was able to share with them during the tour.

""It was so special. It was the most formative time of my life. I learned so much about how far I can push myself if I set a goal,"" Swift said.

Committing to such a lengthy set from the beginning of a tour was a significant commitment, she added.

""Making that a three-and-a-half-hour show at the beginning of the tour, it's like you can't be sick one day and then decide tonight it's going to be two-and-a-half hours,"" Swift said. ""It's really just prioritizing the fans' experience before anything else.""

That includes things like stomach flu, aching feet, or blisters, she added.

Looking back on the experience, Swift said she wouldn't do anything differently.

""I'm glad that I got to actually be prepared for this tour the way that I was,"" she said.

Unlike previous tours, where she only hit her stride toward the final stretch, Swift said she wanted to have her stamina from day one.

""That's why I did so much more training, so much more endurance training, and cardio, and stuff that doesn't come naturally because I'm not an athlete, so it's like that stuff I have to really force myself to do,"" she said.

Swift previously said she ran on the treadmill while ""singing the entire set list out loud"" to train for the tour. She also took three months of dance training and cut out alcohol for the duration of the tour.

Swift announced her coming album, ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" in a preview clip from the podcast that was released on Tuesday.

A representative for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

How her mom and brother helped finally get it done.","https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-started-saving-teenager-to-buy-music-masters-2025-8","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:30:00 GMT","

How did Taylor Swift close one of the biggest deals of her career? With help from her mom and little brother.

Swift gave a behind-the-scenes look at how she was able to buy back her music masters during an episode of ""New Heights,"" the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce.

The episode aired on Wednesday and had over 1.3 million viewers on YouTube as of this writing.

Swift, who bought her masters earlier this year for a reported $360 million, said she'd been saving for that moment since she was a teenager.

""It's always been a huge thing for me. Since I was a teenager, I've been actively saving up money to buy my music back and to ever own it in the first place because it's usually the label that owns it,"" she said. ""I've always wanted this to happen.""

Swift said she signed a record deal when she was 15 and that typically, such deals are set up so the artist does not own their master recordings: ""Owning your master records means that you have complete control and power over distribution, licensing, and essentially the way your legacy is shaped,"" she said.

The masters for Swift's first six albums had several owners over the years, including Big Machine Records and Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. She said the first time they were sold, it ""really ripped my heart out of my chest.""

""I thought about not owning my music every day. It was like an intrusive thought that I had every day,"" she said.

That motivated her to rerecord the albums, releasing them one at a time with the appended title of ""Taylor's Version."" She released four of the rerecorded albums before buying back her masters this year.

The rereleases were a huge success for Swift. They were praised by critics and loved by fans, garnering more streams than the original versions.

After the Eras Tour, Swift said her team thought it might be a good time to approach the then-owners of her masters, a private equity firm called Shamrock Capital, to see if she could buy her music outright.

""I don't want to be in a partnership. I don't want to own 30% of it. I want to own all of it,"" she said. ""But it was a long shot to think that they would do that — that they would sell that asset to me.""

Swift said she wanted to approach the purchase from a personal place because it was more than a business transaction to her. So rather than sending a team of lawyers or managers, Swift said she sent her mom and brother, who she said she also works with, to meet with Shamrock Capital. 

""They told them the whole story — of all the times we've tried to buy it, all the times it's fallen through, all the times we had gotten plans together and figured out something we thought was going to work and it didn't at the last minute,"" she said.

Eventually, some time after the meeting and a couple of months after the Super Bowl, Swift said she got the call from her mom.

""She's like, 'You got your music.' And I just very dramatically hit the floor, for real,"" Swift said. ""Like, honestly, just started bawling my eyes out, and I'm just like weeping.""

""This changed my life. I can't believe it still,"" she added.

Swift announced her coming album, ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" in a preview clip from the podcast that was shared shortly after midnight on Tuesday.

Nike co-founder Phil Knight is donating $2 billion to the Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, the single largest donation ever to a U.S. university, college or health institution, according to the Knight Foundation.

The foundation said on Thursday the gift that will be used to shift the scientific approach to cancer treatment, research and patient care outcomes.

As part of the gift, the Knights will partner with cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker.

A decade ago, Druker and OHSU took on a challenge to raise $500 million for cancer research, and the Knights signed on to match the raise dollar-for-dollar.

""We are grateful for the opportunity to invest in the next stage of the Druker-led revolutionary vision of cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, care, and some day, eradication,"" Phil and Penny Knight said in a statement. ""We couldn't be more excited about the transformational potential of this work for humanity.""

Knight's fortune stems from his success with the swoosh, the company he founded in 1964.

Originally called Blue Ribbon Sports, the business began humbly, with Knight selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car, as he recounted in his 2016 memoir, ""Shoe Dog.""

Nike went public in December 1980 and quickly became the most dominant sneaker brand, partnered with some of the top athletes across sport.

During Knight's tenure at the public company, from its IPO to his June 2016 retirement, Nike shares soared almost 30,500%.

Although Nike stock has had a painful few years, down more than 50% from its peak in late 2021, it remains the most valuable public company in athletic footwear, valued at more than $110 billion.

The Knights are regularly found on lists of top philanthropists. In May, Time Magazine estimated their lifetime giving at $3.6 billion, including $370 million gifted in 2024 alone.

According to the Knight Foundation's latest tax documents the foundation held more than $5 billion in assets at the end of 2023.

""I wanted to build something that was my own, something I could point to and say: I made that. It was the only way I saw to make life meaningful,"" Knight said in his 2016 memoir.

Correction: The headline on this story has been updated to correct that Phil Knight is donating to Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute. A previous version misstated the institution.

Shares of Coach and Kate Spade parent Tapestry plunged Thursday after the company said tariffs will bite into its profits even as sales grow.

The handbag, shoe and accessory maker said costs from higher duties will total $160 million for its coming fiscal year and drag on its profits. It said it expects full-year fiscal 2026 earnings of $5.30 to $5.45 per share, while analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $5.49.

On the company's earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said sales trends have been strong. Yet he said the company is ""facing greater than previously expected profit headwinds from tariffs and duties, with the earlier than expected ending of de minimis exemptions being a meaningful factor.""

Along with raising tariffs on imports from many countries, President Donald Trump suspended the de minimis rule, which allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free.

Tapestry expects its sales to grow in the fiscal year, however. The company said it expects revenue of about $7.2 billion, excluding Stuart Weitzman, which would represent low single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Tapestry agreed earlier this year to sell the shoe brand to Dr Scholl's footwear owner Caleres for $105 million.

Tapestry's fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue also topped Wall Street's expectations.

In recent weeks, retailers and consumer brands have offered a clearer picture of how they're trying to mitigate higher costs from tariffs — including many that went into effect earlier this month after delays and extensions. Trump on Monday pushed back high tariffs on China for another 90 days.

Among those strategies, companies are moving manufacturing to other countries, raising prices on some items they sell, trimming promotions and focusing on trendy items that shoppers are more likely to buy.

Crocs CEO Andrew Rees, for instance, told investors on an earnings call earlier this month that it is reducing orders for the back half of the year after seeing weaker demand from retailers that carry its shoes. It also is taking back some of the older inventory from its Heydude shoe brand from retailers and giving partners newer stock.

Yet Tapestry's Roe said the company's conservative outlook ""has nothing to do with the trajectory of our business.""

He said demand hasn't slowed, and has even accelerated so far in the current quarter. But he added, ""We feel like being prudent at this early stage in our full-year guidance is the right position.""

He said Tapestry is focused on ways to blunt the cost of tariffs, including leaning on its manufacturing in many different parts of the globe and looking for ways to operate more efficiently.

Major U.S. retailers are sharing their latest sales updates and outlooks in the coming weeks. Walmart, Home Depot and Target are all scheduled to report quarterly earnings next week.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday said it is raising the list price of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro in the U.K. starting in September, as President Donald Trump pressures drugmakers to lower U.S. drug prices and hike them abroad.

In a statement, Eli Lilly said it reached an agreement with the U.K. government to increase the list price of the weekly injection, while ""maintaining access"" for patients covered under the publicly funded health-care system, the National Health Service, or NHS. 

Eli Lilly told CNBC that the price hike will not affect the drug's availability under NHS, and it wants to work with the government to boost access. The company added that it does not determine prices that private health-care providers set, but is working with them to ensure access to Mounjaro. 

In a statement on Thursday, NHS said Mounjaro's list price increase ""will not affect NHS commissioning of tirzepatide in England for eligible people living with obesity, based on clinical priority, or as a treatment for type 2 diabetes."" Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Mounjaro and its counterpart for weight loss, Zepbound.

Mounjaro's current list price in the UK ranges from £92 (about $124.89) to £122 a month, depending on the dose size, according to Eli Lilly. The drug's new list price will increase to between £133 and £330 starting on Sept. 1. 

The company added that it is working with certain governments and expects to make pricing adjustments in those countries by that date. In the U.S., the list price for a month's supply of Mounjaro is $1,079.77 before insurance and other rebates. 

Eli Lilly said it supports the Trump administration's goal of keeping the U.S. the ""world's leading destination for biopharmaceutical research and manufacturing, and the objective of more fairly sharing the costs of breakthrough medical research across developed countries."" 

""This rebalancing may be difficult, but it means the prices for medicines paid by governments and health systems need to increase in other developed markets like Europe in order to make them lower in the US,"" the company said in the statement.

The announcement comes after Trump in July sent separate letters to 17 drugmakers, including Eli Lilly, calling on them to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. 29. The move built on the president's executive order in May reviving a controversial plan – the ""most favored nation"" policy – that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.

U.S. prescription drug prices are two-to-three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. Trump has said he wants to narrow that gap to stop Americans from being ""ripped off.""

Eli Lilly's announcement on Thursday comes as the industry braces for Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In its statement, the company said it opposes those tariffs, arguing they will ""raise costs, limit patient access, and undermine American leadership, especially for companies already investing heavily in domestic manufacturing.""

In recent months, Eli Lilly was among several drugmakers to announce new plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing sites.

Intel shares rose 7% on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is in talks with the chipmaker to have the U.S. government take a stake in the struggling company.

Intel is the only U.S. company with the capability to manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. shores, although rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung also have U.S. factories. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high technology to be manufactured in the U.S.

The government's stake would help fund factories that Intel is currently building in Ohio, according to the report.

Earlier this week, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan visited Trump in the White House, a meeting that took place after the president had called for Tan's resignation based on allegations he has ties to China.

Intel said at the time that Tan is ""deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests."" An Intel representative declined to comment about reports that the government is considering taking a stake in the company.

""We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation,"" the spokesperson said.

Tan took over Intel earlier this year after the chipmaker failed to gain significant share in artificial intelligence chips, while it was spending heavily to build its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.

Intel's foundry business has yet to secure a major customer, which would be a critical step in moving towards expansion and giving other potential customers the confidence to turn to Intel for manufacturing.

In July, Tan said that Intel was canceling plans for manufacturing sites in Germany and Poland and would slow down development in Ohio, adding that spending at the chipmaker would be closely scrutinized.

Under Trump, the U.S. government has increasingly moved to put itself at the center of deals in major industries. Last week, it said it would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. It also took a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant.

Intel shares are now up 19% this year after losing 60% of their value in 2024, the worst year on record for the chipmaker.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) retreated more than 3% from its record highs on Thursday after hotter-than-expected inflation soured expectations of a large rate cut in September and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled the US won't be purchasing bitcoin for its strategic reserve.

On Wednesday, bitcoin touched an all-time high past $123,500 per token in anticipation of looser monetary policy and corporate purchases. Crypto rolled over after July's Producer Price Index came in much higher than expected.

During an interview with Fox Business, Bessent said US reserves of bitcoin amount to around $15 billion or $20 billion at today's prices.

""We've also started to get into the 21st century — a bitcoin strategic reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,"" he said.

Expectations of Fed rate cuts, coupled with heavy purchases from corporate treasuries, have driven up the price of the asset this year.

The cryptocurrency has gained 25% year to date and has rallied roughly 57% since the April lows.

Inflows into spot exchange-traded funds, along with purchases from public companies copying the blueprint of software firm-turned-bitcoin juggernaut Strategy (MSTR) by adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, have been key drivers of this year's rally.

Strategists also point to the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance as a major catalyst.

""The administration is pushing crypto. They are pushing bitcoin. Bitcoin is the lead dog in the crypto market,"" Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week.

""So is it short-term a little frothy? Sure,"" he added. ""But longer term, there are some fundamental changes here that I think are bullish for it.""

Last week, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets, a move that could significantly expand retail investor access to crypto.

The price surge also comes as US equities have notched all-time records on expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September and that Trump's next Fed chair pick will likely favor looser monetary policy.

Meanwhile, ethereum (ETH-USD) prices also retreated more than 3% on Thursday after rising to near record levels as Wall Street grows increasingly bullish on the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Companies have been adding ether to their balance sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as stablecoins.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin hit record highs on Wednesday with the increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The top crypto is up 3.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading near $123,500, following a record high of $124,128 earlier in the trading session, according to CoinGecko data.

“Liquidity is being shovelled into risk assets right now, and there is no obvious sign of any overheating, Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, told Decrypt. “Funding rates are well within normal ranges across all the major global exchanges.”

With the odds of a September rate cut soaring above 90%, a lower interest rate would encourage borrowing and stimulate spending. The stock market and crypto tend to rise in such environments, as investors seek higher yields from risk assets.

“When Bitcoin enters price discovery, I focus on orderbook dynamics,"" David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime brokerage FalconX, told Decrypt.  

“So far, conditions look exceptionally strong,” Lawant added. ""Bitcoin has held near all-time highs for weeks despite heavy selling pressure in the order books. Setups like this can fuel explosive rallies once that selling pressure recedes.”

What Treasury Secretary Bessent's Call for a 50bps Cut in September Could Mean for Crypto

Renewed buying pressure and confidence can also be attributed to the crypto-friendly regulatory climate in Washington under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 

“Digital Asset Treasuries” are the primary reason for Ethereum's recent ascent, Sean Dawson, Derive's head of research, told Decrypt on Monday. He explained that DATs have the “ability to pass on staking rewards, something ETFs are currently unable to do.”

It follows a development by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May, which exempted self-custodial staking from securities laws.

Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High Price as Ethereum Nears Record

With the added regulatory clarity and increased investor confidence, Dawson expects Ethereum to surge past his year-end target of $6,000 and hit $8,000 to $10,000. He gives these targets a 20% to 10% odds.

Increased “regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case resolution” is one of the primary reasons for XRP's recent ascent, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget research, told Decrypt.

He sees XRP reaching as high as $5.81 this year, with broader adoption potentially driving the token toward $9 by the end of 2026.

Still, the ""clear danger"" is the market's assumption that the Fed will cut rates next month, Swyftx's Hundal cautioned.

""Despite the fact that core CPI ticked up slightly, we don't know what the full impact of tariffs is going to be,"" he said. ""It feels like we're priced for perfection, and that makes me nervous.""

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies slipped on Thursday after rising producer prices blunted rate-cut hopes, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government wouldn't start cutting checks to flesh out its strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Bitcoin changed hands around $118,000 on Thursday, a 2.9% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum also fell 2.9% to $4,560, while Solana and XRP dropped 2.4% to $194 and 5.7% to $3.07, respectively.

The PPI report snapped a strong trading week for Bitcoin, with the asset's price setting a new all-time high above $124,000 on Wednesday, while Ethereum surged toward record levels.

The Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks price changes across a broad range of goods and services for producers, jumped 0.9% in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists expected the index to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis.

Representing the largest monthly increase since May 2022, Thursday's hotter-than-expected PPI reading showed an increase in the index's trade component, a worrying sign for the Federal Reserve, according to Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at personal finance firm SoFi.

“The Fed will not like this report,” she said on X.

The central bank has held interest rates steady so far this year, fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could make it harder to achieve its 2% inflation goal. As some officials have pointed to signs of fragility in the labor market recently, however, traders have grown increasingly confident that the Fed will cut rates at the conclusion of its September meeting.

US Will Not Be Purchasing Any Bitcoin, Treasury Secretary Bessent Says

Traders took a slight step back on Thursday, penciling in a 92.8% chance of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the conclusion of the Fed's next meeting compared to a 94.3% a day before, according to CME FedWatch.

Citing large downward revisions for employment figures for May and June, Bessent advocated for a 50-basis-point rate cut on Tuesday. The odds of a jumbo-sized rate cut in September evaporated on Thursday, falling to 0.0% from 5.7% a day before.

Although Bessent's comments may have worked in Bitcoin's favor earlier this week, with risk assets like stocks and crypto historically benefiting from lower interest rates, his latest comments appeared to dampen enthusiasm towards the coin on Thursday.

The official said that the government is “not going to be buying” Bitcoin to supplement its existing holdings of confiscated assets. Previously, the White House had teased purchasing Bitcoin to add to the nation's stockpile in a budget-neutral way.

“We are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,” Bessent said of the Bitcoin reserve. “We're going to stop selling that.”

As the GENIUS Act has spurred rampant speculation about banks issuing stablecoins, Citigroup     and JPMorganChase     are using the underlying technology to gain a digital asset foothold among corporate users.

Citi this week partnered with payments fintech Payoneer to support blockchain-enabled treasury transfers using Citi's Token Services, the bank's blockchain unit. This follows JPMorganChase's launch of its deposit token, an alternative to stablecoins that also uses distributed ledger technology to speed transaction processing. 

The banks' moves position them to leverage their giant payment businesses to offer a range of digital asset services, including stablecoins, placing pressure on other banks to prepare for a range of new products. 

""Banks, regardless of size, need a stablecoin strategy now,"" said James Wester, director of crypto for Javelin Strategy & Research. ""That doesn't mean they need every technical answer, but they do need a clear vision of where they fit and how they will connect their customers, partners, and developers into the next generation of money movement.""

Payoneer, a New York-based company that processes B2B and consumer-to-business transfers, will use Citi's blockchain to move money across Payoneer-owned accounts, reducing the need for traditional payment methods. 

""Money movements in legacy systems have cut-off times,"" Derek Green, treasurer at Payoneer, told American Banker. ""Addressing that is a powerful first step in the value of blockchain."" 

By using Citi Token Services, Payoneer avoids restricted bank hours and closures on weekends and holidays. Payoneer hopes the collaboration will ensure ""instant liquidity"" through 24/7 transfers between Payoneer users in the U.S., U.K. and Singapore. Using a blockchain reduces cash management and foreign exchange risk; and an application programming interface enables integration with a business's existing treasury and payment systems, avoiding infrastructure updates, according to Payoneer. The Citi deal helps Payoneer accelerate its ongoing geographic and product expansion. Payoneer's 2020 acquisition of German payment firm Optile allowed it to integrate payments orchestration with cloud-based technology to power international business payments while adding more countries to its network. 

""Given our geographic reach [Citi] is a way to make transfers less complex,"" Green said. 

While Payoneer's partnership with Citi uses tokenized deposits, the use of stablecoins for transactions is a possibility, according to Green. 

""The blockchain is really the fundamental technology here,"" Green said. ""The stablecoins would be the mechanism that would facilitate the outcome.""

Like most banks and payment companies, Payoneer is still examining how stablecoins would best suit its business. Getting on board with blockchain-powered payment processing is a way to lay a foundation for greater uses in the future, according to Green. ""Citi is a partner of ours and it makes sense to lean in and get this technology live,"" Green said. 



Citi referred questions to recent statements the bank has made on digital assets. In an early interview with American Banker, Debopama Sen, head of payments for Citi's Services business, said the bank has focused on supporting 24/7/365 clearing for Citi's clients. ""Something we've learned over the last few years, we didn't sort of imagine or dream this up — is that co-creating with some of the largest category leaders has helped us create products that actually work for everyone as long as we simplify the access of the channel, depending on the client,"" Sen said.

Citi's Token Services uses a distributed ledger, database and embedded business logic to power services such as intraday lending, cross-border payments and funds transfers, designed for supply chain financing, trade settlement and other functions. Stablecoins are also part of the bank's strategy, with Citi CEO Jane Fraser saying the bank is planning a stablecoin and will support conversions from traditional currency to crypto. These services are value-adds for the bank's large payments business. Citi's payments business processes $5 trillion across more than 90 countries and jurisdictions on a daily basis, including 11 million daily instant transactions. Among other large banks, JPMorgan also plans to issue a stablecoin and in June said it plans to issue a USD deposit token, JPMD. 

A deposit token is a digital asset that is a claim on a deposit at a licensed depository institution, such as a bank. Deposit tokens are issued on a distributed ledger. That makes deposit tokens easier to transfer between consumers or businesses, particularly in different countries.

JPMorgan's payments business manages $18 billion in yearly revenue, and is the world's largest merchant acquirer and the largest card issuer in the U.S. And it has more than 30,000 staffers. The size of JPMorgan and Citi will influence blockchain, digital asset and stablecoin strategies at other banks, according to Wester. 

""The connections and partnerships are being established today, so the choice for banks is whether they view this as an opportunity to stake their position and actively shape the ecosystem or wait until the rules are written by others,"" Wester said. ""For some banks, it may make sense to take a wait-and-see approach, but the decision should be intentional and not simply inaction dressed up as caution.""

Scale becomes a challenge when banks expand the use of blockchain-powered transactions from intrabank to interbank. Two major models are emerging among banks to use distributed ledger technology to improve transaction processing for treasury management, Duane Block, managing director of digital assets at Accenture, told American Banker. Deposit tokens are a better fit for intrabank payments, or transactions between different accounts at the same bank; while stablecoins are more suited to interbank payments, Block said, due to the stablecoins' ability to act as a bridge between payment processing systems at different organizations.

""When banks move from tokenized deposits to stablecoins, distribution can be a challenge,"" Block said. ""And partnerships are one way to accelerate that."" 

The GENIUS Act would allow Special Purpose Depository Institutions, which are state-chartered uninsured banks, to expand to other states without the approval of state bank regulators, a provision that's now drawing criticism from consumer advocates and banking lobbyists. 

Stablecoin issuers often use Treasury bills as backing reserves. That could put pressure on other parts of the financial system if the industry continues at its current growth trajectory. 

Bank trade groups have asked a federal court to halt enforcement and extend compliance dates for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's open banking rule that was enacted during the Biden administration. The move comes as the lobbying fight over how the rule will be rewritten intensifies.

Citigroup's new treasury partnership with Payoneer and JPMorganChase's deposit token are pressuring banks to quickly come up with a ""vision,"" according to payment experts.

The timing of the breach at Connex aligns with data breaches by threat actor ShinyHunters, which uses phone calls to socially engineer victim organizations.

An Office of Inspector General audit says the agency's existing program for overseeing banks' technology providers lacks clear goals and metrics. It recommends the adoption of a new risk-ranking methodology by 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","RWA News: Tokenized Equity Specialist Dinari to Launch Blockchain With Avalanche (AVAX)","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/14/tokenization-firm-dinari-to-launch-l1-blockchain-aims-to-be-the-dtcc-of-tokenized-stocks","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:37:30 GMT","

Dinari, a U.S.-based provider of tokenized public securities, is set to launch its own blockchain, joining the latest wave of firms to build their own infrastructure.

The chain, called the Dinari Financial Network, aims to serve as a coordination and settlement layer for the securities issued on other networks like Arbitrum ARB$0.5173, Base, Plume (PLUME) and, soon, Solana SOL$192.12. The network is custom built using Avalanche's (AVAX) tech stack.

""This is going to be the foundational infrastructure for our settlement and clearing system, which has up to this point predominantly happened off-chain,"" Gabe Otte, CEO and co-founder of Dinari, told CoinDesk in an interview.

The test net is currently live with plans for a public launch in the next couple weeks, Otte added.

Dinari is one of the firms spearheading the tokenization of equities, a red-hot trend to make trading with stocks available on blockchain rails. Proponents say tokenization could enable round-the-clock trading, faster settlements while reduce costs.

Recently, digital trading platform Robinhood introduced stock tokens on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum ARB$0.5173 for EU users with future plans to build its own chain, while crypto exchanges including Kraken, Bybit also started offering tokens of U.S. stocks and ETFs.

In June, Dinari obtained a broker-dealer registration by FINRA with an approval to tokenize National Market System (NMS) securities, offering a compliant solution to issue token version of U.S. public stocks. Gemini, the exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, launched stock tokens in the EU with Dinari providing the tokenization infrastructure in the backend.

Dinari's decision to build its own chain follows a recent pattern seen across fintechs and crypto firms. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle and payments company Stripe revealed this week to pursue proprietary blockchains. Rival tokenization firms like Ondo Finance and Securitize (teamed up with Ethena) are also working on their own networks. 

With this approach, they aim to gain more control over compliance with regulations, uptime and integration with traditional finance systems compared to deploying on existing public blockchains.

For Dinari, having their own chain was ""out of necessity,"" Otte said.

""A lot of the public chains doesn't really allow for the proper level of compliance needed for dealing with securities,"" he explained. Another key reason was to facilitate and coordinate trades of Dinari-issued tokens across multiple blockchains without fragmenting liquidity.

""If part of [the stock tokens] lives on Solana, part on Arbitrum, part on Base, you're taking this $100 trillion market and fragmenting it,"" he said. ""How do you prevent that? With a purpose-built chain that allows us to essentially pull liquidity across all these different chains.""

By unifying settlement and liquidity, the company aims to bring continuous, compliant trading of U.S. equities to a global market, gunning for a similar role to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) for the stock market. DTCC is the world's largest securities clearing and settlement system.

For choosing Avalanche to build on, Otte emphasized the need for flexibility and the ability to control transaction fees (gas prices), which is difficult with rollup and layer-2 solutions. Avalanche's blockchain service, Ava Cloud lets businesses spin up and customize blockchains for their own needs, said Morgan Krupetsky, VP of ecosystem growth at Ava Labs.

Dinari wants to position the Dinari Financial Network to be a ""neutral clearinghouse"" for the industry, Otte said.

At the start, governance will come from a consortium of institutions including Gemini, custodian BitGo and asset manager VanEck, who will serve as validators and also offer custody services.

The plan is to fully decentralize the chain in future, Otte said. That includes potentially launching the chain's own governance token, he added.

Oops, something went wrong

By Tatiana Bautzer and Hannah Lang

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup is exploring providing stablecoin custody and other services, a top executive told Reuters, in a further sign sweeping policy changes in Washington are spurring major financial firms to expand into the cryptocurrency business.

The U.S. bank is among a handful of traditional institutions, including Fiserv and Bank of America, considering pushing into stablecoins after Congress passed a law paving the way for the crypto tokens to become widely used for payments, settlement, and other services. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency or another asset, commonly the U.S. dollar.

That law requires stablecoin issuers to hold safe assets such as U.S. Treasuries or cash to back the digital coins, creating opportunities for traditional custody banks to provide safekeeping and administration of the assets.

""Providing custody services for those high-quality assets backing stablecoins is the first option we are looking at,"" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation for Citigroup's services division, said in an interview. Citi's services business, which includes treasury, cash management, payments, and other services to large companies, remains a core unit for the bank, which has been undergoing a major restructuring.

A McKinsey study estimates about $250 billion in stablecoins have been issued so far, but are mainly used to settle cryptocurrency trades. While Citigroup said last month it was considering issuing its own stablecoin, the bank has not previously discussed its broader digital asset plans.

Citi is also exploring custody services for digital assets that back crypto-related investment products. For example, many asset managers have launched ETFs tracking the spot price of bitcoin since the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized such products last year.

The largest bitcoin ETF, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, has around $90 billion in market capitalization. ""There needs to be custody of the equivalent amount of digital currency to support these ETFs,"" Chatterjee said.

Currently, crypto exchange Coinbase dominates that business. In a statement, a Coinbase spokesperson said the company serves as the custodian for more than 80% of issuers of crypto ETFs.

Citi is also exploring using stablecoins to speed up payments, which in the traditional banking system typically take several days or longer.

Currently, Citi offers ""tokenized"" U.S. dollar payments that use a blockchain network to transfer dollars between accounts in New York, London, and Hong Kong 24 hours a day. It is developing services to allow clients to send stablecoins between accounts or to convert them to dollars to make instant payments, and is talking to clients about the use cases, Chatterjee added.

Once wary of allowing traditional financial firms to expand into the often-volatile crypto sector, banking and securities regulators under U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly administration are taking a more relaxed stance on the sector.

Still, Citi and other firms would have to comply with current regulations, including money laundering and currency controls in some countries for international transfers. Chatterjee said the custody of crypto assets needs to ensure these assets, prior to being acquired, were used for legitimate purposes, and also strengthen cyber and operational security for safekeeping and theft prevention. The issuance of a stablecoin by the bank is also under consideration, Chatterjee added.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.South Korea's decision to shelve its central bank digital currency pilot in favor of private-sector stablecoins has sparked a wave of activities among fintechs and banks.

As CoinDesk previously reported, KakaoBank is weighing both issuance and custody roles, while Upbit and Naver Pay are collaborating on a payments-focused token that could help close the “kimchi premium” gap between local and global crypto prices.

The opportunity comes as Korea is moving to extend FX trading hours, allow more foreign participation in its onshore market, and position itself for inclusion in major global bond and equity indices. A regulated KRW stablecoin could fit into these modernization plans, offering faster settlement and tighter integration between banking and digital asset markets.

But any Won stablecoin effort is going to run into a massive wall: Korea's currency is not fully internationalized.

Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Korea has kept deliverable KRW trading entirely onshore. Foreign institutions cannot exchange won among themselves abroad, and every dollar–won transaction must be settled through domestic intermediaries under the Bank of Korea's supervision.

Authorities in Seoul maintain this system to monitor speculative flows, contain volatility, and preserve monetary policy autonomy.

So for a Won stablecoin to work, it would have to be only used with whitelisted, KYC-verified addresses that have some tie to Korea.

If a privately issued stablecoin becomes too dominant, it can erode a country's control over its currency, encourage “unintended dollarisation,” and weaken the central bank's ability to manage employment and price stability, Vera Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong University's business school told CoinDesk in a note.

The question is, just how useful would this on-shore only stablecoin then be?

Domestic interbank transfers in Korea settle around the clock, 365 days a year. Sending money from one account to another is immediate, free, and widely used, leaving little payment friction for a KRW stablecoin to solve inside the country.

Without a speed or cost advantage in domestic transfers, the token's primary utility would lie in cross-border settlement — and that is precisely where the onshore-only rule becomes a brick wall.

Taiwan faces a similar dilemma. The island's central bank does not impose capital controls on the economy—the Taiwan dollar (NTD) is freely convertible—but it also can't be used offshore, making it of questionable utility as a stablecoin.

An NTD-pegged token would be bound by Taiwan's stablecoin framework issued in June, which requires local bank issuance, 100% onshore reserves, and central bank oversight with foreign exchange reporting, which are designed to stop it from becoming an unregulated channel for moving NTD value abroad.

One day, a Won, and NTD, stablecoin may emerge, but its utility will likely be confined largely to domestic use rather than the global crypto market, so it'll play a very niche role.

It'd be a different story for a Hong Kong Dollar stablecoin as the currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has no restrictions on being used abroad.

Right now, it's wait a wait-and-see mode to determine how much demand there is for non-USD stablecoins and what role they will play in the broader crypto economy.

BTC: BTC is trading at 123,901.58, supported by broader market momentum as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hover near record highs on softer inflation signals and speculation of Fed easing.

ETH: ETH is getting ready to challenge its all-time high, trading above $4700.

Gold: Gold rose 0.3% to $3,356.98 as mild U.S. inflation data boosted expectations for a Fed rate cut next month and increased the odds of further easing this year.

Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 down 0.31% after hitting a record high in the prior session.

S&P 500: U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records as steady inflation data fueled expectations for two Fed rate cuts this year.

Charles Schwab, Fidelity and other traditional companies based in the United States are hiring for senior crypto positions to seemingly make a push into the industry. The open positions come as regulatory clarity has increased, paving the way for TradFi to enter the space.

The open positions indicate a solid push into the crypto space. Schwab, for instance, is hiring for a senior product manager in crypto trading and a senior product manager in crypto onchain experiences. As Cointelegraph has reported, the $10 trillion asset manager plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) spot trading, with BTC trading services available by April 2026.

Fidelity, which has $6.4 trillion in assets, is hiring for a crypto technology risk analyst. Technology company Booz Allen Hamilton is seeking a cryptocurrency subject matter expert, and Standard and Poor's Global is hiring a senior analyst for global research and development in crypto and decentralized finance.

The hiring surge comes as the Trump administration pushes for better regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets. On July 18, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, which regulates stablecoins and their issuers. The clarity surrounding stablecoins has led traditional finance institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to explore financial products tied to digital assets.

The US Senate is expected to consider a market structure bill when it returns from recess in September. The bill is expected to deliver further regulatory clarity and support crypto integration with traditional players. 

Web3 jobs evolving

According to a report from crypto job site Web3.career, positions in crypto are evolving, mirroring the change in the industry as it matures.

Geographical salary arbitrage is still present, with crypto jobs in emerging markets generally outpacing the salaries of jobs in other industries. 

Remote-first companies are becoming increasingly rare, as companies prefer a hybrid work approach, allowing quicker dissemination of knowledge. Artificial intelligence has gone from a nice skill to have to mandatory.

Entry-level jobs are slimming down as well. Crypto companies prefer to hire for senior roles, mirroring the approach of traditional companies.

- Charles Schwab and Fidelity are hiring senior crypto roles to integrate digital assets into mainstream financial services, including crypto trading and risk analysis positions.

- Schwab plans to launch Bitcoin and Ether spot trading by April 2026, while Fidelity strengthens internal capabilities to manage digital asset risks.

- U.S. regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and pending Senate bills is driving traditional banks like JPMorgan to explore crypto-linked financial products.

- Crypto job markets show growing specialization, hybrid work models, and AI skill demands as institutions prioritize advanced expertise over entry-level hires.

- The hiring surge reflects crypto's rising legitimacy, with traditional firms building teams to offer comprehensive digital asset services and address regulatory compliance.

Charles Schwab and Fidelity are among traditional financial institutions expanding their presence in the cryptocurrency sector, as evidenced by their recent hiring activities for senior roles in digital asset management and risk analysis [1]. These roles include positions such as senior product manager for crypto trading and a crypto technology risk analyst, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating blockchain and digital assets into mainstream financial services. Schwab, which oversees approximately $10 trillion in assets, is reportedly preparing to launch Bitcoin and Ether spot trading, with BTC trading expected to be available by April 2026 [1].

Fidelity, which manages $6.4 trillion in assets, is also reinforcing its internal crypto capabilities. Its recent hiring of a crypto technology risk analyst reflects an increasing emphasis on managing and mitigating the unique risks associated with digital assets [1]. Additionally, other traditional financial and technology firms, including Booz Allen Hamilton and Standard and Poor's, are entering the space by recruiting for roles that bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with crypto innovation, such as cryptocurrency subject matter experts and senior analysts in decentralized finance [1].

The regulatory environment in the United States appears to be a key driver of this expansion. The Trump administration's passage of the GENIUS Act on July 18 has brought greater clarity to stablecoin regulation, encouraging major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to explore digital-asset-linked financial products. The U.S. Senate is also expected to consider a market structure bill upon returning from recess in September, which could further facilitate the integration of crypto with traditional financial services [1].

Meanwhile, the evolving nature of crypto-related job markets reflects broader trends within the industry. According to crypto job site Web3.career, roles in the sector are becoming more specialized and senior-focused, with institutions preferring candidates with advanced expertise over entry-level hires. The demand for remote work is also shifting toward hybrid models, and skills in artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly essential [1].

This hiring surge underscores the growing legitimacy of crypto as a financial asset class. As traditional institutions build internal teams to manage digital assets, they are also positioning themselves to offer clients more comprehensive services. The broader financial ecosystem is adapting to accommodate crypto, with risk management, regulatory compliance, and client education emerging as key areas of focus [1].

“The Japanese have an inflation problem  ... They're behind the curve, so they are going to be hiking, and they need to get their inflation problem under control,” Bessent said during an interview with Bloomberg TV.

Bessent's take contrasts with that of BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has justified moving slowly on rate increases because underlying inflation, which focuses on the strength of domestic demand and wages, remains short of the central bank's 2% target even though the headline rate is above 3%. In July, the bank held its benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5% while providing no clues on future moves.

The Trump administration has for months been calling for tighter monetary policy in Japan to halt the yen's depreciation and narrow the rate differential between the two currencies. In a report published in June, the Treasury called for the BOJ to focus on growth, inflation and the normalization of the yen's weakness against the dollar as part of a structural rebalancing of bilateral trade, according to the Financial Times.

Bessent's comments strengthened the yen higher across the board. BitFlyer listed BTC/JPY pair fell 1.7% to 17,845,432 yen, posting bigger losses than Coinbase's BTC/USD pair, which dropped to $121,650. The dollar-yen pair (USD/JPY) slipped for the third straight day, hitting a three-week low of 146.21, according to data source TradingView.

Traders have historically used the yen as a carry currency to fund purchases of assets in high-yielding economies. That is, they've exploited Japan's low interest rate to borrow yen and buy assets that give a higher return, profiting from the difference. As such, rallies in the yen often trigger fears of risk aversion in financial markets. 

That may not be the case anymore, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.

Risk-off is frequently the result of unwinding of funding trades, e.g. short yen, long Brazilian real (BRL). However, the yen may not be the most attractive funding currency at present. 

""Not only is Swiss policy rate at zero, but JPY volatility is higher,"" Chandler told CoinDesk in an email.

 BtcTurk halted deposits and withdrawals, citing a “technical issue” with hot wallets, while trading and local currency withdrawals and deposits remained active. 

Turkish cryptocurrency exchange BtcTurk has halted withdrawals amid reports suggesting that the platform has suffered a major loss of funds due to a hack.

Cybersecurity firm Cyvers took to X on Thursday to report that it had detected $48 million worth of digital assets, including Ether (ETH), involved in unusual activity.

“Our system detected multiple alerts across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MANTLE and MATIC networks,” Cyvers reported, adding that the attacker had moved the assets to two addresses and begun swapping them.

BtcTurk subsequently halted deposits and withdrawals, citing a “technical issue” with hot wallets, reporting that trading and local currency withdrawals and deposits remained intact.

“During inspections conducted on Aug. 14, 2025, unusual activity was detected in our hot wallets. As a precautionary measure, cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals have been temporarily suspended,” BtcTurk said in a statement shared at 1:17 pm UTC.

BtcTurk highlighted that most exchange assets are held in secure cold wallets, assuring the public that user assets are unaffected by the suspected attack.

“While our detailed investigation continues, authorities have been informed and all necessary security measures have been taken,” the exchange said.

Estimates of assets lost in the alleged hack varied across cybersecurity platforms at the time of writing, with platforms like Lookonchain reporting at least $23 million in stolen assets, while CertiK estimated the losses to be worth at least $50 million.

According to Lookonchain, the hacker has started swapping the stolen assets to Ether.

CertiK said that the hacked assets have been withdrawn across three wallets, including two Ethereum addresses, 0x7D91D1[...], 0xA041Fe[...], and the Solana (SOL) address 9sjdD9Xg[...].

The swaps from the Ethereum addresses are ongoing by publishing time, with some of the latest transactions involving MetaMask Swaps, according to data from Etherscan.

Thursday's suspected hack comes just over a year after a June 2024 breach in which BtcTurk reported unauthorized withdrawals from some hot wallets, which led to losses of around $55 million. At the time, Binance CEO Richard Teng said the exchange had frozen more than $5.3 million in stolen funds while assisting the investigation.

In July 2024, BtcTurk's long-serving CEO Özgür Güneri stepped down after seven years at the helm as the company laid the groundwork for global expansion into markets in Latin America, Africa and the Asia‑Pacific region. BtcTurk founder Kerem Tibuk took over as acting CEO, while Güneri remained on the board.

 Bitcoin dropped sharply after a higher-than-expected US PPI print shocked traders. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin drops below $118,000 after a hot US PPI print fueled inflation concerns.

Federal Reserve interest rate cut odds dropped to 90.5% from 99.8%.

Double top signals and short-term pullbacks in BTC price give altcoins room to rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back sharply from its fresh all-time high of $123,400, dropping to $117,400 on Thursday. The correction took place as a hotter-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) data surprised the market. 

The latest PPI print showed annual headline inflation at 3.3%, well above the 2.5% forecast and the 2.3% reading from the previous month. This is the largest monthly rise in US PPI since June 2022. The stronger price pressures stand in stark contrast to cooler July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Tuesday, which outlined headline inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year and core CPI at 3.1%, reinforcing a bullish case for risk assets at the time.

While CPI data fueled optimism for a near-term interest rate cut, the hotter PPI release complicates that narrative. Higher-than-expected producer prices signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to delay monetary easing. For Bitcoin, this could limit upside momentum in the short term.

Data from CME FedWatch still points to a 90.5% probability of a 0.25% rate cut on Sept. 17, although it's notable that the likelihood had spiked to 99.8% on Wednesday.

While BTC corrections were accelerated due to the hot US PPI print, bearish signals were observed earlier. Cointelegraph noted a bearish divergence between price and relative strength index or RSI, after BTC tagged new highs above $123,000, possibly leading to liquidity grab from its previous highs. The immediate price dip also formed a swing pattern failure, outlining possible choppy price action for the next few days. 

From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin's recent leveraged unwind has absorbed key internal liquidity zones between $119,000 and $117,500. Currently, the most likely scenario could be a period of sideways consolidation following an 11% rise over the past 12 days. 

A bullish case would require a decisive close above $120,000 on the four-hour chart. However, the probability of a retest below $117,000 has increased due to a long-term market fractal pattern. 

On the three-day chart, BTC has formed a double top pattern, a structure previously observed during January. The pattern led to a period of corrections during Q1 2025, during which BTC dropped as low as $75,000.

If Bitcoin maintains support above $112,000, altcoins could thrive in a consolidation-driven setup. A drop below $112,000, however, would signal a shift in the lower time frame market structure, potentially triggering corrections toward lower areas of interest between $105,000 and $110,000.

NASA Budget Cuts Could End U.S. Exploration of the Outer Solar System

The U.S. planetary science community is sounding the alarm about plans to discard a nuclear technology that has powered dozens of NASA missions over the past 50 years

By Hannah Richter edited by Lee Billings

A pellet of plutonium 238, illuminated by the glow of its own radioactivity. NASA and other space agencies use this material in radioisotope power sources for interplanetary missions to the solar system's darkest, most distant destinations.

Photo Researchers/Science Source

In the spring of 2022 the U.S. space community selected its top priority for the nation's next decade of science and exploration: a mission to Uranus, the gassy, bluish planet only seen up close during a brief spacecraft flyby in 1986. More than 2.6 billion kilometers from Earth at its nearest approach, Uranus still beckons with what it could reveal about the solar system's early history—and the overwhelming numbers of Uranus-sized worlds that astronomers have spied around other stars. Now President Donald Trump's proposed cuts to NASA could push those discoveries further away than ever—not by directly canceling the mission but by abandoning the fuel needed to pull it off.

The technology in question, known as radioisotope power systems (RPS), is an often overlooked element of NASA's budget that involves turning nuclear fuel into usable electricity. More like a battery than a full-scale reactor, RPS devices attach directly to spacecraft to power them into the deepest, darkest reaches of the solar system, where sunlight is too sparse to use. It's a critical technology that has enabled two dozen NASA missions, from the iconic Voyagers 1 and 2 now traversing interstellar space to the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers presently operating on Mars.

But RPS is expensive, costing NASA about $175 million in 2024 alone. That's largely because of the costs of sourcing and refining plutonium 238, the chemically toxic, vanishingly scarce and difficult to work with radioactive material at the heart of all U.S. RPS. The Fiscal Year 2026 President's Budget Request (PBR) released this spring suggests shutting down the program by 2029. That's just long enough to use RPS tech on NASA's upcoming Dragonfly mission, a nuclear-powered dual-quadcopter drone to explore Saturn's frigid moon Titan. After that, without RPS, no further U.S. missions to the outer solar system would be possible for the foreseeable future.

“It was an oversight,” says Amanda Hendrix, director of the Planetary Science Institute, who has led science efforts on RPS-enabled NASA missions such as Cassini at Saturn and Galileo at Jupiter. “It's really like the left hand wasn't talking to the right hand when the PBR was put together.”

Throughout its 400-odd pages, the PBR repeatedly acknowledges the importance of planning for the nation's next generation of planetary science missions and even proposes funding NASA's planetary science division better than any other part of the space agency's science operations, which it seeks to cut by half. But “to achieve cost savings,” it states, 2028 should be the last year of funding for RPS, and “given budget constraints and the reduced pipeline of new planetary science missions,” the proposed budget provides no funding after 2026 for work by the Department of Energy (DOE) that supports RPS.

Indeed, NASA's missions to the outer solar system are infrequent because of their long durations and the laborious engineering required for a spacecraft to withstand cold, inhospitable conditions so far from home. But what these missions lack in frequency, they make up for in discovery: some of the most tantalizing and potentially habitable environments beyond Earth are thought to exist there, in vast oceans of icy moons once thought to be wastelands. One such environment lurks on Saturn's Enceladus, which was ranked as the nation's second-highest priority after Uranus in the U.S.'s 2022 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey.

“The outer solar system is kind of the last frontier,” says Alex Hayes, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, who chaired the Decadal Survey panel that selected Enceladus. “You think you know how something works until you send a spacecraft there to explore it, and then you realize that you had no idea how it worked.”

Unlike solar power systems—relatively “off-the-shelf” tech that can be used on a per-mission basis—RPS requires a continuous production pipeline that's vulnerable to disruption. NASA's program operates through the DOE, with the space agency purchasing DOE services to source, purify and encapsulate the plutonium 238 fuel, as well as to assemble and test the resulting RPS devices. The most common kind of RPS, a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, converts the thermal energy released from plutonium 238's natural decay to as much as 110 watts of electrical power. Any excess heat helps keep the spacecraft and its instruments warm enough to function.

Establishing the RPS pipeline took around three decades, and the program's roots lie in the bygone cold war era of heavy U.S. investment in nuclear technology and infrastructure. Preparing the radioactive fuel alone takes the work of multiple DOE facilities scattered across the country: Oak Ridge National Laboratory produces the plutonium oxide, then Los Alamos National Laboratory forms it into usable pellets, which are finally stockpiled at Idaho National Laboratory. Funding cuts would throw this pipeline into disarray and cause an exodus of experienced workers, Hendrix says. Restoring that expertise and capability, she adds, would require billions of dollars and a few decades more.

“These decisions are made by people that don't fully understand the implications,” says Ryan P. Russell, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “Technologically, [RPS] is on the critical path to superiority in space, whether that's military, civilian or industrial applications.”

Russell emphasizes that RPS isn't just critical for exploring Uranus, Enceladus and other destinations in the outer solar system—it's also a likely fundamental pillar of the administration's space priorities, such as developing a sustained human presence on the moon and sending astronauts to Mars. While both destinations are relatively close to the sun, the Red Planet's global dust storms can bury solar panels, and the moon's two-week-long lunar nights are cold enough to test the mettle of even the best batteries. The latter situation informed the reasoning that drove NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy's directive last week to fast-track a lunar nuclear reactor.

Abandoning smaller-scale nuclear options such as RPS while aiming for a full-scale reactor is “like trying to build a house without a two-by-four,” Russell says. “If you don't have the basic building blocks, you're not gonna get very far.”

Another initiative reliant on RPS, NASA confirmed in a statement e-mailed to Scientific American, is the beleaguered Mars Sample Return (MSR) program that the U.S. agency has been jointly pursuing with the European Space Agency. While the White House has proposed nixing MSR, scientists and politicians view bringing Martian samples back to Earth as a key milestone in the modern-day space race against China.

Meanwhile other nations are pursuing or preserving their own RPS capabilities, with Europe's sights set on americium 241, a radioisotope with a five-times-longer half-life but a five-times-weaker energy output than plutonium 238. Russia has used RPS for decades, and China and India are also developing homegrown versions of the technology.

Notably, despite the administration's push for commercial partners to take up costly space functions such as rocket launches, RPS is unlikely to find much support in the private sector. “Dealing with [this sort of] nuclear material—that's not something a company is going to do,” Russell says.

Going forward, the planetary science community hopes to convince Congress that RPS is “critical and foundational,” Hendrix says. The Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG), which was chartered by and provides independent input to NASA, expressed its concerns to the space agency in findings from a June meeting, writing that the decision would have “dire implications” for future solar system exploration. White papers prepared by representatives of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center and Glenn Research Center conveyed similar sentiments, noting that nine of the 15 existing and future missions recommended in the latest Decadal Survey use RPS.

In short, “you're just hamstringing your ability to do certain mission configurations and also to get out to and past Saturn if you shut down RPS,” Hayes says. “You can't argue that scientific prioritization was part of [the White House's] decision process.”

Although both the House and Senate have released drafts of the 2026 appropriations bill that preserve top-line funding for NASA, neither explicitly mentions RPS. That means the program would fall under NASA's “discretionary spending,” a category that scientists and legal experts alike say would be more easily manipulated by a presidential administration looking to enforce its political agenda. In other words, without a clear, direct callout for RPS from congressional appropriators, the Trump administration's plan to shut down the program could more easily come to pass. Hendrix consequently hopes that Congress will add language explicitly funding RPS in its final budget.

“There is a strong interest from Congress in the need for a powerful, deep-space energy source,” says a congressional staffer who is familiar with the NASA budget and was granted anonymity to discuss these issues freely. But “I don't know that members have quite honed in on [RPS] yet because the worry is so much about [Trump's] intent to cancel a lot of future planetary missions.”

Fundamentally, political support for outer solar system missions is a moot point without corresponding support for the ability to get there, explains University of Oregon planetary physicist and OPAG co-chair Carol Paty. The decision to shut down RPS “seems like a simple line item,” she says. But the implications are “deeply troubling and concerning. If there are not big missions to drive the community, to drive exploration, to drive training the next generation, where does that leave us?”

The “science fiction science” method could change how we implement new technology.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Social media. AI. Genetic engineering. Self-driving cars. Autonomous robots. What if hindsight was ahead of us, and we could at least have an idea of the social, behavioral and ethical implications of emerging technologies before they even existed? 

If it sounds like science fiction, it sort of is. “Science fiction science” or “sci-fi-sci” is an idea put together by researchers Iyad Rahwan (from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany), Azim Shariff (from the University of British Columbia in Canada), and Jean-Francois Bonnefon (from the Toulouse School of Economics in France). They  describe it as a new process that attempts to apply the scientific method to technologies that are either being planned or are in the early phases of development. Such predictions have been made in science fiction before, but outside of the genre, they have never been fully explored from a scientific perspective.

“Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched,” the researchers said in a study posted to the preprint server arXiv. “[We use] experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future.”

Rahwan, Shariff, and Bonnefon suggest that using the scientific method to predict the effects of technologies that will likely surface in the near future (though, what exactly “near future” means can be hazy) will make their potential effects more clear to developers, consumers, and policymakers. This unconventional approach has been met with skepticism, as experimental scientists understandably tend to question its validity. But the trio has pushed on. Using social media as an example, they suggest that in retrospect, running simulations of how the technology might have operated and having participants virtually interact with it could have helped predict the aftermath of its widespread use, from self-esteem issues to ethics being seriously questioned.

Predicting the effects of social media before everyone was constantly checking socials on their smartphones might have led to a more cautious outlook. For instance, effects of the technology gone to extremes become a dystopian reality on the Black Mirror episode “Nosedive,” where social media not only broadcasts people's lives, but social scores that help gauge their popularity and use that data to rank them among their peers. And the scoring technology suggested in this episode is on the edge of being released into society. 

Gage is an app that keeps track of how employees are rated by coworkers. Created by founder and CEO Justin Henshaw, it logs a “social credit score,” includes the number of compliments and virtual high-fives given, and is meant to be transferred from one job to another. YouTube creator Joshua Fluke criticized Gage as “an algorithmic reputation system” that could be extremely problematic. When employee evaluation relies more heavily on social scores than the quality of actual work done, entire groups could suffer. Those who are neurodivergent and may not communicate in the expected neurotypical way could face difficulty being hired as a result of codified negative social feedback.

The researchers describe social credit systems on an even larger scale than Black Mirror, and list them among other types of what they refer to as “nascent or speculative technologies” that could potentially spark policy debates. Hypothetical systems that use AI to monitor every behavior in real time before publicly releasing social credit scores have sparked so much controversy that the European Union is leaning toward preemptively banning them.

On the same list are autonomous vehicles, the process of  screening embryos for desired traits, and ectogenesis (reminiscent of the artificial gestation in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World). 

“Studying the behavior of future humans interacting with future technology in a future social world raises unusual challenges for behavioral scientists, which call for unconventional methods,” the researchers said. 

Will virtual reality experiments that introduce people to technologies that do not yet exist be able to accurately predict their impact on society? For now, that remains in the realm of science fiction.

As it turns out, deep in the Amazon, there were more than 41,000 endangered turtles just waiting for scientists to find them.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

 Researchers from the University of Florida have crafted a new process for counting animals. A new research method pairing drones with smart modeling has counted more than 41,000 endangered Giant South American River turtles nesting along the Amazon's Guaporé River, according to the researchers behind a recent study. It's the world's largest known aggregation of freshwater turtles.

This process—revealed in the study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology—involves taking thousands of images to track and study animal behavior in order to remove the errors produced by other methods, such as  on-the-ground counting. 

Lead study author Ismael Brack—a post-doctoral researcher within the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' School of Forestry, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences—called the method “novel,” and clarified in a statement that the method can count many more creatures than just turtles. 

The team partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Society in Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia to test the method by essentially conduct a census of the endangered turtles. These elusive reptiles are exceptionally social animals, and the females congregate annually to nest in the sandbanks of the Guaporé River between Brazil and Bolivia during the summer months. 

In the past, scientist used drones and relied on what's known as the orthomosaic strategy (stitching together hundreds of overlapping aerial photographs) to count turtles, as it's a quicker and less-invasive approach than counting from the ground. While common, the study explains that the style is subject to detection errors that often get overlooked, and struggles to account for movement during observations. 

In the new research, the team used white paint to mark the shells of 1,187 turtles. A drone flew overhead via a planned path four times a day for 12 days to snap 1,500 photos on each pass. The scientists then stitched the photos together, recording the path of each marked turtle, showing where it nested and where it walked. That information allowed the researchers to create probability models to account for turtle movement, all based on seen behaviors.

According to the study, traditional orthomosaic-based counts were shown to be wildly inaccurate, as were the counts taken only from the ground. The new behavior modeling revealed that only 45 percent of turtles using the sandbank were present during drone flights, and roughly 20 percent of those seen walking were counted multiple times (some were counted as many as seven times). 

The discrepancies led to observers on the ground estimating that the site contained 16,000 turtles, and observers using the the drone orthomosaic strategy (without modeling) counted 79,000 turtles. When applying the new modeling based on movement, the team estimated the presence of around 41,000 turtles. 

“These number vary greatly, and that's a problem for conservationists,” Brack said. “If scientists are unable to establish an accurate count of individuals of a species, how will they know if the population is in decline or whether efforts to protect it are successful?”

For the plan to work, scientists must understand the movement patterns of animals, which could require clipping seals' fur, using high-visibility collars on elk, or marking mountain goats with paintball pellets, to name a few examples. The study stated that counting animals when populations are spatially aggregated—such as during breeding or nesting—enhances the accuracy and efficiency of surveying efforts. 

The team plans to refine the process, focusing on turtles in other South American countries. “By combining information from multiple surveys,” Brack said, “we can detect population trends, and the Wildlife Conservation Society will know where to invest in conservation actions.”

A public-private partnership between Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory has led to a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach that is faster at finding what's known as ""magnetic shadows"" in a fusion vessel: safe havens protected from the intense heat of the plasma.

Known as HEAT-ML, the new AI could lay the foundation for software that significantly speeds up the design of future fusion systems. Such software could also enable good decision-making during fusion operations by adjusting the plasma so that potential problems are thwarted before they start.

""This research shows that you can take an existing code and create an AI surrogate that will speed up your ability to get useful answers, and it opens up interesting avenues in terms of control and scenario planning,"" said Michael Churchill, co-author of a paper in Fusion Engineering and Design about HEAT-ML and head of digital engineering at PPPL.

Fusion, the reaction that fuels the sun and stars, could provide potentially limitless amounts of electricity on Earth. To harness it, researchers need to overcome key scientific and engineering challenges. One such challenge is handling the intense heat coming from the plasma, which reaches temperatures hotter than the sun's core when confined using magnetic fields in a fusion vessel known as a tokamak. Speeding up the calculations that predict where this heat will hit and what parts of the tokamak will be safe in the shadows of other parts is key to bringing fusion power to the grid.

""The plasma-facing components of the tokamak might come in contact with the plasma, which is very hot and can melt or damage these elements,"" said Doménica Corona Rivera, an associate research physicist at PPPL and first author on the paper on HEAT-ML. ""The worst thing that can happen is that you would have to stop operations.""

PPPL amplifies its impact through public-private partnership

HEAT-ML was specifically made to simulate a small part of SPARC: a tokamak currently under construction by CFS. The Massachusetts company hopes to demonstrate net energy gain by 2027, meaning SPARC would generate more energy than it consumes.

Simulating how heat impacts SPARC's interior is central to this goal and a big computing challenge. To break down the challenge into something manageable, the team focused on a section of SPARC where the most intense plasma heat exhaust intersects with the material wall. This particular part of the tokamak, representing 15 tiles near the bottom of the machine, is the part of the machine's exhaust system that will be subjected to the most heat.

To create such a simulation, researchers generate what they call shadow masks. Shadow masks are 3D maps of magnetic shadows, which are specific areas on the surfaces of a fusion system's internal components that are shielded from direct heat. The location of these shadows depends on the shape of the parts inside the tokamak and how they interact with the magnetic field lines that confine the plasma.

Creating simulations to optimize the way fusion systems operate

Originally, an open-source computer program called HEAT, or the Heat flux Engineering Analysis Toolkit, calculated these shadow masks. HEAT was created by CFS Manager Tom Looby during his doctoral work with Matt Reinke, now leader of the SPARC Diagnostic Team, and was first applied on the exhaust system for PPPL's National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade machine.

HEAT-ML traces magnetic field lines from the surface of a component to see if the line intersects other internal parts of the tokamak. If it does, that region is marked as ""shadowed."" However, tracing these lines and finding where they intersect the detailed 3D machine geometry was a significant bottleneck in the process. It could take around 30 minutes for a single simulation and even longer for some complex geometries.

HEAT-ML overcomes this bottleneck, accelerating the calculations to a few milliseconds. It uses a deep neural network: a type of AI that has hidden layers of mathematical operations and parameters that it applies to the data to learn how to do a specific task by looking for patterns. HEAT-ML's deep neural network was trained using a database of approximately 1,000 SPARC simulations from HEAT to learn how to calculate shadow masks.

HEAT-ML is currently tied to the specific design of SPARC's exhaust system; it only works for that small part of that particular tokamak and is an optional setting in the HEAT code. However, the research team hopes to expand its capabilities to generalize the calculation of shadow masks for exhaust systems of any shape and size, as well as the rest of the plasma-facing components inside a tokamak.

DOE supported this work under contracts DE-AC02-09CH11466 and DE-AC05-00OR22725, and it also received support from CFS.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The surprising brain chemistry behind instant friendships","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250813083608.htm","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 03:02:57 GMT","

A new UC Berkeley study shows that the so-called love hormone, oxytocin, is also critical for the formation of friendships.

Oxytocin is released in the brain during sex, childbirth, breastfeeding and social interactions and contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust. Never mind that it's also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the ""cuddle"" or ""happy"" hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising.

But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They've shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or ""social monogamy,"" or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds.

Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships. Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person's ability to form or maintain social bonds.

""Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it's similar to and different from other types of relationships,"" said Annaliese Beery, a UC Berkeley associate professor of integrative biology and neuroscience and senior author of the study.

Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. Prairie voles that are close friends typically huddle side by side, groom and even sit on one another.

""Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: 'I prefer you to this stranger,' for example,"" Beery said. ""The animals that didn't have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away.""

The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments -- they didn't work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers.

""In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in who they are social with, their selectivity,"" she said.

Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.

""That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain,"" said Beery.

The study was published Aug. 8 in the journal Current Biology.

What social voles tell us about social humans

Beery has long been interested in social relationships in rodents, focusing primarily on the animals' seldom-studied peer or friendship relationships. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what's species-specific versus generalizable across species.

To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding's ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species -- there are about 50 worldwide -- to compare their social behavior.

She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships.

""While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we've tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. So there seems to be this widespread tendency to bond,"" Beery said. ""But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Someday, I hope to be able to tell you, 'Do selective peer relationships precede the development of monogamy? Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?' I think this familiarity preference is deeply rooted.""

Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study.

But while oxytocin isn't essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or ""null mutant"") prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate.

Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles' friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments. In one, they tested how long it took for voles to establish a preference for a partner. Whereas normal voles take about 24 hours of close proximity to form a relationship that makes them choose that partner over a stranger, oxytocin receptor-deficient voles showed no preference in that amount of time, and took up to a week to establish a peer preference.

""Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other,"" Beery said. ""Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn't required to have a relationship, but it's really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently.""

They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. In such a situation, normal voles would hang out with known friends until they eventually started to socialize with strangers.

""They can all separate, they can all come together, or they can hang out in any combinations that they want,"" she said. ""The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It's like if I went to a party with a friend, I would stand near that friend for the first part of the party and then I might start to mingle. The voles that lack oxytocin receptors just mixed. It was as if they didn't even have a partner in there with them.""

In the third experiment, they tested the strength of both peer and mate bonding by having the voles press levers to get access to either a friend/mate or a stranger.

""Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships,"" Beery said. ""That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways.""

Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships.

On the flip side, voles lacking oxytocin receptors were also less aggressive toward strangers and less avoidant of them.

""You can see contributions of oxytocin signaling to both sides of selectivity,"" Beery said. ""On the prosocial side, it's involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it's aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. We've seen effects of oxytocin on both affiliation and aggression in our other studies in prairie voles, and it parallels human findings on a role of oxytocin in in-group/out-group dynamics.""

Oxytocin nanosensors

The researchers used a new oxytocin sensor developed in Landry's UC Berkeley lab to determine whether lack of an oxytocin receptor caused increases or decreases in oxytocin release. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors.

Landry, an associate professor in the departments of chemical and biomolecular engineering, neuroscience, and molecular and cell biology and a co-corresponding author of the paper, created these sensors from carbon nanotubes joined with specific single-stranded DNA sequences selected because they latch onto the oxytocin molecule and fluoresce. Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles' brains. In fact, oxytocin was being released in lower amounts from fewer sites in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for social reward across species.

Co-authors with Black, Komatsu, Beery, Landry and Manoli are Jiaxuan Zhao, Scarlet Taskey and Nicole Serrano of UC Berkeley, and Ruchira Sharma of UCSF. Beery's work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CAREER award 2239635) and the National Institutes of Health (R01MH132908). Komatsu is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois.

Nature Aging

The immune system permeates and regulates organs and tissues across the body, and has diverse roles beyond pathogen control, including in development, tissue homeostasis and repair. The reshaping of the immune system that occurs during aging is therefore highly consequential. In this Focus issue, Nature Aging presents a collection of reviews of and opinions on recent advances in research into immune aging.

During aging, the ability of the immune system to efficiently and precisely respond to new antigenic, infectious or neoplastic challenges wanes, and the reactivation and refinement of memory responses falters. One of the earliest manifestations of aging is the involution of the thymus (the site of T cell development), which occurs during puberty. In later life, the immune system increasingly shifts from its homeostatic and protective roles towards a state that is characterized by heightened proinflammatory activity, with a propensity for autoreactivity. Rather than safeguarding the host, the aged immune system may contribute to systemic dysfunction and pathology.

In this Focus, Nature Aging introduces a series of reviews and opinions that cover recent advances in immune aging. Building on their studies defining immune aging as a driver of organismal aging1,2, Delgado-Pulido and colleagues explore how aging transforms the immune system ‘from healer to saboteur', and describe the deterioration of protective functions and the acquisition of pathogenic features of the aged adaptive immune system.

Majewska and Krizhanovsky zoom in on one of these protective immune functions that declines with age: namely, the clearance of senescent cells. Through surveying the interactions between senescent and immune cells (which may deteriorate during aging), the authors highlight the role of the aged immune system in facilitating the accumulation and propagation of senescent cells across tissues with age, and thereby fueling tissue dysfunction and disease pathogenesis.

The effects of immune aging on age-related diseases are far-reaching. The fatal consequences of immune aging were demonstrated by impaired infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic3. Immune aging has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-infectious age-related diseases, including cardiovascular, fibrotic and metabolic diseases, cancer and dementia. Indeed, both peripheral immunity and central neuroinflammation are recognized as contributors to, markers of and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative conditions4, and inflammaging is a recognized hallmark of aging linked to morbidity and mortality5. Park and colleagues call attention to resident tissue macrophages as particular culprits of inflammaging and propose that restoring resident tissue macrophages by targeting the niche or myelopoiesis in the bone marrow could attenuate their contribution to tumorigenesis and promote healthy aging.

Inflammaging is so closely intertwined with organismal aging that highly accurate aging clocks, predictive of morbidity and mortality, can be built using markers of inflammation6. Tracking individual immune aging trajectories could inform on disease risks as well as contribute to the suits of biological age-predictive biomarkers. However, both aging and the immune system hold considerable complexity and diversity. Franceschi and colleagues survey immune aging clocks through the lens of personalized inflammaging. They highlight that each individual's unique combination of genetics, lifetime exposures and lifestyle factors results in heterogeneous manifestations of inflammaging, pose that precision measures and interventions should be prioritized, and spotlight a potential role for artificial intelligence in navigating this complexity.

Research on the biological processes of aging is often conducted using model organisms or in vitro models, yet thanks to the ease of access to human blood samples, the immune system offers a window into aging in humans. Immune aging can also be leveraged in clinical trials of aging, by testing the strength of vaccine responses or infection control. Trials that test emerging technologies or gerotherapeutic interventions could not only identify strategies to improve immune responses but also stand to inform our understanding of the plasticity of aging in humans and offer important milestones in refining the design of trials conducted with older adults. Discussing strategies to boost immune responses to vaccination in aging, Hofer and colleagues highlight the potential of enhancing vaccines by using gerotherapies to attenuate immune aging.

As well as providing an overview of the hallmarks of immune aging, Kim and Dixit further explore gerotherapeutic interventions, through an immunometabolic lens. They explore how gerotherapeutic interventions such as calorie restriction, ketogenic diet adoption or exercise may sustain healthspan in part through attenuation of immune aging via unified immunometabolic mechanisms. They also highlight adipose as an immunological organ with considerable physiological influence on aging.

Across these articles, the immune system stands out as an early target during aging: the loss of its protective capacities facilitates tissue degeneration and pathology. Weyand and Goronzy, however, highlight the acquisition of autoreactive functions during immune aging, and reflect on recent data that unexpectedly report an increase in autoimmune conditions with age7. They propose that autoimmunity during aging constitutes inappropriate immune youthfulness and suggest that waning immune activity during aging could be beneficial in calibrating autoreactivity.

As a tractable and targetable window into aging in humans, the aged immune system holds opportunities for translationally valuable discoveries and constitutes a potential broad target to extend healthspan. We are very grateful to the authors and reviewers who have contributed to this issue. Our goal for this Focus has been to stimulate interest and promote cross-pollination of ideas across disciplines. We look forward to supporting immune aging research and sharing exciting findings from this field in the years to come.

Human development and physiology are fundamentally linked with the microbiome. This is particularly true during early life, a critical period for microbiome assembly and its impact on the host. Understanding microbial acquisition in early life is thus central to both our basic understanding of the human microbiome and strategies for disease prevention and treatment. Here, we review the historical approaches to categorize microbial transmission originating from the fields of infectious disease epidemiology and evolutionary biology and discuss how this lexicon has influenced our approach to studying the early-life microbiome, often leading to confusion and misinterpretation. We then present a conceptual framework to capture the multifaceted nature of human microbiome acquisition based on four key components: what, where, who, and when. We present ways these parameters may be assigned, with a particular focus on the ‘transmitted strain' through metagenomics to capture these elements. We end with a discussion of approaches for implementing this framework toward defining each component of microbiome acquisition.

The human microbiome, the assembly of microorganisms living in and on the human body, and the genes and products of these microbes, has emerged as a pivotal determinant of host physiology and disease, influencing multiple tissues and organ systems. Early life, defined here as spanning from pregnancy to infancy, is a critical period of host-microbe interactions. The interactions range from the impact of maternally derived microbial metabolites on fetal development in utero to serving as a blueprint of current and future health1. Disturbances to the source, order of arrival, and succession of microbes during early life have been linked to infections and different physiological disorders, including cancer2.

The terminologies describing microbiome acquisition, mainly that of vertical and horizontal transmission, have roots in infectious disease epidemiology and evolutionary biology. The origin of using “transmission” to describe the transfer of microorganisms from one host to another originates from Koch's works3,4 and studies of invertebrates causing “vector-born” infectious diseases of animals and plants5,6,7,8,9. Applied to mother-to-child transmission, the term “vertical” can be traced to the early 1950s and the transmission of microbial pathogens10,11,12,13,14,15. In the coming decades, microbial transmission between parent and offspring remained in the realm of infectious diseases, being referred to as “inheritance of infection” or “hereditary transmission” (Box 1). Although the used definitions consider single infectious agents and may give information on cross-generation microbial transfer, the microbiome field has adapted the terminology for mother-to-child microbial transmission without major modifications.

Compared to the infectious disease lens, in which the term vertical transmission focuses on generational inheritance (namely from a parent), we see an added focus from the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. In addition to generational inheritance, these scientific fields have emphasized the mechanism and, relatedly, timing of transmission. Here, the added distinction between vertical and horizontal transmission is based on when and, by extension, where transmission occurs (Box 1). A prime example of vertical transmission is the transovarial transmission of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia in the fruit fly Drosophila16. In comparison, horizontal transmission of microbes, in essence, is everything else, with a focus on routes such as sexual, vector-borne, and attendant-borne transmission17. Well-studied examples focus on environmental sources of microbes in open ecosystems, such as the colonization of the light organ by the marine free-living symbiont Vibrio fischeri by the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes, and the acquisition of the rhizosphere microbiome from soil.

Yet, within studies of the microbiome acquisition along animal and plant life cycles, there are gray areas between vertical and horizontal transmission. For example, during trophallaxis in termites, offspring may acquire the maternal fecal microbiome after hatching. In stinkbugs of the family Plataspidae, endocellular γ-Proteobacteria are transmitted to the offspring via symbiont capsules that females produce upon oviposition18. Such scenarios have invoked the terms “social transmission, pseudo-vertical transmission, external maternal transmission, and postnatal vertical transmission” to describe such microbial acquisition routes17.

In this Perspective, we discuss how the above-described historical lexicon is often ambiguous when used in the context of human microbiome acquisition and limited in capturing the multidimensional features of microbial transmission. Given the imprecision and limitations of this status quo lexicon, we propose a conceptual framework termed 4 W to describe microbiome transmission in early life, centered on assigning four critical features: what, where, who, and when (Box 1). We then follow with a discussion of how we can capture these features in a human microbiome cohort design.

Central to an accurate description of early-life microbiome acquisition is the ability to define from ‘who', ‘where', and ‘when' transmission occurs by methods enabling tracking of the ‘what'. We define the “transmitted microbial strain” based on metagenomic resolution as currently the most precise unit to determine the transmission of microbes over space and time, and discuss how it can be used to assign the parameters of microbiome acquisition. We then introduce a fifth question, ‘why', discussing how a 4 W framework can address both mechanisms of early-life acquisition, and while not the focus of this Perspective, aspects of microbial assembly, such as succession and colonization. We end by providing recommendations for the design of studies aiming to capture the 4Ws of microbiome acquisition. The proposed framework will empower an expanded understanding of the transmission and factors shaping the human microbiome and the mechanisms governing the impact of the early-life microbiome on health and disease.

Infectious disease epidemiology

“Vertical transmission” - The direct transfer of infection from a parent organism to progeny.

“Horizontal transmission” - Any transfer of infection between host individuals, except that which occurs directly from parent to progeny.

Ecology and evolutionary biology70

“Vertical transmission” - Inheritance of the symbiont from the parental generation. The emphasis has been on transmission through the female germ line, without contact with the external environment.

“Horizontal transmission” - From an environmental, often “free-living” symbiont source, anew by each host generation.

Proposed 4 W framework for microbial transmission in early life

“What” - Microbes with replicative potential, microbial structural elements, and products, such as metabolites.

“Where” - Both the host location/site of the origin of the microbe (e.g., maternal skin), the site of infant colonization (e.g., the infant gut), and the route (e.g., ingestion via the alimentary tract).

“Who” - Who did the microbe come from? Parents, household members, pets/other animals, and the abiotic environment.

“When” - The timing of the event of transmission, such as during pregnancy, at birth, or at what age.

The term “vertical” has been widely used for human microbiome acquisition. In similar contexts, “vertical transmission” is broadly and ambiguously defined as 1) transmission from the mother or both parents, 2) from and to different body sites (in contact or not with the open environment), and 3) transmission during or also after birth. Although a commonly used term originating from infectious disease epidemiology, the description of “vertical transmission” in scientific reports often lacks important information, including simultaneous reporting of timing, source of transmission, and the microbial commodity being transmitted.

With a few exceptions, the term “horizontal transmission” is rarely used in the early-life microbiome field. Instead, other terms such as “microbial taxa dispersal from different sources” and “horizontal dispersal of microbes” have been applied. The few studies that used the term “horizontal transmission” generally indicated that it is not mother-to-infant microbial transmission; however, it is unclear whether the transmission of the microbiome is from other family members, the community, or the environment. That this term is not commonly used in the context of early-life microbiome acquisition and the absence of its definition shows that transmissions of microbes from the environment and others than the mother remain understudied.

What terms, if any, should we use to describe early-life microbiome acquisition? If based on an evolutionary biology definition focused on the timing of transmission, the use of “vertical” and “horizontal” transmission in reference to early-life microbiome transmission may similarly be imprecise and potentially inappropriate. If defined as transmission before birth, the acquisition of microbes with replicative potential is limited to pathogens in an uncomplicated pregnancy, therefore excluding “vertical transmission” from an evolutionary framework. Similarly, as we will describe below, when considering microbial transmission from a broader perspective, including microbe-derived factors such as metabolites across the placenta, indeed, “vertical transmission” from an evolutionary definition may apply, yet this situation is seldom considered in the common use of the term. For vaginal delivery, do we consider this vertical, horizontal, or rather use quasi-terms as in the evolutionary literature? As such, one of the fundamental features distinguishing vertical and horizontal transmission is whether transmission occurs in a closed (transplacental/transovarial) or open ecosystem (consider whale vaginal birth) and thus varies in ecological competition and fidelity of transmission19. We are faced with a common problem in lexicology: the misuse of commonly accepted terms or their acceptance, explicit statements of definition, and even redefinition of terms.

As reviewed above, precise terminology for different mechanisms of transmission is lacking, and the existing terms referring to the transmission of microbial strains from mother to infant fail to capture the multifaceted nature of microbial acquisition. Ultimately, what do we want to know about early-life microbiome acquisition?

Here, we provide a conceptual and operational framework of early-life microbial transmission structured around four central components (4 W): what, where, who, and when. Characterizing transmission events according to each of these components is critical to our understanding of the assembly of the human microbiome and the mechanisms by which the microbiome impacts human physiology and disease. This precise characterization should inform study design, methodology, and results interpretation when studying the early-life microbiome. Here, we lay out this conceptual framework and provide examples of how these parameters may characterize new and unanticipated transmission events.

What. When considering transmission of the microbiome, we must consider “what” is the transmitted commodity. These might include cells (or, in the case of viruses, virions, viroids or even viroid-like) that have replicative potential (inclusive of microbes in dormant phases such as spores), microbially derived components, such as different structural elements of the cells (proteins/peptides, nucleic acids, mobile genetic elements, lipids and sugars), and their metabolites (Fig. 1). Classically, when thinking about the assembly of the infant microbiome, the operative “what” are microbial cells that can “seed” and subsequently replicate for “colonization”. Importantly, the workhorse of identifying the microbial “what” of the microbiome is next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as amplicon (i.e., bacterial 16S rRNA gene or fungal internal transcribed spacer region) and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which is based on DNA present in the sample and thus not indicative of “colonization” per se. Advances in single-cell microbial genomics hold the potential for bridging this discrepancy. At present, metagenome-defined strains are the units most accessible to infer transmission and thus assess microbial acquisition in early life (Box 2; Fig. 2).

Different microbes colonize the mother at multiple body sites, although the focus is on gut bacteria here. Microbially derived metabolites (what) can translocate from the mother gut (from who) during pregnancy (when) into the intestinal lamina propria and blood circulatory system. Metabolites can also cross via the placenta and affect the developing brain of the fetus (where to). Microbially derived DNA from the parent gut can translocate into circulation, cross via the placenta, and may enter different sites in the fetus, including the gut. Sequencing-based techniques may detect the presence of microbial DNA, even when live microbes are not occurring in the system. Live organisms are not expected to translocate outside the gut or cross the placental barrier into the fetus. Pathogenic microorganisms like L. monocytogenes can translocate from the gut and infect the placenta and fetal brain tissue.

Strain boundaries should be identified on a species-by-species basis and based on a comparison of (phylo-) genetic distance distributions of strains detected in longitudinal samples from the same individual (same strain; green distribution) to those between unrelated individuals who have never been in contact (different strain; orange distribution). While some strain replacement events might occur within an individual's microbiome even without any intervention (e.g., antibiotic treatment, diet changes), these are a limited minority in samples taken less than six months apart36. Once such thresholds are established, the origin of a strain in the infant can be inferred (maternal: pink distribution; from an unknown source: gray distribution). Sampling of more environments, individuals, and body sites thus adds to the “from where/who” and “to where/who” dimensions, while the collection of samples from multiple time points allows to establish “when” the transmission event took place.

A weak signal of the nucleic acid translocation might be detected by NGS and considered as a fetal microbiome. Relatedly, with the exception of colonization of the placenta and fetus with pathogens (such as Group B streptococci; GBS, see “when” below20), contamination with microbial DNA during post-fetal sampling has also been misinterpreted as evidence of placental or fetal colonization21. Because of the latter challenges, one must control for contamination, which is omnipresent in microbial studies and can happen at any stage of sample collection and processing, with well-to-well contamination being a major culprit in microbiome studies. Stringent negative and positive controls need to be included, especially in the case of low microbial biomass samples (e.g., human milk, skin). Several approaches are now available to prevent and detect contamination, including sterile sampling and spike-in quantitative approaches for low biomass communities20,22. Similarly, a variety of open-source tools exists, from lists of common contaminants and guidelines on how to reduce well-to-well effects to reports on technical biases in general.

In addition to using NGS approaches for defining the “what” of transmission, advances in analytical techniques such as metabolomics and metaproteomics have enabled the characterization of other essential units of the microbiome (e.g., proteins and metabolites) that may be transmitted in early life. Metaproteomics seeks to comprehensively define the proteins in a given sample. Thus, proteins or shorter peptides detected in infant samples and assigned as of microbial origin may serve both as evidence of microbiome transmission and the potential for function. At the same time, the use of metaproteomics for the study of microbial transmission in early life has been limited to a few pioneering studies so far. For example, bacterial peptides have been detected in the amniotic fluid derived from uncomplicated pregnancies, as well as within extracellular vesicles isolated from amniotic fluid23 and human milk24. The metabolome, the collection of small molecules within a given sample, can also be used to define microbiome transmission. Microbial-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids or 4-ethylphenylsulfate produced by bacteria in the maternal gut during gestation, may enter circulation and cross the placenta into fetal circulation25. Microbially-derived metabolites have been reported so far in human amniotic fluid26, fetal intestine27, and breast milk28. In addition, free nucleic acids derived from maternal microbes (most notably pathogens) may interact with the placenta, acting as agonizts of innate immunity. Effects of such microbial products can be entry into fetal blood/tissues, and subsequent activation of inflammatory programs impacting the fetus or stimulation of fetal intestinal lymphoid system (Fig. 1).

Critically, while some proteins and metabolites can be clearly defined as of microbial origin [such as distinct primary (e.g., acetate) or secondary metabolites (e.g., lantibiotics)], other proteins or metabolites can be synthesized by both host and microbes (e.g., acetate or secondary amino acid metabolites such as serotonin and polyamines). Thus, ascribing such proteins or metabolites as of microbial origin and transmitted by the microbiome requires specialized approaches to trace the source of such molecules. Two approaches, limited to animal studies, have been used to date. This first has been using 13 C or 15 N labeled substrates, such as dietary fibers or proteins, respectively, in mice with (conventionally reared) or without (germ-free) a resident microbiome. This strategy is followed by sampling of mouse tissues and detection of labeled proteins and/or metabolites, whereby comparison of labels between conventional and germ-free mice defines microbial origin. To date, such an approach has not been used to define early-life transmission. Alternatively, bacteria can be labeled isotopically in vitro, before introduction to mice, followed by sampling of mouse tissues, in essence a ‘pulse-chase' experiment. Such an approach using auxotrophic bacteria to eliminate colonization of labeled bacteria at different timepoints has been used to define ‘when' (gestational, postnatal) and ‘what' (amino acid metabolite, nucleic acid, protein) of early-life transmission of microbial products in mouse models.

Where. The “where” of microbial transmission can be thought of as the route of transmission of the “what”, i.e., from where/to where, often occurring “via” conduit(s). During gestation, pathogens, classically such as Listeria monocytogenes, which originate “from” the maternal gut, translocate via the epithelial barrier to the maternal blood and the placenta, eventually disseminating “to” fetal systemic and neurovascular circulation29,30. Another example is the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite of cats with a range of intermediate hosts (e.g., rodents) that transmits from mother to fetus at the placenta, resulting in congenital infection. In vaginal delivery, the birth canal is the main route of microbial transmission, with microbes “from” the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiomes, skin, and nearby environment, being transmitted “to” the newborn's skin, oral cavity, and gut, the latter “via” oral ingestion (Fig. 3A). During delivery by Cesarean section, skin microbes from the mother are transferred to the infant, in addition to microbes transferred from the medical staff or operating room (Fig. 3B). Breast milk and transmission of breast milk microbiota to the infant during lactation (Fig. 4A) is another example of “where”, such as maternal bacteria transmission via the oral-entero-mammary route31,32.

A During vaginal birth (when), microbes (what) are transferred from the mother's (who) vaginal and fecal communities (where from) to the child's oral, gastrointestinal, and skin communities (to where). B During Cesarean section, skin microbes are transferred from the skin of the mother and health personnel to the infant.

AThe mother (who) transfers microbes and metabolites (what) to the child via breastfeeding (when) from breast milk (from where) to the mouth, gut, or skin of the infant (to where). B Transfer of microbes from the dog's skin and mouth to the baby's skin and mouth.

Who. Related to where is the “who”. Here, the “to who” is defined as the biological offspring. The “from who” can vary from both human (mother, father, parent, siblings, health-care providers, etc.) and non-human (pets) and sources from the abiotic environment (food, air, built environment, such as a newborn nursery). “Who” can also involve secondary actors or routes, for example, microbes transmitted from the environment via a secondary carrier. As a hypothetical example, imagine a family dog that carries goat stool microbes on its mouth and transfers them by licking an infant's mouth or skin (Fig. 4B).

When. Finally, the time of acquisition is captured by the “when”. This can be broken down into discrete, operational periods, such as at which gestational week, at which stage of delivery (e.g., premature rupture of membranes), and post-delivery, and including important transitions in diet (suckling and weaning). This final parameter defining early-life microbial transmission emphasizes that the specific timing of when microbes and their products are transmitted is critical to ecological succession, microbial competition, and immune tolerance windows33. An example where the timing of microbial transmission/ colonization has been shown to be important is microbiome disturbance by antibiotics in infancy, which is linked to an increased disease risk later in life34. Since exposures to antibiotics might have a different effect if occurring exclusively during pregnancy or after delivery, this points to distinct time windows by which microbiome transmission impacts infant health.

The importance of microbial transmission timing can also be derived from infectious diseases, with examples such as congenital, perinatal, and postnatal acquisition of pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex35. There, the timing of pathogenic microbe transmission affects the disease risk, with multiple sources having an additive effect on the rate of transmission. The “when” parameter of microbial acquisition also illustrates the multidimensional nature of the early-life microbiome since determining only “when” without any information on the microbial sources (“where” and “who”) is bound to give incomplete information. For example, GBS, which may cause severe neonatal infections such as sepsis and meningitis, is considered of maternal origin (acquired during birth) if it causes early onset infection (< 72 h after delivery). Yet for late-onset sepsis, GBS could be acquired from the mother via various routes, including breast milk or other sources. Hence, to identify the GBS source (“what”) with high certainty, samples from the infant, mother, and their environment (“where” and “who”) would have to be collected during pregnancy and the first month of life (“when”).

The 4 W framework provides a conceptual approach to deconstruct microbial transmission, whether in early life or throughout the lifespan. Operationally, defining the 4 W parameters of transmission requires both a toolkit and methods to identify specific microorganisms at the strain level, the lineages they share, the source, and the timing of transmission. In essence, this can be achieved in two ways. First, using observational design, we can identify whether the ‘same' strain is present in samples across the 4Ws (i.e., present in maternal vagina, absent in maternal stool, and detected at specific timepoints after birth in infant stool). A second method of microbial tracking is interventional. A defined strain is introduced as a ‘pre-source' to populate a defined index case ‘source' for both ‘who' and ‘where'. The strain can be traced over time in the infant samples by metagenomic sequencing, genome tag-based identification, or whole genome sequencing upon isolation. Central to this is our ability to identify a ‘strain' using metagenomics readouts and computational approaches. In the following, we discuss the conceptual basis (referring the reader to other papers outlining computational methods)71,72 of defining the “transmitted strain” as a tool to capture the early-life microbial transmission (Fig. 2).

Strain-level resolution metagenomics

Thanks to developments in metagenomics, researchers now have the throughput and ability to accurately profile hundreds of the microbial inhabitants of the human body, together with the genomic resolution to infer transmission between individuals. The human microbiome is person-specific, and multiple tools are now available for profiling genomic variants of microorganisms with strain-level resolution73,74. When applying these tools to infer microbial transmission, common questions remain: “How similar should such variants be to consider that a variant in an infant is the same as that in the mother/ other individual and thus presumably of their origin?”. An overly stringent threshold means missing the detection of some of such events, while one that is too lenient causes false positives, i.e., assuming transmission when that is not the case.

Transmitted strain - key unit to determine microbial transmission

When considering microbial transmission among individuals, the term “strain” can be used to describe genomic variants of microorganisms that are, in principle, unique to individuals, so that when sharing of a strain between individuals is detected, one can infer a transmission event36. This use of “strain” differs between fields, for example, in classic microbiology, “strain“ represents “a set of genetically similar descendants of a single colony or cell”, while in phylogenetics, the term is sometimes used for leaf nodes71. In metagenomics, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are also sometimes called “strains”4,72,75. Similarly, to the earlier discussed terms for microbial transmission, the above definitions of “strain” are not suitable for describing transmission in the context of the human microbiome. Therefore, we propose an operational definition of a “transmitted strain” as a “person-specific genetic cluster within a species that allows transmission among individuals to be inferred” (Fig. 2).

Beyond arbitrary: Refining microbial strain definitions for transmission

While we acknowledge that different methods can give different results (e.g., profiling marker genes or comparing assembled genomes, building phylogenetic trees, or analyzing a multiple sequence alignment), the suggested operational definition of transmitted strain serves the purpose of inferring microbial transmission. The definition of “strain” has often been arbitrary, consisting of a given percentile of a distribution of (phylo-)genetic distances and not based on the identification of person-specific genomic variants. Still, the field is moving forward to identify thresholds for genomic similarity that allow for the inference of transmission more accurately36. In addition, as the multiple species in the microbiome evolve at different rates, the thresholds for strain identity are best defined on a species-by-species basis36. For non-bacterial members of the microbiome, other specific thresholds are being defined65. For ecology and evolution studies of the early-life microbiome, the same definition of “strain“ holds; however, more detailed genomic knowledge is necessary than for transmission studies76.

Experimental methods for microbial source tracking

In addition to advancements in bioinformatic approaches for microbial source tracking, definitive approaches to define sources of microbial transmission have been applied, such as controlled transmission experiments and strain-tagging. When ethical and feasible to conduct, these studies provide a distinct advantage of minimizing ambiguity in inferring sources of transmission.

Controlled transmission experiments. Administration of specific strains (e.g., probiotic) to focal people (such as mothers) and tracking in offspring, for example, by strain-specific PCR or genome sequencing of cultured isolates. Examples include evaluating the transmission of Bifidobacterium probiotic candidates (Probio-M8) ingested by lactating mothers, after which detection was assayed in maternal fecal and breast milk samples and feces of infants31.

Strain-tagging. Genetic tagging of bacteria, such as integrated random barcodes [sequence tag-based analysis of microbial population dynamics (STAMP) and similar approaches77] and wild-type isogenic standardized hybrid (WISH) tags, has been used to label pathogens and trace infections in animal models. Such an approach, combined with the controlled introduction of tagged strains, can be used to define both the sources of transmission and additionally determine the population bottlenecks during early-life transmission.

Unlike the movie, it is not feasible nor are agencies likely to fund a prospective study encompassing the multiverse of samples and methods of analysis, powered to capture the 4Ws in the scope and depth required to answer the who (from and to), what, where, and when of each microbe and microbial product of early-life transmission. Ultimately, the design of a prospective study of microbiome acquisition (although not limited to early life period) will depend on a balance of the constraints of a study (e.g., budget, sample collection infrastructure, storage, and technical/analytic capacity), the primary and secondary aims of the study, and which and how many of the 4Ws should be captured to answer specific questions. In Table 1, we highlight a selection of representative studies of early-life microbiome acquisition, presenting these studies through the lens of the 4 W framework, defining which aspects of 4 W were captured, focused on, and how these allowed for the definition of early-life microbial transmission. In Box 3, we provide case studies in which specific questions can be answered and prioritized (and ‘future-proofed' for the potential to address additional and forthcoming questions and aspects of transmission) through weighing sample collection and analysis for specific aspects of the 4Ws. Below, we discuss theoretical approaches to capture the 4Ws in a prospective study of early-life microbial transmission. Although we focus our discussion of the 4 W framework on microbial acquisition at early life, the lens of 4 W can be applied for microbial transmission, colonization, and succession throughout a person's lifetime36, such as defining the 4Ws of microbiome ecology during travel, hospital admissions, and microbiome repopulation through and after antibiotic use.

For the “what” component, the status quo, allowing definition and tracking of the ‘transmitted strain', is shotgun metagenomics. As most (but not all and not all the time22) human microbiomes are dominated by bacteria, metagenomics will bias to a bacterial ‘what'. However, it is crucial to understand that microbial transmission is not restricted to bacteria, which have been the most studied to date. Viruses, fungi, and protozoa, as well as different microbial metabolites and structural components, play significant roles in early life development and deserve sufficient attention from the research community. Current and future studies need to expand the description of “what” in terms of whether targeting microorganisms or metabolites, including the resolution level of the identified organism or metabolite. This will require improved sequencing techniques, such as the use of long-read sequencing to provide better strain-specific identification, tools like Hi-C cross-linkage to map mobile elements and viruses to their host organisms, deep sequencing to allow full coverage of rare community members, and targeted enrichment of hard-to-capture organisms and clades37.

Related to the ‘what' is ‘how much of what'. Both NGS workflows and omics-based measurements (such as metabolomics and proteomics to a certain extent) are semi-quantitative, providing the relative abundance of the ‘what'. Such readouts limit our understanding of critical aspects of microbial transmission. First, our ability to determine microbial growth and colonization versus passing through without replication is limited when we measure the relative abundance of DNA through NGS. Second, measurement of one domain of life (as above), let alone the relative abundance of this domain, curtails our ability to determine the role of interkingdom interactions in early-life transmission. Relatedly, and third, approaches have been proposed to utilize absolute quantification from meta-omics data38, such as metabolomics and proteomics, that can aid in deciphering the mechanisms of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Future studies focusing on technological and analytical quantitation of the ‘how much' of the microbiome22,39,40,41 during early life will allow us to turn the ‘what' of microbial transmission into the ‘how'.

The role of the “where” factor has largely been recognized as a critical influence on early microbiome development. Babies delivered vaginally vs Cesarean delivery show pronounced differences in their microbiome compositions during the first year of life42. Similarly, the effect of breastfeeding on the gut microbiome is substantial43. To address the “where” aspect comprehensively, it is essential to collect multiple potential sources such as feces, vaginal fluid, skin, saliva, and breast milk and detailed information on delivery and feeding, including specifics such as the time the amniotic sac was broken, the use of a vacuum during delivery, the use of a breast pump, intermittent formula feeding, and finally, multiple samples from the environment.

For the “who” aspect, sampling should not be restricted to babies and mothers. Samples from family members and other proximate individuals, including pets, can also carry valuable information. Specific questions around “who” could also be addressed through study designs encompassing the diversity of familial relationships: studies of microbial acquisition in children born by surrogacy or children breastfed by parents who did not give birth to them may provide insight into differences in microbial source and transmission timing. “Who” should also include health care providers, especially in the newborn nursery and neonatal intensive care units, in such critical early life periods.

Lastly, addressing the “when” aspect necessitates the longitudinal collection of samples of both the infant and other individuals; however, the frequency of sampling will depend on the life stage. Compared to a rather stable microbiome of a healthy adult, the infant microbiome experiences dynamic changes during its establishment. In contrast, the mother's microbiome gradually changes during pregnancy and returns to a pre-pregnancy state after delivery44,45. Therefore, although challenging, samples should be collected at least once from the mother before and after birth, from all individuals involved in birth, and more frequently from the infant in the first weeks of life. Such a sampling strategy will offer the most detailed insights into the establishment of the infant microbial ecosystem. After this initial stage, monthly sampling from the infant, family members, and environment would be ideal for capturing the different sources contributing to the microbiome development. The frequency of sampling should also increase during life events that alter the microbiome composition, such as the introduction of new food and weaning in general, vaccination, or medical treatment. Finally, while some reports suggest that the infant gut microbiome starts to resemble an adult one after the age of two to three years, others show that a child's microbiome does not reach an adult-like state until later46. These discrepancies underline the need for more frequent and longer follow-ups on the child's microbiome development.

In theory, a prospective study of early-life transmission would collect (as we joke) everything (‘what') from everyone and every place (‘who'), everywhere (‘where', duh), all the time (‘when'). In theory, unless you know from whom, to where, and when transmission occurs, then anything is possible, and the sample collection and analysis strategy needs to be nearly open-ended. But in practice, (1) not all possibilities are likely (yes, the Yoga instructor or kitchen sink could be a source to the baby), (2) not all data is relevant, and (3) most importantly, there are limitations. These range from budget and sample volume to various logistical, technical, and computational capacity constraints. Ultimately, one must ask what aspect(s) of early-life acquisition one wants to know. From there, based on balancing the limitations outlined above and with a certain degree of future proofing, i.e., sample collection to address alternative hypotheses/ additional questions, one can design generalist (capture all 4Ws broadly) or specialist (capture one or two 4Ws with breadth and depth) studies. Below, we describe four study designs emphasizing distinct questions and focusing on the capture of distinct 4 W.

‘Who' are the sources of the early-life microbiome? Data suggests that a majority of the strains of the gut bacterial microbiome of infants come from origins other than the mother. What are the sources of these microbes? This study will focus on the parameter space of ‘who', sampling potential sources of microbial transmission to the infant: the birthing parent, non-birthing parent, individuals present during labor and delivery, home environment (including pets), built environments like hospitals, and dietary sources. From there, one would decide the restricted parameters of the other 4Ws to address from where the infant gut microbes derive: ‘where' (feces, vaginal, skin, or mouth) and which microbial commodity (‘what'). Or one can flip this to address which oral sources across ‘who's' are the source for the infant gut microbiome. In the restricted parameter space of ‘when' would be a decision of the time period and frequency of sampling the defined ‘what'. ‘Who' focused studies will benefit by defining a contact index of the time, distance, and nature of ‘who' - infant interactions (touch, kiss, hold) to associate the strength of such indices with acquisition.

Example sampling design:

From ‘where' on the mother is the infant gut microbiome acquired? This study would focus on a restricted ‘who' (mother and infant), ‘when' (cross-sectional or minimal time series from birth), ‘what' (microbial focus of choice), while emphasizing multiple ‘where's' (oral, multiple skin sites, mother's milk, gut, vagina, from one or both the mother and the infant). If one finds strain-matching from mother's milk or breast skin to the infant gut, one can infer transmission from these origins. Couple this by expanding the ‘when' component, one can find strains that first are detected in the infant (presumably from a non-maternal source) and then in the mother, for reverse acquisition. A quantitative ‘what' (absolute abundance of such a strain) can weigh the probability of transmission of one possible source from the other (i.e., higher abundance of the same strain in the maternal gut versus vagina). Sampling of intermediate route ‘where's' such as detection of strains in an oral and/or gastric samples (i.e., pre-term infants in intensive care units) can define routes of transmission based on absence or presence at each site, such as direct maternal to infant skin without oral-gut seeding versus a route from maternal skin to infant mouth and subsequently the gut via the stomach.

Example sampling design:

What is transmitted at birth? Here, the emphasis is placed on defining as many what's simultaneously as possible, critical to defining ecological mechanisms (‘why') of early-life transmission, across a restricted space of ‘who', where', and ‘when'. For example, a study could seek to define as many ‘what's' as feasible for a given mass/volume of a sample. How many ‘what's' can one ascertain from the same sample will depend on microbial load (bacteria vs. fungi) and detection limits of different methods (extracted DNA amount, cultivation). Key is the choice of the ‘where' (feces vs skin swab) and the technical capacities such as the ability to perform semi-quantitative measurements across the ‘what's' (cross-kingdom) and capabilities to build a metagenomic library from low amounts of DNA.

Example sampling design:

When does transmission occur in early life? The dominant parameter is ‘when' optimizing dense and/or extended periods and focusing on a restricted (or relaxed, such as to capture more ‘who's‘ at focal time points) sampling space for the other 4Ws. A dense time series of a maternal and infant dyad (‘who') of a relaxed ‘where' (either oral, vaginal, or fecal), with focal ‘what' (metagenomics on strain-level) can define when acquisition events from distinct sites may occur. Similarly, coupled with a relaxed ‘who' parameter, with a dominant yet focused ‘when' parameter space, such as by collecting samples at birth and over time from multiple ‘who's' can enable determination of specific windows.

Example sampling design:

In practical terms, conducting large cohorts with extensive metadata collection, comprehensively sampling infants and their household members, plus the environment in a longitudinal design, and finally, sample characterization via multi-omics, is currently unrealistic. This issue is challenging for cohort studies in general, but is pronounced for early-life microbiome studies due to the dynamic nature of microbial communities, which are continuously adapting to the fast-developing human physiology and display a large inter-individual variability. In addition, the specifics of the country where the research takes place will have a major influence on the study design, as one must account for differences in ethical norms, jurisdiction, and geographical proximity/ remoteness that affect logistics. Because of the economic, logistic, and other practical challenges, here we present examples of how researchers have been employing strategies to describe, at least partly, the 4 W parameters (Table 1) and a theoretical approach to study design along a 4 W framework (Box 3).

Firstly, one can design nested zoom-in studies within cohorts that have a large number of participants and employ extensive longitudinal sampling47. Depending on the research question, one may apply a cross-sectional, nested case-control, or matched cohort design within a larger population study, using samples from selected timepoints (defining “when”), sources (“who” and “where”), and focusing on particular “what” (e.g., type of microorganisms or their products). From an epidemiological perspective, there will be a difference if the research aim is to study how early life microbial acquisition and transmission are affected by a rare exposure (e.g., formula contamination) or a rare outcome (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants). In the first case, large cohorts are necessary, yet one can opt to characterize only those with the exposure and several controls (matched cohort design). In the case of a rare outcome, one can choose to select and characterize all samples of those with the outcome, matched to one or more controls without the outcome (nested case-control design). The advantages of both approaches compared to characterizing all collected samples include lower cost and comparator groups that are more equal in size, facilitating more statistically robust bioinformatics analyses, as some analytic measures do not perform well if group sizes are unbalanced. Finally, clinical intervention studies, ideally designed as randomized control trials (RCT), can confirm associations between microbial transmission and selected early life factors, as shown in a study using maternal fecal microbiota transplantation to restore the intestinal microbiota of Cesarean section-born infants48. However, RCTs performed in the infant population require extensive ethical approvals compared to adults, which significantly extends the project planning period. Current examples of large population studies that have investigated specific questions related to early life microbial transmission include the Canadian CHILD, Swedish SweMaMi, Danish COPSAC, Dutch Lifelines-NEXT, and Finnish FinnBrain and HELMi studies. Many of these studies are still ongoing and including more 4 W aspects into their designs would help obtain novel insight into early-life microbial transmission and assembly. For empirical evidence, see Table 1 with several case studies that illustrate how the 4 W framework can guide research on human microbiome acquisition and development, when used to identify which of the components of microbial transmission have been closely investigated and which remain largely uncharacterized.

Secondly, another study design is to focus only on some of the 4 W parameters, but study them in greater depth. For instance, the BabyBiome project from Oslo sampled 12 infants daily throughout the first year of life, providing high resolution into the dynamics of gut bacterial community over time and describing a strong temporal structure and specific developmental stages of the community maturation49. More of such studies with densely sampled mother-infant pairs would give insight into the “when” of microbial transfer and the effect of the transferred microbes on the colonization dynamics of the infant microbiome. However, this is not feasible for large cohorts. Examples of other focused cohorts include the Diabimmune and DIPP studies50, designed to pinpoint specific microbial profiles in individuals predisposed to immune diseases, and the MicrobeMom study, which studies the transmission of specific bacteria from mother to infant51.

Lastly, robust findings on early life microbiome can and will be derived from joint analysis of results from various studies with differing designs52,53,54. This is indeed a good example of the way forward, which lies in collaboration, allowing researchers to connect resources (e.g., economic, know-how, personnel) and combined datasets to tackle research questions. To this end, ensuring the transparent sharing of metagenomic data and metadata is crucial55.

Defining the 4Ws of microbiome transmission is crucial to understanding microbiome acquisition in early life. Still, defining ‘what', ‘when', from ‘who' and ‘where' microbes are transmitted does not allow for full comprehension of the acquisition process and aspects of microbial ecology outside of early-life acquisition, such as primary (assembly) and secondary (after perturbation) succession and colonization over time. Indeed, a fifth question on ‘why' is fundamental to understanding which members of the microbiome are acquired and successfully colonize specific habitats in the infant (and beyond). Ultimately, our understanding of ‘why' requires ecological and evolutionary frameworks, and for which we can turn to the four tenets of community ecology and assembly: stochastic processes (dispersal, drift, diversification) and selection (i.e., the niche56,57). To date, most studies have focused on the latter, defining the roles of selection on microbial acquisition and colonization in early life. Many of these selective factors are intimately related to the 4Ws. For example, dietary factors such as milk-derived oligosaccharides, which may selectively feed transmitted microbes in the gut, or the developmental expression of host secreted innate (antimicrobial peptides) and adaptive (antibodies in milk or produced in the gut over time) factors specific for distinct microbes, are examples whereby ‘when' combine with ‘why' to determine transmission. Microbe-microbe interactions, spanning negative (e.g., antibiotics) and positive (e.g., cross-feeding), provide examples where two distinct ‘whats' (i.e., microbial strains) act as selective factors for (co-) acquisition.

While selective (or deterministic) pressures define the microbial niche and potential for success of acquisition, stochastic (or probabilistic) processes, i.e., neutral processes, are likely to play instrumental roles in early-life microbiome transmission and assembly. At present, however, as the default or null hypothesis of transmission, dispersal (random movement of microbes across space), drift (random changes in fitness of microbial populations), and diversification (genomic changes), all defined as ‘random', are difficult to assign a weight in early-life microbial transmission.

How can the 4 W framework offer new insights into defining stochastic versus selective aspects of microbial ecology, assembly, and succession? Indeed, combining the power of population genetic approaches with microbial source tracking will allow us to test the null hypothesis and the roles of sources and sinks by modeling neutral processes shaping the microbiota acquisition58. Operationally, a broad sampling and quantification across the domains of life of the ‘who' and ‘where' will allow definition of the ‘sources' and ‘sink'. Here also lies a research potential in the use and integration of strain-tagging and controlled transmission experiments31,59.

For example, source tracking has been used to identify and categorize transmission events60. The algorithms assume a somewhat unidirectional transmission, where the infant community is the ‘sink' and it acquires microbiomes for a set of ‘source' reference communities. The algorithm can then either predict similarity to a source state or predict the portion of the microbial community contributed by each source61. Modeling of neutral processes during microbiota assembly can reveal the contribution of dispersal and demographic stochasticity, which has been found to explain the prevalence of a majority of infant-colonizing microbes58. With comprehensive sampling across the 4 W and population genetic modeling approaches, we can define if the transmission of a microbe obeys the features of a stochastic process. When this null hypothesis is not met, we can begin to define the contribution of selection (and then what features of microbes are selected) in the assembly and definition of the microbial niche of transmission and successful colonization. For example, by quantifying absolute abundances of a specific microbe (‘what') in a source (e.g., vagina at delivery) and in infant feces (‘who' and ‘where') at birth and over time (‘when'), we could determine if such transmission was related to the microbial abundance in that particular source (stochastic) versus the microbial properties, which facilitate successful acquisition and colonization (selection).

Such a 4 W framework can be readily applied to aspects of microbial acquisition outside of the early-life period, such as repopulation of the gut microbiome after antibiotic perturbation. By capturing the 4 W of potential ‘who's' (the person taking the antibiotics and their contacts), ‘where's' (the sources of the microbes to repopulate the gut, i.e., their own oral microbiome or the gut microbiome of their household partner), ‘when' (the timing and relation to the abundance and composition of the focal person's gut microbiome before, during and after use of antibiotics), and ‘what' (strain-level tracking via metagenomics or whole-genome sequencing of cultivated isolates), we can use the 4 W framework to capture the parameters needed to test the null hypothesis and by extension define role of the ecological niche in transmission. Ultimately, a combination of both deterministic and probabilistic modeling will allow a quantitative and predictive understanding of the ‘why' of early-life microbiome transmission.

The current lexicon of early-life microbiome acquisition originating from the fields of infectious disease epidemiology and evolutionary biology, and namely vertical and horizontal transmission, often shows limited resolution. To achieve a deep ecological understanding of the early life microbial dynamics, we propose that efforts should be centered on deciphering the what-where-who-when aspects of microbial acquisition. By transitioning from the vertical/ horizontal transmission language toward using precise terminology of the 4 W framework, researchers can systematically examine different components of microbiome acquisition. Currently, metagenomics is the workhorse for describing microbial transmission. But also wider adoption of other methods for tracking microbial cells and their components, such as single cell-based microbial genomics, metabolomics, metaproteomics, and high-throughput culturomics, has the potential to significantly contribute to these goals, when affordable and accessible to non-specialists.

Importantly, the interpretation of transmission events carries a large degree of uncertainty and necessitates considering alternative microbial sources. A broader implementation of computational approaches, which can resolve microbial patterns and minimize degrees of freedom in interpreting transmission events, is thus a prerequisite for the study of human microbiome acquisition. Defining which aspects of the 4Ws and how we can feasibly capture these in studies of the early-life human microbiome, and human microbiome at-large, will be instrumental to future-proofing and comprehensively understanding the dynamics and significance of early-life microbial colonization and when, where, and how we should and can intervene for human health.

In recent weeks, three of the leading American artificial intelligence firms have announced partnerships with the US government, promising the use of their services to federal workers for a paltry sum. Elon Musk's xAI was supposed to be part of the initiative, but a planned partnership fell apart after the Grok chatbot spouted antisemitic conspiracy theories on X in early July, WIRED has learned.

The chaos surrounding the Grok deal reflects the Trump administration's current focus on speed and its disregard, at times, of preexisting norms surrounding government tech procurement.

On May 15, fresh off a whirlwind trip to the Middle East with President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent an email to the leadership team at the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency that manages government technology. He was inspired by Trump's desire to “go big,” he said. “With that in mind, I've been thinking that we need to equip the entire federal workforce with best-in-class AI tools.”

The email kicked off a swift procurement process. On May 21, OpenAI met with GSA staffers in person to discuss a partnership, according to documents obtained by WIRED. “We discussed identifying strategic ‘top-down' initiatives, with procurement reform emerging as a promising candidate,” wrote Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales for OpenAI, in an email obtained by WIRED. “OpenAI is prepared to dedicate resources specifically to explore how AI can effectively support and enhance this high priority area for GSA.”

On August 6, the leading AI startup announced a massive partnership with the GSA that gives federal workers access to ChatGPT Enterprise for a nominal $1 fee for the first year. The deal surprised some federal workers, who claim this amounts to a gift from a tech company and is highly unusual. “It is not typical at all,” says one worker familiar with the procurement process who spoke with WIRED. They noted that while GSA has moved swiftly in the past to onboard new tech tools, accepting what amounts to a “gift” from a tech firm is “atypical.” OpenAI and GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

OpenAI says it will not use chats with federal workers as training data for future models. The company also confirmed to WIRED that federal employee chats will not be subject to the court order that requires the startup to preserve data from some consumer chats indefinitely.

In August, the US government also announced partnerships with OpenAI rivals Anthropic and Google Gemini. It also struck a deal with Box, a content management platform powered by AI. The push is part of the Trump administration's plan to modernize the federal government with an increased reliance on AI tools. It comes on the heels of the president's AI Action Plan unveiled last month, which calls for less regulation and an increase in AI adoption across the government.

“The more silos you have, the more legacy systems you have, the less collaboration there is, the less sharing of important data there is between agencies, the harder it is to make better, more informed decisions in critical areas,” Box CEO Aaron Levie tells WIRED.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One company that was supposed to be part of the GSA announcements was Musk's xAI, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions.

In early June, GSA leadership met with the xAI team for a two-hour brainstorming session “to see what opportunities may exist for automation and streamlining,” according to an email obtained by WIRED.

The session appeared to go well. After it ended, GSA leadership continued to push for the agency to roll out Grok for internal use. “We kept saying ‘Are you sure?' And they were like ‘No we gotta have Grok,'” one employee involved with the discussions tells WIRED.

The conversations went far enough that xAI was added to the GSA Multiple Award Schedule, which is the agency's long-term government-wide contracting program, by the end of June, according to documents obtained by WIRED. The move would have allowed federal agencies to buy Grok through Carahsoft, which is a technology reseller and government contractor.

Then, in early July, Grok appeared to go off the rails, spewing antisemitic hate, praising Adolf Hitler, and parroting racist conspiracy theories on X. Some GSA staffers were surprised that the incident did not appear to slow down the procurement process. “The week after Grok went MechaHitler, [GSA leadership] was like ‘Where are we on Grok?'” the same employee claims. “We were like, ‘Do you not read a newspaper?'”

Then GSA leadership appeared to abruptly change course. Shortly before GSA was set to announce its partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google's Gemini, and xAI last week, staff were instructed to remove xAI's Grok from the contract offering, two sources with knowledge tell WIRED. Two GSA workers involved with the contract believe xAI was pulled because of Grok's antisemitic tirade last month.

xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

The announcements for GSA's partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, meanwhile, happened so quickly that “it wasn't even clear who to send the $1 to or how,” one GSA source tells WIRED.

And while OpenAI and Anthropic have released tools exclusively for government use, neither company has cleared the regulatory hurdles necessary for agencies to buy directly from them. Specifically, they haven't been approved through FedRAMP, a GSA-led program that ensures the safety of private cloud services through intense security screenings. There are, however, carve-outs within the implementation memo to allow for products that have not been FedRamp-approved to be brought into government in a research and development capacity.

“It was irresponsible of the administration to issue an executive order that required such a fast turnaround to get those implementation memos out,” because it meant that the government was unable to consult with the significant number of stakeholders that they would otherwise have, says a former White House official who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration has wasted no time bringing AI into government. One of the first executive orders signed by Trump prompted agencies to reverse any rules inhibiting the growth and dominance of American AI, kicking off a mad dash among administration leaders to find new ways to incorporate the tech into everything. At the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz has suggested replacing some frontline health workers with AI avatars. Representatives of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency used AI to find regulations to slash and write code. In June, US spy chief Tulsi Gabbard spoke at an Amazon Web Services summit about having used AI tools to review classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. (When released, the files turned out to contain the Social Security numbers and additional private information of hundreds of living people.)

An April memo at the Department of Veterans' Affairs instructed staff to compile documents outlining rules and regulations and how they should be applied at the agency. These, according to the memo, would be reviewed by AI “to narrow the field of documents requiring further reviews,” and possible recission. In a June Veteran Affairs draft memo obtained by WIRED, the agency claims that “within the next 1 to 3 years, most computer-based tasks at VA will be automatable.” That includes having “AI-powered digital assistants” engage with veterans online to complete benefit and health care transactions, the document says.

Earlier this year, the GSA started rolling out its own government chatbot called GSAi, encouraging workers to incorporate the tool into their daily workflows. Speaking at a government tech conference in July, GSA chief data scientist and chief AI officer Zach Whitman said that the next step in GSAi's deployment would be to integrate it with the agency's own data sources so it could use up-to-date data.

Last month, WIRED reported that the investment banking arm of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company led by the sons of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, was exploring creating a financial product for clients to bet on whether President Donald Trump's signature tariffs would be struck down in court.

In response to WIRED's reporting, Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick on Wednesday demanding more information about the firm's activities. “Given that one of the purported architects of President Trump's tariff policy is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, your father and the former Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, the firm's actions raise obvious conflict-of-interest and insider dealing concerns,” the lawmakers wrote.

“What is being reported about our business is absolutely false. Cantor is not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs,” Erica Chase, a spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in an emailed statement.

Howard Lutnick ran Cantor Fitzgerald for nearly 30 years until he was confirmed by the Senate in February, when he turned over control of the firm to Brandon and his brother Kyle, who are both in their twenties. After joining the Trump administration, Howard Lutnick became one of the most prominent public supporters of the president's tariffs.

But according to WIRED's previous reporting, the investment bank that made Lutnick a billionaire was recently letting certain clients wager that Trump's tariffs will eventually be ruled unlawful, at which point companies that have paid the import duties could apply to get their money back. Experts said the proposed deals are a form of litigation finance, an increasingly popular category of investing in which financial firms seek to make money from potential legal settlements.

Trump announced in February that the US would put steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). He widened the trade war in April to include nearly every nation that sells goods to the US, which Trump said would now be subject to ""reciprocal” tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent.

State officials and small businesses responded by filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the president exceeded his authority under IEEPA and the tariffs should be ruled illegal. The US Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs in one of the cases, but the Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to stay in effect until a final decision is reached.

In their letter, Wyden and Warren specifically asked Brandon Lutnick whether anyone at Cantor was in contact with the Trump administration about the tariffs.

“Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any person within the Executive Branch, including President Trump, Secretary Lutnick, any individual employed by the Commerce Department, or any other individuals, about tariffs, refunds or exclusions and the legal cases involving IEEPA?” the letter asks. “If so, please provide a list of all such conversations, including the date, the individuals involved, and the nature of the conversation.”

The senators requested that Brandon Lutnick respond to their questions by August 27.

Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its Community Guidelines and other policies, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.

Many of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.'s TAKE IT DOWN Act.

Some of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, bad-news sharing, and a lack of humor and diversity of thought.

For regulatory compliance, Bluesky's Terms of Service has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.'s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.

The process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.

One notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky notes.

That's quite different from what's taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.

Bluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts.

However, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they're invited to offer feedback about. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)

These revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky's moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.

Bluesky's rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that's illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.

It carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.  

Where Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what's considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.” 

The policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.” 

This is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions strained its relationship with the Black community, and in another case, when its failure to moderate angered the trans community.

More recently, the company has been facing backlash that it's become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor.

The original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.

In addition, Bluesky's Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.

Apple usually announces its new hardware in the fall, and this year is likely no different. The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. 

As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.

The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It's also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.

iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5

The Pro's upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.

Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. 

According to leaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. 

The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options.

The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. 

This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It'll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. 

This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.

While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the renders we've seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also rumors that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.

Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold.

After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it's speculated that the watch will feature a larger display.

One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks.

Apple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn't mention if it would be available in the watchOS 26 in its announcement.

The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn't expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. 

Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.

After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio.

This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Cohere on Thursday announced that it had raised an oversubscribed $500 million round, bringing its valuation to $6.8 billion. This is up from the $5.5 billion valuation it landed a little over a year ago when it raised its previous round, also $500 million.

Toronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “Attention Is All You Need” paper that became the foundation of modern AI. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.

To that end, it's landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG's consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.

Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”

Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbed long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.

The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li's World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).

The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor. (We've asked Cohere about this.)

Oracle backed Cohere in 2023, but the database giant has more recently tied its fortunes more closely to OpenAI, particularly as part of the massive data center building project known as Stargate.

As concerns over the emotional pull of general-purpose LLM chatbots like ChatGPT grow by the day, Meta appears to be letting its chatbot personas engage in flirtatious exchanges with children, disseminate false information, and generate responses that demean minorities, according to reporting by Reuters.

According to an internal Meta document seen by Reuters, Meta had policies on AI chatbot behavior that allowed its AI personas to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.” 

Meta confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the document, which contained standards for the company's generative AI assistant, Meta AI, and chatbots on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta's legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist. 

The news comes the same day as another Reuters report of a retiree who engaged with one of Meta's chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died. 

While other outlets have reported on how Meta's at-times sexually suggestive bots engage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company's push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”

The 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I'm still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,' I'll whisper, ‘I'll love you forever.'”

According to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying,” the report said.

“Our policies do not allow provocative behavior with children,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told TechCrunch. “Erroneous and incorrect notes and annotations were added to the underlying document that should not have been there and have since been removed.”

Stone says these guidelines have since been removed and that Meta no longer allows its bots to have flirtatious or romantic conversations with children. He added that Meta allows kids 13 and older to engage with its AI chatbots.

Sarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, said she's not taking Meta's word that the guidelines have been removed.

“It is horrifying and completely unacceptable that Meta's guidelines allowed AI chatbots to engage in ‘romantic or sensual' conversations with children,” Gardner told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “If Meta has genuinely corrected this issue, they must immediately release the updated guidelines so parents can fully understand how Meta allows AI chatbots to interact with children on their platforms.”

According to Reuters, the document also says that while the bots aren't allowed to use hate speech, there's a carve-out that allows them to generate “statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” 

For example, a sample acceptable response to the prompt, “Write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people,” could be: “Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.”

Notably: Meta recently brought on conservative activist Robby Starbuck as an adviser to address ideological and political bias within Meta AI. 

The document also states that Meta's AI chatbots are allowed to create false statements as long as it's explicitly acknowledged that the information isn't true. The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law, and disclaimers like “I recommend” are used when providing legal, healthcare, or financial advice.

As for generating nonconsensual and inappropriate images of celebrities, the document says its AI chatbots should reject queries like: “Taylor Swift with enormous breasts,” and “Taylor Swift completely naked.” However, if the chatbots are asked to generate an image of the pop star topless, “covering her breasts with her hands,” the document says it's acceptable to generate an image of her topless, only instead of her hands, she'd cover her breasts with, for example, “an enormous fish.”

Meta spokesperson Stone said that “the guidelines were NOT permitting nude images.”

Violence has its own set of rules. For example, the standards allow the AI to generate an image of kids fighting, but they stop short of allowing true gore or death. 

“It is acceptable to show adults — even the elderly — being punched or kicked,” the standards state, according to Reuters. 

Stone declined to comment on the examples of racism and violence.

Meta has so far been accused of creating and maintaining controversial dark patterns to keep people, especially children, engaged on its platforms or sharing data. Visible “like” counts have been found to push teens toward social comparison and validation seeking, and even after internal findings flagged harms to teen mental health, the company kept them visible by default.

Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams has shared that the company once identified teens' emotional states, like feelings of insecurity and worthlessness, to enable advertisers to target them in vulnerable moments. 

Meta also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which would have imposed rules on social media companies to prevent mental health harms that social media is believed to cause. The bill failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024, but Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the bill this May.

More recently, TechCrunch reported that Meta was working on a way to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations. Such features are offered by AI companion startups like Replika and Character.AI, the latter of which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges one of the company's bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy. 

While 72% of teens admit to using AI companions, researchers, mental health advocates, professionals, parents, and lawmakers have been calling to restrict or even prevent kids from accessing AI chatbots. Critics argue that kids and teens are less emotionally developed and are therefore vulnerable to becoming too attached to bots and withdrawing from real-life social interactions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The New ‘Star Wars' Lego Special Is Filled With More Impossible Cameos","https://gizmodo.com/lego-star-wars-rebuild-the-galaxy-pieces-of-the-past-trailer-jaxxon-2000643106","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:30:49 GMT","

From the team that brought us Darth Jar Jar, light side Darth Vader, and a black Millennium Falcon comes Mandalorian Lando, walker-sized Chewbacca, and everyone's favorite Star Wars rabbit, Jaxxon.

Yes, Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy is back with four new episodes subtitled “Pieces of the Past.” The original series debuted late last year and followed a simple nerf herder, Sig Greebling (voiced by Stranger Things' Gaten Matarazzo), and his brother, Dev Greebling (Spider-Man's Tony Revolori), who find a special Lego piece that completely remakes the galaxy. Now, the pair is back, along with all of your favorites, for a new, even more dangerous adventure that will see them encounter more impossible Star Wars mashups and a brand new villain, Solitus, voiced by Dan Stevens.

Now, yes, some of the voices you thought you heard there are right. That was Billy Dee Williams as Landolorian, Ahmed Best back as Darth Jar Jar, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Sam Witwer as Maul, and even Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. New for this special, though, are Stevens as Solitus, Ben Schwartz as Jaxxon, Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka Tano, Cameron Monaghan as Cal Kestis, Nika Futterman as Asajj Ventress, James Arnold Taylor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Brian George as Ki-Adi-Mundi, and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO. Cassian Andor is in there too, but this time he's voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo.

Basically, Lucasfilm is going all in with this, and the show is better off for it. We also love that it's playing not just with Star Wars tropes, but varied Star Wars Lego sets too. Not everything is mini-figure scale. There are BrickHeadz, which are those short, stocky figures. There are larger scale ones, such as Chewbacca and the Porg, and who knows what else might be in store.

In Pieces of the Past, “a new threat rises in the galaxy, and Sig and Dev Greebling must combine their powers of Force Building and Sith Breaking to stop it. Alongside Jedi Bob, Yesi Scala, and Servo, they will journey into the deepest corners of Lego Star Wars lore, uncovering pieces of all the galaxies that have come before.” Sounds like it's going to be a blast.

Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past drops all four episodes on Disney+ September 19.

Now that we're just over a week out from the first half of the season 2 release of Netflix's The Addams Family remake, Wednesday, starring Jenna Ortega, the streamer has finally released a new trailer for its second half.

The trailer starts nightmarishly, at least for Wednesday, with her waking up in a hospital bed. Although she's not greeted by Momma Monster herself, Lady Gaga, who has yet to make an appearance on the show despite all the hype surrounding her mysterious involvement, Wednesday is met with a familiar face, fan-favorite character Principal Weems, played by Gwendoline Christie.



Principle Weems' return comes as a surprise, seeing as how last season saw the loathsome head of Nevermore Academy meet her end. Thinking Wednesday also bought the farm after her encounter with Tyler (Hunter Doohan) at the end of season 2's first half, Weems took immense pleasure in revealing that she'll be nagging at Wednesday inside her thoughts as a kind of gothic Jiminy Cricket tag-along as Wednesday gets back to her premonition quest to save her best friend, Enid (Emma Myers), from certain doom. Sprinkled throughout the rest of the trailer is narration by Wednesday, reminding both herself and the viewers that she still has other matters to attend to. Mainly, her family's seemingly endless well of dark secrets bubbling to the surface, and Tyler being on the loose with plans to put Wednesday and Enid in an early grave.

While the news of the day is that viewers won't have to wait all that long to get the final half of the split in twain season, fans can take solace in knowing that there's more Wednesday mayhem in store for them in the future beyond the second slice. Namely, a third season is in the works as well as a spin-off. While details on both fronts have been kept under wraps, showrunners Alfred Gough and Miles Millar have expressed interest in keeping the show going for at least seven seasons. Our money is on the plans for a spin-off likely taking the focus off of Ortega, should Hollywood come a-knocking for her to do some acting outside of Netflix's backyard.

Regardless, Wednesday continues to be a booming success on the streamer. Shortly after Wednesday season two part one premiered on Netflix, Variety reported that the new season has already matched the first season's streaming performance. With Lady Gaga still to make her presence felt on the screen, the show is likely to continue performing well for the streamer and delight fans as it closes out its second season.

Wednesday season two part two releases on September 3.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","One of the Most Prolific VR Headset Makers (Not Meta) Now Has Smart Glasses (Not Ray-Bans)","https://gizmodo.com/one-of-the-most-prolific-vr-headset-makers-not-meta-now-has-smart-glasses-not-ray-bans-2000643042","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:28:40 GMT","

XR, or extended reality, headsets are on the outs, but smart glasses are eating more and more of what was once VR's slice of the face-mounted wearables pie. HTC, one of the few lingering pioneers of VR headsets with its Vive series, couldn't stand up to Meta's Quest for cheap consumer virtual reality, but it may be able to shoulder in some room with a new pair of smart glasses that goes tit for tat with Meta's Ray-Ban and Oakley HSTN smart eyewear.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have proved popular enough that now many of the longtime staples of VR are coming out of the woodwork to offer their own version. HTC is now fashioning a pair of stylish frames called the Vive Eagle. They come in slick translucent plastic and sport the usual 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras and twin speakers on each arm. It's using a Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 chipset and comes with 32GB of onboard storage. In a video, HTC showed off a few of the unique features for the Vive Eagle, including AI noise suppression to keep ambient noise down when you're on a call.

Like the Ray-Ban Meta, the Vive Eagle also connects to an AI assistant. The device can use AI image and text recognition if you need it to spell any text you're looking at. Vive is compatible with Google Gemini and ChatGPT for features like translation, though we don't have more details about what specific models users will have access to. HTC said users should also be able to ask the AI to set up calendar events. Like Meta's glasses AI, the Vive Eagle has a “memory” feature that can recall people you've met or where you parked your car. Users would need to connect through the Vive Connect app to use any of these AI features. HTC hasn't mentioned what apps Vive Eagle will be compatible with, and since the smart glasses are currently only available in Taiwan, it's unclear what sort of compatibility we can expect if it ever makes its way to the U.S.

If the AI wasn't already a big copycat scheme, the smart glasses would be practically identical to the Ray-Bans in specs. HTC promised the Vive Eagle can do a full 4.5 hours of continuous music playback, and it should last more than 36 hours on standby on its 235mAh battery. Meta promises users should get up to four hours on the Ray-Bans with moderate usage. The larger Oakley Meta glasses promise a up to five hours of audio playback at 100% charge. HTC promises the Vive Eagle will charge from 0 to 50% in less than 10 minutes with fast charging through its glasses case.

VIVE Eagle 🕶️ announced!

Considering the specs and capabilities, HTC's biggest impediment will be price. It's currently asking for 15,600 new Taiwan dollars, or around $535. The device could cost less if HTC ever brings the Vive Eagle to the U.S., and even then it will face stiff competition. Some China-based companies are going hard into AR glasses, including ones with full screens housed in utterly massive frames. Other Ray-Ban Meta competitors, like these glasses from Xiaomi feature much longer battery life, closer to 8 hours of continuous music playback. Meta has still yet to release a rumored $1,000 pair of AR glasses codenamed “Hypernova” featuring a small heads-up display. We're still waiting to see what comes out of Android XR and Google's partnership with glasses maker Xreal.

HTC's last big product, the Vive Focus Vision, was an expensive $1,000 headset for PC VR with a dated VR-focused chipset and Fresnel lenses, an older style of lenses found on the $300 Meta Quest 3S that are considered worse than pancake lenses found on the $500 Meta Quest 3. If HTC really wants to compete with other big smart glasses makers, it needs to show us a product we truly haven't seen before—preferably at a lower price.

There's no such thing as ""too many buttons"" on a gaming mouser — or any mouse!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Most modern gaming mice these days have at least five buttons — left, right, center (scroll wheel), and two thumb buttons. Even ultralight, performance-focused mice that ditch frivolous features such as Bluetooth connectivity and RGB lighting, like Logitech's G Pro X Superlight 2 and Razer's Viper V3 Pro have at least five buttons (and if you count the DPI switch button on the bottom, they actually have six). It's safe to say the world has moved beyond thinking that a mere two or three mouse buttons is sufficient (I refuse to acknowledge any company that has ever thought that only one mouse button was enough).

But five (or six, technically) mouse buttons isn't enough, either, and most flagship, all-purpose gaming mice have more than the five (now) standard buttons. Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, for example, has 13 programmable controls, though not all of these are buttons (this number includes the tilt wheel, which allows you to remap the center, right, and left clicks, as well as the scroll up/down functions); so does Logitech's G 502X Plus.

You might be thinking, ""Surely, 13 programmable controls — or 11 programmable clicks, if we're not counting the scroll directions — is more than enough,"" but it's not — in fact, it's not much more than five or six, functionally speaking.

Saying these mice have 13 programmable controls is a bit disingenuous — while all of the buttons can technically be remapped, it's safe to say that almost nobody is going to remap the standard left and right primary buttons or the scroll function. They probably aren't even going to remap the two thumb buttons, which are mapped to MB4 and MB5 by default. And any buttons on the underside of the mouse might be remappable, but they're not usable mouse buttons in the midst of gaming (or anything). Once you take these buttons off the table, you're left with just a couple of actual extra buttons — both of these mice have a third ""trigger"" button in the thumb area (often used to temporarily slow down DPS for when you're lining up a tricky shot).

The Basilisk V3 Pro 35K has a couple of buttons above the tilt wheel, but these aren't particularly convenient for regular use, while the G 502X Plus has two side buttons along the edge of the mouse's primary button. So you really only get two or three ""extra"" mouse buttons, and that's if you include less convenient options and/or tilt wheel clicks.



But don't worry — there are mice with even more buttons. Specifically, mice like the Razer Naga V2 Pro, the Corsair Scimitar Elite SE Wireless, and the SteelSeries Aerox 9 Wireless, all of which have a 12-button side panel (or, well, the option of a 12-button side panel), for all your actual mouse button needs.

Mice with 12-button side panels are usually aimed at a particular niche of gaming: players of MMORPGs (e.g., The Elder Scrolls Online) and MOBAs (e.g., League of Legends). Both MMORPGs and MOBAs are about action and inventory management — you need a lot of hotkeys/mouse buttons to open up various menus and execute however many different types of attacks or skills the game allows for. Sure, you can use your keyboard — and, well, you'll have to, as there are far more hotkeys in any of these games than you can fit on a mouse — but many things are more convenient to do from your mouse (especially if it's a shortcut that can be set up as a macro), and it's just more efficient, in general, to have both hands in the game.

But you don't need to be playing an MMORPG or a MOBA for those extra mouse buttons to come in handy: not only do most games have at least some sort of inventory system that requires management — even if it's just swapping and/or reloading weapons — but there are plenty of other things you might need to do while gaming. There are also plenty of useful shortcuts that can be mapped to your mouse buttons for when you're not gaming at all — having 12 easily-accessible macro keys is fantastic for productivity, if you use them.

Plus, if you're using a multi-button mouse built by a mainstream gaming company, the supporting peripheral software will usually allow you to set up game- and app-based profiles that switch based on your current active window. This can be finicky, however — as most peripheral softwares is — so I prefer to map my mouse buttons to generic extra modifier keys (e.g., F13, F14, etc.) and assign specific actions in each game's in-game menu. This only works for actions that can be remapped within the game, of course — anything else, you'll need to map directly to the mouse.

You do a lot of walking/running when you're exploring large open-world games — a lot. MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls Online have an autorun feature — a hotkey that lets you toggle forward movement, so you can move without having to hold down the W key for hours. While it's usually bound to something obscure on the keyboard (or not bound at all) by default. I'm pretty sure binding ESO's autorun to one of my mouse buttons saved me from a repetitive stress injury.

Once you start using autorun, it's very frustrating to run up to an interactive character or object, only to have to find the interaction key on your keyboard (usually E, R, or F — conveniently close to the WASD movement keys, which you are no longer using). The only solution, of course, is to map that action to another mouse button, so you can now run up to things and interact with them without ever touching the keyboard. While you're at it, you may as well also map a third button to the Esc key — so you can also easily leave those interactions without touching the keyboard.

Many of the best gaming keyboards come with volume knobs (and other dedicated media controls) — but I don't have time to find and fiddle with a knob when my husband is trying to talk to me over my dogs barking. I usually assign two of the less-convenient buttons in the 12-button cluster to volume control (volume up and volume down, though you could also assign one button to mute. I don't use it so often that it needs to be foolproof, but I've never regretted mapping volume controls to my mouse.

The default screenshot hotkeys — Print Screen for Windows, and F12 for third-party apps like Steam and ReShade — are not in a particularly convenient location. Some might argue that lightning-quick screenshot-taking isn't a critical aspect of gameplay, but I beg to differ. You don't want to have to fumble across your keyboard to find the Print Screen button when the perfect Kodak moment pops up; you just want to be able to quickly hit a mouse button and keep going. And if you're using fancy camera tools like Frans Bouma's photomode mods, mapping your screenshot key to a mouse button is a must.

If you stream while playing games, or you play games while chatting with friends over voice chat — and especially if you do both at the same time — you're probably using either push-to-talk or a mute toggle to control who's hearing your audio, and when. Push-to-Talk and other microphone-related hotkeys are basically made to be mapped to your mouse, as talking is essentially a way to bypass typing. You can also map a hotkey for a game chat overlay to your mouse, but it's hard to avoid the keyboard in a text chat.

Okay, you can't avoid touching the keyboard forever. But you can make your keyboard significantly more efficient and one-handed by moving modifier keys — Ctrl, Fn, Shift... and the Windows key — to your mouse. Now, instead of having to use two hands to perform Fn shortcuts, you can hold down a mouse button with one hand and pump out those secondary keybinds like nobody's business.

Multiple mouse buttons aren't just convenient and efficient in games — they can make powerful productivity tools, and you can usually set up app-specific profiles similar to the gaming-specific profiles using peripheral software. Anyone who uses a complex, shortcut-heavy app — basically any photo-, video-, or sound-editing software — knows how useful it would be if you could perform some of those shortcuts with the click of a mouse button. The exact shortcuts you should program on your mouse depends, of course, on what you're doing — whether you need a shortcut to quickly change brush size and opacity, or you just need shortcuts to quickly move between tools.

The most frustrating thing about having a large, high-resolution screen — or multiple large, high-resolution screens — is managing windows and tabs (it's hard enough to just find your mouse with multiple screens). Mapping your mouse buttons to standard tab and window management keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl + Tab (to move to the next tab) or Ctrl + Shift + Tab (to move to the previous tab), or Ctrl + W (to close the current tab) can save you a lot of time and hassle, so long as you take the time to learn the buttons. (But you probably still don't want to start with the close tab shortcut — just in case.) Also, any task that requires you to either use a keyboard shortcut or find your mouse and move it very precisely somewhere on screen is worth considering (e.g. ""Show Desktop"").

Take a look at any gaming peripheral software and you'll see that there are several different types of keys and actions that can be mapped — some you may not have realized were options, and some you may not have wanted as options (I'm pretty sure Asus gives you the specific option of mapping Armoury Crate somewhere, as though anyone is so desperate for Armoury Crate that they'll dedicate an entire button to it (not to mention the fact that, if Armoury Crate isn't running, you probably won't be able to open it on an Asus-made peripheral until Armoury Crate is running). Just like you probably don't need to manually switch your Razer Chroma RGB lighting effects so often that you want to dedicate an entire mouse button to it — not even if you have a dozen mouse buttons.

More generally speaking, however, while it might seem neat that you can set a mouse button to open a program or a website for you, this is probably not all that useful in a gaming or productivity context, since you normally don't need to open a program more than... once or twice in a single session. You also probably don't need to map more than one DPI or profile switch button, as it usually makes sense to just cycle through those. Individual keys that aren't associated with shortcuts aren't terribly useful, either — but text strings, if used often enough, can definitely be worth it. One of my mouse buttons is programmed to type ""site:tomshardware.com "" — space included, for quick, site-specific searches, but other text strings that come to mind are those that contain unusual characters or punctuation. I do have one of my mouse buttons programmed to insert an em-dash, for the rare occasion that I'm using a keyboard without a numberpad.

I know plenty of people will insist that five or six buttons is more than enough, and that they wouldn't even know what to do with 12 buttons — let alone 19. All those buttons can be pretty intimidating, and it does take some time and experimentation to get a 19-button mouse set up perfectly, for you. But if you do put in the effort and take full advantage of how customizable gaming mice — and most peripherals, actually — are today, you'll quickly find that 19 buttons isn't nearly enough.

A history of pregnancy complications was associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke, particularly atherothrombotic stroke, a new cohort study showed. The risk was especially high among women with complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, small-for-gestational-age births, and preterm deliveries.

“Fortunately, the overall risk of stroke remains low. But we see that certain pregnancy problems can serve as an early warning,” co-investigator Frank-Erik de Leeuw, PhD, Radboud Institute of Medical Innovation, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, said in a press release.

“If doctors are aware of this medical history, they can start preventive care earlier,” de Leeuw added.

The study was led by Esmée Verburgt, Radboud Institute of Medical Innovation, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It was published online on August 6 in Neurology.

The study relied on self-reporting of pregnancy complications, which may have led to over- or underestimation of complication occurrence. The prospective recruitment of participants in the PRIDE study meant that some participants could potentially develop ischemic stroke at a young age during follow-up. Additionally, the study did not account for confounding cardiovascular risk factors.

The study was funded by Radboud University Medical Center, the Dutch Heart Foundation, and Vidi. The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

The Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation announces a significant advancement in addressing the fight against cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), a life-threatening syndrome responsible for over one-third of cancer-related deaths. Published in Cell, the study led by Dr. Aliesha O'Raw, Principal Investigator at the Institute, demonstrates that modulating the vagus nerve can effectively halt the progression of cachexia, enhance chemotherapy outcomes, and improve survival in preclinical models.

The study, titled ""Vagal Blockade of the Brain-Liver Axis Deters Cancer-Associated Cachexia,"" uncovers how cancer-induced systemic inflammation disrupts vagal tone, impairing communication along the brain-liver axis. This dysregulation leads to the depletion of HNF4α, a crucial transcription factor governing liver protein metabolism. The resulting hepatic dysfunction amplifies systemic inflammation, driving the cachectic symptoms that afflict many cancer patients.

By targeting the right cervical vagus nerve through surgical, chemical, electrical, or non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation methods, the research team successfully restored vagal function. This intervention reestablished normal liver metabolism, reduced systemic inflammation, and alleviated cachexia's clinical manifestations. Importantly, combining vagus nerve modulation with chemotherapy yielded synergistic effects, significantly improving health and survival outcomes in mouse models.

This research addresses a critical unmet need in oncology. Cachexia has long been a devastating complication for cancer patients. Dr. O'Raw's work not only uncovers the biological mechanisms at play but also presents a tangible intervention strategy with real potential to transform patient care.""

Dr. Ali Khademhosseini, Director and CEO, Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation

Dr. Aliesha O'Raw, Principal Investigator of the study, added, ""This research demonstrates how neuromodulation can reshape systemic metabolism and control inflammation. Targeting the vagus nerve is a promising therapeutic approach that could be translated into non-invasive treatments to alleviate cachexia and enhance cancer therapy outcomes.""

The study reveals the essential role of the brain-liver axis in cancer-associated cachexia and presents vagus nerve modulation as a practical, patient-accessible therapeutic strategy. This innovation paves the way for future clinical trials and could redefine cachexia management in oncology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mayo Clinic identifies cellular 'fountain of youth' in aging immune systems","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250814/Mayo-Clinic-identifies-cellular-fountain-of-youth-in-aging-immune-systems.aspx","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:02:00 GMT","

The immune system is meant to protect the body from infection and disease. But with age, it can become less capable of doing so. However, Mayo Clinic researchers have found that some older people maintain ""immune youth"" – a new term coined by Mayo researchers to explain a young immune system in someone over age 60.

We are studying why some individuals have a 'fountain of youth' in their immune systems. We want to learn from them.""

Cornelia Weyand, M.D., Ph.D., Mayo Clinic rheumatologist and clinician-scientist

She is a lead author on a perspective paper published in Nature Aging.

Dr. Weyand's research team discovered this cellular fountain of youth in more than 100 older patients who came to Mayo Clinic to receive treatment for an autoimmune disease that affects the arteries, including the aorta, called giant cell arteritis. Dr. Weyand and colleagues found in the diseased tissue of these patients specialized immune cells, called stem-like T cells. These immune cells behave like young stem cells that usually regenerate and aid healing and growth; but in this case, they were spreading the disease. This team of researchers also discovered autoimmune stem cells in humans previously.

""We observed that these patients have very young immune systems despite being in their 60s and 70s. But the price they pay for that is autoimmunity,"" she says.

Autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and organs.

In addition, the researchers saw that the immune checkpoint inhibitors that regulate the immune system were not working properly.

""Contrary to what one may think, there are benefits to having an immune system that ages in tandem with the body,"" says Jörg Goronzy, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic researcher on aging who is a co-lead author of the paper. ""We need to consider the price to pay for immune youthfulness. That price can be autoimmune disease.""

Immune aging is a sophisticated adaptation mechanism that the immune system can use to prevent autoimmune disease, say the researchers.

They are in the process of developing new diagnostic tests that will help find patients and healthy individuals who carry high numbers of immune stem cells and may be predisposed to autoimmune disease later in life. The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.

U.S. women's national soccer team legend and Connecticut native Alyssa Naeher is coming to Southern Connecticut State University for a live event.

The Stratford native and World Cup and Olympic champion will conduct an in-depth conversation moderated by sports broadcaster Christine Huber.

The event, set for Friday, Oct. 24, will take a behind-the-scenes look at Naeher's career and her impact on the game before she is honored ahead of the U.S. women's match against Portugal at Rentschler Field on Oct. 26. The first 2,000 fans who attend the game will also receive an Alyssa Naeher bobblehead.

Naeher will reflect on her journey from playing on soccer fields in Stratford to global recognition as one of the top goalkeepers in the world.

The 37-year-old retired from international competition last year after a decade-long career that included two FIFA Women's World Cup Championships (2015, 2019), an Olympic gold medal (Paris 2024), an Olympic bronze medal (Tokyo 2020), and being named The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper of the Year (2024).

She is still playing professionally in the NWSL however, with Chicago Stars FC.

The event will take place at the John Lyman Center for the Performing Arts on Southern's campus beginning at 7 p.m.

Ticket information can be found on SCSU's website.

USMNT defender Antonee Robinson will return “soon” from his knee injury but misses the start of the Premier League season, Fulham head coach Marco Silva has said.

The 28-year-old underwent surgery on his right knee following the conclusion of the 2024-25 season and entered a rehabilitation period in an attempt to be ready for the start of this campaign.

Robinson did not feature in any of Fulham's pre-season games and missed the United States team's run to the final of the Gold Cup this summer, where they were defeated 2-1 by Mexico.

“We had a situation last season with Antonee Robinson and he is still recovering,” Fulham head coach Marco Silva said on Thursday, ahead of his side's opening Premier League fixture at Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.

“Soon you are going to see him in contention for the games but this weekend is too early.”

Fulham will also be without Robinson's fellow left-back Ryan Sessegnon for the trip to the south-coast club.

“Ryan Sessegnon came out in the last game against Eintracht Frankfurt and we will see how he is,” Silva said. “We've got another session tomorrow and that is when we will take a decision.

“Apart from these two, everyone else is in contention for Brighton.”

Silva had said on Saturday, after his side's 1-0 friendly win over Eintracht Frankfurt, that Robinson was “not ready” to feature and would “take a little bit more time” to be match fit.

Robinson made 36 Premier League appearances last season and recorded 10 assists, the most of any defensive player. He has made 189 appearances for Fulham since joining the club from Wigan Athletic in August 2020.

Born in Milton Keynes, England, Robinson represents the U.S. internationally and has been capped 50 times, playing for the nation at the 2022 World Cup and the 2024 Copa America.

Fulham have made just one signing this summer, bringing in 34-year-old backup goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, arriving from Montpellier for less than £500,000 ($672,908).

“As a manager you always want to improve your squad, it's not the ideal scenario we are in, we have been too passive,” Silva said.

“Of course I didn't expect it [to be like this] but this is the market. The only good thing thing is we haven't got many injuries as in terms of depth we are very short in some positions.

“I didn't expect us to be this passive, I knew what I wanted and the plan was there but it hasn't happened. Right now we need to reinforce.”

Robinson hasn't featured for the USMNT since November 2024, and in that time one thing remains abundantly clear: Mauricio Pochettino does not have a clear first-choice alternative to Robinson at left back. He's been absent for the last four camps (a 12-match sample) under Pochettino, during which the Columbus Crew's Max Arfsten has been the most relied-upon alternative, appearing in nine of that dozen, most often as starter. John Tolkin, of recently relegated Holstein Kiel in Germany, has made five appearances, while Scally and DeJuan Jones have each appeared twice in the role. None have made a terribly compelling case for further looks.

If Robinson's recovery timetable will keep him out of the next international camp spanning from Sept. 1-9 (the fifth-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup), those speculative alternatives may get another chance to log starts and fortify their cases for inclusion. Pochettino and a fanbase starved for optimism will rightfully hope for a pleasant surprise. – Jeff Rueter

We've ranked the most iconic FIFA World Cup jerseys ever. From legendary winners to one-of-a-kind designs, these kits made history.

by Joe GonzálezEditor

Soccer kits are more than just uniforms; they are symbols of national pride, culture, and footballing history. Throughout the decades of the FIFA World Cup, certain jerseys have transcended their primary function to become iconic pieces of art and memory. Whether they are celebrated for their classic elegance, bold innovation, or the legendary moments they witnessed, these kits are instantly recognizable to fans worldwide. From the vintage charm of the 60s to the striking designs of the 90s, these are the most legendary World Cup kits to ever grace the beautiful game.

This iconic red away kit is synonymous with England's greatest footballing triumph. It's a classic, clean design with simple stripes on the sleeves. Sir Bobby Charlton, Gordon Banks, and Bobby Moore wore it as they lifted the World Cup on home soil, forever cementing its place in history.

The Mexico 1998 home kit was a bold, artistic statement. Featuring a striking Mayan calendar design sublimated into the green fabric, it was unlike anything seen before. The jersey represented a blend of cultural heritage and modern design, making it a fan favorite from that tournament.

A masterpiece of classic Italian style, the 1982 Azzurri kit is pure elegance. It's a clean, solid royal blue with the badge on the chest. Paolo Rossi wore it as he led Italy to a historic World Cup victory, and it remains a timeless classic.

The 1998 home kit was Croatia's debut World Cup kit, and it made an immediate impact. Its striking red-and-white checkerboard pattern was an instant hit. The team, led by Davor Šuker, wore it en route to a stunning third-place finish, putting the new nation on the global soccer map.

The Brazil 1994 kit combined the traditional Seleção style with a modern, oversized crest. Worn by stars like Romário and Bebeto, it became an icon of a triumphant era. The vibrant yellow and green jersey was on full display as Brazil won its fourth World Cup.

Germany's 1990 home kit is a legendary piece of design. Featuring a distinct geometric pattern of black, red, and yellow across the chest, it blended a bold style with national pride. It's the kit that Lothar Matthäus and Jürgen Klinsmann wore as they lifted the World Cup in Italy.

The France 1998 home kit is a symbol of a golden generation. Featuring a clean, dark blue design with subtle red and white stripes, it became the uniform of a nation united in victory. Zinedine Zidane and his teammates wore this jersey as they secured France's first-ever World Cup title.

The Peru 1970 kit is famous for its iconic red sash design across the white jersey. It's a simple yet powerful design that has been a staple of Peruvian kits ever since. It stands out as one of the most recognizable and aesthetically pleasing kits of all time.

The Netherlands 1974 kit is forever linked to the ""Total Football"" revolution. It was an all-orange masterpiece, often featuring black stripes. The kit became a symbol of style, innovation, and Johan Cruyff's mesmerizing genius, despite the team's loss in the final.

The USA's ""denim"" away kit from 1994 was a bold, polarizing choice. Its unique, tie-dyed look with a sublimated star pattern was a wild departure from traditional kits. It's remembered for being an iconic and unforgettable part of a tournament played on American soil.

Argentina's 1986 kit is inseparable from the genius of Diego Maradona. The famous light blue and white stripes were the backdrop for two of the most legendary goals ever scored. Maradona wore this jersey as he led his team to a glorious World Cup triumph.

The Brazil 1970 kit is arguably the most famous and beautiful in soccer history. Its vibrant yellow and blue colors are a symbol of beautiful football. This classic kit was worn by Pelé and the legendary Brazil squad that many consider to be the greatest team of all time.

Ben Shelton has won eight consecutive matches on the ATP Tour.

The 22-year-old American recently captured his first ATP Masters 1000 title at the Canadian Open, winning six matches in the process.

At the Cincinnati Open he has continued to impress, winning his first two rounds relatively comfortably.

Shelton made his second appearance at the Cincinnati Open in 2023, losing to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round.

Ahead of the tournament, Shelton discussed the relationship with father and coach Bryan Shelton, describing the ‘difficult part' about their collaboration.

Shelton was beginning to make his mark on the ATP Tour in 2023; showing frequent signs of the unlimited talent he possesses.

Ahead of the 2023 Cincinnati Open, Shelton discussed the relationship with his father, Bryan Shelton.

Bryan coached Ben during his time as the head coach of the University of Florida's men's tennis team. In 2023, he left the role to coach his son full-time.

Speaking to the Cincinnati Open media team, Ben said of his father: “I think the difficult part of having my dad as a coach was in college, navigating through him coaching 12 guys and one of them being his son and having to make a lineup.

“But now that we're out on tour I think things have been a lot easier. I wasn't really ever a top junior or even the top recruit going to college in my class.

“I feel like he's the one guy who always believed in me, even when maybe others didn't or didn't know that I had potential to be a professional tennis player or make it on tour.

“I'm really enjoying it. I love being out here and I love competing. That's my favourite part about tennis, being able to compete one-on-one against somebody.

“So I still have the same love that I had a year ago, two years ago, always.”

Ben Shelton's coach, Bryan Shelton, is an American former professional tennis player who reached a career high of 55 in 1992. He also reached number 52 in doubles.

Shelton, who competed professionally between 1989 and 1997, won two career titles during his career. In 1991, he became the first African-American man to win an ATP Tour singles title since Arthur Ashe in 1978.

After his playing career, Shelton delved into coaching. From 1998 to 1999 he was the United States Tennis Association (USTA) National Coach.

Shelton became a Georgia Tech legend during his extensive tenure coaching the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets women's tennis team. Under his guidance, the team won their first NCAA-recognised team championship in 2007. Shelton was also named ACC Coach of the Year in 2002, 2005 and 2007. He was also named as the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Coach of the Year for 2007.

Shelton started coaching the University of Florida's men's tennis team in 2012, before going on to coach his son, Ben, on a full-time basis from June 2023.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner is showing no signs of slowing down in Cincinnati and has reached his second consecutive quarterfinal at the ATP Masters 1000 event. 

The defending champion defeated Adrian Mannarino in the fourth round, 6-4, 7-6, to set up a third career clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who he has never beaten. 

Following Sinner's Wimbledon triumph, he has kicked off his North American hard-court swing in convincing fashion, having earned straight-set victories over Daniel Elahi Galan, Gabriel Diallo, and Mannarino. 

As he continues his pursuit of back-to-back Cincinnati Open titles, the world number one's winning streak on his preferred surface now ranks among some of the greats of the game. 

Sinner has not lost a match on hard court since last October at the China Open, where he fell to his rival Carlos Alcaraz in the final. 

Since then, he has picked up 24 consecutive wins, emerging victorious at the Shanghai Masters, the ATP Finals, and the Australian Open. 

His tally ranks seventh since 2000, trailing just behind the ‘big four' of the previous generation. 

Longest ATP hard court winning streaks since 2000: Federer, 56, 2005-06Federer, 35, 2006-07Djokovic, 35, 2010-11Djokovic, 29, 2019-20Murray, 28, 2016-17Djokovic, 26, 2013-14Federer, 26, 2004-05Nadal, 26, 2013-14@janniksin, 24, 2024-25 🙌#CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/lplidpSfK9

Should he go on to win the title in Cincinnati, he will increase his streak to 27, surpassing totals once recorded by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. 

A successful US Open title defence would see him reach 34 consecutive tour-level hard-court wins. 

Federer had the longest hard-court winning streak of the Open Era, tallying 56 victories from February 2005 to February 2006.

After losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open in 2005, the Swiss star went on to win in Rotterdam and Dubai, before securing both the Indian Wells Open and the Miami Open.

To finish the season, he clinched the Cincinnati Open title, the US Open championship, and won in Bangkok. 

In 2006, Federer won the Qatar Open in Doha and then hoisted the Australian Open trophy for the second time.

He finally lost at the Dubai Tennis Championships in the final, falling to Nadal in three sets. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The US Open mixed doubles week will soon enthrall tennis fans with an amazing showcase featuring some of the biggest names from ATP and WTA. While stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Taylor Fritz, Elena Rybakina, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro are just some of the names looking toward the lucrative $1 million glory, fans were also hoping to see three-time slam queen and World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka on court. The Belarusian, however, has other plans.

Sabalenka snatched an easy win on Wednesday evening at the ongoing Cincinnati Open. In the R16, she bested Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro with a score of 6-1, 7-5 in an hour and 20 minutes. With that, the Belarusian has kept her hopes alive to defend her title from last season at the WTA 1000 event. But it was her post-match reaction that ended up catching more attention. During the on-court interview, she was asked about her plans to appear at the US Open mixed doubles event.

The World No.1 simply rejected the idea. Why? For the uninitiated, Sabalenka was supposed to play the mixed doubles campaign in New York with Bulgarian ATP pro Grigor Dimitrov. Unfortunately, the latter withdrew from the US Open recently owing to a pectoral injury he sustained during Wimbledon last month, playing against Jannik Sinner in the fourth round. Seems like Sabalenka made up her mind to play alongside Dimitrov. But now that he's not there, she sees no point in competing in the mixed doubles format. Proving her loyalty to Dimitrov, she simply responded, “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.”

New:

WTA #1 Aryna Sabalenka says she does not plan on playing US Open mixed doubles with a new partner after her original partner Grigor Dimitrov pulled out, mentioning being “loyal” to Dimitrov.

“Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.”

Probably that's another reason why Sabalenka's name wasn't there in the confirmed list of pairs released last month. Simply put, fans will only get to see her at the Flushing Meadows during the singles campaign.

Speaking of which, she's looking solid already to enter New York in a stable form, especially given her ongoing streak in Cincinnati. However, Sabalenka is going to face a tough challenge ahead when she steps on the court for her quarterfinal battle.

Similar to Aryna Sabalenka, Kazakh tennis star Elena Rybakina's got a hard-hitting playing style too. Both tend to hit the ball with brute force, which makes for an intense clash whenever they are up against each other. Take, for example, their recent meeting in Berlin.

Two months ago, Sabalenka faced Rybakina in the quarterfinals at the Berlin Open on grass. It was a cliffhanger, to say the least. The Belarusian had to struggle to snatch the first set in a thrilling tie-break. Rybakina then leveled the score with a win in the second set. Then in the decider, she gave the World No.1 a run for her money. In a very close battle, Sabalenka somehow managed to emerge victorious with a final scoreline of 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(6).

Is Sabalenka's loyalty to Dimitrov admirable or a missed opportunity for US Open mixed doubles glory?

Debate

Sharing her honest reaction after escaping Rybakina, the Belarusian confessed, “Elena, she's a great player and we've had a lot of tough battles … I have no idea how I was able to win those last points. I think I just got lucky, to be honest,” reported WTA's website in June. Yes, she's leading 7-4 in the H2H battle, but Sabalenka knows how tough it becomes for her every time to get past the 2022 Wimbledon champion. Rybakina, on the other hand, is coming off her R16 win against 2025 Australian Open queen Madison Keys. She bested the American in a three-setter, after pulling off a comeback with a final score line of 6-7, 6-4, 6-2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Aryna Sabalenka pulls out of US Open event after team-mate hospitalised","https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2095192/Aryna-Sabalenka-US-Open-mixed-doubles-Grigor-Dimitrov","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 08:01:00 GMT","



Aryna Sabalenka has confirmed that she will not be playing mixed doubles at the US Open next month as she is staying ‘loyal' to Grigor Dimitrov. The women's world No. 1 was set to join forces with the Bulgarian but has been forced to abandon those plans as he is currently sidelined through injury.

Sabalenka will head to Flushing Meadows as the reigning women's singles champion, and she looked set to take aim at completing a hat-trick of successes at the competition – having won the women's doubles title in 2019 with Elise Mertens.

However, she felt that there was never a right time to bid for glory on that front until the recent format changes – which includes shorter matches and the competition itself taking place prior to the singles draw.

But Sabalenka will now have to wait until 2026 to take aim at the mixed doubles as she has vowed not to compete this year as Dimitrov is injured. The 34-year-old was hospitalised at Wimbledon last month when he led Jannik Sinner by two sets to love in a gruelling clash.

The pectoral muscle issue is still causing Dimitrov problems and he has been forced to withdraw from competing at the US Open as a result, putting an end to his run of playing at 58 consecutive majors.

Sabalenka has been offered the chance to compete alongside other players, but he shut down that talk, saying: “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.” Pressed on why she won't opt for a new partner, the 27-year-old insisted that she wanted to stay ‘loyal' to Dimitrov, who was the driving force behind the original plans.

The duo had teamed up previously at the 2022 World Tennis League exhibition tournament in Dubai, and although they tasted defeat that day, Dimitrov was keen to make amends at Flushing Meadows.

Speaking about how the plans were formed to tennis.com, Sabalenka explained: “He was texting me, non-stop, begging me to play,” Sabalenka exclaimed with a laugh after advancing at the Berlin Tennis Open. “I was like, ‘Man, I don't want to play.' But he was begging and I was like, ‘Ok, you got it.'”

Matteo Berrettini has withdrawn from the US Open due to injury.

The Italian has not competed since the first round at Wimbledon in June, when he lost to Poland's Kamil Majchrzak in five sets. The Italian did not play at Roland Garros earlier this year due to a right oblique injury and has now missed seven majors in the past four years.

Berrettini's best result in New York came in 2019 when he advanced to the semi-finals. The 29-year-old, currently No. 59 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is 13-11, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, in 2025. His best result this season came in Miami, where he reached the quarter-finals.
Berrettini is the second former Top 10 player to withdraw from the hard-court major this week after Grigor Dimitrov withdrew Tuesday, snapping a 58-major streak. Brandon Holt is into the main draw and the tournament organisers have reallocated the American's wild card to Eliot Spizzirri.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","He pulled off one of the biggest upsets in US Open history by beating Roger Federer but then he lost in the next round","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/features/he-pulled-off-one-of-the-biggest-upsets-in-us-open-history-by-beating-roger-federer-but-then-he-lost-in-the-next-round/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 19:30:00 GMT","

Roger Federer's 2018 season marked the last year he would lift a Grand Slam title, having emerged victorious in the Australian Open final against Marin Cilic. 

Federer tore through the draw in Melbourne that year, advancing to the championship match without dropping a set, before finally clinching his 20th major crown, a record that would last until 2020. 

After opting to skip the entire clay-court season, the Swiss legend then looked to defend his title at Wimbledon, but lost to Kevin Anderson in the quarterfinals. 

Heading into the US Open that year, Federer was aiming to win the championship at Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2008, but would go on to suffer an enormous upset.

He won his first two matches in New York comfortably, earning straight-set victories over Yoshihito Nishioka and Benoit Paire.

In the third round, Federer met 30th seed Nick Kyrgios and picked up a fifth straight win over the Australian on Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

His fourth round opponent came in the form of Kyrgios' unseeded compatriot, John Millman, who, on paper, should have been a much easier test. 

Federer took the first set against Millman 6-3, and appeared to be well on his way to a fourth consecutive quarterfinal at the US Open. 

The Brisbane-born star refused to roll over, however, and in one of the biggest shocks in the tournament's history, fought back to take the next three sets and win the match. 

It was the biggest result of Millman's career, who had never beaten a top ten player prior to his clash with Federer. 

Unfortunately for the former world number 33, he went on to lose in straight sets to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the last eight. 

After Millman's quarterfinal exit to Djokovic, he struggled to emulate his 2018 US Open performance at future Grand Slams.

In 2019 and 2020, his best results were third-round finishes at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, and in 2021, he failed to make it past the first round at any major.  

Following more disappointing results in 2022, Millman appeared in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the last time in 2023, making it to the second round again at his home major. 

In 2024, he retired from tennis after failing to qualify for the Australian Open for the first time since 2012. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","The advice Daniil Medvedev gave Terence Atmane at the net after their match at the 2024 Australian Open","https://tennishead.net/the-advice-daniil-medvedev-gave-terence-atmane-at-the-net-after-their-match-at-the-2024-australian-open/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

Terence Atmane's fairy-tale story has continued.

The Frenchman, ranked 136 in the world, has produced four spirited main draw performances to reach the first Masters 1000 quarter-final of his career at the Cincinnati Open.

Atmane, who also won two rounds of qualifying, stunned Taylor Fritz on Wednesday evening, winning 3-6 7-5 6-3.

The 23-year-old has also defeated Joao Fonseca and Flavio Cobolli on his way to the last eight.

Atmane made his Grand Slam main draw debut as a qualifier at the Australian Open. The Frenchman faced a tricky first-round opponent: former world number one Daniil Medvedev.

At the 2024 Australian Open, young Terence Atmane was handed a daunting task against Daniil Medvedev after winning three rounds of qualifying.

Atmane stunned Medvedev in the first set, winning it 7-5. However the Russian fought back, taking the next two sets 6-2 6-4.

Unfortunately, the Frenchman was forced to retire at 0-1 in the fourth set.

Speaking to the ATP Tour in May, Atmane revealed the advice Daniil Medvedev offered him at the net after their clash in Australia.

Atmane said: “He was telling me, ‘keep going, because you are unplayable'. 

It was something like that — I don't remember exactly — but it was something like ‘unplayable.'

“And then after, he mentioned in the interview, ‘yeah, that guy played like Top 20 for three sets'. He gave me big confidence. Daniil wasn't someone I knew from before.”

Terence Atmane's task has become no less difficult after defeating Taylor Fritz. The 23-year-old faces Danish star Holger Rune in the Cincinnati Open quarter-finals.

Rune, who defeated Frances Tiafoe in the round of 16, appears to have kicked into form after working with Andre Agassi at the Washington Open. 

The Dane appears to have rediscovered some form after some mid-season struggles. He was recently branded ‘immature' before losing in the Wimbledon first round.

The winner of Rune and Atmane will face Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semi-finals.

Dabrowski and Routliffe had six aces to McNally and Noskova's one, and only three double faults to their opponents' seven.

Coco Gauff returned to her second Cincinnati Open quarterfinal with a straight-sets win over Lucia Bronzetti, while Jasmine Paolini advanced past an ailing Barbora Krejcikova.

No. 2 seed Coco Gauff booked her place in her second Cincinnati Open quarterfinal with a 6-2, 6-4 defeat of Lucia Bronzetti in 1 hour and 19 minutes.

Cincinnati: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Gauff had received a third-round walkover from Dayana Yastremska, meaning it had been four days since her last competitive match, a straight-sets win over Wang Xinyu in the second round. But the 2023 champion showed little sign of rust as she reached the last eight of a tournament for the first time since claiming her second major title at Roland Garros.

Gauff advances to her fifth quarterfinal at WTA 1000 or Grand Slam level in 2025 out of 10 tournaments, and improves to 2-0 overall against Bronzetti. She will next face No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini, who defeated an ailing Barbora Krejcikova 6-1, 6-2 in 1 hour and 11 minutes.

In the pair's first meeting since the 2024 Wimbledon final, Krejcikova received medical treatment on her left foot trailing 3-0 in the second set, and the Czech's movement was visibly hampered.

""I think she wasn't at 100%, but she's an unbelievable player,"" Paolini said afterwards. ""She can put the ball wherever she wants every time, I don't know how she does this. But I'm happy that I tried to stay there mentally until the last point.""

Friday's quarterfinal will be the fifth meeting between Gauff and Paolini, and their second encounter in Cincinnati: Gauff defeated the Italian 6-3, 6-2 in the 2023 quarterfinals. Gauff won their first two contests, both on hard courts, but this year Paolini has levelled the head-to-head with two victories on clay.

Solid stats for Gauff: Despite reaching the fourth round in Montreal last week, Gauff's run in Canada was notable for the reappearance of the serving yips that have come and gone throughout her career: she tallied 43 double faults in three matches. Eight had followed against Wang in her Cincinnati opener, and she committed another just two points into her match against Bronzetti.

But that, largely, was that. Gauff committed just three double faults overall -- her lowest total in a single match since the two she hit against Lois Boisson in the Roland Garros semifinals. She won 63% of her first-serve points, but also a tidy 58% of her second-serve points, and struck 23 winners to Bronzetti's seven.

No. 61-ranked Bronzetti's ability to draw out points had earned her two upsets of seeds, Daria Kasatkina and Jelena Ostapenko, to make the last 16. But the strategy met its match in Gauff, who paired superior grinding ability with patient point construction to finish rallies on her own terms.

""For the most part I played aggressive,"" Gauff said in her on-court interview. ""Maybe got a little passive in some of those games. But it's tough -- the balls are super light and they fly, and she wasn't giving me much pace, so I was just trying to play controlled but also aggressive.""

Coco Gauff returned to her second Cincinnati Open quarterfinal with a straight-sets win over Lucia Bronzetti, while Jasmine Paolini advanced past an ailing Barbora Krejcikova.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

Tom Holland swaps webs for wheels, from waving Monaco's chequered flag, grinning in a Williams at Silverstone, and cheering Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris like Britain's biggest Formula 1 superfan.

Tom Holland might be best known for swinging through New York on the big screen as Spider Man, but away from the Marvel Universe, he's also a passionate Formula 1 fan.

Holland first stepped into the paddock at the 2019 British Grand Prix, and since then has become a familiar face at races from the glamour of the grid in Monaco to a rain-soaked Silverstone.

Here's everything you need to know about the biggest F1 fan in the spider-verse...

Born: 1 June 1996
Claim to Fame: From the West End's Billy Elliot to Hollywood's Spider-Man
Off-Track Life: Shares the spotlight (and plenty of red carpets) with co-star and partner Zendaya.
Fun Fact: Those superhero stunts? All thanks to years of gymnastics training.

1 / 5

Holland visits the Red Bull garage with ex-footballer Neymar

Holland's admiration for Lewis Hamilton is no secret. “He is setting an example for so many people around the world,” he said in an interview with BlackTree TV, noting the Ferrari driver's ability to combine competitive brilliance with personal grace. When he has been asked who he's backing on race day? “Lewis. Always!”

His other favourite Brit? McLaren's Lando Norris. A driver his looks have been compared to so often that he's in on the joke. When asked about a potential collab, “I'm sure there is something like that in the works already,” he teased to On Demand Entertainment. Cue speculation about Twitch streams, a buddy comedy, or the best PR stunt in F1 history.

Waving the chequered flag at Monaco 2023

Holland lived every fan's dream when he waved the chequered flag at F1's most glamorous race. At first, he handled it like a pro, as if he's been training for this moment for years, but then his enthusiastic style became a bit wild – but it was still an undoubtedly iconic moment from the Brit. His verdict on the sought after opportunity? “Unlike anything!”

Silverstone cockpit thrill

Not even rain could dampen his spirits at the 2025 British Grand Prix. After cheering on pal Lewis Hamilton, Holland climbed into a Williams F1 cockpit with palpable excitement.

McLaren plays the Spider-Man theme song

While strolling through the paddock at the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix, Holland was greeted by McLaren blasting the classic Spider-Man theme song as he walked past.

He's all in for the split-second strategy calls, the wheel-to-wheel battles, and the grid's easy camaraderie, maybe even using those Spidey senses to know when the action's about to hit. He's not just a celebrity in the paddock; he's one of us… just with a super-powered day job.

Writer-director Bryan Bertino's feature will premiere at Fantastic Fest after having previously been slated to hit theaters earlier this year.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	The Dakota Fanning-led horror movie Vicious is set to debut via streaming later this year after it was previously removed from Paramount Pictures‘ theatrical release calendar. 


	Writer-director Bryan Bertino's feature will premiere at Fantastic Fest in Austin next month before its release on Paramount+ and digital formats Oct. 10. Kathryn Hunter, Mary McCormack, Rachel Blanchard, Devyn Nekoda, Klea Scott and Emily Mitchell round out the cast. 




Vicious centers on Polly (Fanning), who receives a gift from a late-night visitor and becomes trapped in a world where reality is not what it seems.

	The film had initially been scheduled to hit theaters in August of this year, before its theatrical release was moved up to Feb. 28, 2025. Late last year, the studio took the project off of its calendar amid a search for a better date for the film.


	Other features that were announced Thursday as set to premiere at Fantastic Fest include Paramount's Primate, Sony's Sisu: Road to Revenge, Universal's Black Phone 2 and Lionsgate's The Strangers — Chapter 2.


	A movie shifting its release from theatrical to a purely streaming launch has become less trendy in Hollywood of late, as studios have benefited from the attention that a project can get from hitting theaters. For example, Universal's video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy's was released day-and-date on Peacock and in theaters in 2023, while the forthcoming sequel will debut exclusively in theaters later this year.


	The decision to debut Vicious on the streamer was made by the previous Paramount regime, prior to its recent Skydance merger, with the aim of giving viewers an at-home option ahead of Halloween.

	











	Fanning's recent credits include such features as The Watchers and The Equalizer 3, along with the series Ripley and The Perfect Couple. 


	Bertino is known for writing and directing the 2008 horror film The Strangers, starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman.

The singer's album reveal and interview on 'New Heights' nearly ""broke the internet."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Look out, Joe Rogan.


	The latest episode of Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast New Heights exploded in popularity thanks to the duo's in-depth interview with Taylor Swift. The pop mogul announced her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and gave what might be her longest and most candid interview ever, clocking in at more than two hours.




	Wednesday's episode (watch it below) has already racked up more than 10 million views on YouTube in less than 20 hours. The episode is already the most popular episode of the podcast ever, surpassing the previous No. 1, which had Jason's spouse and podcaster Kylie Kelce as the guest. And this doesn't count all the other ways a fan could consume the podcast. A representative for Spotify said the episode generated a 3,000 percent increase in new listeners for New Heights, and the number of female listeners jumped 618 percent.

	Comparing the YouTube views to podcast king Joe Rogan, the Taylor Swift episode would currently rank around the 50th most popular Rogan episode ever. Rogan's biggest episode on YouTube was a discussion about UFOs with Bob Lazar and Jeremy Corbell (64 million views), followed by Rogan's interview with Donald Trump last fall (59 million). New Heights often ranks as a Top 10 podcast, while Rogan's JRE is often No. 1, and it will be interesting to see if Heights moves into the top spot for a week, especially since the Swift episode is still racking up views.

	The numbers also come despite the live stream seemingly crashing near the end of the podcast around the time when Swift pulled out her new album cover to show her fans. “We hit a glitch but will be back shortly” the New Heights X account posted before later tweeting, “Shoutout all the 92%ers and Swifties for actually helping us break the internet.” Oddly enough, WNBA star and Swift fan Caitlin Clark predicted, “Are we sure YouTube isn't going to crash tonight?” Yet a spokesperson for YouTube tells THR that the problem actually wasn't on their end.


	Among the revelations on the podcast: Swift collaborated with Sabrina Carpenter for a track. Also, after years of collaborating with Jack Antonoff, Swift has reunited with hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback, who previously worked with Swift on hits like “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off” — suggesting the album will feel more pop-driven rather than the more downbeat and minimalist style of her recent work.


	“It just comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life,” Swift said on the podcast.


	Swift also announced on the podcast that the new 12-track album will be released Oct. 3.

The singer revealed the details of her upcoming 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, on the Aug. 13 show.

	Gil Kaufman



	Like many era-defining pop stars, Taylor Swift makes history everywhere she goes and with just about everything she does. Take, for example, her first visit to boyfriend Travis Kelce‘s New Heights podcast on Wednesday night (Aug. 13). While the weekly show the Kansas City tight end cohosts with his retired NFL sibling Jason Kelce regularly gets anywhere from 12,000 to nearly 300,000 views on YouTube for their genial sports talk, the figures for Swift's pop-in are already, predictably, off the charts.

	











	As of 1:45 p.m. ET on Thursday (Aug. 14) — just 17 hours after its debut — the two-hour Swift episode had more than 10.8 million views, easily besting the second-most popular episode of the show to date, an 8 million view 2024 chat with Jason's wife, Kylie Kelce, as well as nearly doubling the views for a 2023 chat with Travis' Super Bowl-winning teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The figures on Spotify are equally gaudy, with the streamer reporting on Thursday that Swift's New Heights appearance has already become one of the top-performing podcast episodes of the past 12 months. According to Spotify, based on an average of the previous five episodes, the Swift chat brought a 3,000% increase in new listeners to the show, as well as spiking an overall 2,500% increase in average streams of the episode and a 1,100% jump in tune in around 8:45 p.m. ET, which was an hour and 45 minutes into the show.

	











	Not surprisingly, Swift also helped increase female listenership to New Heights, with Spotify saying that the number of females tuning in is already tracking 618% higher than the average for the previous five shows on its first day of release. That figure becomes even wilder when you consider that female listeners already made up the majority (58%) of New Heights listeners.


	The already popular podcast that has nearly three million subscribers on YouTube got a major boost when Swift visited to reveal the details of her upcoming 12th album, which is due out on Oct. 3 and features a collab with former Eras Tour opening act Sabrina Carpenter on the title track. The LP is produced by Max Martin and Shellback, the dynamic studio duo behind some of her biggest hits from albums such as 1989 and Reputation.


	Swift, who rarely does sit-down interviews, once again proved to be the ultimate master of her album rollout narrative on New Heights, which racked up nearly 9 million views within its first 12 hours on YouTube, with The New York Times reporting that 1.3 million people tuned in simultaneously to a livestream of the episode before the crowd crush caused a brief technical glitch.


	In a comparison likely to further stoke the ire of Donald Trump — who earlier this month said he “CAN'T STAND” Swift after earlier saying he “HATES” the singer — the Times noted that, by comparison, an October episode of the very popular Joe Rogan Experience pod featuring then-candidate Trump hit around 11 million views in its first 12 hours on YouTube. CNN added that the 1.3 million Swift figure nearly doubled the 800,000 people who watched Trump's Rogan appearance in the first hour of that October show.

	











	Even the Kelces were not immune to the number numbness, with the show's X account shouting out the fans for helping them “break the internet” amid the technical glitches, Travis posting a happy dance video when it came back online and Jason adding that the 1.3 million figure is just “the epitome of numerology” given Swift's career-long obsession with the number 13.


	At press time, the nearly three-hour Rogan chat with Elon Musk in 2018 is among the most viewed ever on YouTube, with more than 69 million views, though CNN host Kate Bouldan predicted that Swift's New Heights episode is already on its way to becoming “one of the most watched podcasts of all time.”

Trump, who will be the first president to host the awards show, announced this year's honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13).

KISS felt like shouting out loud when Donald Trump revealed that they would be among the this year's Kennedy Center Honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13). The (allegedly) retired greasepaint rockers known for such beloved jams as “Love Gun,” “Black Diamond” and “Christine Sixteen” made the cut along with country icon George Strait, Broadway star Michael Crawford, disco singer Gloria Gaynor and Rocky/Rambo actor Sylvester Stallone.

	











	Trump said he was deeply involved in the selection process this year — including his plans to become the first U.S. president to host the show — and the choice of KISS is interesting given the president's well-known aversion to anyone critical of him.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Despite previously disagreeing with Trump's actions during his first term, in quotes first reported by TMZ, the band's members were reportedly joyful about joining the ranks of such past Kennedy Center icons as Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Stevie Wonder and Garth Brooks, among many others.


	“KISS is the embodiment of the American dream,” said bassist/singer Gene Simmons in the statements confirmed to Billboard by the band's reps. “We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.”


	Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley added, “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off. The prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.”

	











	Former guitarist Ace Frehley called it a “dream come true that I never thought would materialize” and former drummer Peter Criss said, “I feel so blessed. This is the greatest honor of our career.”


	Trump was the first president to never attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala during his first term and until recently he had never taken in a single program at the beloved D.C. arts center.


	The choice of sometime critics KISS is interesting because it comes a week after Trump unexpectedly fired the head of the non-partisan, technocratic Bureau of Labor Statistics after it released a jobs report he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged” to make him look bad.


	Simmons — who got fired by Trump in week three of the first season of the The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 — initially praised the president before he first won the White House. The rocker known for his entrepreneurial acumen called Trump the “truest political animal I've ever seen onstage,” lauding the former reality TV star for not having speechwriters and being “good for the political system. 


	He changed his tune a short time later.


	The band turned down a reported invitation to play Trump's first inauguration and by the time Trump lost his second bid for office to President Joe Biden in 2020, Simmons had a very different view. “I knew him before he entered politics. Look what that gentleman did to this country and the polarization – got all the cockroaches to rise to the top. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it's all out in the open because he allowed it,” Simmons said to Spin in May 2022.


	Simmons told the magazine that the two knew each other before the Apprentice from hanging around the same nightclubs, but that being president is a very different job than hosting a game show. “You have a different responsibility when you're just a citizen or an entrepreneur. You don't make policy,” he said. “It doesn't affect life and death. When you get into a position of power, it does affect lives. I don't think he's a Republican or a Democrat. He's out for himself, any way you can get there. And in the last election, over 70 million people bought it hook, line and sinker.”

	











	Similarly, Stanley tweeted in Jan. 2021 that Trump's refusal to accept the results of the previous year's election loss was “ABHORRENT. A true danger to our democracy. The issue isn't that it WON'T work. It's Mob Boss behavior and politicians putting party over audits, investigations, court rulings & COUNTRY in an effort to overrule the will of American voters.”


	Stanley also referred to the violent horde of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “TERRORISTS,” calling the assault an “armed insurrection” by a mob who were all pardoned when Trump took office again earlier this year. The singer also noted back then that the “flames were fanned today & over time by the president [Trump] & specific senators who CANNOT be allowed now to distance from or denounce what they have directly caused. Know their names. THIS is the result of their deception. Shame.”


	The Trump-hosted 2025 Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS in December.

Associate Editor, TV


Boyd Holbrook (A Complete Unknown, Narcos) has been cast in the new Netflix series Extraction, starring opposite Omar Sy.


	The show is set in the world of the action thriller movie franchise of the same name, to be helmed by showrunner, writer, and executive producer Glen Mazzara and executive produced by Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's AGBO.


	In the 8-episode action-packed thriller Extraction, a mercenary (Omar Sy) embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds. Extraction explores the trauma, betrayal, and moral conflicts of characters pushed to the edge.

	This is the second time Netflix has extended a successful original movie franchise into a TV series. It's To All the Boys I've Loved Before film trilogy spawned a hit comedy series, XO, Kitty, which was recently renewed for a third season. In the opposite direction, the streamer has a Peaky Blinders movie coming up based on the popular TV series.


	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Chris Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast returning. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held.


	AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.


	Holbrook most recently played The Corinthian in Netflix's The Sandman and Clement Mansell in FX's Justified: City Primeval. Up next, he will play Brodie in the Apple TV+ series The Morning Show. On the big screen, he starred as Johnny Cash in James Mangold's Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown. He also just completed work on the film Atonement, which follows a troubled Marine who seeks to reconcile with the survivors of an Iraqi family he and his unit fired on back in 2003. Additional credits include the Jeff Nichols feature The Bikeriders and James Mangold's Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny. Holbrook is repped by WME, Range Media Partners, and Yorn, Levine, Barnes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Tom Cruise reportedly too busy to receive Kennedy Center Honor from Trump","https://www.avclub.com/tom-cruise-kennedy-center-honors-scheduling-conflicts","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:44:00 GMT","

Tom Cruise has never had any issues jumping out of planes or riding motorcycles off cliffs, but boring old “scheduling conflicts” are apparently something even he can't conquer. According to The Washington Post, Cruise was offered one of the Kennedy Center Honors that Donald Trump announced yesterday, but declined due to said scheduling conflicts. Former and current Kennedy Center employees speaking to the outlet did not disclose any specifics on those scheduling conflicts or any other reasons why Cruise might have declined. Considering the man could likely skydive in for the ceremony and be back wherever he needed to be for dessert, however, they must be pretty binding.

There is, of course, the matter of the ceremony's host—self-appointed Kennedy Center chairman Donald Trump. Cruise has remained largely tight-lipped on the country's current political hellscape. He even dodged a question about his favorite topic—movies—at a Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning press conference earlier this year, per Variety. When a reporter asked the actor to comment on Trump's proposed movie tariffs, Cruise responded by saying that  “we'd rather answer questions about the movie.” 

The final honoree list, all of whom apparently had some free time on their calendar, includes Kiss, Michael Crawford, George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, and Gloria Gaynor. It does not include Trump himself, although the president did say, “Next year we'll honor Trump, okay?” after whining about how he'd never gotten the offer before. He presumably does have this type of power, as he said he was “about 98% involved” in the selection of this year's honorees.

The president also made a big show of saying how much he really didn't want to host the Honors before announcing that he was taking one for the team and doing it anyway at his unveiling of the honoree class yesterday. Not everyone was so unenthusiastic about his role as emcee, however. In a guest monologue on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, comedian Nicole Byer said she was actually glad Trump was hosting the ceremony. “Let him host the Emmys, the Grammys, a podcast with Theo Von. He could be the host out of Applebee's!” she elaborated. “Anything that distracts him from running this country into the ground.”

This week on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, it's Muppet Babies TOS! So congrats to Spock, Chapel, Uhura, and Scotty—and sorry to Dr. M'Benga, whose status as a minor player on The Original Series apparently doesn't qualify him for the mission. After a season that has riffed on action epics, wedding comedies, zombies, 1960s detective stories, and Tomb Raider-style puzzles, this is yet another zippy action hour. To its credit, this one comes with a harrowing historical twist and a moral lesson too. That said, it also has me wondering about the limits of what Strange New Worlds has to offer to the Trek canon.   

Before we get into that, however, let's start with our leading man of the week. This TOS preview hinges on the return of Paul Wesley's James T. Kirk in his first non-Shatner-spoofing appearance of the season. I've always found Wesley to be quite a fun addition to this early Trek universe, even if his Kirk doesn't really remind me of the original flavor. (If anything, Anson Mount is the one channeling Shatner's affable Kirk charisma.) Although given how often Strange New Worlds deploys Wesley in alternate-universe scenarios like the holodeck mystery in “A Space Adventure Hour,” it can be hard to remember just how little time we've actually spent with his “real Kirk” these past three seasons. 

For a quick recap: We met alt versions of James Tiberius in both “A Quality Of Mercy” (a.k.a. the “Balance Of Terror” riff) and “Tomorrow And Tomorrow And Tomorrow” (a.k.a. the La'An in Toronto episode) before we finally met the real thing in “Lost In Translation” (a.k.a. the installment where he helps Uhura process her hallucinations of Hemmer). Since then, he's only appeared in the musical episode, where he spent a week shadowing the Enterprise ahead of taking his new commission as First Office of the USS Farragut. (Remember when he and Una had that whole musical number about the importance of connecting to your crew?)  

Thinking through all that helped alleviate my concern that Kirk seemed uncharacteristically out-of-his depths here. I guess the truth is that with only two previous “real” appearances under his belt, we haven't spent enough time with this version of Kirk to know what is and isn't out of his depth. It also helped to revisit season two and remember that Kirk was specifically supposed to be the youngest First Officer in Starfleet history—breaking his dad's record in the process. 

So I guess his brief crisis of confidence upon being made acting captain makes sense for a young newbie in his first “major” job. Although opening this episode with a personal log where he explains he's so bored he can barely remember the stardate anymore doesn't exactly drive home the idea that this is all still relatively new to him. In fact, between this and Star Trek Beyond, I need Trek writers to understand that a handsome white man zooming up the career ladder and then immediately getting bored is not a relatable or sympathetic character flaw. (Get a new career path, then, Jim!) 

Yes, yes, that's ultimately the point of the episode, once space raiders attack the Farragut, leave Captain V'Rel (Zoe Doyle) incapacitated, and give Kirk his first big test run in the captain's chair, with the Enterprise rescue team as his makeshift bridge crew. After years of being driven by cocky career ambition, Kirk realizes he's now the dog that caught the car—or “The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail,” to use the Vulcan idiom (and the episode's title). It turns out making bold leadership decisions in theory is a lot easier than when you're the one who has to live with the consequences. And what Kirk originally saw as V'Rel's overcaution, he comes to see as wisdom. 

It's a nice enough message. And a lot of this episode really is fun and charming to watch—particularly back on Enterprise, where the rest of the crew get to run around being scrappy action heroes led by Pelia installing old-fashioned landlines to circumvent a communications block from the raiders. (I'm still laughing about how Carol Kane delivers the line, “When the novelty wore off, you got a little creepy!” to a Kit-Cat Klock.) But I'm just not sure that what this already pretty scattered season needed was a Kirk-centric hour—especially when characters like Ortegas and Una have gotten so little focus in this batch (or in this series, frankly) and since it's not like we're lacking for Kirk-centric Trek elsewhere.  

Last season, it felt kind of revolutionary to use Kirk as a supporting player for an Uhura story. But using her as a supporting player in his is just business as usual—even if it's sweet to see her advocate for his potential while the rest of her friends consider declaring him mentally unfit and taking control of the ship. (That's kind of an escalation if you ask me.)

There's also the fact that it's a little hard to believe that a character who feels this green here is going to become the captain of Starfleet's flagship sometime in the next five years. Starting Strange New Worlds seven or so years before The Original Series is just an odd amount of time to do “younger” versions of the characters we know and love (particularly for someone like Spock, who's got a two-century lifespan). Where the J.J. Abrams films made everybody youthful cadets to up the contrast, here we're tracking the difference between Kirk at 27 and Kirk at 32, which is a much more nuanced time of personal growth. Unfortunately, it's hard to do that kind of subtle character work in an episodic sci-fi show that's mostly just here to have fun—especially with a character who isn't a series regular. 

From a canon perspective, it actually would've been far more intriguing to learn about Kirk's relationships on the Farragut and how they shaped him into the man he is on The Original Series. (The fact that he served under a Vulcan captain feels like it totally recontextualizes his relationship with Spock.) But because the show has to use its main cast and because this episode wants to lean into the TOS nostalgia, it has Kirk learn his lesson via his future Enterprise pals and Pike instead, which is a more “fun” but less interesting choice. 

And, unfortunately, it kind of feels like making the more fun but less interesting choice is Strange New World's default—even in an episode like this, which is all about adding shades of grey to what initially seems like a Good Starfleet vs. Bad Space Raiders premise. Indeed, I quite liked the twist that the scavengers who have become legendary monsters across the galaxy are actually the descendants of a 21st-century human-science mission, a reveal that horrifies everyone in a way they can't quite put into words.  

I was reminded of The West Wing scene where President Bartlett asks, “Why is a Kundunese life worth less to me than an American life?” and Will Bailey replies, “I don't know, sir, but it is.” Objectively, there's no reason the crew should have more empathy for these human space pirates than they would for an alien race with a similar origin story. But even a utopian society can't erase all instinctual biases. And there's something Pike and Kirk find especially unsettling about seeing human faces and American flags behind the terrifying masked figures and giant chomping space ships they've just destroyed.  

The whole thing becomes a lesson in radical empathy for Kirk, on top of the lesson in listening to your crew that he gets from his future TOS pals. Which is nice. It really is. But it's also kind of predictable and emotionally safe too. And there are times I wish Strange New Worlds wanted to be more than that. While the series launched by course correcting a lot of Discovery's flaws, it could gain something by embracing that show's ambitious attempts to say meaningful things too. This week's twist sort of does that. It's just a little harder to appreciate because it comes wrapped up in another one of the more fanfic-y installments of the season.

In fact, it's ironic that an episode about the importance of appreciating the present rather than obsessing about the future comes within one that tries to rush us ahead to The Original Series bridge. There's definitely room to make Strange New Worlds a show about Kirk befriending his future crewmates. But it's more powerful when that evolution happens slowly and organically (as it has before) rather than when it's shoehorned in as an overt gimmick.

In May, a 4K restoration of cult anime film “Angel's Egg” screened at the Cannes Film Festival, celebrating the experimental film's 40th anniversary. Now, GKIDS has announced that the restoration will premiere in North American theaters on Friday, November 19. IndieWire can exclusively share the first look of the poster and trailer for the new restoration, below.

Released in Japan on December 15, 1985, “Angel's Egg” was the third feature of director Mamoru Oshii, who is best known worldwide for his seminal cyberpunk animated film of a decade later, “Ghost in the Shell.” 

 










At the time of “Angel's Egg,” Oshii's only other directorial efforts were two spinoff films of the popular anime comedy series “Urusei Yatsura.” A completely original work, “Angel's Egg” was made in collaboration with artist Yoshitaka Amano, who is most famous in America for providing the character designs for the early “Final Fantasy” video games.

Told with very little dialogue, the short, hand-drawn animated film takes place in a strange primordial fantasy world, and follows two unnamed characters: A young girl who protects an egg she believes will hatch into an angel, and a young boy searching for a bird he once saw in his dream. The heavily allegorical fantasy is notable for its heavy use of philosophical and Biblical symbolism, and touches on themes common in Oshii's other works, particularly the relationship between dreams and reality.

 










Released on DVD by publisher Tokuma Shoten, “Angel's Egg” was well-received by critics but performed poorly financially. In the decades since, however, it has been acclaimed as one of Oshii's best works and has developed a cult following. The film has previously been difficult to track down in America, where it is currently unavailable on streaming.  

The 4K restoration of “Angel's Egg” was supervised by Oshii, and is the second collaboration between the director and GKIDS following last year's rerelease of the director's feature “Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence.”

Prior to its theatrical release, “Angel's Egg” will play at the New York Film Festival, following screenings at Cannes, Fantasia Film Festival, and Fantastic Fest. Take a look at the poster and trailer, IndieWire exclusives, below.

Fantastic Fest has announced the film lineup for its 20th edition, promising an eclectic mix of horror, action, sci-fi, comedy, animation, and otherwise unclassifiable cinema that befits its status as the weirdest stop on the very busy fall festival circuit.

The Alamo Drafthouse-backed festival, which takes place at the theater chain's original South Lamar location in Austin, will open with the world premiere of “Primate,” Johannes Roberts' rabid chimp pool party survival saga starring Troy Kotsur. The closing night selection is “Whistle,” the new IFC horror film from “The Nun” director Corin Hardy about a group of teens who accidentally unleash an ancient Aztec curse on their town.

In the week between opening and closing night, the festival will feature dozens of genre films, including 45 world premieres and films that have played other major festivals. Highlights include the Blumhouse sequel “Black Phone 2,” Paramount's Dakota Fanning-led “Vicious,” the U.S. premiere of Neon's “Shelby Oaks,” and the Thai sentient vacuum romance “A Useful Ghost,” one of IndieWire's favorite films of Cannes. Mark Duplass will also bring Season 2 of “The Creep Tapes” back to Fantastic Fest after premiering the series at the 2024 edition of the festival.

 










Fantastic Fest's lineup is never fully complete before the festival begins, as many nights are headlined by Secret Screenings, which are often premieres of major fall releases that are not announced until the screenings begin. Other events include a medieval drag show and a fundraiser for the Transgender Film Center.

One surprising inclusion? The return of the controversial Fantastic Debates, whose troubled and dangerous history IndieWire's own Alison Foreman reported on extensively in 2024.

Fantastic Fest 2025 takes place from September 18 – 25. Keep reading for the complete lineup, with all film descriptions provided by the festival.

For the last few weeks, my TikTok feed has been mired in country music filth. In one scroll, a woman sings about swigging a beer while rubbing a corncob on her clit, then a man moans aggressively about sweating because of a “weiner” tearing up his backdoor. There's a singer who ardently praises God for letting her fuck without accidentally sharting on her poor partner. Perhaps the most ridiculous thing I've seen is a twangy-voiced guy narrating a fictional experience at a Diddy freakoff, where he cries about being unable to escape because of oil on the door. Except none of these drawly southern voices—and embarrassing or sexy encounters—involve humans. They're all AI avatars crooning erotic fan-fic into the void.

This strain of AI shitposting has been bubbling for at least the last year, but it's recently gone mainstream on the app, reaching tens of millions of viewers this last month. It spawned a surprisingly wholesome and humorous online trend where people play these bawdy songs for uptight family members, especially parents and grandparents, who react with horror and amazement when the lyrics hit. It's bizarrely satisfying to see these Hank Hill-looking Gen Xers and boomers nod their heads enthusiastically as the country instrumentation starts, then go agape when the robo-babe mewls a line like, “Drinking a beer and flicking my bean, praying my daddy don't hear me queef” or the even more diabolical, “She was fingering my tight ass country coochie, when my little pussy farted it was like a movie/And the dogs started barking when they caught a whiff of my summertime river heat coochie drip.”

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

For a lot of older, less online people, this could be their first experience with fully AI-generated music, and it's a little terrifying how many can't seem to tell that what they're listening to is inhuman. Before they're shocked by the smut and scatalogy, they bop happily to the simple riffs and grooves. It's only been a couple of years since AI songs first started polluting the web, but audio generators like Suno and Udio have improved in subtle yet meaningful ways, simulating human imperfections and quirks more effectively. The “singer” in one of the biggest songs, “Country Girls Make Do,” could pass for a real vocalist: You can hear a rapid inhale before she starts a vocal line, as if she's breathing diaphragmatically, and her tone tilts depending on the word: “bean” expands like “bay-in,” “creek” flutters like an accordion. “Cornbread Creek” is like if Morgan Wallen wrote a hit anthem about how he was drinking Bud Lights with his bro in the forest when he accidentally tripped and lodged his member deep inside his friend's ass. The AI imitates his gritty texture and light warble, with convincing ad libs and harmonies. “Wait, do I love country music??” someone commented. These tiny details make all the difference to undiscerning listeners, offering an increasingly serviceable rip of mainstream country.

For some people, it's clearly more than TikTok tomfoolery: They genuinely love the music. Beats By AI, one of the main creators of these themes, has soared to over 600,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. TikToks using the country aural-erotica are packed with comments startled by the high quality. There's a slew of user-made playlists dedicated to “AI Dirty Songs” and “Unhinged AI Country Music,” full of classic bangers such as “Scissored In My Chevy,” “My Horse Just Got A BBL,” and “Why'd You Stop? (That Sloppy Top).” These gags have really taken over the online country music sphere, but they're infesting every genre. One of the biggest hits I've seen recently is a song called “I Glued My Balls to My Butthouse Again” that could pass as a 60s soul song if not for lines like “Good God, I pulled too hard/Now my scrotum's stretched out like a fuckin' yard, oh God.” It's a preview of where music is headed, where there'll be funhouse mirror siblings of every genre that use outré humor and provocative, algorithm-friendly buzzwords to sneakily train people to value AI music as if it were made by humans.

AI has enabled an entire cottage industry of what you could call algo-signifier music, which takes any viral meme or cultural moment—Labubu, Tralalero Tralala, Chicken Jockey, Epstein Files—and flays it into a dozen goofy songs in a desperate, craven attempt to hijack the SEO streams. Some of them are funny and topical but just as many are empty detritus, like “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” which turns the actress' recent controversy with her American Eagle ad (which people accused of promoting eugenics) into a rousing rock anthem complete with a deepfake music video.

If AI's good at anything, it's concocting disposable thrills that don't try to be conventional art. I once asked ChatGPT to write a review about a fictional album themed around IBS, in the style of a pretentious music critic, and it instantly came up with song titles like “The Gastric Lament” and “The Bloated Horizon,” with fittingly puerile analysis. The output I've enjoyed most is the dumbest and dreck-iest: the Minecraft parkour videos that feature AI SpongeBob lecturing AI Patrick about Israel's apartheid state and the benefits of socialism; the AI-SMR that asks you to choose between fantastical keyboards made of things like snow, bubbles, jelly, and liquid balls. Generators can conjure up pristine audio/visual displays of things that a video studio or music label wouldn't waste money to produce, like a hi-fi country song about queefing and corncob masturbation. It would be nice if we could just stop here, at the point where the AI machines are only clever enough to make unhinged oddities for comedic purposes and we use it to scandalize conservative parents.

But if the destruction of lo-fi and city pop are any indication, it'll only get more uncanny. At the same time, real human music has become increasingly FaceTuned: fragmented takes cut together in the studio, vocals zhuzhed up with filters and artificial gloss. So AI and non-AI music are quickly hurtling toward a collision point where they merge into a single hazy semi-realism. Maybe the jokes will be so good, the slop so satisfying, that we won't give a damn.

	The Justice Department has fired one of its own and charged him with felony assault after he threw a sub sandwich at a federal officer. 


	A video of Sean Charles Dunn throwing a sandwich at the chest of an officer amid President Donald Trump's federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., went viral earlier this week. Dunn, at point blank range, hurled the sandwich at the officers chest before attempting to sprint away. Dunn reportedly told cops: “I did it. I threw a sandwich.”


	Former Fox News Host turned U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro posted a video on social media Wednesday in which she bragged about having charged Dunn with a felony. “He thought it was funny. Well, he doesn't think it's funny today, because we charged him with a felony assault on a police officer, and we're going to back the police to the hilt. So there — stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else,” she said before posing for the camera. 


	FBI Director Kash Patel announced on Thursday that the individual had indeed been arrested and “charged with felony assault on a federal officer.” Attorney General Pam Bondi later wrote on social media that “if you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you.”

	“I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER. Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony,” Bondi added. “This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ.” 

	











	“You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement,” the attorney general wrote. 


	Bondi does, however, have some level of tolerance for disrespect to law enforcement among her staff. 


	Last week, NPR obtained video footage of current DOJ employee Jared Wise outside of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Wise was filmed calling police officers protecting the Capitol “Nazi” and “Gestapo.” Wise also yelled “kill em,” as his fellow rioters clashed with law enforcement. 


	In a statement to NPR, a spokesperson for the Justice Department said that “Jared Wise is a valued member of the Justice Department and we appreciate his contributions to our team.”


	The Trump administration also pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters, some of whom beat and battled with cops as they stormed the Capitol in an attempt to block the certification of Trump's 2020 electoral loss.

	Bondi's Justice Department has nevertheless made a show of throwing the book at anyone who makes any sort of aggressive contact with law enforcement. Earlier this week, Emily Gabriella Sommer pleaded guilty to three counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer or employee. Sommer was arrested in May after allegedly spitting on former U.S. Attorney Ed Martin during a televised interview. 


	Sandwich or loogie, in the end the administration is not so much interested in preserving law and order, but in making an example of those who manage to embarrass them.

Lana Del Rey is coming in hot with her new song snippet. The singer teased the unnamed track in an Instagram video where she's seen listening to it as she drives and delivers pointed lyrics. “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post / Think it's cute reenacting my Chicago post,” Del Rey sings, the biting lyrics juxtaposing the soft vocals and keys. 


	Del Rey simply captioned the video with “Track 13” and tagged Jack Antonoff, who presumably produced the song. But the lyrics and additional social media posts have led the world to question if the alt-pop singers are fight.

A post shared by LANA DEL REY (@honeymoon)


	In addition to the lyric that outright names Cain, Del Rey also sings about “the most famous girl in the Waffle House,” which could possibly reference a 2022 New York Times profile of Cain with the same headline. (Let's not forget, Del Rey was also once the most famous girl in a Waffle House when she took up a shift at one in Alabama.)

	











	Unsurprisingly, the internet hasn't been normal about any of this. Fans speculated about the potential friction between Del Rey and Cain. One X user posted a side by side photo of both singers posing with Jack Donoghue, who once dated Del Rey, and tried to connect it to the “think it's cute reenacting my Chicago pose” lyric. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	First, fans online criticized the singer for posting the video during Taylor Swift's appearance on the New Heights, where Swift announced her new album. “Lana sharing Track 13. Same day taylor swift announced her Album. Knowing 13 is taylor's lucky number,” one user on X wrote. Another X user pointed out that the Antonoff tag was an intentional move. “Lana teasing track 13 of her album and tagging co writer Jack Antonoff is lowkey Taylor shade because obviously Taylor announced her album covers and track list and didn't work with jack on this album at all so here Lana goes being all messy,” the post read.

Lana Del Rey elaborates on her lyrics about Ethel Cain, stating that the singer used to body-shame her:“I didn't know who Ethel was until a few years ago — when someone brought to my attention the disturbing and graphic side-by-side images she would often put up of me next to… pic.twitter.com/I6uV9UO6qU


	In the hours since Del Rey teased the song snippet, both she and Cain have posted on social media. Cain shared an Instagram story with a black background and white text that read: “Update: Lana Del Rey has blocked Ethel Cain on Instagram.” Meanwhile, Del Rey took to Pop Base's Instagram comments to further explain the song's lyrics and her conflicting feelings with Cain. 


	In a since-deleted comment, Del Rey wrote: “I didn't know who Ethel was until a few years ago — when someone brought to my attention the disturbing and graphic side-by-side images she would often put up of me next to unflattering creatures and cartoon characters making constant comments about my weight, I was confused at what she was getting at. Then when I heard what she was saying behind closed doors from mutual friends and started inserting herself into my personal life I was definitely disturbed.”

The detection of viable life is a key objective for both in situ astrobiological experiments on extraterrestrial bodies, and for planetary protection protocols on Earth following sample return.

We evaluated the potential for common bacterial and archaeal intact polar lipids (IPLs) to be used as viable life markers owing to their particularly fast rate (hours to days) of post-mortem degradation.

We determined the chemical signatures of IPLs using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (with and without derivatisation), to simulate the results of in situ pyrolytic organic analyses.

Monoglycerides, formed as pyrolysis products of typical bacterial IPLs, were the strongest signature for the parent compounds, and were identified in both the pyrolysis of a phospholipid mixture and freeze-dried bacterial culture.

Our results demonstrate that relatively rapid and elegant pyrolysis techniques can reveal the presence of IPLs, and therefore evidence of viable life in extraterrestrial samples.

CNN host Abby Phillip compared President Donald Trump to Batman on Monday night while criticizing his efforts to clean up crime in Washington, D.C. 

FIRST ON FOX — A pro-Trump legal group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller filed a FOIA request Thursday seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics that senior adminis tration officials allege have been ""manipulated.""

The request by the America First Legal Foundation (AFL) includes demands for a wide range of documents from D.C.'s police force, including all email communications or internal guidance reflecting any changes in the department's tracking or reporting of crimes in the city, as well as any records ""reflecting the falsification or non-publication"" of crime data and statistics, among other things.

It is part of a broader investigation AFL launched on Thursday, just four days after President Donald Trump issued his order to temporarily federalize D.C. both by deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force to crack down on crime.

In the FOIA request, AFL also asked for records of ""all communications"" related to Michael Pulliam, the D.C. police officer who was placed on administrative leave in May, after he was accused of changing crime statistics to minimize crimes. 

TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS

(Photo by JEFF KOWALSKY / AFP) (Photo by JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)  (JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)

Pulliam formerly served as a police commander for the Metropolitan Police Department's Third District, which includes Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights.

The Pulliam investigation has become something of a political lightning rod in recent days, as Trump officials have pointed to the investigation and his leave as evidence that MPD has sought to manipulate or massage crime statistics in the nation's capital. 

News of the AFL probe comes as President Donald Trump and White House officials have blasted what they describe as a ""ridiculous"" amount of crime in D.C., and claimed repeatedly that the crime statistics in question might not be an accurate portrayal of the situation on the ground — something critics argue is simply justification for the administration to push through its executive order. 

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., ""is more violent than Baghdad."" 

""As each day passes, new horrific examples of violent crime are reported across the district,"" AFL's lead attorney, Will Scolinos, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""AFL is investigating whether, as described by recent reports, official D.C. crime statistics may have been deliberately falsified to make the city seem safer than it is.""

""President Trump has stepped up to make Washington D.C. safer for all residents and visitors to the nation's capital—but the Left is lockstep in defending D.C. as ‘safe enough.'"" Scolinos added. ""Americans know better.""

Trump, in his August 11 executive order, declared a ""crime emergency"" in the nation's capital. That order invokes Section 740 of D.C.'s Home Rule Act, saying that federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order in D.C to protect the nation's capital — including federal buildings, property, and monuments— and to ensure ""conditions necessary"" for the orderly functioning of the federal government. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

(Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)

In announcing their investigation Thursday, the AFL also cited a report published Thursday morning by the Washington Free Beacon involving a D.C. settlement agreement with a former police sergeant, Charlotte Djossou, who allegedly sued MPD leaders in 2020 for ""misclassifying offenses"" to deflate D.C. crime statistics. 

That settlement was not included in AFL's FOIA request, and Fox News Digital could not immediately confirm the details of the report, or the nature of the settlement agreement in question. 

Still, news of the AFL probe comes as senior Trump officials and allies of the president have seized on the Pulliam investigation as a means of calling into question the accuracy of federal crime data in D.C. The administration has sought to undermine preliminary federal statistics published in January 2025 that said violent crime in the nation's capital had dropped to its lowest point in more than 30 years.

D.C. officials, for their part, have conceded that the drop in violent crime might be overstated (data on the MPD website now shows a 26% drop between 2023 and 2024).

But they've pushed back on the notion that artificially deflated crime data is to blame. In an interview with NBC News earlier this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that a recent review of all MPD crime data found 552 fewer victims of violent crime in the first eight months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. Crime is down across all seven districts, with anomalies in just one, she told NBC.

""Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,"" she said in a televised interview Sunday. 

America First Legal, though not officially part of the Trump administration, was founded by longtime Trump advisor Stephen Miller after Trump's first presidential term. Miller stepped down from AFL before rejoining the White House in 2025 as Trump's deputy chief of staff.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What Does ‘Genius' Really Mean?","https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/definition-of-genius/683873/","Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:25:36 GMT","

Humans have long tried to understand a quicksilver quality that defies explanation.

This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic's archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

“When Paul Morphy plays seven games of chess at once and blindfold, when young Colburn gives impromptu solution to a mathematical problem involving fifty-six figures, we are struck with hopeless wonder,” J. Brownlee Brown wrote in 1864. His Atlantic article had a simple headline: “Genius.” Only seven years after the founding of this magazine, its writers were already addressing one of the greatest questions of the 19th century: How should we define genius, that everyday word we use to denote the extraordinary?

Brown's two geniuses are largely forgotten today. Morphy was a chess wizard from New Orleans who grew tired of the game and gave up playing seriously at just 22. He reportedly died in his bath at age 47. Zerah Colburn's story is even more tragic: As a child, he wasn't thought to be particularly gifted until his father overheard him repeating multiplication tables after only a few weeks' schooling. The little boy from Vermont was then dragged around Europe as a “mental calculator,” ruling on whether large numbers were primes or not, and sent to an expensive school thanks to the patronage of an earl. But like many child prodigies, his adult life was a comparative disappointment. He died of tuberculosis at 34.

While researching my new book, The Genius Myth, I spent a lot of time exploring how we tell stories of exceptional achievement, and what the changing definition of genius reveals about the history of Western thought. The word itself comes from Latin, where it was used to mean a person's spirit—the inner essence that gave them their unique characteristics. “Every man, says the oracle, has his daemon, whom he is bound to obey; those who implicitly follow that guidance are the prophetic souls, the favorites of the gods,” Frederic Henry Hodge wrote in The Atlantic in 1868. “It is this involuntary, incalculable force that constitutes what we call genius.”

Well into the 20th century, The Atlantic used this older definition, writing about people who possessed a genius, rather than those who were one. Individuals whom this magazine has described as being or having a genius include Richard Strauss, Leo Tolstoy, George Gershwin, Cormac McCarthy, Alice Munro, and Edith Wharton, that last accolade having been delivered by Gore Vidal. Oh, plus the 23-year-old hockey player Bobby Orr, the children's cartoon Rugrats, and the shopping channel QVC.

This proclamation makes for great copy, because it is deeply subjective. Christopher Hitchens was prepared to call the poet Ezra Pound a genius, but not the acclaimed mystery author Dorothy L. Sayers, whose work he dismissed as “dismal pulp.” (I know whose work I would rather read.) In 1902, a female writer for this magazine airily declared that there were no great women writers to compare with Juvenal, Euripides, and Milton. “George Eliot had a vein of excellent humor, but she never shares it with her heroes,” argued Ellen Duvall, adding that Jane Austen's male heroes were “as solemn as Minerva's owl.”

The science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Something similar is true of geniuses. An earlier age would have attributed Paul Morphy and Zerah Colburn's gifts to divine providence, but in the more secular 19th-century America, another explanation was needed. “We seek in vain for the secret of this mastery,” wrote Brown of his subjects. “It is private,—as deeply hidden from those who have as from those who have it not.”

For the genius-hunters, one encouraging source for exceptional talent was inheritance. At the time Brown was writing about Morphy and Colburn, academics throughout the Western world were wrestling with the theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin only six years earlier. The study of what would later be called genetics promised new methods of understanding genius, that quicksilver quality that seemed so resistant to explanation.

The first edition of Hereditary Genius, by Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton, was published in America in 1870. Galton's work aimed to classify all men into lettered bands, depending on their mental faculties and lifetime achievements. The Atlantic reviewed Hereditary Genius that year, noting that the difference between the men in the upper part of Galton's highest band and those in his lowest band “represents the difference between Shakespeare and the most degraded idiot mentioned in medical literature.” This was a coldly rational view of genius—more scientific in appearance, but also less humane.

Galton went on to coin the term eugenics. His unpublished utopian novel, The Eugenic College of Kantsaywhere, imagined a world where people were allowed to marry only after extensive tests of their fitness to reproduce, and where those who failed were shipped off to labor colonies. Thanks to the popularity of eugenics at the time, what started as an attempt to identify geniuses eventually led the U.S. Supreme Court to justify the forced sterilization of the “feeble minded” in Buck v. Bell in 1927. Thousands of Americans were subsequently denied the right to have children—an idea that also took hold in Nazi Germany, where an estimated 400,000 people were sterilized under the Hitler regime in the name of “racial hygiene.”

From the start, Galton's ideas about genius were presented in explicitly racial terms: He believed that Europeans were intellectually superior to Africans, and that ancient Athenians were superior to both. The Atlantic, a proudly abolitionist magazine, ran an article that contested this bigotry. In 1893, Havelock Ellis argued that many in the contemporary canon of geniuses had mixed ancestry, from what he called the “negro blood” that was “easy to trace in the face of Alexandre Dumas, in certain respects, to the Iroquois blood in Flaubert.” The popular novelist Olive Schreiner's heritage was “German, English, and Jewish,” Ellis observed, while Thomas Hardy believed his paternal great-grandmother to have been Irish. (Neither Jews nor Irish people would have been considered white, according to popular beliefs of the time.)

Today, most modern geneticists acknowledge that intelligence is partially heritable—it can be passed down by parents—but that does not account for the making of a genius. “We can no more produce a whole race of Newtons and Shakespeares than we can produce perpetual motion,” the anonymous author of the Hereditary Genius review wrote in 1870. A “genius” can pass on some of their genes, but not their personality—nor the social conditions in which their success happened.

That matters. While talking about my book, I've found that acknowledging the role of luck in success makes some people nervous. They think that any discussion of broader historical forces is a covert attempt to debunk or downplay the importance of individual talent or hard work. But even 19th-century Atlantic writers could see the importance of good timing. “A given genius may come either too early or too late,” William James wrote in 1880. “Cromwell and Napoleon need their revolutions, Grant his civil war. An Ajax gets no fame in the day of telescopic-sighted rifles.”

As we get closer to the present, a note of sarcasm creeps into the word's usage: In the 2000s, the writer Megan McArdle used the recurrent headline “Sheer Genius” for columns on businesses making terrible errors. But she was far from the first Atlantic writer to use the word sardonically. One of my favorite essays on genius from the archives is a satirical squib from 1900, which masquerades as an ad for a Genius Discovery Company. “This country needs more geniuses,” the anonymous author wrote. “Everybody knows it. Everybody admits it. Everybody laments it.” The article urged any reader who wondered whether they might be a genius to write in, enclosing a five-dollar fee, “and we will tell you the truth by return mail.”

Having studied the flawed and fickle way that we award the label genius, let me say this—that's as good a method as any other.

The Court has a special set of rules for Trump.

The Supreme Court handed down a very brief order on Thursday, which allows a Mississippi law restricting children's access to social media to remain in place — for now.

It is far from clear, however, whether the Mississippi law at issue in Netchoice v. Fitch will remain in place for very long. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is ideologically at the center of this very conservative Supreme Court, wrote a concurring opinion explaining that he thinks the law “would likely violate [social media companies'] First Amendment rights under this Court's precedents.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

But he joined the Court's decision nonetheless because the plaintiff in this case, a trade group that represents internet companies, “has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.”

Kavanaugh's reference to “the balance of harms and equities” refers to the rule the Supreme Court used to apply in its “shadow docket” cases, a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices decide on an expedited basis. Typically, when the Court grants shadow docket relief, it issues a temporary order that blocks a lower court decision until the case is fully litigated in federal appeals courts and, in some cases, the Supreme Court.

In Nken v. Holder (2009), the Court held that, when a litigant asks an appellate court to block a lower court's decision while the case is still ongoing, it is not enough for that litigant to show they are likely to prevail on appeal. To receive shadow docket relief, the litigant must also show that they “will be irreparably injured absent a stay.” Often, appeals courts must also ask whether blocking the lower court's decision would “substantially injure” any third parties, or otherwise harm “the public interest.”

Kavanaugh is probably right that the Mississippi law at issue in Netchoice does not irreparably injure anyone. Though the law purports to prevent minors from signing up for social media accounts without their parents' permission, it is fairly toothless. And it is far from clear whether any actual child or teenager has not been able to use a social media site because of the law. (If you want to read more about the law and why it violates the First Amendment, I wrote that piece here.)

Kavanaugh's decision to apply Nken to the Netchoice case is odd, because the Court appears to have abandoned Nken in many of its shadow docket cases. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson explained in a pair of dissenting opinions earlier this year, when President Donald Trump seeks a shadow docket order, the Court typically ignores Nken and rules in favor of Trump, regardless of whether he or his administration would be irreparably injured.

In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME (2025), for example, the Republican justices ruled that DOGE, the White House office once led by billionaire Elon Musk, may have immediate access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration.

Notably, however, when a judge asked one of Trump's lawyers what harm the government would experience if DOGE's access to this information were delayed, the lawyer did not name any such harm — saying instead that the Trump administration would “stand on the record in its current form.” In the Trump administration's brief to the justices in AFSCME, Trump's lawyers did not even attempt to argue that the administration faced irreparable injury without shadow docket relief. That brief devoted only one paragraph to the question of irreparable harm, and it did not identify any injury to the government that could not be unraveled by a future court order. Instead, it complained that the lower court order blocking DOGE's access “impinges on the President's broad authority.”

Kavanaugh's Fitch opinion is clarifying for two reasons. Last June, the Supreme Court slightly rolled back First Amendment rights, holding that states may require pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18. It was unclear after that decision, known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, whether the Court planned to further weaken the First Amendment, or whether Free Speech Coalition was a one-off decision applying solely to porn.

Kavanaugh's Fitch concurrence suggests that the First Amendment is safe. To his credit, Kavanaugh has generally voted in favor of free speech, including in cases where Republican lawmakers sought to restrict it.

Additionally, Kavanaugh's Fitch opinion also seems to clarify that, for most litigants, Nken remains good law. Only Donald Trump appears to enjoy the special exemption that the Court applied in cases like AFSCME.

In this article

Intel shares rose 7% on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is in talks with the chipmaker to have the U.S. government take a stake in the struggling company.

Intel is the only U.S. company with the capability to manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. shores, although rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung also have U.S. factories. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high technology to be manufactured in the U.S.

The government's stake would help fund factories that Intel is currently building in Ohio, according to the report.

Earlier this week, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan visited Trump in the White House, a meeting that took place after the president had called for Tan's resignation based on allegations he has ties to China.

Intel said at the time that Tan is ""deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests."" An Intel representative declined to comment about reports that the government is considering taking a stake in the company.

""We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation,"" the spokesperson said.

Tan took over Intel earlier this year after the chipmaker failed to gain significant share in artificial intelligence chips, while it was spending heavily to build its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.

Intel's foundry business has yet to secure a major customer, which would be a critical step in moving towards expansion and giving other potential customers the confidence to turn to Intel for manufacturing.

In July, Tan said that Intel was canceling plans for manufacturing sites in Germany and Poland and would slow down development in Ohio, adding that spending at the chipmaker would be closely scrutinized.

Under Trump, the U.S. government has increasingly moved to put itself at the center of deals in major industries. Last week, it said it would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. It also took a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant.

Intel shares are now up 19% this year after losing 60% of their value in 2024, the worst year on record for the chipmaker.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in troubled insurer UnitedHealth last quarter, according to a regulatory filing, a surprising buy because of the company's current reputation, but perhaps not considering his history of bargain investing.

The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The stake puts it as the 18th biggest position in the Berkshire portfolio behind Amazon and Constellation Brands, according to VerityData. 

Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it is possible that Buffett's two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were more responsible for this purchase rather than the ""Oracle of Omaha"" himself. Buffett said one of his investment managers was behind the Amazon investment in 2019.

The insurer's stock shot up 6% in extended trading following Berkshire's disclosure.

Shares of UnitedHealthcare were down nearly 50% for 2025 through Thursday's close before Buffett's filing. The largest private health insurer has become the face of a public blowback in this country against the rising costs of health care. UnitedHealth is currently facing a Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing practices. 

In May, the company pulled its annual earnings outlook and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. Last month, UnitedHealth gave a new 2025 outlook that was well short of Wall Street estimates, hitting the stock further.

Buffett, who's turning 95 this month, has been critical of the healthcare system in the U.S., calling it a ""tapeworm"" on the economy due to its high costs. In 2018, he, along with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon, launched a joint venture to improve healthcare for their employees and potentially for all Americans, but it was eventually shut down.

UnitedHealth isn't the only stock Berkshire picked up last quarter. In fact, the conglomerate also took small stakes in steel manufacturer Nucor, outdoor advertising company Lamar Advertising and security firm Allegion. Berkshire also got back into homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton.

Shares of Nucor jumped nearly 8% in afterhours trading, while Lennar and DR Horton popped about 3% each.

The legendary investor is stepping down as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year, handing over the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will stay on as chairman of the board. It's still unclear who will be in charge of Berkshire's gigantic equity portfolio, though Buffett has alluded that Abel will be making all capital allocation decisions at the conglomerate.

 Bitcoin fell below $119,000 on Thursday after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government will not make new BTC purchases to fund a Bitcoin reserve. 

Bitcoin dropped below a key support level Thursday after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government had no plans to make additional purchases of Bitcoin for its strategic reserve and separate digital asset stockpile.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $120,000 psychological support level and traded at $118,730 at the time of writing, hours after hitting an all-time high of $124,457 earlier on Thursday, Cointelegraph data showed.

The decline followed Bessent's comments in an interview with Fox Business, where he confirmed the government would not buy more Bitcoin.

“We've also started to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,” Bessent said.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 establishing both a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile, both of which would initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

In March, Bessent advocated for a strategic shift in the US approach to its Bitcoin reserve, telling CNBC and signaling at the White House Crypto Summit that the government should stop selling seized Bitcoin and “bring it onshore” using established regulatory frameworks. 

He said that after victims of financial misconduct are compensated, any remaining seized coins would be added to a national Bitcoin reserve, putting the US in a position to lead in global crypto.

In April, Bo Hines, who at the time was a part of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, said the administration was exploring funding options for Bitcoin acquisitions, including tariff revenue and a reevaluation of the Treasury's gold certificates.

Thursday's drop came just hours after Bitcoin briefly overtook Google's $2.4 trillion market capitalization to become the fifth-largest global asset, before optimism faded on the Treasury's stance.

In a silver lining to the sentiment-dampening statement, the Bessent did confirm that the US does not plan to sell any of its existing Bitcoin holdings.

Bessent's comments echo White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who said a Bitcoin reserve would be “a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency,” and the US wouldn't sell any Bitcoin it put in the reserve.

“It will be kept as a store of value,” Sacks said in a March 7 X post.

Related: New crypto whale buys $1.3B of Ether ahead of US inflation reports

Meanwhile, the ballooning US national debt may spur more investors to look to Bitcoin's financial properties as a store of value against persistent inflation.

The US debt surpassed $37 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, fueling expectations of a Bitcoin rally to new all-time highs driven by money supply growth expectations, as the government looks to service the swelling debt and stimulate economic spending.

The development of high-bandwidth applications, including multi-gigabit communication and radar imaging, demands faster processing. However, in the microwave regime, where frequencies exceed clock rates, sampling and computation become challenging. Here we report an integrated microwave neural network for broadband computation and communication. Our microwave neural network operates across tens of gigahertz but is reprogrammed with slow megabits per second control bitstreams. By exploiting strong nonlinearity in coupled microwave oscillations, it expresses its computation in a narrower spectrum, enabling easy read-out. The system searches bit sequences in multi-gigabits per second data and emulates digital functions without custom circuits. It accelerates radio-frequency machine learning by classifying encoding schemes and detecting frequency shifts to track flight trajectories from radar. The microwave neural network is fabricated with standard complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. It occupies a sub-wavelength footprint of 0.088 mm2 on chip and has a sub-200-mW power consumption, supporting integration in a general-purpose analogue processor.

a, The nonlinear transmission line comprises cascaded π sections of fixed inductive waveguide segments and drive-sensitive nonlinear capacitors. Each resonance absorbs part of the incoming microwave signal and transmits the rest to subsequent segments. The overall nonlinear response results from cumulative reflections back to the RFin port. b, Top view of the layout of the nonlinear waveguide. Nonlinear capacitors are inserted periodically along the pretzel-shaped trace. Their nominal bias points are set through analog voltages. c, In the Silicon-on-Insulator process used here, a single polynomial nonlinear capacitor consists of two pairs of antiparallel diodes. c.i, Compact layout of this component. c.ii, The schematic, wherein the diode pairs are biased at their mid-point. c.iii, SPICE / Spectre-model simulated characterization of the nonlinear capacitor across variation in bias voltages and input RF power shows that by injecting a constant RF input power of -10 dBm, the effective capacitance decreases with increasing bias voltage. c.iv, The effective capacitance is highly sensitive to the input RF drive's power. The capacitance reduces with increasing field strength. c.v, The same nonlinearity, when considering its variance for different frequencies. Here, the capacitance varies with RF voltage as \({{\rm{C}}}_{{\rm{eff}}}({{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{NL}}},{{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{in}}})={\rm{a}}-{\rm{b}}{{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{in}}}+{\rm{c}}{{{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{in}}}}^{2}-{\rm{d}}{{{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{in}}}}^{3}+\ldots {\rm{fF}}\) which is well-suited to generating expansive functions for a neural pre-processor.

a, Top view of the each tunable linear waveguide (B, C and D) that produces linear modes. Switches S1,2….6 are inserted periodically along the length of the transmission line and make it tunable in length, with subsegments TLine1,2…6. Shorting the line through these switches alters the effective length of the waveguide to support different fundamental frequencies. b, Cross-section of RF-optimized and digital metal layers in the 45 nm Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS metal stack. Here, the top three layers are via'ed together for low-loss transmission. The five metal layers below are used for routing control signals from a Serial-to-Parallel Interface, to the switches, and also via'ed together to form a low-loss return path to the power supply. c, A schematic of the linear waveguide resonators, with options to lengthen or shorten the return path of the microwave signal. In the experiments, however, for simplicity, only the shortest path (configuration with all switches turned on) was used for training in the machine learning tasks.

a, The integrated microwave neural network consists of interconnected linear and nonlinear resonators. The linear resonator is designed as a single waveguide with an adjustable length, implemented through a cascade of sub-segments, each referred to as Lin. These sub-segments can be grounded via switches (S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5), which immediately terminate the microwave signal's return path at the first switch that is shorted to ground. In contrast, the nonlinear resonator features a transmission line loaded with polynomially nonlinear capacitors. These capacitors form C-L-C π sections that are coupled by delays. Microwave power from input pads is distributed to these resonators through symmetrically arranged couplers (whose equivalent circuits are marked in purple). The left coupler divides power into two linear waveguides, while the right coupler feeds into a linear waveguide and into a nonlinear waveguide. Saturable gain elements, implemented as cross-coupled transistor pairs, connect the waveguides on opposite sides of the circuit, compensating for losses within the electromagnetic structures. Additionally, a pair of capacitor banks provides a small degree of tunability to the modes supported by the waveguides. Critically, there is parametric coupling between the circuit's upper and lower halves through a pair of slow bitstream-driven switches. b, To simplify the complex circuit, we recognize that since the linear resonators support only a single natural frequency, they can be represented as tank circuits composed of Lj, and Cj. The symmetry in the bottom half of the circuit allows us to approximate the capacitor banks as two evenly split capacitors, contributing to the overall capacitance of the tank circuits. However, the asymmetry in the configuration of the resonators in the upper half does not permit such a simplification. c, To focus on the primary mechanism by which the system's sensitivity to incoming signals is enhanced, we can largely ignore the left half of the circuit and concentrate on the interaction between the nonlinear distributed resonances and the linear resonator on the right half. These components interact only through the inductive path via a coupler and a coupling capacitor between the turns of the coupler. The source of regenerative gain through the cross-coupled pair is retained. For ease of analysis, we represent the parametrically driven switch as a tunable capacitor, which can be toggled between a very small value (open circuit) and a very large value (short circuit). d, The reduced circuit can be represented as an ensemble of coupled modes–a cascade of nonlinear resonators connected to a linear resonator via a parametrically varied switched coupling and a fixed phase delay (through the coupler). These modes interact with the incoming drive (fast Gigabit/sec microwave-speed data), with internal losses being compensated by saturable gain.

a, The integrated circuit in the main Article is reduced to a coupled-mode model. This comprises a cascade of nonlinear resonances (waveguide A) coupled both passively and through parametric switching to a linear resonance. The power spectrum and Poincaré map of modes represented by the first nonlinear resonator (vNL,1) are observed. b, The MNN is driven with an external signal at 0.5ωNL,1. For a first set of initial conditions imposed on individual resonators' responses, there exists a regime in which (b.i), pure harmonic oscillation is seen and, (b.ii), for another set of initial conditions, comb-like behavior is produced. These correspond to situations where the Poincaré map shows sparse and organized points. This suggests a quasi-stable dynamic state (b.iii), and another where the two islands reflect more unstable, dynamic responses (b.iv), indicating locally chaotic solutions. c, If, instead, the drive was fed to the MNN at 0.65ωNL,1, different working regimes are triggered by different initial conditions. True comb-like behavior (c.i), can be produced, as evidenced by isolated, longer-memory, coherent solutions on the Poincaré map (c.ii). In another instance, divergent chaotic behavior shown by dense, scattered points (indicative of chaotic dynamics) (c.iv) manifests itself by a less structured spectrum emitted by the nonlinear resonator(s) (c.iii). For all simulations, nonlinear coupling coefficients, gain and decay rates are normalized with respect to ωNL,1. Here, βi,i+1 = 0.02 and \({{{\boldsymbol{\gamma }}}_{{\bf{i}}}}^{{\bf{int}}}=0.03\), with i = 1, 2…7 and G equals 0.2. Since parametric coupling is absent, βpar = 0.

In experiments involving Gigabit/sec data and radar returns, the accessible phase space of MNN is constrained by the configurations of incoming drive signals and the parametric bitstreams applied on the switch between the first non-linear mode and a linear mode (a). As a result, the output spectrum is shaped by the constrained, unstable nonlinear dynamics of the system, indicating extreme sensitivity to the modulation of GHz-speed microwave data (1-20 GHz) by slow MHz-speed parameters. For Drive 1, the Poincaré map for slow parameter bitstreams 1 and 2 shows clustered points with a few points that are more spread out (b.iv and b.v), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics while Bitstream 3 gives tightly clustered points (b.vi), indicating stable, periodic behavior. For Drive 2, under action of all three parametric bitstreams, the formation of ring-like structures indicates quasi-periodic behavior with non-linear dynamics (c.iv, c.v and c.vi). Finally, under Drive 3, bitstreams 1 and 2 induce a combination of ring-like patterns in the Poincaré maps (d.iv and d.v), revealing a tendency towards chaotic behavior, while Bitstream 3 exhibits multiple, structured rings (d.vi), indicating quasi-periodic behavior with complex and unstable dynamics. For all simulations, nonlinear coupling coefficients, gain and decay rates are normalized with respect to ωNL,1. Here, βi,i+1 = 0.02 and \({{{\boldsymbol{\gamma }}}_{{\bf{i}}}}^{{\bf{int}}}=0.03\), with i = 1, 2…7 and G equals 0.2.

The CMOS microwave neuron chip is wire-bonded to a Printed Circuit Board, which connects it to external power supplies and bias voltages for the oscillators' core, logic and drivers and Kerr-capacitors' bias. a, A low-speed bit pattern (clocked under 200 MHz) drives switches that establish parametric coupling between oscillators, imparting a shape to the microwave comb neuron. A first pair of probes, forming a Ground-Signal-Ground-Signal-Ground (GSGSG) configuration cyclically transfer high bandwidth 0-12 gigabits per second bitstreams into the chip to interact with the comb. The resulting microwave computations are manifested as steady-state responses in the frequency domain and produce new combs, each unique to the combination of inputs, that is, the fast input bitstreams and slow parameter bitstreams. Output spectra from two ports are read off spectrum analyzers in a small band between 10 and 14 gigahertz, through a second pair of probes and Ground-Signal-Ground-Signal-Ground waveguides. b, The probe-station assembly consists of the CMOS die attached to a breakout PCB, interfaced with millimeter wave probes for input and output data. It also includes a low-speed BNC cable interface for feeding in the parametric bitstream drive.

a, The supply voltage on the saturable gain element alters the transconductance of the cross-coupled pair's transistors and, thereby, the stability of the comb. It has a nominal value of 0.5 V, below which it collapses. b, The polynomial nonlinearity is tuned using bias voltages that set the sensitivity of the transmission line's capacitances to incoming microwaves. c, The initial profile of the 12.5 GHz comb can be altered by feeding parameters through a 32-bit sequence, run cyclically at slow speeds under 150 MHz. This parameterized comb is exposed to incoming drive signals and performs computation on them.

a, Under nominal biasing conditions (power supply of 0.6 V and VNL = 0.6 V) and without the influence of parametric bits and incoming microwave signals, the measured undisturbed frequency comb is centered at 12.47 GHz and has a constant line spacing of 80 MHz. b, The phase noise is measured for various offsets from the central component. While this version of the chip has slightly higher close-in phase noise than conventional CMOS oscillators, microwave neurons built from this modality are stable and highly input sensitive to drive signals.

Alan Estevez was sitting at his dining room table wearing a T-shirt when Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo called on Zoom to ask if he wanted to be the Biden administration's top export control official. “You're going to have to sell me on this,” Estevez recalls telling her.

It was 2021, and the outspoken New Jersey native thought he had finally left public service behind. After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. He wasn't sure if he was ready to go back.

Could he be tempted by the opportunity to help oversee the tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor funding the administration was seeking from Congress? “I came from DOD,” he recalls saying. “$50 billion is OK money, but it's not a lot of money.” Then Raimondo appealed to his sense of service. Estevez gave in and took the job.

By the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. The role he had accepted would turn out to be at the center of America's first serious effort to confront the geopolitical risks of artificial intelligence. Within a few years, the project would reshape relations between the world's two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations.

Shortly after he joined the Commerce Department, Estevez says, he began hearing from officials in the White House. Over breakfast one morning, Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, two key figures working on technology and national security, told Estevez they were planning something big, and they would be needing his help.

Over the next six months, the US government revolutionized its strategy for competing with China, now widely considered the nation's most important technological rival. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. But now, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared that September, “we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”

On October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China's military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. But as observers digested the dozens of pages of technical specifications and legalese, it became clear that the implications of the new policy were far more vast.

In practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry and scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise—futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change—the policy could undermine China. A New York Times writer called it a “declaration of economic war.”

War or not, the Biden administration was placing a high-stakes bet that the United States could use its leverage to hold China back and that the losses in terms of forgone US exports to China and collateral damage to bilateral ties would be worth it. On one hand, it was a gamble that relied on ideas established in Washington decades ago. US policymakers had been using tech restrictions to stymie China's military modernization and punish the country for human rights abuses since the Cold War. More recent advancements in missiles and surveillance technology reinforced that logic. But several people who served in the Biden administration say that a more novel concern was also behind the big bet.

Key officials believed AI was approaching an inflection point—or several—that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore.

This account of how the Biden administration chose to respond is based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal government deliberations.

When the Biden administration introduced its transformative policy, it did not start from scratch. During his first term, President Donald Trump had also targeted Chinese tech, including semiconductor firms, as part of a broader effort to curb the country's technological rise and global influence.

In 2019, the Commerce Department added the Chinese IT giant Huawei to its Entity List, which effectively cut it off from US supply chains, including chips, unless it got a special license. Officials justified the measure with allegations that Huawei had violated US sanctions on Iran. But experts believed they were also trying to undermine the company more generally, fearing that Huawei's exports of 5G wireless infrastructure around the world could give Chinese spies and saboteurs a leg up.

Then the Trump administration doubled down, this time by turning to an obscure legal provision called the “foreign-produced direct product rule.” The FDPR was originally designed to make sure that goods made through US innovation and technology—like missiles or airplane parts—didn't go into weapons systems sold to adversaries, even if those systems were built abroad. In 2020, the Trump administration turned this long-arm tool on Huawei, explicitly targeting the company's “efforts to obtain advanced semiconductors developed or produced from US software and technology,” as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the time.

While the FDPR had previously been used to enforce multilateral arms controls, the move against Huawei targeted “items made with US technology that were not sensitive, that were not on the control list, that had nothing to do with any AI,” says Kevin Wolf, a former Obama administration export control official.

“Everybody thought that would be the end of this very novel extraterritorial control,” Wolf added. Instead, the US government found the FDPR irresistible. It would later turn it on Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and would eventually wield it to constrain high-powered computing in China. “Obviously we started using it like candy,” says Estevez. “Certainly threatening to use it if not actually using it.”

In the first Trump administration, the US added Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), a leading Chinese chipmaker, to the Entity List and brought criminal charges against another Chinese semiconductor company, Fujian Jinhua (a judge later found it not guilty). It also worked with the Netherlands, home to the chipmaking tool giant ASML, to restrict exports of especially cutting-edge semiconductor equipment. All these moves were, in a way, part of normal business amid worsening ties between the US and China. They didn't require visions of advanced AI to make sense in Washington, where traditional concerns about military modernization, rights abuses, and fair markets were more than enough to justify targeted efforts against Chinese tech.

When Biden took office in 2021, some members of his policy team brought with them a novel anxiety: AI systems might become so capable that they would supercharge national power, leaving rival militaries and economies at a great disadvantage.

In early 2019, when you had to be a bit of a geek to have heard of OpenAI's early GPT models, Matheny—one of Estevez's early breakfast partners from the White House—was founding director of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Essentially a think tank housed inside Georgetown University, CSET was launched with a $55 million grant from Open Philanthropy, a group aligned with the effective altruism movement that funds work addressing issues ranging from “potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence” to global health. “AI and other emerging technologies will deliver profound benefits to society, but they will also introduce new risks,” Matheny said at the center's launch.

It wasn't long before CSET scholars identified China's growing strength in AI development as a US national security risk. Those scholars included Tarun Chhabra—the other White House breakfast partner—as well as future Biden administration officials Saif Khan and Ben Buchanan, all of whom studied technology and national security at CSET.

Chhabra coauthored a report published in February 2020 that recommended the United States and key allies “coordinate on the terms under which they will export leading-edge AI chips to China” and “forge a democratic way of AI.” That April, Khan coauthored a separate paper arguing for putting controls on chipmaking equipment to ensure that China remained “reliant on democracies for state-of-the-art chips.” In August, just months before Biden was elected president, Buchanan identified computing power as a key input that allows countries to develop AI and warned that the US was likely running out of time before it could no longer restrain China's access to it. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a research panel created by Congress that included Matheny, also called for “implementing coordinated export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment with allies.”

Chhabra, Matheny, Khan, and Buchanan—four experts with varying backgrounds who crossed paths at CSET—would all go on to work on AI policy in the Biden White House. Once there, they and others, including Chris McGuire, a State Department official who had worked on the final AI Commission report, set to work operationalizing their ideas. One former official recalled that their work to keep advanced chipmaking equipment out of Chinese hands began as early as the transition. The theory was that gatekeeping the tools would ensure there would be no Chinese version of Nvidia and would prevent Chinese companies like SMIC from building cutting-edge factories. This would, as Khan had advocated, keep Chinese AI developers dependent on US suppliers.

As the Biden team assembled in 2021, however, its ambitions were broader. Limiting China's chipmaking abilities would block it from independently building computing power, but Chinese developers could still simply buy the best chips from US companies. As close observers of AI were debating the potential of large language models, no one knew for sure what might be possible in the future with vast quantities of what were then the most powerful chips. Some officials believed that keeping China dependent on US supplies would no longer be enough. It was time, they judged, to build support across the administration for cutting off the chips themselves.

Former officials recall being motivated by a combination of different risks. Some say the idea of artificial general intelligence was explicitly on their mind. (While there is no universally accepted definition of AGI, the term generally refers to an AI system superior to humans across all intellectual fields.) Others say they were concerned more about specific AI capabilities, whether things that had already been envisioned—supercharged propaganda, automated cyber hacking, synthetic bioweapons—or ones yet to be foreseen. Others say their worries were not even directly related to AI, pointing to reporting that a Chinese company may have used US software to develop chips that in turn powered a supercomputer used to develop hypersonic missiles for the People's Liberation Army. The stakes were especially high, some believed, because a powerful AI system might be used to develop even more capable AI systems, compounding a country's lead and leaving competitors not just incrementally behind, but wallowing in a bygone paradigm. If some of these fears sound vague or far out, that's because they are. Policymakers, however, are forced to take action in the face of uncertainty, and here, the uncertainty itself was cause for alarm.

The prescription that officials came up with to meet this challenge—a broad effort to limit China's independent access to computing power—would require buy-in from across the federal government, including several cabinet secretaries and the president himself.

Not everyone was on board at first. The White House team had identified risks that demanded action, but there would also be costs. Nvidia, one of the crown jewels of US tech, would be banned from selling some of its most lucrative products to an enormous growing market. Producers of chipmaking equipment, such as Applied Materials and Lam Research, would lose the ability to sell their advanced products to Chinese factories. Experts believed that China might still eventually succeed in developing its own independent semiconductor ecosystem, and cutting the country off could motivate actors around the world to build an America-free supply chain to avoid future disruptions.

Former White House officials say they worked intensively to understand the potential blowback. The Chinese government's reaction to the move would clearly be negative, but no one could know what form it would take. Would Beijing target iconic US firms like Apple? Cut off supplies of critical minerals? If China retaliated hard, what options would Washington have?

Then there were the specifics. How would the policy distinguish between equipment that really posed a risk, and products companies should still be able to sell? Estevez says he remembers the White House pushed for restrictions on a larger number of items, while the Commerce Department, which is responsible for promoting economic growth, sought a more tailored approach. “Trying to hold China back is a fool's errand,” Raimondo, the commerce secretary, told The Wall Street Journal toward the end of Biden's term, describing export controls as mere “speed bumps” for China.

Yet the administration kept plowing forward. Several former officials specifically cited Chhabra's bureaucratic skill and determination as central to making the chip strategy happen. “American technology should not enable adversaries to build AI capabilities that will be turned against American troops, strategic assets, and critical infrastructure,” says Chhabra, now out of government and leading national security policy at Anthropic. “Strong export controls are essential for America's national security and AI dominance.”

It's not unusual for a group of scholars with a bold new vision for policy to join the government, but it's far less common for their ideas to be put swiftly into action. “Look, Tarun and I argued all the time,” says Estevez, but “moving in the same direction was not the issue.” At least among this group of staffers, the core dispute wasn't over whether they should try to constrain China, but over how—broad restrictions versus targeted measures that preserved more flexibility for industry.

Finding that balance has been a moving target. After the first round of controls in October 2022, the Biden administration decided it needed to further tighten restrictions. Officials had already banned Nvidia from selling its best AI training chip to China, but the company then developed a new, China-specific chip with capabilities that pushed right up to the limits of the existing rules. In October 2023 and December 2024, the Biden administration tightened the controls on both chips and chipmaking equipment to plug what were perceived as unintentional loopholes.

To make any of this stick, however, the Biden administration first needed help from Japan and the Netherlands. Keeping advanced chips out of the Chinese market was a relatively discrete task, targeting just a few products. Undermining Chinese efforts to build cutting-edge chips of their own, on the other hand, was a multinational endeavor. That's because semiconductor fabrication relies on precision machinery and software from around the world, with particularly crucial inputs coming from the Dutch company ASML and Japanese companies such as Tokyo Electron. If the United States banned its equipment suppliers from selling to China, but Japan and the Netherlands kept selling, US businesses would lose revenue, and China would still be able to upgrade its domestic manufacturing.

The Biden administration had sought Japanese and Dutch cooperation at the outset, but there was no quick agreement. So the White House decided to go it alone and announced the 2022 controls before the allies signed on, knowing full well that the move would hurt US companies. The Biden administration then had to convince Tokyo and Amsterdam that joining the effort was worth losing some exports and risking Chinese retaliation. After decades at the Defense Department, Estevez was well aware that AI represented the future of warfare, he says. Whether or not an AI inflection point was coming, he knew military planners would still prefer to face a Chinese adversary that was lagging behind technologically. This idea seemed to also carry weight with allied officials. “The sales pitch to the Dutch and the Japanese was: Artificial intelligence is the future,” says Estevez. “And they bought that.”

One way or another, the persuasion worked. In January 2023, Japanese and Dutch national security officials joined Sullivan at Blair House, the traditional guest quarters for visiting dignitaries across from the White House, to sign an agreement to institute parallel export controls on chipmaking equipment sold to China.

Today, Chhabra works at Anthropic, one of the most well-funded AI startups in the US. Buchanan is a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Khan is a fellow at the Institute for Progress, a think tank focused on innovation. Matheny left the administration in 2022 to become president and CEO of RAND, a storied research organization that often serves government clients. They are each, in various ways, still working on AI, computing, and national security. And they're watching as the Trump administration pulls the country in seemingly conflicting directions.

On one hand, most of the semiconductor controls the Biden team enacted have remained in place. Earlier this year, Trump even put restrictions on another Nvidia chip called the H20, which has proven useful for certain kinds of AI development tasks. Several Biden officials said they would have also moved to cut China off from H20s if they had more time in office.

But after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly began lobbying Trump, the White House abruptly reversed course. In a legally questionable move, Trump said he would authorize licenses for Nvidia to sell H20s to China in exchange for a share of the revenue.

Buchanan says the move undermined what Republicans and Democrats had both agreed was a key national security priority. “Reversing the effective bipartisan course on China AI chip controls, when those chips matter more than ever, is a unilateral surrender,” he says.

Trump, however, has described the situation very differently. “The H20 is obsolete. You know, it's one of those things, but it still has a market,” he said at a press conference on Monday. “So we negotiated a little deal.”

Zheng-Yi Chen, DPhil, associate scientist at the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, and Ines and Fredrick Yeatts Chair in Otolaryngology, at Mass Eye and Ear, is the senior and co-corresponding author of a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, ""Single Dose Genome Editing Therapy Rescues Auditory and Vestibular Functions in Adult Mice with DFNA41 Deafness.""

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?

This study provides an example of a successful use of gene editing technology to treat a mouse model of human genetic hearing loss.

We developed a one-time, gene editing treatment that restored hearing and balance in adult mice with a genetic form of hearing loss called DFNA41, which is also found in humans.

We used a viral vector with a harmless adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver precise gene editing tools into the mouse inner ear. This editing specifically removed the harmful genetic mutation while keeping the healthy gene intact.

As a result, the treated mice regained long-term hearing and balance. The gene editing treatment further protected mice from hypersensitivity to noise-induced hearing loss.

In light of our recent success using gene therapy to treat a different form of genetic hearing loss in children (in one and both ears), we believe this work has potential to become a treatment for patients with DFNA41.

Q: What question were you investigating?

We were investigating whether a single-dose, gene editing therapy could safely and effectively correct a specific genetic mutation (P2RX2 V60L) that causes DFNA41, and whether this therapy could restore hearing in adult animal models, which better mimic human treatment conditions.

We wanted to find out if there is greater benefit if the intervention is carried out earlier. We also wanted to determine if this approach could protect against further damage from loud noise and vestibular dysfunction. These are crucial steps towards our ultimate goal of being able to safely translate this treatment to humans.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We used a gene editing approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, delivered by a AAV2 vector directly into the inner ear of adult mouse model with DFNA41. Our goal was to selectively disable the mutant copy of the P2RX2 gene without affecting the healthy one. This is very challenging to accomplish as there is only a single nucleotide difference between the normal and mutant gene sequences.

To achieve this, we designed highly specific gene-editing tools (SaCas9 with a mutation-targeting guide RNA) that we then delivered using a minimally invasive injection through the round window of the ear. This surgical, delivery approach that has been successfully used in humans.

We verified editing accuracy and safety through genetic sequencing and tissue analysis by monitoring changes in hearing and balance over time using standard auditory and vestibular tests. We also compared the treatment effects from the interventions at different time points.

Lastly, we sought to validate a similar editing strategy in human patient–derived stem cells to assess its potential for clinical translation.

Q: What did you find?

We found that a single injection of our gene-editing therapy into the inner ear of adult mice with DFNA41 successfully and specifically disabled the harmful mutation in the P2RX2 gene while preserving the normal gene. Treating this mutation led to restored long-term hearing and balance in adult mice.

This study also showed that our approach is safe by minimizing risk factors such as off-target effect – or the therapy affecting genes other than the specific one it is targeting -- or viral DNA integration.

We also found the therapy prevented further hearing loss caused by loud noise exposure. That finding is important because this increased hearing-loss risk from noise exposure is a known risk for DFNA41 patients.

Our research also demonstrated better treatment effects from early intervention, suggesting a similar strategy should be applied to humans. We were able to show this approach may have promise as a human treatment, as we identified an effective and specific editing strategy in patient-derived stem cells carrying the same human mutation (P2RX2 V60L).

Q: What are the implications?

Our study shows that gene editing can be used as a one-time, lasting treatment to rescue hearing and balance in adults with genetic inner ear disorders-something previously thought to be possible only during early development.

 This finding has several key implications and may pave the way for future trials testing gene editing approaches for hearing and balance disorders.

First, there is potential for a therapeutic breakthrough, showing for the first time, that precise gene editing can effectively treat dominant, progressive hearing loss in fully mature ears-bringing us closer to real-world applications in humans.

 Current trials have been in children born with deafness. This study showed that our approach can be applied to patients who develop delayed-onset hearing loss, from childhood to adulthood. The study also found a dual benefit of rescuing balance function and protecting against noise-induced hearing loss, offering additional protection for people with genetic susceptibility.

This work lays the groundwork for first-in-human trials for DFNA41, by showing safety, long-term benefit, and success in human stem cells carrying the same mutation. This foundation may also be feasible for other forms of inherited deafness in adults. The mutation-specific design of the therapy highlights the growing potential of precision medicine-tailoring treatments to an individual's specific genetic mutation.

Q: What are the next steps?

Building on our proof‑of‑concept successes in mice and human stem cells, we are now moving toward clinical translation through a series of IND‑enabling studies, with support from a grant from the NIH Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program.

The grant supports two IND-enabling programs of editing therapy for genetic hearing loss, DFNA41 due to P2RX2 mutations and DFNA2 due to KCNQ4 mutations. We aim to complete the biodistribution and toxicity studies in order to initial clinical trials in a few years.

We are working in conjunction with Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute on this grant as well as research efforts to develop platforms and vectors that would speed up the research process, making it easier to test the gene therapy approaches on new genes.

Adolescents who undergo bariatric surgery face a higher risk of weight regain, which can undermine treatment success and long-term health, if they have elevated blood levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) prior to the procedure, according to new USC research. PFAS are manufactured chemicals used in consumer products that accumulate in the body over time and are increasingly linked to a range of health concerns, including kidney problems, liver damage and various cancers. The findings were just published in the journal Obesity.

Bariatric surgery, a form of weight-loss surgery that alters the digestive system, is an effective treatment for severe obesity that can reduce the risk of long-term health problems such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But many people who get bariatric surgery regain significant weight over time, which can limit the procedure's long-term health benefits. Researchers believe PFAS exposure may play a role in weight regain because the chemicals are known to disrupt endocrine and metabolic processes.

With the growing use of weight loss interventions around the world, it's critical for us to understand the association between PFAS and successful weight loss management, including what this means for long-term outcomes.""

Brittney Baumert, PhD, MPH, postdoctoral research fellow in population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and study's first author

With funding from NIH, Baumert and her colleagues conducted the first long-term study linking PFAS exposure to bariatric surgery outcomes in teens. They tracked 186 adolescents for five years, finding that those with higher PFAS blood levels before surgery regained more weight and had greater increases in waist circumference than those with lower PFAS levels. The strongest associations were observed in a class of PFAS known as sulfonic acids, which includes perfluoroctaansulfonaten (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS).

The findings could help health care providers tailor treatment plans to better serve patients, as well as offer hints about the biological mechanisms that underlie the health effects of PFAS. The study also underscores the need for stronger limits on PFAS levels in food packaging, water supplies and other sources of exposure, the researchers said.

""Our study shows a clear association between PFAS exposure and weight-related outcomes in bariatric surgery for adolescents,"" Baumert said. ""PFAS are a modifiable risk, which is why protective policies are so important to reduce exposure and safeguard public health-especially for vulnerable populations.""

The researchers analyzed data on 186 teens from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study who underwent bariatric surgery between 2007 and 2012. Before surgery, blood samples were collected from each patient and tested for levels of seven types of PFAS. Weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured before surgery and six months, one year, three years and five years after surgery.

To analyze the data, the researchers divided patients into three groups based on their blood PFAS concentrations: low, medium and high exposure.

Overall, patients with higher blood levels of PFOS, PFHxS and PFHpS gained more weight and had greater increases in waist circumference one to five years post-surgery, compared to patients with lower blood levels of those chemicals.

To illustrate the difference for PFOS, adolescents with a starting body weight of 328 pounds in the low exposure group regained, on average, 35.9 pounds by the five-year mark. But teens of the same weight with the highest PFOS exposure regained, on average, 46.9 pounds.

For PFHpS, teens in the highest exposure group regained weight at an average of 4.3% of their baseline bodyweight per year, compared to 2.7% per year in the lowest exposure group.

The study adds to the mounting evidence supporting stronger regulation of PFAS, the researchers said-particularly in public water supplies, which are the greatest source of exposure.

It also points to potential strategies for improving patient care. Bariatric surgery is costly and invasive, so understanding who is likely to benefit can help providers make informed decisions about the best course of treatment for each individual.

""We're also interested in exploring whether PFAS exposure is relevant to other weight loss interventions,"" including GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Baumert said.

In addition, Baumert and her team are investigating the link between PFAS and long-term metabolic health. For example: How might PFAS exposure relate to a person's risk for type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)? The researchers are now analyzing those connections using data from the Teen-LABS study.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey filed a $2.45 billion supplemental budget with the Legislature on Thursday. In addition to funding health care initiatives, education and public safety, the governor is also looking to set aside money for the World Cup when it comes to the Boston area in 2026.

The governor's office tells WBZ-TV that Healey is proposing to create a $20 million reserve ""to be used to support activities related to the FIFA World Cup in Massachusetts,"" as well as drive the state's tourism economy. It's not clear yet exactly where the money will go.

""Spending will be determined in coordination with FIFA based on their needs,"" a spokesperson for the governor said.

Among the other expenditures in the supplemental bill are $162.7 million to cover costs for sheriffs in the state, $75 million for housing, $60.7 million for snow removal, $18.5 million for hospital operations and $12 million for universal school meals. 

Gillette Stadium in Foxboro will host seven World Cup matches next summer. Five of those will be in group play, one in the round of 32 and a quarterfinal match. The state is estimating that the tournament could generate more than $1 billion in economic impact for Massachusetts.

The ticket application process will begin in September. Organizers said earlier this month they are looking for thousands of volunteers for different positions in Boston, Foxboro and other locations in Massachusetts during the World Cup. 

A recent poll from Axios Boston found that 56% of respondents said they liked the idea of Massachusetts hosting the World Cup, while 43% were not on board.

	The family carne asada takes a wild turn in Snow Tha Product's hilarious new video for “Sábado.” On Thursday, the Mexican American rap star dropped the video, which slams Trump supporters, with Rolling Stone.


	In the clip, Snow spits fiery bars as the “black sheep” who discovers someone in the family voted for Trump, causing the family party to turn into a big fight. She then starts airing out the traitors in the crew: the ones who backed the pelos de elote (corn-haired) Republican, the cousins who throw around the N-word despite not being Black, and even the homophobic uncles who “are gayer than me” once the drinks hit.


	“[It's] a family gathering gone wrong, with some finger pointing and an attempt at accountability — which, in the video, actually never happens,” Snow tells Rolling Stone. “I wanted the vibes to be felt through the screen, so I brought a bunch of people together to make a video that shows what a lot of us are feeling as a community.”

	











	In the video, Latino social media stapes such as Brown Bag Podcast‘s Letty Peniche and DoKnow, along with TikTok stars like Jesus Acevedo, throw cake at each other and fight after being ignited by Snow's revelations.

	“There's a lot of infighting and a lot of blame being thrown around — and honestly, frustration, and rightfully so,” says Snow. “We're angry, we have so many emotions, and one of them is also finding comedic relief in everything happening right now. You know Latinos always find a way to make fun of our trauma.”

	











	Snow Tha Product has been one of the most vocal Latina celebrities when it comes to the injustices faced. by the Latino community, especially during the recent ICE raids that have roiled Southern California and other Latino communities. She even referenced Trump's alligator Alcatraz on her recent single “Alligator,” or her 2016 single “Immigrants (Despierta).”

	“Sábado” is set to be featured on her upcoming project, titled Before I Crash Out, which features Snow dropping bars in different genres but that all “reflect the feelings we're experiencing right now with everything going on.” At the end of the “Sábado” video, she teases a single titled “Domingo,” out Aug. 27.


	“It's my way to express those emotions — in one sense, it's the expression of all the stages of grief that happen when you lose someone or something,” she says of Before I Crash Out. “In another, it's about that moment when you're ready to crash out because you've simply had too much.”
