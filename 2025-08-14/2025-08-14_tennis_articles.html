CINCINNATI — Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski and partner Erin Routliffe of New Zealand are on to the semifinal of the Cincinnati Open.

The duo beat Caty McNally of the United States and Linda Noskova of Czechia 6-2, 7-6 (3) in the quarterfinals of the women's doubles tournament.

Dabrowski and Routliffe will face Australia's Ellen Perez and Ukraine's Lyudmyla Kichenok in Friday's semi.

Routliffe holds dual Canadian-New Zealand citizenship and had previously represented Canada in tennis.

Dabrowski and Routliffe had six aces to McNally and Noskova's one, and only three double faults to their opponents' seven.

Later, Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime faced world No. 1 Jannik Sinner of Italy in a quarterfinal of the men's singles bracket.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Federer's 2018 season marked the last year he would lift a Grand Slam title, having emerged victorious in the Australian Open final against Marin Cilic. Federer tore through the draw in Melbourne that year, advancing to the championship match without dropping a set, before finally clinching his 20th major crown, a record that would last until 2020. Heading into the US Open that year, Federer was aiming to win the championship at Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2008, but would go on to suffer an enormous upset. He won his first two matches in New York comfortably, earning straight-set victories over Yoshihito Nishioka and Benoit Paire. In the third round, Federer met 30th seed Nick Kyrgios and picked up a fifth straight win over the Australian on Arthur Ashe Stadium. His fourth round opponent came in the form of Kyrgios' unseeded compatriot, John Millman, who, on paper, should have been a much easier test. Federer took the first set against Millman 6-3, and appeared to be well on his way to a fourth consecutive quarterfinal at the US Open. It was the biggest result of Millman's career, who had never beaten a top ten player prior to his clash with Federer. Unfortunately for the former world number 33, he went on to lose in straight sets to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the last eight. Following more disappointing results in 2022, Millman appeared in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the last time in 2023, making it to the second round again at his home major.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atmane, who also won two rounds of qualifying, stunned Taylor Fritz on Wednesday evening, winning 3-6 7-5 6-3. The 23-year-old has also defeated Joao Fonseca and Flavio Cobolli on his way to the last eight. Atmane made his Grand Slam main draw debut as a qualifier at the Australian Open. The Frenchman faced a tricky first-round opponent: former world number one Daniil Medvedev. At the 2024 Australian Open, young Terence Atmane was handed a daunting task against Daniil Medvedev after winning three rounds of qualifying. Atmane stunned Medvedev in the first set, winning it 7-5. Atmane said: “He was telling me, ‘keep going, because you are unplayable'. It was something like that — I don't remember exactly — but it was something like ‘unplayable.' “And then after, he mentioned in the interview, ‘yeah, that guy played like Top 20 for three sets'. Daniil wasn't someone I knew from before.” Terence Atmane's task has become no less difficult after defeating Taylor Fritz. Rune, who defeated Frances Tiafoe in the round of 16, appears to have kicked into form after working with Andre Agassi at the Washington Open. He was recently branded ‘immature' before losing in the Wimbledon first round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alfie Hewett insists he has all eyes on remedying his Wimbledon mistakes as he bids to clinch a consecutive hat-trick of US Open crowns. Hewett won a career 10th Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in January, adding doubles victory alongside long-time partner on the court Gordon Reid in both Melbourne and at Roland Garros. Now, coming off the back of defeats in the men's wheelchair singles and doubles finals at his home Slam at Wimbledon, Hewett admits that he is ready to get back to winning ways on the other side of the Atlantic. "There is always a tournament round the corner and so my attention is now on the US Open. Hewett and Reid were in attendance at the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition, Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, last week. “We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett. "For wheelchair players, there is not a lot of opportunity to play on the grass until you get to the higher levels so to play at Wimbledon is such a good eye opening experience. “Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while. It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this." Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.” Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATP world number one Jannik Sinner might be set to miss out on a big financial boost, as a combination of his doping suspension from earlier in the 2025 season combined with a couple of key tournament misses meaning he will now likely be ineligible to receive a cut of a massive 15.5 million pound Bonus Pool on offer for the men's tennis stars. As per a new ATP initiative that began in 2023, the thirty men's players who score the most points in the tour's Masters 1000 series are eligible to receive a portion of a 15.5 million pound prize pool. However, with only 9 of these events across a calendar year, participation and involvement in as many of these tournaments as possible is essential. Thus far this season, Sinner has only participated at his home tournament at the Rome Masters, where he reached the final, and now in Ohio. Sinner, having missed the Masters events in Miami, Indian Wells, Madrid, and now most recently in Toronto, will therefore be out of the running for the bonus prize pool. The first three tournaments in that list took place during Sinner's high-profile suspension from tennis, in which he missed no grand slams but did miss a string of important tournaments. Most recently, a pair of long tournaments at the French Open and his title-winning bid in Wimbledon forced Sinner to withdraw from the Rogers Cup in Toronto, marking it as his fourth missed mandatory event. He also missed the Monte Carlo Masters, although that event is not classified as mandatory due to its smaller draw size. Sinner was the winner of the Bonus Pool's top spot after his unprecedented 2024 campaign, but will be out of the running for this year's award. At the moment, Carlos Alcaraz has a comfortable 500-point lead in first place in the Bonus Pool standings, ahead of Brit Jack Draper and Italian Lorenzo Musetti.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Damir Dzumhur turned a moment of potential chaos into pure highlight-reel magic at last month's Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, claiming July's Hot Shot of the Month award in spectacular style. In his quarter-final clash against Titouan Droguet, the Bosnian star found himself in a split-second scramble at the net. After carving a delicate backhand slice, Dzumhur watched as Droguet unleashed a daring ‘tweener from deep in the court, which kissed the net cord and sharply changed direction. But with incredible reflexes and a lightning grip adjustment, Dzumhur pounced and landed a clean winner. The rally was classic Dzumhur, who is known for blending speed, anticipation, and court craft into moments that leave fans gasping. 56 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has built a reputation for thriving in cat-and-mouse points, where quick thinking is just as important as quick feet. With his latest honour, Dzumhur joins the likes of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz as winners of the fan-voted award.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors 1 Jannik Sinner will look to snap a losing run against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime, while Holger Rune will have to face Terence Atmane, who has broken through on the ATP Tour this week. It's been a dream week for Atmane, which peaked Wednesday after the Frenchman stunned Taylor Fritz 3-6 7-5 6-3 for his first Top 10 win. Rune is defending semifinalist points at this event, and he's been steady this tournament with three straight-set wins. Neither players have been able to make a ton of first serves in their previous matches, hovering around 50-60%, so that shot will be critical. Rune has the tendency to break down physically in hot conditions, but he hasn't played a ton of matches, and it may be tough for Atmane to back up a big win. Auger-Aliassime could use a big tournament result in Cincinnati, and it's already been a strong event for the Canadian should he lose in this stage. He's just inside the Top 30, and typically plays his best tennis on these types of hard courts. The Italian was vulnerable at times in a 6-4 7-6(4) win over Adrian Mannarino in the fourth round, and Auger-Aliassime did defeat the Italian at this very event in 2022. Sinner's consistency has greatly improved since then, something that Auger-Aliassime still struggles with. Because of that, Sinner should be the strong favorite to get through this match, but I won't rule out a three-setter here.

Arif and Seed, 14, who both attend King Edwards Grammar School and live in Chelmsford, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club. Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week. Arif, who described Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz as his tennis idols, soared to victory in the boys' U18 doubles finals alongside close friend and schoolmate Seed and revealed it was an experience he will never forget. "There is no one I would rather win with here than Kai. We are both quite relaxed and it's always better playing with someone you know. "It was never really a big dream of mine but I used to want to be a professional tennis player. I really hope it can help with my composure and learning how to handle pressure in everyday situations." This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Arif representing Hampton Sports and Leisure Tennis Club. “It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.” Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. “This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.” Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the championship match of last year's Wimbledon, Barbora Krejcikova defeated Jasmine Paolini 6-4 in the third to claim her second Major singles title. On Thursday, we get the rematch, and Paolini gets a chance to avenge that heartbreaking loss. Also on Thursday, two of the ATP's strongest hitters collide in a fourth round contest, as recent Toronto champion Ben Shelton takes on Jiri Lehecka. Plus, multi-time Major champs Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff will both be in action. Jasmine Paolini (7) vs. Barbora Krejcikova – Not Before 1:00pm on Center Court Paolini has not dropped a set through two rounds, despite arriving in Cincy having lost three of her last four matches. And three of the four sets she's contested have been decided by tiebreaks, so she's playing her best at crucial moments. Jasmine owns 30 wins this season, as she now vies for her second Cincinnati quarterfinal within the last three years. By contrast, Krejcikova has already contested a trio of three-setters this past week, which includes a notable win over Elina Svitolina. The Wimbledon final is their only prior encounter, outside of a qualifying match seven years ago at the Australian Open, which also went Krejcikova's way. I favor the more match-tough Paolini to get some revenge from last year's Wimbledon, and advance to her second Cincinnati quarterfinal. Ben Shelton (5) vs. Jiri Lehecka (22) – Not Before 4:30pm on Grandstand His title run last week in Canada included victories over four top 20 players (Cobolli, de Minaur, Fritz, Khachanov), to earn the biggest title of his career. The now-23-year-old was a semifinalist last year on the clay of Madrid, yet hasn't advanced beyond this round at a Masters tournament since that run. Their only previous meeting occurred two months ago on grass in Stuttgart, where Shelton was victorious 6-4, 6-4. On a similarly-fast surface in Cincinnati, and in his home country, I like a confident Ben to prevail again on Thursday. In a matchup where both possess similar styles, confidence and home court advantage will be crucial differences. Bronzetti is another woman to already survive three third-sets, and has upset two seeds (Kasatkina, Ostapenko) to equal her best-ever result at a WTA 1000 event. Coco is 2-0 against Lucia, with two straight-set victories. He's actually 0-2 against Auger-Aliassime, though they haven't played since this same event three years ago, and both are very different players in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka has confirmed that she will not be playing mixed doubles at the US Open next month as she is staying ‘loyal' to Grigor Dimitrov. 1 was set to join forces with the Bulgarian but has been forced to abandon those plans as he is currently sidelined through injury. Sabalenka will head to Flushing Meadows as the reigning women's singles champion, and she looked set to take aim at completing a hat-trick of successes at the competition – having won the women's doubles title in 2019 with Elise Mertens. However, she felt that there was never a right time to bid for glory on that front until the recent format changes – which includes shorter matches and the competition itself taking place prior to the singles draw. The 34-year-old was hospitalised at Wimbledon last month when he led Jannik Sinner by two sets to love in a gruelling clash.

Sabalenka has been offered the chance to compete alongside other players, but he shut down that talk, saying: “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.” Pressed on why she won't opt for a new partner, the 27-year-old insisted that she wanted to stay ‘loyal' to Dimitrov, who was the driving force behind the original plans. The duo had teamed up previously at the 2022 World Tennis League exhibition tournament in Dubai, and although they tasted defeat that day, Dimitrov was keen to make amends at Flushing Meadows. Speaking about how the plans were formed to tennis.com, Sabalenka explained: “He was texting me, non-stop, begging me to play,” Sabalenka exclaimed with a laugh after advancing at the Berlin Tennis Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Open mixed doubles week will soon enthrall tennis fans with an amazing showcase featuring some of the biggest names from ATP and WTA. While stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Taylor Fritz, Elena Rybakina, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro are just some of the names looking toward the lucrative $1 million glory, fans were also hoping to see three-time slam queen and World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka on court. Sabalenka snatched an easy win on Wednesday evening at the ongoing Cincinnati Open. With that, the Belarusian has kept her hopes alive to defend her title from last season at the WTA 1000 event. But it was her post-match reaction that ended up catching more attention. For the uninitiated, Sabalenka was supposed to play the mixed doubles campaign in New York with Bulgarian ATP pro Grigor Dimitrov. Seems like Sabalenka made up her mind to play alongside Dimitrov. Proving her loyalty to Dimitrov, she simply responded, “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.” WTA #1 Aryna Sabalenka says she does not plan on playing US Open mixed doubles with a new partner after her original partner Grigor Dimitrov pulled out, mentioning being “loyal” to Dimitrov. “Well there is a few guys who are asking, but, no, I don't think so.” Probably that's another reason why Sabalenka's name wasn't there in the confirmed list of pairs released last month. Speaking of which, she's looking solid already to enter New York in a stable form, especially given her ongoing streak in Cincinnati. However, Sabalenka is going to face a tough challenge ahead when she steps on the court for her quarterfinal battle. Similar to Aryna Sabalenka, Kazakh tennis star Elena Rybakina's got a hard-hitting playing style too. Both tend to hit the ball with brute force, which makes for an intense clash whenever they are up against each other. Take, for example, their recent meeting in Berlin. Is Sabalenka's loyalty to Dimitrov admirable or a missed opportunity for US Open mixed doubles glory? Sharing her honest reaction after escaping Rybakina, the Belarusian confessed, “Elena, she's a great player and we've had a lot of tough battles … I have no idea how I was able to win those last points. Yes, she's leading 7-4 in the H2H battle, but Sabalenka knows how tough it becomes for her every time to get past the 2022 Wimbledon champion. Rybakina, on the other hand, is coming off her R16 win against 2025 Australian Open queen Madison Keys. Do you think Sabalenka will be able to move past Rybakina in the quarterfinal to keep her Cincinnati campaign alive?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terence Atmane was struggling in March. But after notching some results starting in April, he slowly began to climb. On Aug. 13, he broke into the projected top 100 rankings after logging the biggest win of his young career, taking down ATP No. Atmane, who entered the tournament as a qualifier, came back from a set down to take the match 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. "That's a crazy win for my young career," Atmane said. "So, definitely out of words right now. I believed that I could beat Taylor Fritz tonight on Court 3, and this is what happened." Atmane, 23, has toppled Italian world No. 22 Flavio Cobolli and Brazilian ATP No. 52 Joao Fonseca after making it out of qualifiers en route to his best-ever ATP Masters 1,000 run. Atmane had only won five tour-level matches before arriving in Mason, Ohio, but after beating Fritz, he has nine. Near the match's end, Atmane led 5-3, needing to hold his serve to secure the match. Atmane said the rankings position and prize money will help him progress his career and invest in his team. Next, the Frenchman will face ATP No. 9 Holger Rune as the last match on Center Court Aug. 13. "This is just the beginning, and I need to work hard to stay consistent to rise in the rankings and keep going like this," Atmane said.
