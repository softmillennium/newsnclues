The detection of viable life is a key objective for both in situ astrobiological experiments on extraterrestrial bodies, and for planetary protection protocols on Earth following sample return.

We evaluated the potential for common bacterial and archaeal intact polar lipids (IPLs) to be used as viable life markers owing to their particularly fast rate (hours to days) of post-mortem degradation.

We determined the chemical signatures of IPLs using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (with and without derivatisation), to simulate the results of in situ pyrolytic organic analyses.

Monoglycerides, formed as pyrolysis products of typical bacterial IPLs, were the strongest signature for the parent compounds, and were identified in both the pyrolysis of a phospholipid mixture and freeze-dried bacterial culture.

Our results demonstrate that relatively rapid and elegant pyrolysis techniques can reveal the presence of IPLs, and therefore evidence of viable life in extraterrestrial samples.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna detailed her experience with what she described as an unidentified flying object (UFO) during an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. She said she saw an airspace incursion, which is the unauthorized entry of an aircraft into a designated area of airspace. and the TV show "X Files" were popular, so she wasn't frightened or freaked out. Still, she said based on her experience, as well as photos she's seen, there "is definitely something that I can tell you with confidence that exists that we don't know how to explain currently." Rogan asked why the pilots wanted to keep it a secret, as he wondered if it was an aircraft from another country. Luna said she got the impression it was a UFO due to the way one of the pilots was talking about it, noting that he seemed to fear there would be repercussions if he spoke to her about it. Now, as a state representative, she said she and a few of other elected officials have talked to pilots about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) incidents. In a 2023 report, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office noted that a "reported UAP very likely was an ordinary object and was not exhibiting anomalous or exceptional characteristics or flight behaviors." The Committee investigates government transparency on a variety of topics, including UAPs. Luna, meanwhile, promoted the podcast on social media. She also shared a few clips from the podcast on her X account, noting that they talked about banning insider trading, capping student loan interest, UAPS, JFK, and more. Luna, 36, is currently serving her second term as the Representative for Florida's Thirteenth Congressional District. "Raised by a single mother in Southern California, Anna's tough upbringing taught her the importance of hard work and grit," her website noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Celtic manager's choice of attire sparked chatter among a section of supporters already on edge over the lack of incoming transfers, with two weeks left before the window shuts. One of the more outlandish theories even made its way onto Superscoreboard, the Scottish football phone-in where a certain type of caller thrives on far-fetched conspiracies. Rodgers today dismissed the speculation in a typically forthright fashion. ‚ÄúIt's unbelievable, someone has told me this here, it's like I'm supposedly sending messages, kidding, as if! ‚ÄúI'm basically like everyone else, see when it's really hot, you have to take off your jacket, your tie, and see when it's really cold, you wear a jumper. ‚ÄúSo I remember last year I wore a jumper, people said, what, he's sending a message ‚Äî what message? I was wearing a jumper on in my big coat and it was up to there and I'm fine. ‚ÄúI'm basically like everyone else, see when it's really hot, you have to take off your jacket, your tie, and see when it's really cold, you wear a jumper. ‚ÄúAnd last week, there's two grounds I've realised in my career that are absolutely boiling if you get it at the time and the sun's hitting your dugout ‚Äî Pittodrie and Preston. So I thought, well I've either take off my jacket or take off my tie. Rodgers' comments underline just how heightened the atmosphere around Celtic is at present. For the manager, however, Sunday's look was nothing more than a reaction to the Pittodrie sun. Notify me of follow-up comments by email. Notify me of new posts by email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas ‚Äì the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth ‚Äì it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas ‚Äì bigger than Mount Everest ‚Äì hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ‚Äúnot natural‚Äù. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding ‚Äì things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ‚ÄúIndependent Media‚Äù. Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ‚ÄúBeyond the Light Barrier‚Äù, published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna detailed a bizarre UFO encounter involving an ‚Äúairspace incursion‚Äù that left an experienced military pilot rattled while she was serving in the US Air Force. Luna (R-Fla.) told Joe Rogan on Wednesday that she experienced an alarming event that she still questions today during her time stationed at the Portland Air National Guard Base as an airfield management specialist. ‚ÄúThere had been an airspace incursion that had taken place when I was still at the Guard, and I remember talking to some of the pilots about it, and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat was that? Luna served six years in the Air Force as an airfield management specialist, overseeing airfield safety and efficiency, including coordinating flight operations and frequently communicating with F-16 pilots. However, when she asked the pilots, none of them were willing to talk about what they saw in the sky. ‚ÄúThey're like, ‚ÄòEh, we can't really talk about it.' And no one really wanted to address it,‚Äù the 36-year-old Florida representative recounted. After mulling it over, Luna said, she concluded that airspace incursion was likely an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP). ‚ÄúFrom what I gathered, he didn't want to get taken off flight status, and was like, ‚ÄòI really can't discuss it,'‚Äù she said. Luna further explained that there's a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù stigma around those who report seeing UAPs, and for members of the armed forces, that could jeopardize their security clearance and reputation. ‚ÄúWhat I can tell you is, when you have thousands upon thousands of people from around the planet throughout time that have reported something, to say those people are crazy ‚Ä¶ that's a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,‚Äù she told Rogan.

In 2025, there have already been more than 2,100 sightings of UAPs across the US reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, marking a significant increase from the 1,492 sightings reported throughout all of 2024. The Pentagon has remained firm in saying that there is no evidence that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial life and disavowed the existence of any UFO retrieval programs. Last week, a Harvard physicist asserted that new images of the Manhattan-size interstellar object rocketing through our inner solar system back his claim that it's not a comet, but instead possibly an alien probe that may ‚Äúdestroy us.‚Äù ‚ÄúHere, the glow is actually in front of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Astrobiology poses fundamental questions about life in the universe: How did it emerge? Danilo Albergaria and his colleagues examined three kinds of sources of information about science: academic papers, press releases and news articles. They found that the most frequent speculations were about conditions or ingredients for life beyond Earth, followed by speculations on the existence of life. They also found speculations about the outcomes of the search to be uncommon, while speculative content on potential evidence pointing to life detection is rare. The promise that astrobiology is making progress in the search for life was also quite common, with about one-fifth of press releases and news articles exhibiting this kind of content. In contrast, they found that promises of life detection are very rare. "Among news articles, we examined those covering studies published in peer-reviewed journals. News articles presented more speculations and promises than press releases and papers, but press releases had slightly more speculative content when communicating about the significance of research results. "This may reflect pressures for institutional communications to emphasize the impact of a study to grab media attention," explains Albergaria. The team also mapped how frequently speculations and promises appeared associated with authors of studies, with outside experts or without attribution to researchers. Press releases presented speculations most frequently in quotes of authors of studies, while in news articles speculative content appears more balanced between quoted researchers and without attribution to scientists. The study also found that expectations about the search for life are more associated with exoplanet research than solar system exploration, and much higher than about the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Albergaria ponders that speculations are not necessarily bad science communication. "Speculative imagination helps to develop concepts and hypotheses that guide the search. There are many unknowns about life in the universe and that's why speculations in the communication of astrobiology seem almost inevitable. So, it's still difficult to clearly distinguish unwarranted speculative content and legitimate contextualization," he explains. In total, 630 articles were subject to a quantitative content analysis. Articles came from six reference newspapers: The New York Times (U.S.), The Guardian (U.K.), Folha and Estad√£o (Brazil), P√∫blico (Portugal) and El Pa√≠s (Spain). Media coverage of astrobiology frequently includes speculation, especially about conditions for life beyond Earth, with news articles showing the highest levels of speculative and promising content compared to press releases and academic papers. Expectations for technological advances and progress in the search for life are common, while explicit promises of life detection remain rare.

It is the fear of abandonment, yes, but also the fear of not being understood that drives us to be seen and heard. Andhera, the latest horror/sci-fi entry on Amazon Prime Video is concerned about the traumas and anxieties of the youth and their capacity to be understood in a world that is largely growing distant.

Andhera review: Karanvir Malhotra leads the new horror show, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video. It is the fear of abandonment, yes, but also the fear of not being understood that drives us to be seen and heard. Andhera, the latest horror/sci-fi entry on Amazon Prime Video is concerned about the traumas and anxieties of the youth and their capacity to be understood in a world that is largely growing distant. Great on paper, but unfortunately, that does not translate on screen as Andhera walks within a timid, misguided circle of what is scary. Andhera, which translates to darkness, starts off with quite a promise. The seedy lanes and corridors of Mumbai at night trace back to the frantic cries of a distressed woman running away from something, and seeking help from a certain Dr. Prithvi, inside a hotel room. That is of no avail as a dark matter emerges from the walls, creeps up to her, and seemingly, engulfs her. In a parallel track, we also track the recurring hallucinations that Jay Sheth (Karanvir Malhotra) keeps having about the same woman and a sinister force of darkness that comes alive. It will be revealed that his brother Prithvi (Pranay Pachauri) is in a coma- and that Jay's visions are, incidentally, linked to the disappearance of Bani. Jay gets in touch with Rumi (Prajakta Koli), a YouTuber with a show on paranormal presence in Mumbai- a track only the makers can make sense because I failed to do so. Together, they have their own search for what this ‚Äòandhera' means, and whether it is a bigger threat than what is imagined. Andhera is clearly ambitious in its concept and design. Created by Gaurav Desai, Andhera sprawls over a range of characters and is interested in exploring the space between supernatural horror and sci-fi. The catalyst for these ideas to land is, however, thinly imagined, where this central entity of this ‚Äòandhera' and whether this can be pulled into create another realm of human unconsciousness. To land these ideas, it needed a tighter, more ruthless script that could push these characters to their extremes so that Jay's fear and emotional disconnect, in particular, would feel palpably real. Even as Ketan Sodha's brooding music is quite effective here, the show quickly crumbles under its own weight. In a show where there is an element of suspense and intrigue, the viewer is already two steps ahead in calculating what might arrive next. In Andhera, Bani's disappearance is the focal point, and the viewer is not kept in secret about the fact that there are threads which will connect her case to Prithvi, and then to this healing centre called Aatma (herein comes Surveen Chawla as the manager, in a thankless role). The subtext of mental health issues, which starts from Jay's anxieties and panic attacks, leads nowhere after a point. Fear is a very valid emotional response today, given the amount of misinformation, displacement, and violations that take place in the world around us. It appears that Andhera started off somewhere in these discussions and amalgamated into a stagnant mess, after which there were no answers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jared Padalecki, who's known for starring in Supernatural opposite Jensen Ackles, has opened up about the details revolving around his reunion with Ackles in The Boys season 5. Padalecki has joined the cast of The Boys final season, alongside Misha Collins, who also appeared in Supernatural. It is not yet clear who Padalecki will be playing in The Boys, but it was confirmed that he will be appearing as a guest star and he and Ackles will have a scene together, at least. Both Padalecki and Ackles have appeared in all 15 seasons of Supernatural. During Fan Expo Boston, according to Collider, Padalecki was asked about his character in The Boys, and he revealed that his character will pop up in the new season's fifth episode. I'll say this much ‚Äî my character is very excited to meet Soldier Boy. I think they're putting out the first four episodes and then a little bit of time and then the final four episodes. No details have been revealed about Padalecki's character, but based on the casting of Collins as well, there could be an actual reference to Supernatural in the show. Based on Padalecki's comments about how young audiences should not be tuning in for his episodes in the final season and that his character can't wait to meet Soldier Boy, it feels as though a potentially sexual or violent undertone to the character is being teased. Padalecki's answer to the question at Fan Expo Boston indicates that the season will be just as over-the-top as its predecessors. Padalecki is certainly teasing a great season of The Boys. Padalecki is definitely making expectations high, so the fifth and final season of The Boys must truly deliver to not disappoint fans. Supernatural is an iconic show, so having these actors reunite on an equally iconic show like The Boys seems perfect. It is not clear if there will be a clear reference to Supernatural in The Boys, but one can hope for some tongue-in-cheek fun. The Boys is a gritty and subversive take on the superhero genre, focusing on a group of vigilantes who confront powerful superheroes abusing their abilities, exploring themes of corruption and moral ambiguity in a world where heroes are not always what they seem. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Be the first to post your thoughts. Sci-fi is always impressive on the big screen, but these shows prove that TV is the best format for epic space-operas or chilling dystopian visions. Intense martial arts action and fight scenes aren't limited to the big screen, as these incredibly martial arts TV shows all prove. Detective series can risk being same-y while following a formula.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna claimed on Joe Rogan's podcast that the US has credible evidence of ‚Äúinterdimensional beings‚Äù and advanced, non-human technology. Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a close ally of United States President Donald Trump and current chair of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, made massive claims about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. While refraining from disclosing classified information, Luna stated that she has personally viewed photographs of unidentified objects inside a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). While speaking in the podcast, Luna explained that these objects do not appear to be man-made and could involve advanced technology far beyond current human capabilities. She implied that these entities may not be extraterrestrial in the traditional sense but might instead operate in ways that challenge our understanding of space and time. Although she did not elaborate further due to security restrictions, she noted that these accounts suggest the objects in question are capable of navigating through ‚Äútime spaces‚Äù in ways that conventional science cannot yet explain. That inquiry included analysis of incidents reported at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. She argued that withholding such data undermines public trust and limits scientific inquiry into potentially groundbreaking phenomena. Her remarks comes days after similar statement by US Vice President JD Vance. JD Vance revealed a few days ago that he is fascinated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and stated he plans to probe the matter during the upcoming congressional break. What were those videos about?‚Äù Vance was quoted as saying. He acknowledged that in spite of his curiosity, he has not gotten to the bottom of it yet and added that the August recess will give him time to ‚Äúdive into the whole UFO thing from last year‚Äù. His remarks came amid shift of interest into UAPs, following a year of drone sighting reports and congressional hearings about drone sightings.
