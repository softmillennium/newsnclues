                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies slipped on Thursday after rising producer prices blunted rate-cut hopes, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government wouldn't start cutting checks to flesh out its strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin changed hands around $118,000 on Thursday, a 2.9% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The PPI report snapped a strong trading week for Bitcoin, with the asset's price setting a new all-time high above $124,000 on Wednesday, while Ethereum surged toward record levels. The Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks price changes across a broad range of goods and services for producers, jumped 0.9% in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists expected the index to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis. Representing the largest monthly increase since May 2022, Thursday's hotter-than-expected PPI reading showed an increase in the index's trade component, a worrying sign for the Federal Reserve, according to Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at personal finance firm SoFi. ‚ÄúThe Fed will not like this report,‚Äù she said on X. The central bank has held interest rates steady so far this year, fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could make it harder to achieve its 2% inflation goal. US Will Not Be Purchasing Any Bitcoin, Treasury Secretary Bessent Says Although Bessent's comments may have worked in Bitcoin's favor earlier this week, with risk assets like stocks and crypto historically benefiting from lower interest rates, his latest comments appeared to dampen enthusiasm towards the coin on Thursday. The official said that the government is ‚Äúnot going to be buying‚Äù Bitcoin to supplement its existing holdings of confiscated assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dropped sharply after a higher-than-expected US PPI print shocked traders. Bitcoin drops below $118,000 after a hot US PPI print fueled inflation concerns. Federal Reserve interest rate cut odds dropped to 90.5% from 99.8%. Double top signals and short-term pullbacks in BTC price give altcoins room to rally. Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back sharply from its fresh all-time high of $123,400, dropping to $117,400 on Thursday. This is the largest monthly rise in US PPI since June 2022. The stronger price pressures stand in stark contrast to cooler July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Tuesday, which outlined headline inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year and core CPI at 3.1%, reinforcing a bullish case for risk assets at the time. While CPI data fueled optimism for a near-term interest rate cut, the hotter PPI release complicates that narrative. Higher-than-expected producer prices signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to delay monetary easing. For Bitcoin, this could limit upside momentum in the short term. Data from CME FedWatch still points to a 90.5% probability of a 0.25% rate cut on Sept. 17, although it's notable that the likelihood had spiked to 99.8% on Wednesday. üá∫üá∏ UPDATE: The probability of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in September has risen to 99.8%. Related: Bitcoin's new record high has traders asking: Did BTC price top at $124K? Cointelegraph noted a bearish divergence between price and relative strength index or RSI, after BTC tagged new highs above $123,000, possibly leading to liquidity grab from its previous highs. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin's recent leveraged unwind has absorbed key internal liquidity zones between $119,000 and $117,500. If Bitcoin maintains support above $112,000, altcoins could thrive in a consolidation-driven setup. A drop below $112,000, however, would signal a shift in the lower time frame market structure, potentially triggering corrections toward lower areas of interest between $105,000 and $110,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- U.S. regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and pending Senate bills is driving traditional banks like JPMorgan to explore crypto-linked financial products. - Crypto job markets show growing specialization, hybrid work models, and AI skill demands as institutions prioritize advanced expertise over entry-level hires. - The hiring surge reflects crypto's rising legitimacy, with traditional firms building teams to offer comprehensive digital asset services and address regulatory compliance. Charles Schwab and Fidelity are among traditional financial institutions expanding their presence in the cryptocurrency sector, as evidenced by their recent hiring activities for senior roles in digital asset management and risk analysis [1]. These roles include positions such as senior product manager for crypto trading and a crypto technology risk analyst, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating blockchain and digital assets into mainstream financial services. Fidelity, which manages $6.4 trillion in assets, is also reinforcing its internal crypto capabilities. Its recent hiring of a crypto technology risk analyst reflects an increasing emphasis on managing and mitigating the unique risks associated with digital assets [1]. The Trump administration's passage of the GENIUS Act on July 18 has brought greater clarity to stablecoin regulation, encouraging major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to explore digital-asset-linked financial products. The U.S. Senate is also expected to consider a market structure bill upon returning from recess in September, which could further facilitate the integration of crypto with traditional financial services [1]. The demand for remote work is also shifting toward hybrid models, and skills in artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly essential [1]. This hiring surge underscores the growing legitimacy of crypto as a financial asset class. The broader financial ecosystem is adapting to accommodate crypto, with risk management, regulatory compliance, and client education emerging as key areas of focus [1].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charles Schwab, Fidelity and other traditional companies based in the United States are hiring for senior crypto positions to seemingly make a push into the industry. Schwab, for instance, is hiring for a senior product manager in crypto trading and a senior product manager in crypto onchain experiences. As Cointelegraph has reported, the $10 trillion asset manager plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) spot trading, with BTC trading services available by April 2026. Fidelity, which has $6.4 trillion in assets, is hiring for a crypto technology risk analyst. The hiring surge comes as the Trump administration pushes for better regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets. On July 18, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, which regulates stablecoins and their issuers. The clarity surrounding stablecoins has led traditional finance institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to explore financial products tied to digital assets. The US Senate is expected to consider a market structure bill when it returns from recess in September. The bill is expected to deliver further regulatory clarity and support crypto integration with traditional players. According to a report from crypto job site Web3.career, positions in crypto are evolving, mirroring the change in the industry as it matures. Geographical salary arbitrage is still present, with crypto jobs in emerging markets generally outpacing the salaries of jobs in other industries. Remote-first companies are becoming increasingly rare, as companies prefer a hybrid work approach, allowing quicker dissemination of knowledge. Entry-level jobs are slimming down as well.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Block, Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) has unveiled Proto Rig, a first-of-its-kind modular bitcoin mining system, and Proto Fleet, a free and open-source fleet management software platform, marking a bold step toward decentralizing mining hardware, increasing operational efficiency, and boosting Bitcoin network resiliency. The announcement took place at Core Scientific's facility in Dalton, GA, where Proto Rigs are already deployed as part of its mining fleet. This launch represents the first two end-to-end releases from Proto, Block's suite of bitcoin mining products and services, following its initial chip sale to Core Scientific. These issues lead to wasted power, poor space utilization, and shorter life cycles. On the software side, miners are often forced to piece together multiple tools to manage power scaling, monitoring, and diagnostics ‚Äî creating a fragmented and costly operational environment. Operators can swap out individual hashboards instead of replacing entire units, cutting upgrade costs by 15‚Äì20% per cycle. With 1.5x more power per foot of rack space than traditional hardware, Proto Rig was built for compatibility with both modern and legacy infrastructure, to allow seamless integration without costly retrofits. Alongside the hardware, Proto Fleet aims to deliver a comprehensive, open-source fleet management software that consolidates power-scaling, monitoring, diagnostics, and maintenance tools into a single intuitive platform. ‚ÄúMining hasn't really caught up with advances in software more broadly,‚Äù Templeton noted. ‚ÄúWe saw an opportunity to make mining software something modern that improves operational efficiency instead of unnecessarily complicating things.‚Äù By making Proto Fleet free for anyone to use, Block is leveling the playing field for mining operators of all sizes, ensuring access to high-quality management tools without proprietary lock-ins. Together, Proto Rig's repairability, power efficiency, and backwards compatibility, paired with Proto Fleet's streamlined, open-source software, could help redefine the economics and accessibility of bitcoin mining. This launch further underscores Block's broader commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem, alongside its other initiatives through Square, Cash App, Bitkey, and Spiral.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICO-era whales are cashing in as the price struggles to break its all-time high of $4,891. The price has pulled back 1% in the last 24 hours and is now finding support around $4,600. An early Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) participant has realized significant gains after offloading a portion of their holdings. The investor, who originally purchased 100,000 ETH for $31,000 during the ICO, recently sold 4,283 ETH for approximately $18.97 million. Since 2021, the wallet has sold a total of 44,284 ETH, generating around $105 million at an average price of $2,378 per token. Despite these sales, the address still holds 55,716 ETH, currently valued at about $261.6 million. Overall, the investor's total profit from these transactions stands at $366.8 million, marking an extraordinary 11,835x return on the initial investment, reported LookonChain. Following the recent rally, about 98% of ETH holders are in profit, which further raises the chances of profit-taking. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported that Ethereum's ‚ÄúPercent Supply in Profit‚Äù metric exceeded 98% on Thursday, marking its highest level in two years. The indicator tracks the proportion of ETH coins currently valued above their last on-chain transaction price. Coins are considered ‚Äúin profit‚Äù when the market price is higher than their previous transaction price and ‚Äúin loss‚Äù when it is lower. Historically, levels above 95% indicate an overheated market nearing a local peak, as the majority of investors sit on unrealized gains. I keep saying this, your time to buy $ETH isn't right now, that was earlier. I'd prefer to wait for a strong correction to be chasing a position in $ETH. So far, ETH treasury firms like Bitmine Technologies have supported the upside rally amid heavy accumulation over the past two months. The coming weeks will reveal whether whales are using this demand as an opportunity to exit their positions. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spot ethereum ETF inflows for the week stand at $2.2 billion so far, dwarfing their bitcoin counterparts. US spot ethereum ETFs have recorded $2.2 billion of inflows this week so far, the most these investment vehicles have ever seen and a figure multitudes higher than spot bitcoin ETFs' weekly inflows of $331 million, according to SoSoValue. As a result of the price decline, centralized exchanges liquidated more than $182.4 million ethereum long positions in the last four hours, data from analytics platform CoinGlass shows. The wait time for the exit line to clear is 12 days and 11 hours, which is higher than the entry queue wait of three days and 19 hours, according to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in. The total amount of tokens waiting to be unstaked is also at its highest point ever since staking withdrawals went live in 2023. TheBlock reported that a whale address (0x815) that participated in ethereum's initial coin offering sent $5.1 million worth of tokens to a Kraken deposit address on Thursday, bringing its total transfers to the centralized exchange to $24.1 million this week. TeraWulf jumped more than 32% in early trading this morning after it announced two 10-year $3.7 billion AI hosting deals with AI cloud platform Fluidstack. Under the high-performance computing colocation agreements, the bitcoin mining company will deliver 200 megawatts of IT load at its Lake Mariner, New York, data center. ‚ÄúFluidstack is proud to be a trusted provider of critical compute for the world's leading AI labs. Our partnership with TeraWulf reflects our shared commitment to delivering rapid, scalable infrastructure for the AI frontier,‚Äù C√©sar Maklary, Fluidstack cofounder and president, said in the release. The company also announced a long-term ground lease for 183 acres at the Cayuga site in Lansing, NY, a deal that ‚Äúmarks a major step forward in the company's expansion of high-performance computing (HPC) and AI data center hosting.‚Äù Crypto treasury firms focused on solana hold in total 3.4 million tokens, with Upexi, DeFi Development Corp., and Sol Strategies taking the top spots. Meanwhile, Asia's largest corporate bitcoin holder reported positive Q2 results. Standard Chartered raised its price target and now expects ethereum to reach $7,500 by the end of 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dinari, a U.S.-based provider of tokenized public securities, is set to launch its own blockchain, joining the latest wave of firms to build their own infrastructure. The network is custom built using Avalanche's (AVAX) tech stack. "This is going to be the foundational infrastructure for our settlement and clearing system, which has up to this point predominantly happened off-chain," Gabe Otte, CEO and co-founder of Dinari, told CoinDesk in an interview. Proponents say tokenization could enable round-the-clock trading, faster settlements while reduce costs. Recently, digital trading platform Robinhood introduced stock tokens on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum ARB$0.5173 for EU users with future plans to build its own chain, while crypto exchanges including Kraken, Bybit also started offering tokens of U.S. stocks and ETFs. In June, Dinari obtained a broker-dealer registration by FINRA with an approval to tokenize National Market System (NMS) securities, offering a compliant solution to issue token version of U.S. public stocks. Dinari's decision to build its own chain follows a recent pattern seen across fintechs and crypto firms. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle and payments company Stripe revealed this week to pursue proprietary blockchains. Rival tokenization firms like Ondo Finance and Securitize (teamed up with Ethena) are also working on their own networks. For Dinari, having their own chain was "out of necessity," Otte said. Another key reason was to facilitate and coordinate trades of Dinari-issued tokens across multiple blockchains without fragmenting liquidity. With a purpose-built chain that allows us to essentially pull liquidity across all these different chains." For choosing Avalanche to build on, Otte emphasized the need for flexibility and the ability to control transaction fees (gas prices), which is difficult with rollup and layer-2 solutions. Avalanche's blockchain service, Ava Cloud lets businesses spin up and customize blockchains for their own needs, said Morgan Krupetsky, VP of ecosystem growth at Ava Labs. At the start, governance will come from a consortium of institutions including Gemini, custodian BitGo and asset manager VanEck, who will serve as validators and also offer custody services. That includes potentially launching the chain's own governance token, he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This month, one such early ETH backer has revealed a portfolio tilt toward the Top Crypto ICO featuring Pepe Dollar (PEPD), along with meme heavyweights SPX6900 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE). The investor in question was among the earliest to back Ethereum in its 2014 crowdsale, turning a modest initial outlay into generational wealth. Their strategy in 2025 mirrors that early conviction ‚Äî finding projects with massive upside before they hit mainstream markets. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) stands out as the only meme coin in this selection with a utility-driven roadmap. Built on Ethereum, it merges meme culture with DeFi-compatible payments, a Layer-2 scaling backbone, and aggressive burn mechanics. SPX6900 has become a phenomenon in absurdist meme coin culture. The seed investor isn't looking at SPX6900 for long-term fundamentals, but rather for its proven ability to rally thousands of percent on hype waves. In a bull market, these spikes can deliver quick profit rotations into more stable holdings. With ultra-low fees, anti-bot features, and a meme-launchpad ecosystem, LILPEPE is positioned as a growth hub for the next wave of viral tokens. The presale's rapid sell-through rate and nearly doubled pricing in early stages suggest strong demand before listings. By entering presales like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and LILPEPE early, and holding a tactical SPX6900 position for volatility spikes, they're building a portfolio that balances moonshot potential with blockchain network strength. Even with SPX6900's hype and LILPEPE's Layer-2 appeal, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) remains the central piece. That dual appeal could allow PEPD to retain value long after speculative froth fades. The best cryptos to buy now, according to one of Ethereum's earliest backers, are not just blue-chip altcoins ‚Äî they're presale meme coins with viral potential and network compatibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine if your paycheck wasn't just a figure in your bank account, but a living digital asset that reflects the work you do, in real-time. This idea is being brought to life by platforms like Soneium, which intelligently integrate culture and technology to create crypto payroll solutions that are more accessible and secure. Crypto payroll platforms are being adopted more often, especially as businesses go remote. This is where crypto payroll platforms step in, allowing businesses to pay employees using digital currencies. Naturally, this is particularly appealing to tech-savvy employees and those in creative fields. Soneium, built atop Ethereum's Layer 2, is a prime example of this trend. It uses blockchain tech to ensure transactions are smooth and offers a crypto-friendly payroll platform that supports various payment structures, including stablecoin payments. Web3 is bringing a fresh take on corporate banking by providing decentralized solutions that make financial management more efficient. Traditional banking often lags behind the fast-paced digital world, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In contrast, Web3 corporate banking solutions allow for real-time transactions, lower fees, and better security. It allows them access to essential financial services without the limitations imposed by traditional banks. This not only fosters innovation but also encourages the creation of crypto-native business tools for modern enterprises. By intertwining technology with cultural aspects, Soneium is crafting a unique ecosystem. Their partnerships with anime brands and emphasis on community engagement show how important culture is in shaping crypto payroll solutions. Regulatory hurdles, tech integration issues, and market acceptance can be tough. Complying with KYC and AML regulations can be particularly challenging, as the decentralized nature of crypto lacks clear guidelines. Startups that manage to tackle regulatory concerns and create user-friendly platforms could find themselves thriving in the evolving landscape of crypto payroll. By harnessing blockchain tech and focusing on user experience, solutions can be developed that meet regulations while enhancing the payroll process. Soneium's combination of blockchain tech and cultural engagement sets the stage for a new era in crypto payroll solutions. Crypto payroll solutions are set to change how we think about work and payment. With both culture and technology driving this change, Soneium isn't just a payroll platform; it's shaping the future of how we work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The data, which was first posted on the social media platform X, includes screenshots from the XRPL Console and examples of live transactions, forming what the validator described as a clear on-ledger footprint of unusually large and repetitive transfers between exchange addresses. Out of roughly 1,000 XRPL nodes in existence, about 150 to 170 are active validators, and Grape's node is one of them. Grape confirmed that he has been operating a validator since July 12, 2025, which has given him real-time oversight of transactions on the network. Interestingly, Grape stated that his findings are the result of systematic tracking using a custom Python tool that is designed to monitor and flag payments above 10,000 XRP. Since activating his validator, he has documented thousands of such high-value movements, often involving popular crypto exchanges like Bitget and Binance. The destinations and sources of these payments often connect to exchange-controlled wallets. The screenshots shared show consistent high-value movements to and from these crypto exchanges. An example is shown in the Console data below. This trend is more of an organized pattern rather than normal trading activity among traders. Grape explained that XRP's price is often calculated using volume-weighted averages. As such, repeatedly moving large volumes between exchanges can inflate these volume figures and manipulate the calculations of market cap. This activity, referred to as wash trading, is done to create an impression of artificial demand, which in turn tricks other people or other automated bots into buying into the crypto. One of the responses came from ‚ÄúCrypto Bitlord,‚Äù an account with over 415,000 followers on the social media platform. In response, Grape noted that an enhanced version to deeply analyze and identify XRP price manipulation is currently being developed. Grapedrop's findings certainly raise concern, but they stop short of actually proving price manipulation. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The altcoins have it even worse, with more painful declines that have harmed over-leveraged traders, as the total value of wrecked positions surges toward $1 billion. However, it dropped by a few grand later during the day and calmed at around $121,000. BTC bounced off almost immediately and now sits a grand and a half higher, but it's still $5,000 away from the new peak charted earlier today. What could have had a bigger negative impact on BTC's price is actually the wholesale inflation data that came out earlier today. Nevertheless, the liquidations have skyrocketed to over $930 million on a daily basis. Moreover, they are close to $460 million in the past hours alone.

An Ethereum initial coin offering whale sent a further 1,060 ETH worth $5.1 million to a deposit address labelled as belonging to Kraken on Thursday ‚Äî their fourth transfer to the crypto exchange in as many days, according to onchain analysts. Approximately 4,657 ETH remain at the address, per Arkham data, worth $21.9 million. While it is not certain that the participant no longer owns the ETH, such transfers to crypto exchange deposit addresses often indicate selling. On Monday, another Ethereum ICO participant transferred 2,300 ETH, worth about $9.9 million, according to Lookonchain. That whale originally received 20,000 ETH for roughly $6,200, which is now valued at around $94 million. The Ethereum ICO ran from July 22 to Sept. 2, 2014, raising about $18.3 million by selling over 60 million ETH at an average price of $0.31 per ETH, with 1 BTC initially buying 2,000 ETH. The funds, equivalent to 31,531 BTC, supported the development of Ethereum, which subsequently launched in July 2015 with an initial supply of 72 million ETH, 83% of which went to ICO investors. Ethereum is currently trading for $4,718, per The Block's ETH price page, up 23% over the past week to come within 3% of its prior all-time high of around $4,868.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr say autonomous AI agents could become Ethereum's ‚Äúbiggest power user.‚Äù They could use a revived web standard to make crypto payments without human help. Autonomous AI agents are programs that can make decisions and complete tasks without human control. According to Coinbase (COIN) developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr, these agents could transform Ethereum's role in global commerce. That standard is HTTP 402, also called ‚ÄúPayment Required.‚Äù When combined with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3009, it allows AI agents to send stablecoin payments automatically. Once the payment is confirmed, the service delivers what was requested, whether that is data, storage, or computing power. In other words, it turns APIs into services that can directly check a wallet's balance and process a payment in one simple step. This is where Ethereum's strengths come into play. Its settlement system can handle payments instantly without the delays and intermediaries of traditional finance. Instead of invoices and disputes that can take days, Ethereum processes everything on the spot. According to the developers, AI agents ‚Äúneed atomic payments, programmable policies, and composable wallets. For example, Hyperbolic Labs has integrated HTTP 402 into its large language model AI. Prodia Labs is using it to pay for the creation of images and videos. Moreover, Coinbase has also built its own version called the ‚Äúx402 payments protocol,‚Äù available for other developers on GitHub. By connecting multiple services in a chain, AI agents could eventually create complete economic loops without human involvement. This ties into a trend already visible in crypto markets. AI agents are trading cryptocurrencies by reading market data and executing orders in real time. If they can also pay for services directly, their role could expand into areas like transportation, content creation, and data management. Self-driving taxis could pay for their own charging stations. If this adoption accelerates, AI agents could become Ethereum's biggest power users and help push blockchain technology into the mainstream far beyond just the crypto space.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Project Acacia is a research initiative led by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) that explores how digital forms of money‚Äîincluding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), stablecoins, and deposit tokens‚Äîcan support the development of wholesale tokenized asset markets in Australia. This includes testing the end-to-end capabilities required for the issuance, trading, settlement, and distribution of a tokenized security to clients of commercial banks holding Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs). The proof-of-concept involves simulated transactions, with plans to progress towards a live pilot using real assets and money in future phases. As a technology provider in Project Acacia and to use case collaborators, Fireblocks powers secure infrastructure that enables every stage of the transaction lifecycle‚Äîfrom issuance to final settlement. Fireblocks' prior experience from the first phase of the CBDC pilot and our work in Project Acacia is helping to advance Australia's digital finance infrastructure. By demonstrating how a wholesale CBDC can enable secure, efficient settlement across various forms of tokenized money, we aim to lay the groundwork for scalable, risk-reduced tokenized asset markets.
