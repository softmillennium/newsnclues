                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maura Healey filed a $2.45 billion supplemental budget with the Legislature on Thursday. In addition to funding health care initiatives, education and public safety, the governor is also looking to set aside money for the World Cup when it comes to the Boston area in 2026. It's not clear yet exactly where the money will go. "Spending will be determined in coordination with FIFA based on their needs," a spokesperson for the governor said. Gillette Stadium in Foxboro will host seven World Cup matches next summer. Five of those will be in group play, one in the round of 32 and a quarterfinal match. The ticket application process will begin in September. Organizers said earlier this month they are looking for thousands of volunteers for different positions in Boston, Foxboro and other locations in Massachusetts during the World Cup. A recent poll from Axios Boston found that 56% of respondents said they liked the idea of Massachusetts hosting the World Cup, while 43% were not on board. Neal J.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is calling for more than 65,000 volunteers to help out in the soccer tournament's 16 host cities. New Englanders can volunteer at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, where the Boston matches will be played, organizers said. Other Boston-area volunteers might be stationed at local hotels and airports. Prospective volunteers will also have to pass a background check and attend volunteer team tryouts. All volunteers must commit to eight shifts between June 11 and July 19, 2026, organizers said. You can apply to be a volunteer on the FIFA website. Volunteers will receive an official World Cup 26 volunteer uniform, meals and refreshments, an exclusive reward and recognition items, and a volunteer certificate for their service, organizers said. More information can be found on the Boston FIFA World Cup 2026 website. Tickets to watch the matches can be purchased starting on Sept. 10.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No doubt, Fulham will feel a bit up against it heading into the club's Premier League opener, away at Brighton. Nicknamed “Jedi,” he's proven capable of containing Bukayo Saka and Mohamed Salah on one end before dependably squaring crosses right into his striker's stride. He gutted out an injury to his right knee until season's end, finishing third in the fan-voted Player of the Season pageant after a 10-assist campaign. On Thursday, 48 hours before a trip to the AmEx, Silva confirmed that Robinson would not be available for selection as he works back from an offseason surgery on that vital plant-leg knee. So, too, would Ryan Sessegnon, leaving the Portuguese manager without his two top options at left back. Mauricio Pochettino may still be envying Silva's situation. It's hardly a new phenomenon that the U.S. men's national team is dangerously thin at left back. In fact, the program went over a decade with makeshift solutions, forcing players like DaMarcus Beasley and Fabian Johnson to own the role despite spending their careers up until that point further afield. While U.S. Soccer can't take credit for Robinson's development, his commitment was a clear end to holding the left side of the back line together with duct tape and chewing gum. While Robinson has amassed a tidy 50 caps to date, he's been absent for the last four camps under Pochettino, a 12-game sample from which the coach has learned plenty about his player pool. He's had his initial trust in Diego Luna validated by a star-making turn at the Gold Cup. Mexico is back on the ascent, although that's a bit more of a subplot than usual as both nations will abstain from World Cup qualifying this cycle. And, more relevant to today's news via Silva: he doesn't have a clear alternative to Robinson at left back. Unlike other USMNT mainstays like Gio Reyna, Pochettino and Robinson have already logged a bit of collaboration. When an ailment kept Robinson out for the Nations League's business end in March, it became a calamity: Panama targeted out-of-position Max Arfsten and, later, Joe Scally, exploiting the latter's lack of awareness to score a last gasp winner in a 1-0 semifinal upset. Scally went on to start the third-place game, putting in such a poor shift that he got a halftime hook. John Tolkin, of recently relegated Holstein Kiel in Germany, has made five appearances, while Scally and DeJuan Jones have each appeared twice in the role. None have made a terribly compelling case for further looks. Throughout the Gold Cup, Arfsten and Tolkin — as indicated by their higher utilization — were the two options on Pochettino's squad. His attacking contributions were that of an ideal wingback, logging assists and chipping in goals as an auxiliary threat from wide. Tolkin, largely as a substitute, has at least spent his career in the role since debuting with his boyhood New York Red Bulls. His issues more closely mirror the struggles recently seen from young left backs George Bello, Kris Lund and Sam Vines: bona fide left backs, but unable to prove themselves at the international level. Unlike other spots, there's no alternative who hasn't been tested and is flying under the radar. The closest to matching that mold is Caleb Wiley, the Chelsea prospect who earned three caps in 2023 and 2024 but hasn't been in a national team camp since Pochettino took charge. While it's impressive for a 20-year-old to have amassed 135 club appearances, mostly with Atlanta United before the club from London came calling, his first loan with Strasbourg was inconclusive. There's Scally shifting over from right back (and Sergiño Dest before him, the first-choice option in that spot), who fancy themselves to put in a shift on the left. Even then, it weakens the right back contingent that is seemingly three players deep: Dest, Scally, Alex Freeman. If Robinson's recovery timetable will keep him out of the next international camp spanning from Sept. 1-9 (the fifth-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup), those speculative alternatives may get another chance to log starts and fortify their cases for inclusion.

No matter how often he hears the Number 10 role is "dying," he'll always leave a light on for the next great playmaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have made a stunning move to tie their leadership team to new long-term contracts following the club's remarkable success last season. According to the Telegraph, the Blues have handed bumper six-year contract extensions to co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart as well as recruitment chiefs Joe Shields and Sam Jewell. The new deals will run until 2031. It's a massive show of faith and confidence in the quartet's vision and the progress the club has made under their guidance. Chelsea are using the same contract blueprint they apply to players and coaching staff. The extended contracts are heavily performance-based, which aligns with the club's philosophy of rewarding success and results. Since the arrival of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly in 2022, Chelsea have invested north of £2 billion in transfers, while recouping around £900 million through sales. Winstanley and Stewart took up their co-sporting director roles in January 2023 and orchestrated a massive shift in the club's recruitment strategy alongside Shields. Jewell joined the bandwagon a year after Winstanley and Stewart, bringing his experience and expertise to the operation, which has become the envy of most Premier League clubs. After a rocky start to life at Chelsea, the project has finally started delivering positive results.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has never been a more talented USMNT roster with a squad filled with players competing for some of the biggest clubs on the planet. The USMNT has also never employed a more accomplished manager than Mauricio Pochettino, who was hired in September of last year. Those two facts, not opinions, should have American soccer fans counting down the days until the start of the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in North America with 78 of the 104 matches set to be played on U.S. soil. It is not an exaggeration to say that next year's World Cup is the biggest, most important soccer event in the history of United States soccer. It's exactly what the federation was meant to build ahead of 2026. Outside of a disastrous performance when the tournament begins in June, it's a scenario that's seemingly impossible to mess up. (Photo by Manuel Velasquez Figueroa/USSF/Getty Images for USSF) What's surprising about this situation, however, is that it's captain Christian Pulisic delivering self-inflicting wounds and making the USMNT far easier to hate than to like. Hey USA Soccer, This Is An Absolute Joke. Pulisic opted out of competing for the USMNT during the Gold Cup earlier this summer, choosing to take the time to recover from a lengthy club season with AC Milan. Pulisic, however, is not taking that scrutiny well. Instead of acting like a thick-skinned leader who has hoisted a Champions League trophy and many more in his still-young career, he's decided to bitch and moan about the outside noise in his self-titled documentary series. Pulisic's father also jumps in on the trash talk in what is a 59-second clip of pure cringe. Weah pointing out that the national teams before them haven't won anything as if his generation has done something remotely impressive on the world stage is mindboggling. In another clip, Pulisic mocked the media for reporting and speculating about him opting out of competing in the Gold Cup. Every American sports fan should want to embrace this USMNT ahead of the World Cup, but instead of anticipation and excitement building, it's dread and disinterest that are building.

U.S. women's national soccer team legend and Connecticut native Alyssa Naeher is coming to Southern Connecticut State University for a live event.

The Stratford native and World Cup and Olympic champion will conduct an in-depth conversation moderated by sports broadcaster Christine Huber.

The event, set for Friday, Oct. 24, will take a behind-the-scenes look at Naeher's career and her impact on the game before she is honored ahead of the U.S. women's match against Portugal at Rentschler Field on Oct. 26. The first 2,000 fans who attend the game will also receive an Alyssa Naeher bobblehead.

Naeher will reflect on her journey from playing on soccer fields in Stratford to global recognition as one of the top goalkeepers in the world.

The 37-year-old retired from international competition last year after a decade-long career that included two FIFA Women's World Cup Championships (2015, 2019), an Olympic gold medal (Paris 2024), an Olympic bronze medal (Tokyo 2020), and being named The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper of the Year (2024).

She is still playing professionally in the NWSL however, with Chicago Stars FC.

The event will take place at the John Lyman Center for the Performing Arts on Southern's campus beginning at 7 p.m.

Ticket information can be found on SCSU's website.

In recent months, the current generation of USMNT stars, led by Mauricio Pochettino, has been under the microscope, attracting major criticism from some of the stars of old, including Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey, and Lalas, for what they have perceived as a lack of drive, competitiveness, and misplaced priorities. These sentiments came to the forefront following the USMNT's abysmal CONCACAF Nations League title defense in March, which saw them lose to both Panama and Canada, before Pulisic and AC Milan teammate Yunus Musah both controversially opted out of summer call-ups for their Gold Cup run. But while such criticism had died down of late, with the USMNT having last played on July 6, losing 2-1 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final, the flames of debate have been fanned by Pulisic and Weah, after their comments calling out their critics were publicized in the Paramount+ docuseries, Pulisic. “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when, especially, all pundits want to say, ‘They didn't want it. After a clip of Donovan criticizing the USMNT was then played, Weah, who recently completed a loan move to Olympique Marseille from Juventus, opted for a more pointed response, saying, “I think those guys are chasing checks and for me I just feel like they're really evil honestly because they've been players and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed and those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day.” He went on to add how their USMNT predecessors “didn't win anything either.” They're evil…but you respect them?” Lalas wrote in response. Landon Donovan was on best U.S. World Cup team in history. Don't bring your dad to a fight. We're ~300 days from a home World Cup,” he added. “At a time when we should be excited/confident about what next summer can bring, instead there's apathy/concern re this USMNT. America want to like you...so let them.” Lalas also took the opportunity to fire back after one follower suggested the media covering the USMNT was “made up of nothing but overly negative old guys.” He said he had done his utmost “to guard against being "grumpy old man" stereotype of ex-player turned media. I want USMNT to succeed, but not at expense of being honest.” The USMNT is scheduled to return to action on September 6 when they host South Korea in the first of two friendlies, with Japan taking on Pochettino's side three days later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have parlayed their faith in a number of their leadership team by handing key members of the club hierarchy contract extensions. The Blues are experiencing an upswing in momentum after a positive end to the last Premier League season saw them finish fourth - and return to Champions League football after three terms - and secure the UEFA Conference League trophy. Enzo Maresca has been hard at work reshaping the team to his preferred image in the transfer market, recruiting stars such as Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, and Jorrel Hato to join his revamped side. But the club have managed to secure critical outgoings too, with Armando Broja, Joao Felix, Noni Madueke, and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall among those to have moved on. Amid this purple patch, a number of Stamford Bridge's major deal-makers have been rewarded for the work they have carried out over the last few seasons. Make your 7 picks by 12.30pm on Saturday, August 16 to win £1,000* Sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart are two of Chelsea's leadership team to have been rewarded with new deals As per Telegraph Sport, since the summer of 2022, Chelsea have spent a staggering £2billion, but around £800-900m has been earned in player sales in the opposite direction. Standout signings spearheaded by the Blues' leadership team have included Cole Palmer, Moises Caicedo, and Enzo Fernandez, as well as women's team manager Sonia Bompastor, and Enzo Maresca. Chelsea have carved out a reputation for handing players bumper multi-year deals, and another cornerstone of the strategy that the leadership team have created is centred around the 'three pillars' of quality, mentality, and playing experience. Bringing important figures such as Enzo Maresca and Cole Palmer to Stamford Bridge has been a key part of their new strategy However, a number of younger stars like Palmer have now accrued vital Premier League experience, helping fuel Chelsea's belief in signing emerging talents. Among those to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer is teenager Estevao Willian, who was signed for the club last summer, but played his final at Brazilian side Palmeiras before joining up with Chelsea after his 18th birthday. Maresca's side will be keen to back up a strong - if shortened - pre-season in their opening match of the season on Sunday, against Community Shield winners Crystal Palace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are set to donate funds earned from the recent FIFA Club World Cup to the family of late Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, it has emerged. Both players tragically died early last month in a car accident in northern Spain, with tributes continuing across England when the new Premier League season opens this weekend. It is also thought that the club will cover education costs for each of his three young children over the coming years as a further gesture. But the Reds are not alone in pledging their financial assistance. Chelsea are reported by The Athletic to be planning on making a donation to the family, paid out of Club World Cup prize money. A Jota donation will come from that pot, agreed between the club and players that it will be an equal share. It is thought that could be a pre-tax amount in excess of $500,000 (£367,953). At Premier League games played from Friday night—when Liverpool begin the defence on their title against Bournemouth—through to Sunday afternoon, a moment of silence will be observed in memory and tribute to the brothers. In addition to Liverpool, Jota's former club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, have planned their own special tributes, including a tifo at Molineux.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Pumas back-row star Marcos Kremer has drawn a comparison between the All Blacks and Argentina's 2022 World Cup-winning football side ahead of this weekend's Rugby Championship clash between the nations in Cordoba. The 28-year-old is among several players who will make their first Test appearances of the year after being included in Argentina's squad for this year's prestigious Southern Hemisphere tournament. Kremer, who currently plies his trade with Top 14 outfit Clermont Auvergne, is set to return to Los Pumas‘ matchday squad in Saturday's clash with the All Blacks, whom he rates highly. “It's like what any football team must go through with Argentina. “I think right now it's going to come down to the final minutes with a small difference between the teams, depending on how things go and how each team's mindset and mentality work during the week. Rugby Championship preview: ‘Highly motivated' Argentina braced for tough campaign despite 2024 success Kremer has been struggling with a knee injury since last year's Rugby Championship and is relishing the opportunity to return to the international arena. “Playing in this jersey after not having played for two or three months, I don't think there's going to be much change,” he said. Argentina head into their clash with the All Blacks after sealing a solid victory over Uruguay in their final mid-year Test, but prior to that, they suffered back-to-back losses on home soil against England. However, they have been bolstered by the return of several stars, with Juan Cruz Mallía, Santiago Chocobares, Bautista Delguy, Mateo Carreras and Ignacio Ruiz joining Kremer as players who have been called up to head coach Felipe Contepomi's squad for the first time this year. Meanwhile, Contepomi has also been boosted by the return of Tomas Albornoz, Gonzalo Garcia, Franco Molina and Joel Sclavi, who all started in Los Pumas' memorable 28-24 victory over the British & Irish Lions in June but were rested during the two-Test series with England in July. In other news, Benjamín Grondona, Emiliano Boffelli and Thomas Gallo were not be considered due to injury.

Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he announced that he would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team's last competitive tournament before next year's World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a second-straight 50-game season with Milan. Pulisic's decision elicited strong critiques from ex-US players such as Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad and Herculez Gomez. The series also includes segments focused on Pulisic's personal life, and the role his family plays within his inner circle. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,” he said. But Christian doesn't give a shit what anyone says.” Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Christian also repeated a retort he used earlier this year, in an appearance on CBS Sports' Call it What You Want podcast, which had been heavily critical of his decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup. “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all pundits say ‘they didn't want it,' ‘they didn't have the heart,' ‘back in our day we would fight and we would die on the field,'” he said, insisting again that national team results affect him deeply. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. “But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either. … Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak negative on us.” The team will not play in European competition this year, with Pulisic missing time in preseason due to an ankle injury.</p>

Although the project's sole proposal was a camouflage-covered Adistar HRMY, other products have surfaced via sample lookbook and internal launch descriptions—all prepped in anticipation of the FIFA World Cup 2026. Complex has shared unauthorized photos of the latest linkup between BAPE® and the Three Stripes, a partnership that's been in motion for more than 20 years. The aforementioned Adistar HRMY running shoe dons the most eye-catching makeover of the newly-surfaced footwear trio, as Adidas Samba and Campus 00s offerings keep things understated in mostly "Off White" and "Core Black" looks, respectively. STA™ emblems take over sidewalls on both Originals styles. An unshakeable trend at the moment, running gear and its aesthetic has taken over inline and collaborative projects from some of the biggest sportswear brands. The special edition Adistar HRMY goes all-out with streetwear inspiration, donning a trefoil-modified ABC Camo in green across the upper. Shark-reminiscent teeth land throughout the sole unit, which features a REPETITOR cushioning solution and plastic plate wedged in-between. In addition to limited edition footwear, BAPE® is expected to release a handful of different apparel items and accessories in celebration of the North America-hosted football tournament. Enjoy early-looks at the Adidas-backed project by BAPE® ahead. All World Cup-inspired items should release via Adidas.com in the first-half of 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DALLAS — Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux has traveled nearly 8,000 miles to Qatar this week for meetings ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, sources tell WFAA. The chief, who just completed his first 100 days in office, is speaking with Qatari security officials about security for the World Cup next year, the sources said. A Dallas Police spokesperson declined to comment on the chief's calendar. WFAA has submitted a public records request for the information. A Dallas City Hall source said FIFA paid for the trip. North Texas will host more matches in the 2026 World Cup than any other city, including a much-anticipated semi-final. An Arlington Police Spokesperson said no one from that department was traveling to Qatar this week. Chief Comeaux is overseas during a busy week at Dallas City Hall. On Tuesday, the city's Community Police Oversight Board met and debated its response to its June inquiry about DPD cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Dallas City Manager Kim Tolbert unveiled her budget Friday and proposed a 5.7% increase in funding for public safety -- the majority of which would flow to Comeaux's department. She held her first budget workshop with Council members on Tuesday.</p>
