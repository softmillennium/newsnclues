                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience? We developed a one-time, gene editing treatment that restored hearing and balance in adult mice with a genetic form of hearing loss called DFNA41, which is also found in humans. We used a viral vector with a harmless adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver precise gene editing tools into the mouse inner ear. As a result, the treated mice regained long-term hearing and balance. The gene editing treatment further protected mice from hypersensitivity to noise-induced hearing loss. In light of our recent success using gene therapy to treat a different form of genetic hearing loss in children (in one and both ears), we believe this work has potential to become a treatment for patients with DFNA41. We were investigating whether a single-dose, gene editing therapy could safely and effectively correct a specific genetic mutation (P2RX2 V60L) that causes DFNA41, and whether this therapy could restore hearing in adult animal models, which better mimic human treatment conditions. We also wanted to determine if this approach could protect against further damage from loud noise and vestibular dysfunction. We used a gene editing approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, delivered by a AAV2 vector directly into the inner ear of adult mouse model with DFNA41. This is very challenging to accomplish as there is only a single nucleotide difference between the normal and mutant gene sequences. To achieve this, we designed highly specific gene-editing tools (SaCas9 with a mutation-targeting guide RNA) that we then delivered using a minimally invasive injection through the round window of the ear. This surgical, delivery approach that has been successfully used in humans. Lastly, we sought to validate a similar editing strategy in human patient–derived stem cells to assess its potential for clinical translation. Treating this mutation led to restored long-term hearing and balance in adult mice. This study also showed that our approach is safe by minimizing risk factors such as off-target effect – or the therapy affecting genes other than the specific one it is targeting -- or viral DNA integration. We also found the therapy prevented further hearing loss caused by loud noise exposure. Our research also demonstrated better treatment effects from early intervention, suggesting a similar strategy should be applied to humans. We were able to show this approach may have promise as a human treatment, as we identified an effective and specific editing strategy in patient-derived stem cells carrying the same human mutation (P2RX2 V60L). Our study shows that gene editing can be used as a one-time, lasting treatment to rescue hearing and balance in adults with genetic inner ear disorders-something previously thought to be possible only during early development. This finding has several key implications and may pave the way for future trials testing gene editing approaches for hearing and balance disorders. First, there is potential for a therapeutic breakthrough, showing for the first time, that precise gene editing can effectively treat dominant, progressive hearing loss in fully mature ears-bringing us closer to real-world applications in humans. Current trials have been in children born with deafness. This study showed that our approach can be applied to patients who develop delayed-onset hearing loss, from childhood to adulthood. The study also found a dual benefit of rescuing balance function and protecting against noise-induced hearing loss, offering additional protection for people with genetic susceptibility. This work lays the groundwork for first-in-human trials for DFNA41, by showing safety, long-term benefit, and success in human stem cells carrying the same mutation. This foundation may also be feasible for other forms of inherited deafness in adults. Building on our proof‑of‑concept successes in mice and human stem cells, we are now moving toward clinical translation through a series of IND‑enabling studies, with support from a grant from the NIH Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program. The grant supports two IND-enabling programs of editing therapy for genetic hearing loss, DFNA41 due to P2RX2 mutations and DFNA2 due to KCNQ4 mutations. We are working in conjunction with Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute on this grant as well as research efforts to develop platforms and vectors that would speed up the research process, making it easier to test the gene therapy approaches on new genes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation announces a significant advancement in addressing the fight against cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), a life-threatening syndrome responsible for over one-third of cancer-related deaths. This dysregulation leads to the depletion of HNF4α, a crucial transcription factor governing liver protein metabolism. By targeting the right cervical vagus nerve through surgical, chemical, electrical, or non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation methods, the research team successfully restored vagal function. This intervention reestablished normal liver metabolism, reduced systemic inflammation, and alleviated cachexia's clinical manifestations. Importantly, combining vagus nerve modulation with chemotherapy yielded synergistic effects, significantly improving health and survival outcomes in mouse models. Cachexia has long been a devastating complication for cancer patients. Dr. O'Raw's work not only uncovers the biological mechanisms at play but also presents a tangible intervention strategy with real potential to transform patient care." Dr. Ali Khademhosseini, Director and CEO, Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation Dr. Aliesha O'Raw, Principal Investigator of the study, added, "This research demonstrates how neuromodulation can reshape systemic metabolism and control inflammation. Targeting the vagus nerve is a promising therapeutic approach that could be translated into non-invasive treatments to alleviate cachexia and enhance cancer therapy outcomes." This innovation paves the way for future clinical trials and could redefine cachexia management in oncology. Vagal blockade of the brain-liver axis deters cancer-associated cachexia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But with age, it can become less capable of doing so. However, Mayo Clinic researchers have found that some older people maintain "immune youth" – a new term coined by Mayo researchers to explain a young immune system in someone over age 60. We are studying why some individuals have a 'fountain of youth' in their immune systems. Dr. Weyand's research team discovered this cellular fountain of youth in more than 100 older patients who came to Mayo Clinic to receive treatment for an autoimmune disease that affects the arteries, including the aorta, called giant cell arteritis. These immune cells behave like young stem cells that usually regenerate and aid healing and growth; but in this case, they were spreading the disease. This team of researchers also discovered autoimmune stem cells in humans previously. "We observed that these patients have very young immune systems despite being in their 60s and 70s. But the price they pay for that is autoimmunity," she says. Autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and organs. "Contrary to what one may think, there are benefits to having an immune system that ages in tandem with the body," says Jörg Goronzy, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic researcher on aging who is a co-lead author of the paper. Immune aging is a sophisticated adaptation mechanism that the immune system can use to prevent autoimmune disease, say the researchers. They are in the process of developing new diagnostic tests that will help find patients and healthy individuals who carry high numbers of immune stem cells and may be predisposed to autoimmune disease later in life. The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions. (2025) Sustained immune youth risks autoimmune disease in the aging host.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High levels of triglycerides, the most common type of fat in the body and the foods we eat, directly cause abdominal aortic aneurysms, according to a study in mouse models led by Michigan Medicine. Researchers identified triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and proteins that regulate triglyceride metabolism, including APOC3 and ANGPTL3, as causal drivers of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The study challenges the longstanding belief that triglycerides are merely biomarkers of vascular disease and instead demonstrates that they play a direct and pathogenic role in aneurysm development, growth and rupture. We have known that hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm, but this multidimensional study pinpoints hypertriglyceridemia as an essential contributor to the development and growth, as well as dissection and rupture, of aortic aneurysms. Our findings suggest that managing triglycerides could become a powerful therapeutic strategy." Using three different mouse models of hypertriglyceridemia, the research team demonstrated a triglyceride dose-dependent effect on aneurysm severity. Moderate elevations in triglycerides accelerated aneurysm formation, while higher levels led to aortic dissection. Further investigation revealed that elevated triglycerides and related fatty acids, particularly palmitate, impaired the maturation and activity of lysyl oxidase, a critical enzyme that maintains the structural integrity of the aortic wall. This enzyme dysfunction weakened connective tissue and promoted aneurysm progression. Standard lipid-lowering therapies, such as niacin, didn't sufficiently reduce triglyceride levels to a protective range. However, investigators found success with experimental antisense oligonucleotide therapy. "This therapy holds great potential as a treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and our research lays the groundwork for future clinical trials," said co-senior author Yanhong Guo, M.D., Ph.D., research assistant professor of internal medicine at U-M Medical School and member of the U-M Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center. "This is an exciting development for a condition that currently has limited options beyond surgical repair. The findings may represent a paradigm shift in how vascular diseases like abdominal aortic aneurysm are understood and treated, offering hope for patients at high risk who currently lack effective pharmacological interventions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is detecting tumors more often and earlier in the Dutch breast cancer screening program. Those tumors can then be treated at an earlier stage. This has been demonstrated by researchers led by Radboud university medical center in a study published in The Lancet Digital Health. Previous research in Sweden had already shown that AI detects breast cancer on mammograms more frequently than radiologists. Moreover, AI can reduce the workload for radiologists. This even leads to the detection of more tumors-and at an earlier stage-which later turn out to be clinically significant. Traditionally, two radiologists review these scans, as is standard practice in breast cancer screening. Additionally, they followed the women whose scans were analyzed for nearly four and a half years, with multiple scans available for many of them. The study showed that one radiologist working with AI detects more tumors than two radiologists alone. Tumors are also identified earlier when AI is involved. But often that tumor appears in a later scan after all. Therefore the AI was right earlier', PhD candidate Suzanne van Winkel explains. In Sweden, AI is already being used to analyze screening mammograms. Only if the AI is uncertain does a second radiologist step in', Mann explains. 'We see that radiologists work well with AI, which leads to more tumors being detected without a significant increase in unnecessary follow-up checks for women.' Yet AI is not currently being used in the Netherlands. That makes implementing AI more logistically challenging here', says Mann. 'The IT infrastructure in the Netherlands is not yet ready.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adolescents who undergo bariatric surgery face a higher risk of weight regain, which can undermine treatment success and long-term health, if they have elevated blood levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) prior to the procedure, according to new USC research. PFAS are manufactured chemicals used in consumer products that accumulate in the body over time and are increasingly linked to a range of health concerns, including kidney problems, liver damage and various cancers. Bariatric surgery, a form of weight-loss surgery that alters the digestive system, is an effective treatment for severe obesity that can reduce the risk of long-term health problems such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But many people who get bariatric surgery regain significant weight over time, which can limit the procedure's long-term health benefits. Researchers believe PFAS exposure may play a role in weight regain because the chemicals are known to disrupt endocrine and metabolic processes. With the growing use of weight loss interventions around the world, it's critical for us to understand the association between PFAS and successful weight loss management, including what this means for long-term outcomes." Brittney Baumert, PhD, MPH, postdoctoral research fellow in population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and study's first author With funding from NIH, Baumert and her colleagues conducted the first long-term study linking PFAS exposure to bariatric surgery outcomes in teens. They tracked 186 adolescents for five years, finding that those with higher PFAS blood levels before surgery regained more weight and had greater increases in waist circumference than those with lower PFAS levels. The strongest associations were observed in a class of PFAS known as sulfonic acids, which includes perfluoroctaansulfonaten (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS). "Our study shows a clear association between PFAS exposure and weight-related outcomes in bariatric surgery for adolescents," Baumert said. "PFAS are a modifiable risk, which is why protective policies are so important to reduce exposure and safeguard public health-especially for vulnerable populations." The researchers analyzed data on 186 teens from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study who underwent bariatric surgery between 2007 and 2012. To analyze the data, the researchers divided patients into three groups based on their blood PFAS concentrations: low, medium and high exposure. Overall, patients with higher blood levels of PFOS, PFHxS and PFHpS gained more weight and had greater increases in waist circumference one to five years post-surgery, compared to patients with lower blood levels of those chemicals. For PFHpS, teens in the highest exposure group regained weight at an average of 4.3% of their baseline bodyweight per year, compared to 2.7% per year in the lowest exposure group. It also points to potential strategies for improving patient care. Bariatric surgery is costly and invasive, so understanding who is likely to benefit can help providers make informed decisions about the best course of treatment for each individual. "We're also interested in exploring whether PFAS exposure is relevant to other weight loss interventions," including GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Baumert said. For example: How might PFAS exposure relate to a person's risk for type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)? Baumert, B. O., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study in the peer-reviewed journal Tissue Engineering, Part A demonstrates the potential to produce cellular spheroids, from a clinically relevant embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cell (ES-MSC) source, to generate scaffold-free chondrogenic or osteochondrogenic graft tissues. "To engineer osteochondral tissues, cellular spheroids were matured in the [chamber system] for only 7 days before implantation into ex vivo human cartilage defects," stated the investigators. Cellular spheroids cultured in the chamber system developed into neocartilage tissues expressing cartilage associated genes and staining positive for cartilage matrix molecules. The cartilage-like constructs that were implanted into cartilage defects created in ex vivo osteoarthritic tissue resulted in repair tissue that was histologically integrated with the explant tissues. "This study introduces a novel approach leveraging cellular spheroids to generate scaffold-free chondrogenic and osteochondrogenic neotissues that integrate with host tissues, addressing a key challenge to clinical translation," says Tissue Engineering Co-Editor-in-Chief Antonios G.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The project aims to deliver first-in-class antifibrotic therapies for lung and kidney diseases-conditions that currently have no effective treatment. 65LAB is a unique partnership of global investors ClavystBio, Leaps by Bayer, Lightstone Ventures, Polaris Partners and the Polaris Innovation Fund, as well as global life science company Evotec, set up to drive scientific advancement and create new biotech ventures from Singapore. Fibrosis, the formation of damaged and scarred extra tissues, can lead to organ failure. Professor Petretto's innovation directly addresses this huge unmet need by identifying molecules that can potentially be developed into new antifibrotic drugs. We are heartened by the results of our pre-clinical studies, which show at least a 50 per cent reduction in fibrosis in scarred tissues treated with our newly discovered molecules. These compounds work by blocking the activity of a key gene that drives tissue scarring in various diseases. 65LAB's award and the additional funding from LIVE Ventures will enable my team to accelerate the development of these molecules as antifibrotic drugs for clinical testing and future therapeutic use." Enrico Petretto, Professor and Director, Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School Prof Petretto's work builds on his previous discovery of WWP2, a key gene driving tissue fibrosis in multiple conditions, including lung, heart, and kidney disease. His team has since integrated Artificial Intelligence for large-scale high-throughput in silico screening, which allows them to sieve through more than 15 billion molecules. He is also advancing the integration of quantum computing to further enhance this powerful drug discovery platform. Dr Chen Huimei, Principal Research Scientist at Duke-NUS' Centre for Computational Biology and co-Principal Investigator on the project, said: Prof Petretto's commercialisation aspirations are actively strengthened by Duke-NUS' Centre for Technology and Development, which is protecting the novel drug targets and new molecular entities through strategic patent filings. 65LAB, coupled with early-stage venture funding from Duke-NUS's incubator LIVE Ventures, creates a robust ecosystem to nurture scientific advancements into new therapeutic companies from Singapore, addressing critical health challenges globally. Dr. Pei-Sze Ng, Chair of 65LAB Joint Steering Committee and Investment Director at Leaps by Bayer said: By combining world-class academic research with targeted funding and industry expertise, we're not just accelerating drug discovery; we're actively fostering the growth of Singapore's biotech venture ecosystem and bringing innovative therapies closer to patients who desperately need them." Associate Professor Christopher Laing, Vice-Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Duke-NUS, said: It is also an affirmation of a robust platform for AI-driven target discovery, which promises more investible opportunities in the future." The first award by 65LAB was made in July 2024-Associate Professor Lena Ho, also from Duke-NUS, received funding of US$1.5 million for her project developing microproteins into therapeutic targets to treat chronic inflammation.

Dental caries remain a significant oral health burden globally. Scientific evidence has demonstrated the dose-dependent, anticaries action of fluoride; however, more effective, comprehensive, and alternative prevention strategies should be investigated. The study, "Arginine Dentifrices and Childhood Caries Prevention: A Randomized Clinical Trial" by Wei Lin, Sichuan University, et al. carried out a two-year, phase III, double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial from April 15, 2019 through March 12, 2022 across three centers in China. Six thousand children aged 10–14 with two or more active caries lesions were assigned one of three study dentifrices: 8.0% arginine, 1.5% arginine, and 0.32% NaF as a positive control. After two years, the 8.0% arginine-containing dentifrice demonstrated a statistically significant 26.0% reduction in DMFS and 25.3% in DMFT scores vs. the 0.32% NaF control. This clinical study confirms that depending on the concentration, arginine dentifrices are as effective, or more effective, than a sodium fluoride dentifrice in providing anti-caries protection in children with active caries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness, which, when untreated, prevents infants with the most severe form from gaining motor development - never gaining the ability to sit - and typically leads to death before 2 years of age. An international consortium, co-led by Richard Finkel, MD, of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, formerly of Nemours Children's Health, reports today that giving risdiplam as early as 16 days of age, before symptoms arise, is safe and effective. "The impact of giving risdiplam soon after birth is quite dramatic," said co-first and corresponding author Finkel, who is now the Center for Experimental Neurotherapeutics director and Department of Pediatric Medicine member at St. Jude, but started the consortium and participated in the study as a faculty member at Nemours Children's Health. Babies with the genetic mutations that cause SMA were all started on daily risdiplam in the first six weeks of life, before definitive features of SMA appeared, and were followed for two years. Of the 18 children who had a mutation predicting less severe disease, all achieved sitting by 12 months and walking by 24 months, with most reaching these milestones in timeframes comparable to typically developing children. None of the children experienced any major treatment-related adverse events. Treating children before symptoms appear - when they are still developing normally - can change the entire trajectory of the disease. We are no longer just managing symptoms; we are preserving strength, function and quality of life from the very start," said contributing author Aledie Navas, MD, FAAP, FCCP, of Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando. We demonstrated in this study that with treatment shortly after birth, risdiplam maintained a good safety profile and generated a favorable clinical response. Richard Finkel, MD, of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital SMA causes the loss of a specific neuron that activates muscles. Without those neurons, the muscle tissue begins to atrophy. Risdiplam and similar treatments work by preventing the atrophy from accumulating over time. By giving the drug earlier, the researchers hope to avoid more muscle loss and, therefore, delay or prevent disease progression even more than current approaches. While risdiplam slows disease progression, no current pharmaceutical treatment is curative. However, the success of this approach in newborns suggests that early interventions can still be very beneficial. It is sponsored by F. Hoffman–LaRoche and continues the path established in their earlier risdiplam studies in older infants, children and adults with SMA, demonstrating a strong safety profile and clinical benefit of this drug, which is taken orally daily. "The treatment of babies right after birth is an important milestone," Finkel said. "But we will continue to investigate potentially even better ways to give these kids a chance at a normal life."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Griffith University trial has been three decades in the making and involves taking olfactory ensheathing cells, which are specialised cells involved in our sense of smell, from the nose as they have numerous therapeutic properties for repairing and regenerating nerves. Lead researcher Professor James St. John, Head of Griffith's Clem Jones Centre for Neurobiology and Stem Cell Research and Principal Researcher at the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, is carrying on the legacy of the late Professor Emeritus Alan Mackay-Sim AM. "To help stimulate regeneration, patients will undergo intensive rehabilitation for three months prior to the transplantation and then for eight months after the transplantation. "While primary assessments are to ensure the therapy is safe, we will also be measuring numerous aspects to assess if there are changes in functional outcomes that are important to people living with spinal cord injury. "The ability to regain some sense of function, whether it's regaining independent function of their bladder or bowel, regaining movement in their fingers, or the ability to stand and hug a loved one again can improve quality of life. "Regaining some form of independence can open the world up to people living with a chronic acquired spinal injury." The trial, to be conducted at Gold Coast University Hospital, is a blinded and randomised control study with preclinical research demonstrating the olfactory nerve bridges are effective in repairing spinal cord injury in animal models. The Clem Jones Foundation has supported this world-leading project from day one alongside other philanthropic groups and individuals which meant it also attracted state and federal government funding commitments. "This clinical trial represents a long-awaited breakthrough that speaks to the enduring strength of those impacted by spinal cord injury and the extraordinary belief of those who support us," Mr Cross said. "For too long, individuals living with paralysis have been told that recovery lies beyond the horizon of possibility. "Today, we challenge that notion with evidence, ambition and above all, hope. "It is proof that philanthropy, when guided by purpose and vision, can accelerate real change. "For someone like me, who knows all too well the permanence of spinal cord injury, this trial offers not just the possibility of improved function, but a renewed sense of independence and dignity; qualities that define the human experience." The trial is funded by the Medical Research Future Fund, Perry Cross Spinal Research Foundation, The Clem Jones Foundation, Queensland Government, Nicola and Andrew Forrest, Brazil Family Foundation, Terry and Rhonda White, and Griffith University.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from Michigan State University finds that microbes play an important role in shaping early brain development, specifically in a key brain region that controls stress, social behavior, and vital body functions. The study, published in Hormones and Behavior, used a mouse model to highlight how natural microbial exposure not only impacts brain structure immediately after birth but may even begin influencing development while still in the womb. A mouse model was chosen because mice share significant biological and behavioral similarities with humans and there are no other alternatives to study the role of microbes on brain development. This work is of significance because modern obstetric practices, like peripartum antibiotic use and Cesarean delivery, disrupt maternal microbes. Birth also coincides with important developmental events that shape the brain. We wanted to further explore how the arrival of these microbes may affect brain development." Their previous work had shown that mice raised without microbes, or germ-free mice, had more dying neurons in the PVN during early development. Germ-free newborn mice were placed with mothers that had microbes and compared them to control groups. When the brains of these mice were examined just three days after birth, results were striking: All mice gestated by germ-free mothers had fewer neurons in the PVN, regardless of whether they received microbes after birth. They also found that germ-free adult mice had fewer neurons in the PVN. "Our study shows that microbes play an important role in sculpting a brain region that is paramount for body functions and social behavior. Rather than shunning our microbes, we should recognize them as partners in early life development," said Dr. Castillo-Ruiz. "They're helping build our brains from the very beginning." Milligan, Y.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Older adults taking pregabalin for chronic pain had up to an 85% higher risk of heart failure than gabapentin users, raising fresh caution for prescribing practices in high-risk groups. In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers compared heart failure (HF) incidence between users of gabapentin and pregabalin. Non-opioid medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are gabapentinoids (analogs of gamma-aminobutyric acid) prescribed for chronic pain disorders. They are preferred over opioids for chronic non-cancer pain treatment due to the higher risks of overdose, addiction, and death associated with opioids. Non-opioids are specifically indicated for older individuals, as they are among those with the most risk for adverse effects related to opioids. However, adverse cardiovascular effects, including peripheral edema and HF, have been associated with gabapentin and pregabalin due to their additional effects on α2δ subunits of L-type calcium channel subunits on ventricular cardiomyocytes and arteries. Moreover, the risk of adverse effects may be higher with pregabalin compared to gabapentin due to its higher potency and receptor binding affinity. However, there are only a few studies that assessed the comparative HF risk between gabapentin and pregabalin users. In addition, most of these studies did not focus on older individuals, limited their analyses to neurological indications, or lacked a rigorous HF definition. To address these gaps, the researchers used a target trial emulation design, a framework that mimics a randomized controlled trial using observational data to estimate causal effects more robustly. They adjusted for 231 covariates using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize confounding. In the present study, researchers compared the incidence of HF among individuals prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin for chronic non-cancer pain. A 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries between January 1, 2015, and December 21, 2018, was included. The cohort comprised beneficiaries aged 65–89 and was limited to those with outpatient medical care, prescription drug, and hospitalization coverage. Patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage (Part C) were excluded due to incomplete claims data. Patients with a chronic pain diagnosis and a new prescription of gabapentin or pregabalin were included in the cohort. Individuals with terminal illnesses, a history of HF, hospitalization on the day of prescription, hospital stay more than 29 days, or a stay more than 29 days at a long-term care facility were excluded. Subjects were followed up until an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization for HF, death, or the end of the study. Secondary outcomes included outpatient encounters with a primary HF diagnosis and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for gabapentin and pregabalin were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The models were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on a propensity score that incorporated 231 demographic, clinical, and medication-use variables. Further, stratified analyses were performed by sex, race, ethnicity, and history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The cohort comprised 246,237 Medicare beneficiaries, with a median age of 73. Pregabalin was associated with a higher HF risk compared to gabapentin in females, White individuals, and those with a CVD history. However, all-cause mortality did not significantly differ between these groups. In sum, pregabalin initiation was associated with an increased risk of incident HF compared to gabapentin initiation in older individuals with chronic pain. This risk was especially pronounced among individuals with pre-existing CVD, supporting current recommendations for caution when prescribing pregabalin to older people with CVD. The study's limitations include a sample skewed toward female and White individuals, sample restriction to those aged ≥ 65, exclusion of Medicare Advantage enrollees, and limited power for ethnic and racial minority groups. Furthermore, unmeasured confounders such as body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and socioeconomic status were not available in the Medicare dataset but were partially addressed through negative control and E-value analyses. Overall, clinicians should assess ongoing cardiovascular risk factors and provide adequate risk-benefit counseling to older people before prescribing pregabalin for chronic pain.
