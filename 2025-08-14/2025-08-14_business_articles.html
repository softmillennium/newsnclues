                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in troubled insurer UnitedHealth last quarter, according to a regulatory filing, a surprising buy because of the company's current reputation, but perhaps not considering his history of bargain investing. The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it is possible that Buffett's two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were more responsible for this purchase rather than the "Oracle of Omaha" himself. The insurer's stock shot up 6% in extended trading following Berkshire's disclosure. Shares of UnitedHealthcare were down nearly 50% for 2025 through Thursday's close before Buffett's filing. UnitedHealth is currently facing a Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing practices. In May, the company pulled its annual earnings outlook and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. Last month, UnitedHealth gave a new 2025 outlook that was well short of Wall Street estimates, hitting the stock further. Buffett, who's turning 95 this month, has been critical of the healthcare system in the U.S., calling it a "tapeworm" on the economy due to its high costs. In 2018, he, along with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon, launched a joint venture to improve healthcare for their employees and potentially for all Americans, but it was eventually shut down. UnitedHealth isn't the only stock Berkshire picked up last quarter. In fact, the conglomerate also took small stakes in steel manufacturer Nucor, outdoor advertising company Lamar Advertising and security firm Allegion. Berkshire also got back into homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton. Shares of Nucor jumped nearly 8% in afterhours trading, while Lennar and DR Horton popped about 3% each. Buffett will stay on as chairman of the board. It's still unclear who will be in charge of Berkshire's gigantic equity portfolio, though Buffett has alluded that Abel will be making all capital allocation decisions at the conglomerate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high technology to be manufactured in the U.S. Earlier this week, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan visited Trump in the White House, a meeting that took place after the president had called for Tan's resignation based on allegations he has ties to China. Intel said at the time that Tan is "deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests." An Intel representative declined to comment about reports that the government is considering taking a stake in the company. "We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation," the spokesperson said. Tan took over Intel earlier this year after the chipmaker failed to gain significant share in artificial intelligence chips, while it was spending heavily to build its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies. Intel's foundry business has yet to secure a major customer, which would be a critical step in moving towards expansion and giving other potential customers the confidence to turn to Intel for manufacturing. In July, Tan said that Intel was canceling plans for manufacturing sites in Germany and Poland and would slow down development in Ohio, adding that spending at the chipmaker would be closely scrutinized. Under Trump, the U.S. government has increasingly moved to put itself at the center of deals in major industries. Last week, it said it would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. It also took a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant. Intel shares are now up 19% this year after losing 60% of their value in 2024, the worst year on record for the chipmaker. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Nike co-founder Phil Knight is donating $2 billion to the Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, the single largest donation ever to a U.S. university, college or health institution, according to the Knight Foundation. The foundation said on Thursday the gift that will be used to shift the scientific approach to cancer treatment, research and patient care outcomes. As part of the gift, the Knights will partner with cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker. A decade ago, Druker and OHSU took on a challenge to raise $500 million for cancer research, and the Knights signed on to match the raise dollar-for-dollar. "We are grateful for the opportunity to invest in the next stage of the Druker-led revolutionary vision of cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, care, and some day, eradication," Phil and Penny Knight said in a statement. "We couldn't be more excited about the transformational potential of this work for humanity." Originally called Blue Ribbon Sports, the business began humbly, with Knight selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car, as he recounted in his 2016 memoir, "Shoe Dog." The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. Nike went public in December 1980 and quickly became the most dominant sneaker brand, partnered with some of the top athletes across sport. During Knight's tenure at the public company, from its IPO to his June 2016 retirement, Nike shares soared almost 30,500%. Although Nike stock has had a painful few years, down more than 50% from its peak in late 2021, it remains the most valuable public company in athletic footwear, valued at more than $110 billion. The Knights are regularly found on lists of top philanthropists. In May, Time Magazine estimated their lifetime giving at $3.6 billion, including $370 million gifted in 2024 alone. It was the only way I saw to make life meaningful," Knight said in his 2016 memoir. Correction: The headline on this story has been updated to correct that Phil Knight is donating to Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Coach and Kate Spade parent Tapestry plunged Thursday after the company said tariffs will bite into its profits even as sales grow. The handbag, shoe and accessory maker said costs from higher duties will total $160 million for its coming fiscal year and drag on its profits. On the company's earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said sales trends have been strong. Yet he said the company is "facing greater than previously expected profit headwinds from tariffs and duties, with the earlier than expected ending of de minimis exemptions being a meaningful factor." Along with raising tariffs on imports from many countries, President Donald Trump suspended the de minimis rule, which allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. Tapestry expects its sales to grow in the fiscal year, however. The company said it expects revenue of about $7.2 billion, excluding Stuart Weitzman, which would represent low single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Tapestry's fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue also topped Wall Street's expectations. In recent weeks, retailers and consumer brands have offered a clearer picture of how they're trying to mitigate higher costs from tariffs — including many that went into effect earlier this month after delays and extensions. Among those strategies, companies are moving manufacturing to other countries, raising prices on some items they sell, trimming promotions and focusing on trendy items that shoppers are more likely to buy. Crocs CEO Andrew Rees, for instance, told investors on an earnings call earlier this month that it is reducing orders for the back half of the year after seeing weaker demand from retailers that carry its shoes. It also is taking back some of the older inventory from its Heydude shoe brand from retailers and giving partners newer stock. But he added, "We feel like being prudent at this early stage in our full-year guidance is the right position." He said Tapestry is focused on ways to blunt the cost of tariffs, including leaning on its manufacturing in many different parts of the globe and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Major U.S. retailers are sharing their latest sales updates and outlooks in the coming weeks. Walmart, Home Depot and Target are all scheduled to report quarterly earnings next week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man facing a felony federal assault charge for allegedly chucking a Subway sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in Washington, D.C., was an employee at the Department of Justice, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday. The man, identified in court documents as Sean Charles Dunn, has been fired, she said. Dunn worked in the DOJ criminal division's international affairs section. "I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER," Bondi said in an X post. "This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ," she added. "You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement." He then winds up and hurls the sandwich into the chest of the officer nearest to him before sprinting away while at least three officers give chase, the 32-second clip posted by FBI Director Kash Patel shows. Dunn was arrested Wednesday night, Patel said. A statement of facts from a police detective says that Dunn was apprehended after attempting to flee the scene. While being processed by the Metropolitan Police Department, Dunn said, "I did it. I threw a sandwich," according to the detective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets. European stock markets rose as investors' sentiment turned positive amid a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. Regionally, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were up 0.8%. Buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna reported AI-driven sales growth for the second quarter, enabling the company to generate revenues of $1 million per employee. "AI adoption continues to deliver significant, tangible results. As a result of this strategy, average revenue per employee reached $1.0m, up 46% [year on year in the second quarter]," the company said in its quarterly report. Klarna has aggressively leveraged AI to boost productivity performance. "This shift reflects the growing impact of AI and automation in eliminating manual, time-consuming work across Klarna," the company had said in its first-quarter results. Industrial output in the euro zone saw a month-on-month decline of 1.3% in June, preliminary data from statistics agency Eurostat showed on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a decline of 1%. On a monthly basis, German industrial production was down by 2.3%, Eurostat's data showed. "Looking ahead, we think industrial production and overall economic activity will grow at only a slow pace in the second half of the year and beyond," Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note following the data release. "There should be some boost from looser fiscal policy in Germany, but it will not be huge and nor is it likely to last very long." We're half an hour into Thursday's session, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 has so far gained 0.2%, with most sectors in positive territory. The German DAX and France's CAC 40 are both around 0.3% higher, while London's FTSE 100 is down by 0.2%. Danish brewer Carlsberg on Thursday reported slightly weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales on weaker volumes, but nevertheless raised its 2025 guidance towards the upper end. The world's third-largest brewer posted revenues of 25.7 billion Danish kroner ($4 billion) in the three months to June 30, just shy of the 26.4 forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll. CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen cited a "spending pause" among consumers that he said was weighing on volume growth. "The volumes do not flow in the way they did a couple of years ago," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." Month on month, the U.K. economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, today's preliminary data showed. George Brown, a senior economist at Schroders, said the slowdown reflected a drop in manufacturing following tariff frontloading in the first quarter. "This drag should ease in the third quarter, even against a tougher global trade backdrop," he said. "Still, hopes of a sharp rebound are likely to be dashed. The labour market has softened, and capacity constraints mean even tepid growth is generating inflation pressures." Economists polled by Reuters had expected the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by a tepid 0.1% over the period, up from bumper growth of 0.7% in the first quarter. Month-on-month, the economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, failing to shake off the impact of U.S. tariffs and business uncertainty. Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday. Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are meeting to try to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, but close followers of Moscow's leadership are skeptical that any lasting resolution will be reached at the summit. Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action and business news in European financial markets on Thursday. Futures data from IG suggests a generally positive open for European indexes, with London's FTSE 100 seen opening 0.15% higher, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are seen opening around the flatline, and Italy's FTSE MIB slightly higher. Earnings are set to come from Adyen, Swiss Re, Hapag-Lloyd, RWE, Talanx, CVC Capital Partners, Aviva, Antofagasta and Carlsberg on Thursday. On the data front, U.K. second-quarter preliminary gross domestic product figures are released at 7 a.m. London time, followed by the latest French inflation figures shortly after and the EU employment and GDP data at 10 a.m. London time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly on Thursday said it is raising the list price of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro in the U.K. starting in September, as President Donald Trump pressures drugmakers to lower U.S. drug prices and hike them abroad. Eli Lilly told CNBC that the price hike will not affect the drug's availability under NHS, and it wants to work with the government to boost access. The company added that it does not determine prices that private health-care providers set, but is working with them to ensure access to Mounjaro. In a statement on Thursday, NHS said Mounjaro's list price increase "will not affect NHS commissioning of tirzepatide in England for eligible people living with obesity, based on clinical priority, or as a treatment for type 2 diabetes." Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Mounjaro and its counterpart for weight loss, Zepbound. Mounjaro's current list price in the UK ranges from £92 (about $124.89) to £122 a month, depending on the dose size, according to Eli Lilly. The drug's new list price will increase to between £133 and £330 starting on Sept. 1. The company added that it is working with certain governments and expects to make pricing adjustments in those countries by that date. In the U.S., the list price for a month's supply of Mounjaro is $1,079.77 before insurance and other rebates. "This rebalancing may be difficult, but it means the prices for medicines paid by governments and health systems need to increase in other developed markets like Europe in order to make them lower in the US," the company said in the statement. U.S. prescription drug prices are two-to-three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. Trump has said he wants to narrow that gap to stop Americans from being "ripped off." Eli Lilly's announcement on Thursday comes as the industry braces for Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In its statement, the company said it opposes those tariffs, arguing they will "raise costs, limit patient access, and undermine American leadership, especially for companies already investing heavily in domestic manufacturing." In recent months, Eli Lilly was among several drugmakers to announce new plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing sites. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If the world's top YouTuber calls a video or idea "cringe," it's likely dead in its tracks. The 27-year-old creator has buried himself alive, put hundreds of contestants through endurance challenges, and sent a train barreling into a giant pit as an "experiment," all in the name of viral content. With over 400 million subscribers on his main channel, $473 million in revenue last year across his businesses, and a reality show on Amazon Prime Video, Donaldson is in a league of his own. So, what does it take to make a MrBeast video — many of which are filmed in Donaldson's hometown of Greenville, North Carolina? To find out, BI interviewed nine former MrBeast workers and reviewed an internal production guidebook created a few years ago as the YouTuber's team began expanding. What emerged was a portrait of a large-scale content operation that, in many ways, mirrors traditional Hollywood productions — only faster-paced and occasionally more chaotic. Donaldson rejects the notion of being an old-school studio head, and he has eschewed ideas rooted in legacy media. In other ways, his creative instincts align with more traditional Hollywood leaders. Even after investing thousands into a video, for instance, Donaldson will sometimes kill a project if it doesn't meet his quality standards — much like major studios like Warner Bros. For creatives who make the journey out to Greenville, MrBeast offers competitive pay and an opportunity to move fast and break things. "You'll see a lot of former film and TV people dropping everything in their lives in order to move out to Greenville," the former staffer said. Here's BI's breakdown of what goes into making a MrBeast video, from start to finish: The creator, who employed about 350 people as of April, has a dedicated ideation team tasked with building a pipeline of potential video ideas. The ideation team starts by conceptualizing a video title and thumbnail. The team sketches out ideas and logs them in a database, then pitches the best ones to Donaldson and a team of creative leads. Hundreds of ideas are logged, but most never make it past this phase. Another former staffer described the ideation team as a content lab. "If you come up with enough ideas, you're going to get those winning ones that are perfect for a viral engine," they said. This approach is similar to Hollywood's traditional development process, said Paul Hardart, director of the entertainment, media, and technology program at NYU's Stern business school. If Donaldson greenlights an idea, it's handed to a group of creative producers for cost and feasibility planning. But creatives are careful not to kill an exciting idea prematurely. While staff members at Beast Industries — MrBeast's company — may fear the word "cringe," Donaldson has his own dreaded word: "no." The boss does not like to be told that something can't happen. "Don't just stop because one person told you no, stop when all conceivable options are exhausted," Donaldson wrote in his production guide. If an idea is greenlit and assigned a budget, a producer — or group of producers — is enlisted to manage the project and ensure tasks like building a set and casting aligns with the initial creative vision. At any given moment, MrBeast has multiple production teams working on different videos, labeled by letters: Team A, Team B, and so on. "At Beast, you have to be responsible for everything," a third former staffer said. This is typical of YouTube productions, whereas legacy media producers are often more specialized. "YouTube producers are probably more Swiss Army knives, but in TV, they're more scalpels," said Daniel Rosenberg, a writer and producer who cofounded the branded entertainment firm Piro. When building his business, Donaldson and the MrBeast team often came up with their own terms for production roles. The company has a consistent team of workers who build sets, as well as a flurry of production assistants who initially were referred to as "friends of friends" because they were often locals with connections to MrBeast staffers. Friends of friends work on a variety of tasks, from on-set assistance to picking up producers from the Raleigh airport. They're now part of a team referred to as the "task force." Depending on the production, a MrBeast video could feature hundreds of cameras on set, capturing a variety of angles (and individual contestants if it's a challenge where they are facing off against each other). Lengthy video challenges in a nuclear bunker or grocery store would require lots of cameras to film every moment. Donaldson listens to feedback from a range of people and considers factors like budget, virality, and the company's quality standards when determining which projects move forward, they said. Traditional media productions may similarly throw away work if they feel like it isn't up to par, Hardart said, pointing to the decision to reshoot the Game of Thrones pilot episode. Some of MrBeast's videos involve 100-day challenges, with cameras rolling all day and night. A single video generally enlists up to eight editors, with a few staffers handling daily footage cuts, four or five syncing footage and selecting the best parts of what was filmed, and a couple of lead editors compiling everything. For videos shot over a longer timeframe, edits are managed in real time. With editing, the MrBeast team is very focused on how a video will retain viewership on YouTube, known as retention editing. "He has very specific editing requirements for his editors, not just how much you get done or how fast, but how many seconds into a video are you showing the super funny thing that happens," a fifth former staffer said. Donaldson laid out this approach in his production guide, highlighting the importance of using YouTube analytics to identify the exact second when viewership drops off and telling workers that they "must always know what minute mark the content you are working on is." "You can do so much in editing to shape a story." After a MrBeast video has a final cut that makes it to YouTube, it's formatted for multiple languages, put through thumbnail A/B testing, and carefully monitored for viewer retention and performance. It may also be cut for shorter videos on TikTok or YouTube shorts or edited down for age-appropriate content so it can appear on YouTube Kids. The creator also has a team dedicated to making shorter videos for vertical platforms like TikTok or YouTube shorts. Donaldson wrote in his production guide that "the cool thing" about YouTube is that the platform gives "super detailed graphs for every video that show the exact second we lose a viewer on every single video." From setting up a team focused fully on ideas, to dissecting viewership data to plan his video strategy, Donaldson has laid out the blueprint for building a YouTube empire. "I feel like in this day and age, so many content creators are trying to be him," the first former staffer said. He has access to things that no one else does."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inflation-weary consumers would be forgiven for thinking falling prices are a good thing, but that's not necessarily the case. And deflation is exactly what may be in store for the US, according to one top economist. While consumers might perk up at the idea of lower prices, deflation is often thought to be a more difficult problem for policymakers to solve than high inflation. That's one reason why countries like Japan and China, which have been slammed with deflation crises in the past, have seen their economists mired in long periods of anemic growth in the years that followed. The US could be facing a similar fate, Rosenberg said, adding that he believed America was "following the footsteps" of those two nations in particular. "We are now staring down the barrel of a deflationary shock, and it amazes me how all the bond bears, inflation-phobes, and Fed policy hawks are missing this secular shift as they continue to play by the old rules," Rosenberg wrote in a report on Wednesday. He sees three reasons the US is headed for an era of deflation. Tariffs are thought by economists to be inflationary, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties by raising prices for consumers. July is expected to show retail sales grew 0.5%. "GDP is, after all, only about spending," Rosenberg said, referring to how consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of GDP growth in the US. Slower spending among Americans could collide with the near-term impact of President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Reduced immigration is likely to result in less consumer spending, another factor that will lower prices and hurt economic growth, Rosenberg said. "In the final analysis, the demand destruction coming from the trade file, along with lower growth in future spending due to a reduced immigrant consumer base, should lead to lower inflation," he wrote. Those factors are exacerbated by the fact that America's population is rapidly growing older, and people aren't having as many kids as they used to. An aging population can hit economic growth, given that older Americans tend to save more than they spend. The change in someone's likelihood to consume drops from 0.94 at age 35 to around 0.67 at age 65, per Rosenberg's analysis. Rosenberg, who's known as a contrarian on Wall Street, has made a lot of bearish calls about the US economy in recent years. Earlier in this year, he said he still believes the US was headed for a recession, and speculated that a downturn could materialize as soon as mid-summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Igor Babuschkin, who founded xAI alongside Elon Musk in 2023, said he's leaving the artificial intelligence startup. In a farewell post on X on Wednesday, Babuschkin wrote that he's leaving xAI to start Babuschkin Ventures. In his post, Babuschkin recounted his journey from a CERN particle physics Ph.D. student to helping Musk build xAI from scratch. Babuschkin said he learned two major lessons from Musk. "I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency," he wrote. "Naysayers told us that we arrived too late to the game, so starting a top AI company from scratch would be impossible," he wrote. But "xAI executes at ludicrous speed," he wrote. One defining memory came late at night near the project's deadline, when "mysterious issues" hit the training setup. "When the training run finally worked, Elon posted our triumph at '4:20am' causing us to laugh out loud," wrote Babuschkin. "I will never forget the rush of adrenaline that night, and the emotional bonds that we were all in this together. We went to bed feeling like we were living through the most exhilarating time of our lives," he wrote. Musk thanked Babuschkin in a follow-up post on X: "We wouldn't be here without you." xAI, Babuschkin, and Musk did not immediately respond to a request from Business Insider for comment sent outside regular business hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift says life on her record-breaking Eras Tour wasn't all glitz and glamour. During an appearance on the "New Heights" podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce, the pop star spoke about the physical toll of performing on the stage night after night. When asked how she felt after wrapping up her tour after months on the road, Swift said she felt "great." And it was a lot of physical therapy, and it was a lot of being in a state of perpetual physical discomfort — kind of like when you're in season," Swift told the brothers. The Eras Tour, which grossed over $2 billion, consisted of 149 shows held across 21 countries. Each concert lasted an average of three hours and fifteen minutes, depending on the set list and the weather. It was the most formative time of my life. "Making that a three-and-a-half-hour show at the beginning of the tour, it's like you can't be sick one day and then decide tonight it's going to be two-and-a-half hours," Swift said. "It's really just prioritizing the fans' experience before anything else." That includes things like stomach flu, aching feet, or blisters, she added. Looking back on the experience, Swift said she wouldn't do anything differently. Unlike previous tours, where she only hit her stride toward the final stretch, Swift said she wanted to have her stamina from day one. "That's why I did so much more training, so much more endurance training, and cardio, and stuff that doesn't come naturally because I'm not an athlete, so it's like that stuff I have to really force myself to do," she said. She also took three months of dance training and cut out alcohol for the duration of the tour. Swift announced her coming album, "The Life of a Showgirl," in a preview clip from the podcast that was released on Tuesday. A representative for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swift announced Tuesday that her 12th studio album is titled "The Life of a Showgirl." She made the big reveal in a teaser for her appearance on "New Heights," the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce. When the full episode premiered on Wednesday, Swift simultaneously revealed the album cover, tracklist, and release date — October 3 — on social media. "The reason I wanted to have an offstage moment as the main album cover is because the album isn't really about what happened to me onstage, but what I was going through offstage." Such was the case for 2012's "Red," named for the color Swift associates with passionate, reckless love affairs, and 2017's "Reputation," an album whose black-and-white aesthetic was partially intended to evoke newsprint. Orange had yet to be associated with any other album in Swift's catalog. Later that day, Swift's official website was updated with a countdown to 12:12 a.m. on Tuesday, August 12, set against a sparkly orange backdrop. (The numeric repetition is another of Swift's calling cards.) Before the purchase was made public in May, Swifties had been eagerly anticipating the rerecorded version of "Reputation," her fan-favorite sixth album — though Swift has since confessed she has no imminent plans to release it. "To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it," Swift wrote in an open letter to fans. She added that she did finish rerecording her self-titled debut album — the only other missing entry in the "Taylor's Version" series — though she didn't clarify when it might come to light. "Those two albums can still have their moments to reemerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about," she wrote. "But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. Instead, Swifties will soon get a batch of fresh tracks from the prolific songwriter. In the final photo that Taylor Nation shared on Monday, Swift is singing onstage with Sabrina Carpenter, her fan-turned-protégé and Eras Tour opener. The album's closer and titular track is a duet with Carpenter. Among many other literary references, Swift has included nods to both Shakespeare and Elizabeth Taylor in past songs; one of her most famous hits, 2008's "Love Story," is an optimistic twist on "Romeo + Juliet." Meanwhile, Elizabeth Taylor is name-dropped in the 2017 single "…Ready For It?" Also notable: Track 10 on "The Life of a Showgirl" is titled "Cancelled!" Swift ruminated on the psychological effects of "cancel culture" throughout "Reputation," as well as the standout track "Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?" Though he is famously private and media-averse, Max Martin is known as one of the music industry's most iconic hitmakers, dating back to '90s hits like "I Want You Back" by *NSYNC, "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys, and "...Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears. Martin began working with Shellback, a fellow Swede, in the mid-aughts. Together, they co-produced the biggest hits from Swift's fan-favorite album "Red" ("22," "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," and "I Knew You Were Trouble") and much of her subsequent pair of pop blockbusters, "1989" and "Reputation." During the episode of "New Heights," Swift described Martin as her "mentor" and said he and Shellback helped make some of her favorite songs in her discography, including "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," "Style," and "Delicate." "We've never actually made an album before where it's just the three of us. It's just the three of us making a focused album," she explained. "It felt like catching lightning in a bottle." As one might suspect from the duo's participation, Swift confirmed that she considers "The Life of a Showgirl" to be full of "bangers" and "melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it." "I essentially said to him, I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour, and for the same reasons," Swift said of Martin. "This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. It just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life," she continued. "And so that effervescence has come through on this record." For her previous two albums, Swift surprise-released another set of songs just a few hours after they each dropped, dubbed "Midnights (3am Edition)" and "The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology," respectively. Fans had already begun speculating that Swift was planning a similar surprise for "The Life of a Showgirl," but she has denied that's the case. "With 'Tortured Poets Department,' I was like, 'Here's a data dump of everything I thought, felt, and experienced in two or three years. "This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time," she added. "Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons, you know, and you couldn't take one out, and it'd be the same album.</p>

Swift gave a behind-the-scenes look at how she was able to buy back her music masters during an episode of "New Heights," the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce. Swift, who bought her masters earlier this year for a reported $360 million, said she'd been saving for that moment since she was a teenager. "It's always been a huge thing for me. Since I was a teenager, I've been actively saving up money to buy my music back and to ever own it in the first place because it's usually the label that owns it," she said. Swift said she signed a record deal when she was 15 and that typically, such deals are set up so the artist does not own their master recordings: "Owning your master records means that you have complete control and power over distribution, licensing, and essentially the way your legacy is shaped," she said. The masters for Swift's first six albums had several owners over the years, including Big Machine Records and Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. "I thought about not owning my music every day. It was like an intrusive thought that I had every day," she said. That motivated her to rerecord the albums, releasing them one at a time with the appended title of "Taylor's Version." She released four of the rerecorded albums before buying back her masters this year. The rereleases were a huge success for Swift. After the Eras Tour, Swift said her team thought it might be a good time to approach the then-owners of her masters, a private equity firm called Shamrock Capital, to see if she could buy her music outright. "I don't want to be in a partnership. I don't want to own 30% of it. I want to own all of it," she said. Swift said she wanted to approach the purchase from a personal place because it was more than a business transaction to her. And I just very dramatically hit the floor, for real," Swift said. I can't believe it still," she added. Swift announced her coming album, "The Life of a Showgirl," in a preview clip from the podcast that was shared shortly after midnight on Tuesday.</p>
