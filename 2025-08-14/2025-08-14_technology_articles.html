                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alan Estevez was sitting at his dining room table wearing a T-shirt when Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo called on Zoom to ask if he wanted to be the Biden administration's top export control official. It was 2021, and the outspoken New Jersey native thought he had finally left public service behind. After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. By the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. On October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China's military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. In practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry and scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise—futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change—the policy could undermine China. War or not, the Biden administration was placing a high-stakes bet that the United States could use its leverage to hold China back and that the losses in terms of forgone US exports to China and collateral damage to bilateral ties would be worth it. US policymakers had been using tech restrictions to stymie China's military modernization and punish the country for human rights abuses since the Cold War. More recent advancements in missiles and surveillance technology reinforced that logic. Key officials believed AI was approaching an inflection point—or several—that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore. This account of how the Biden administration chose to respond is based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal government deliberations. When the Biden administration introduced its transformative policy, it did not start from scratch. During his first term, President Donald Trump had also targeted Chinese tech, including semiconductor firms, as part of a broader effort to curb the country's technological rise and global influence. Officials justified the measure with allegations that Huawei had violated US sanctions on Iran. But experts believed they were also trying to undermine the company more generally, fearing that Huawei's exports of 5G wireless infrastructure around the world could give Chinese spies and saboteurs a leg up. Then the Trump administration doubled down, this time by turning to an obscure legal provision called the “foreign-produced direct product rule.” The FDPR was originally designed to make sure that goods made through US innovation and technology—like missiles or airplane parts—didn't go into weapons systems sold to adversaries, even if those systems were built abroad. In 2020, the Trump administration turned this long-arm tool on Huawei, explicitly targeting the company's “efforts to obtain advanced semiconductors developed or produced from US software and technology,” as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the time. While the FDPR had previously been used to enforce multilateral arms controls, the move against Huawei targeted “items made with US technology that were not sensitive, that were not on the control list, that had nothing to do with any AI,” says Kevin Wolf, a former Obama administration export control official. “Everybody thought that would be the end of this very novel extraterritorial control,” Wolf added. “Obviously we started using it like candy,” says Estevez. In the first Trump administration, the US added Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), a leading Chinese chipmaker, to the Entity List and brought criminal charges against another Chinese semiconductor company, Fujian Jinhua (a judge later found it not guilty). It also worked with the Netherlands, home to the chipmaking tool giant ASML, to restrict exports of especially cutting-edge semiconductor equipment. All these moves were, in a way, part of normal business amid worsening ties between the US and China. They didn't require visions of advanced AI to make sense in Washington, where traditional concerns about military modernization, rights abuses, and fair markets were more than enough to justify targeted efforts against Chinese tech. When Biden took office in 2021, some members of his policy team brought with them a novel anxiety: AI systems might become so capable that they would supercharge national power, leaving rival militaries and economies at a great disadvantage. Essentially a think tank housed inside Georgetown University, CSET was launched with a $55 million grant from Open Philanthropy, a group aligned with the effective altruism movement that funds work addressing issues ranging from “potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence” to global health. “AI and other emerging technologies will deliver profound benefits to society, but they will also introduce new risks,” Matheny said at the center's launch. It wasn't long before CSET scholars identified China's growing strength in AI development as a US national security risk. Those scholars included Tarun Chhabra—the other White House breakfast partner—as well as future Biden administration officials Saif Khan and Ben Buchanan, all of whom studied technology and national security at CSET. Chhabra coauthored a report published in February 2020 that recommended the United States and key allies “coordinate on the terms under which they will export leading-edge AI chips to China” and “forge a democratic way of AI.” That April, Khan coauthored a separate paper arguing for putting controls on chipmaking equipment to ensure that China remained “reliant on democracies for state-of-the-art chips.” In August, just months before Biden was elected president, Buchanan identified computing power as a key input that allows countries to develop AI and warned that the US was likely running out of time before it could no longer restrain China's access to it. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a research panel created by Congress that included Matheny, also called for “implementing coordinated export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment with allies.” Chhabra, Matheny, Khan, and Buchanan—four experts with varying backgrounds who crossed paths at CSET—would all go on to work on AI policy in the Biden White House. Once there, they and others, including Chris McGuire, a State Department official who had worked on the final AI Commission report, set to work operationalizing their ideas. One former official recalled that their work to keep advanced chipmaking equipment out of Chinese hands began as early as the transition. This would, as Khan had advocated, keep Chinese AI developers dependent on US suppliers. As the Biden team assembled in 2021, however, its ambitions were broader. Limiting China's chipmaking abilities would block it from independently building computing power, but Chinese developers could still simply buy the best chips from US companies. As close observers of AI were debating the potential of large language models, no one knew for sure what might be possible in the future with vast quantities of what were then the most powerful chips. Some officials believed that keeping China dependent on US supplies would no longer be enough. Former officials recall being motivated by a combination of different risks. Some say the idea of artificial general intelligence was explicitly on their mind. (While there is no universally accepted definition of AGI, the term generally refers to an AI system superior to humans across all intellectual fields.) Others say they were concerned more about specific AI capabilities, whether things that had already been envisioned—supercharged propaganda, automated cyber hacking, synthetic bioweapons—or ones yet to be foreseen. The stakes were especially high, some believed, because a powerful AI system might be used to develop even more capable AI systems, compounding a country's lead and leaving competitors not just incrementally behind, but wallowing in a bygone paradigm. If some of these fears sound vague or far out, that's because they are. The White House team had identified risks that demanded action, but there would also be costs. Producers of chipmaking equipment, such as Applied Materials and Lam Research, would lose the ability to sell their advanced products to Chinese factories. Experts believed that China might still eventually succeed in developing its own independent semiconductor ecosystem, and cutting the country off could motivate actors around the world to build an America-free supply chain to avoid future disruptions. Former White House officials say they worked intensively to understand the potential blowback. If China retaliated hard, what options would Washington have? How would the policy distinguish between equipment that really posed a risk, and products companies should still be able to sell? Estevez says he remembers the White House pushed for restrictions on a larger number of items, while the Commerce Department, which is responsible for promoting economic growth, sought a more tailored approach. Several former officials specifically cited Chhabra's bureaucratic skill and determination as central to making the chip strategy happen. “American technology should not enable adversaries to build AI capabilities that will be turned against American troops, strategic assets, and critical infrastructure,” says Chhabra, now out of government and leading national security policy at Anthropic. “Strong export controls are essential for America's national security and AI dominance.” “Look, Tarun and I argued all the time,” says Estevez, but “moving in the same direction was not the issue.” At least among this group of staffers, the core dispute wasn't over whether they should try to constrain China, but over how—broad restrictions versus targeted measures that preserved more flexibility for industry. Officials had already banned Nvidia from selling its best AI training chip to China, but the company then developed a new, China-specific chip with capabilities that pushed right up to the limits of the existing rules. In October 2023 and December 2024, the Biden administration tightened the controls on both chips and chipmaking equipment to plug what were perceived as unintentional loopholes. Undermining Chinese efforts to build cutting-edge chips of their own, on the other hand, was a multinational endeavor. That's because semiconductor fabrication relies on precision machinery and software from around the world, with particularly crucial inputs coming from the Dutch company ASML and Japanese companies such as Tokyo Electron. If the United States banned its equipment suppliers from selling to China, but Japan and the Netherlands kept selling, US businesses would lose revenue, and China would still be able to upgrade its domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration then had to convince Tokyo and Amsterdam that joining the effort was worth losing some exports and risking Chinese retaliation. Whether or not an AI inflection point was coming, he knew military planners would still prefer to face a Chinese adversary that was lagging behind technologically. This idea seemed to also carry weight with allied officials. In January 2023, Japanese and Dutch national security officials joined Sullivan at Blair House, the traditional guest quarters for visiting dignitaries across from the White House, to sign an agreement to institute parallel export controls on chipmaking equipment sold to China. Matheny left the administration in 2022 to become president and CEO of RAND, a storied research organization that often serves government clients. They are each, in various ways, still working on AI, computing, and national security. Earlier this year, Trump even put restrictions on another Nvidia chip called the H20, which has proven useful for certain kinds of AI development tasks. But after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly began lobbying Trump, the White House abruptly reversed course. In a legally questionable move, Trump said he would authorize licenses for Nvidia to sell H20s to China in exchange for a share of the revenue. Buchanan says the move undermined what Republicans and Democrats had both agreed was a key national security priority. “Reversing the effective bipartisan course on China AI chip controls, when those chips matter more than ever, is a unilateral surrender,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its Community Guidelines and other policies, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. For regulatory compliance, Bluesky's Terms of Service has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.'s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site. The process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed. That's quite different from what's taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts. These revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful. Where Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what's considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.” More recently, the company has been facing backlash that it's become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor. The original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cohere on Thursday announced that it had raised an oversubscribed $500 million round, bringing its valuation to $6.8 billion. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. To that end, it's landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG's consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan. Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.” It just nabbed long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor. Oracle backed Cohere in 2023, but the database giant has more recently tied its fortunes more closely to OpenAI, particularly as part of the massive data center building project known as Stargate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's xAI was supposed to be part of the initiative, but a planned partnership fell apart after the Grok chatbot spouted antisemitic conspiracy theories on X in early July, WIRED has learned. “With that in mind, I've been thinking that we need to equip the entire federal workforce with best-in-class AI tools.” The email kicked off a swift procurement process. “We discussed identifying strategic ‘top-down' initiatives, with procurement reform emerging as a promising candidate,” wrote Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales for OpenAI, in an email obtained by WIRED. “OpenAI is prepared to dedicate resources specifically to explore how AI can effectively support and enhance this high priority area for GSA.” The deal surprised some federal workers, who claim this amounts to a gift from a tech company and is highly unusual. They noted that while GSA has moved swiftly in the past to onboard new tech tools, accepting what amounts to a “gift” from a tech firm is “atypical.” OpenAI and GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. OpenAI says it will not use chats with federal workers as training data for future models. In August, the US government also announced partnerships with OpenAI rivals Anthropic and Google Gemini. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One company that was supposed to be part of the GSA announcements was Musk's xAI, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions. In early June, GSA leadership met with the xAI team for a two-hour brainstorming session “to see what opportunities may exist for automation and streamlining,” according to an email obtained by WIRED. And they were like ‘No we gotta have Grok,'” one employee involved with the discussions tells WIRED. The move would have allowed federal agencies to buy Grok through Carahsoft, which is a technology reseller and government contractor. Then, in early July, Grok appeared to go off the rails, spewing antisemitic hate, praising Adolf Hitler, and parroting racist conspiracy theories on X. “We were like, ‘Do you not read a newspaper? Shortly before GSA was set to announce its partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google's Gemini, and xAI last week, staff were instructed to remove xAI's Grok from the contract offering, two sources with knowledge tell WIRED. Two GSA workers involved with the contract believe xAI was pulled because of Grok's antisemitic tirade last month. xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The announcements for GSA's partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, meanwhile, happened so quickly that “it wasn't even clear who to send the $1 to or how,” one GSA source tells WIRED. And while OpenAI and Anthropic have released tools exclusively for government use, neither company has cleared the regulatory hurdles necessary for agencies to buy directly from them. Specifically, they haven't been approved through FedRAMP, a GSA-led program that ensures the safety of private cloud services through intense security screenings. There are, however, carve-outs within the implementation memo to allow for products that have not been FedRamp-approved to be brought into government in a research and development capacity. “It was irresponsible of the administration to issue an executive order that required such a fast turnaround to get those implementation memos out,” because it meant that the government was unable to consult with the significant number of stakeholders that they would otherwise have, says a former White House official who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has wasted no time bringing AI into government. One of the first executive orders signed by Trump prompted agencies to reverse any rules inhibiting the growth and dominance of American AI, kicking off a mad dash among administration leaders to find new ways to incorporate the tech into everything. At the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz has suggested replacing some frontline health workers with AI avatars. In June, US spy chief Tulsi Gabbard spoke at an Amazon Web Services summit about having used AI tools to review classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. (When released, the files turned out to contain the Social Security numbers and additional private information of hundreds of living people.) An April memo at the Department of Veterans' Affairs instructed staff to compile documents outlining rules and regulations and how they should be applied at the agency. These, according to the memo, would be reviewed by AI “to narrow the field of documents requiring further reviews,” and possible recission. In a June Veteran Affairs draft memo obtained by WIRED, the agency claims that “within the next 1 to 3 years, most computer-based tasks at VA will be automatable.” That includes having “AI-powered digital assistants” engage with veterans online to complete benefit and health care transactions, the document says. Earlier this year, the GSA started rolling out its own government chatbot called GSAi, encouraging workers to incorporate the tool into their daily workflows. Speaking at a government tech conference in July, GSA chief data scientist and chief AI officer Zach Whitman said that the next step in GSAi's deployment would be to integrate it with the agency's own data sources so it could use up-to-date data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the team that brought us Darth Jar Jar, light side Darth Vader, and a black Millennium Falcon comes Mandalorian Lando, walker-sized Chewbacca, and everyone's favorite Star Wars rabbit, Jaxxon. Yes, Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy is back with four new episodes subtitled “Pieces of the Past.” The original series debuted late last year and followed a simple nerf herder, Sig Greebling (voiced by Stranger Things' Gaten Matarazzo), and his brother, Dev Greebling (Spider-Man's Tony Revolori), who find a special Lego piece that completely remakes the galaxy. Now, the pair is back, along with all of your favorites, for a new, even more dangerous adventure that will see them encounter more impossible Star Wars mashups and a brand new villain, Solitus, voiced by Dan Stevens. Cassian Andor is in there too, but this time he's voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo. We also love that it's playing not just with Star Wars tropes, but varied Star Wars Lego sets too. There are larger scale ones, such as Chewbacca and the Porg, and who knows what else might be in store. In Pieces of the Past, “a new threat rises in the galaxy, and Sig and Dev Greebling must combine their powers of Force Building and Sith Breaking to stop it. Alongside Jedi Bob, Yesi Scala, and Servo, they will journey into the deepest corners of Lego Star Wars lore, uncovering pieces of all the galaxies that have come before.” Sounds like it's going to be a blast. Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past drops all four episodes on Disney+ September 19.

Tony Gilroy feared releasing the scripts to the 'Star Wars' series to avoid them being consumed by generative AI models—but one of the finest hours of 'Andor' has had its screenplay released. The puffy Red Hulk from 'Captain America: Brave New World' is also daring you to look away. 'The Mandalorian' actress had been in a legal dispute with the 'Star Wars' company, and now she may return.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple usually announces its new hardware in the fall, and this year is likely no different. The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. It could also come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it's speculated that the watch will feature a larger display. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn't expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's no such thing as "too many buttons" on a gaming mouser — or any mouse! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Even ultralight, performance-focused mice that ditch frivolous features such as Bluetooth connectivity and RGB lighting, like Logitech's G Pro X Superlight 2 and Razer's Viper V3 Pro have at least five buttons (and if you count the DPI switch button on the bottom, they actually have six). It's safe to say the world has moved beyond thinking that a mere two or three mouse buttons is sufficient (I refuse to acknowledge any company that has ever thought that only one mouse button was enough). But five (or six, technically) mouse buttons isn't enough, either, and most flagship, all-purpose gaming mice have more than the five (now) standard buttons. Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, for example, has 13 programmable controls, though not all of these are buttons (this number includes the tilt wheel, which allows you to remap the center, right, and left clicks, as well as the scroll up/down functions); so does Logitech's G 502X Plus. You might be thinking, "Surely, 13 programmable controls — or 11 programmable clicks, if we're not counting the scroll directions — is more than enough," but it's not — in fact, it's not much more than five or six, functionally speaking. Saying these mice have 13 programmable controls is a bit disingenuous — while all of the buttons can technically be remapped, it's safe to say that almost nobody is going to remap the standard left and right primary buttons or the scroll function. Once you take these buttons off the table, you're left with just a couple of actual extra buttons — both of these mice have a third "trigger" button in the thumb area (often used to temporarily slow down DPS for when you're lining up a tricky shot). But don't worry — there are mice with even more buttons. Sure, you can use your keyboard — and, well, you'll have to, as there are far more hotkeys in any of these games than you can fit on a mouse — but many things are more convenient to do from your mouse (especially if it's a shortcut that can be set up as a macro), and it's just more efficient, in general, to have both hands in the game. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. But you don't need to be playing an MMORPG or a MOBA for those extra mouse buttons to come in handy: not only do most games have at least some sort of inventory system that requires management — even if it's just swapping and/or reloading weapons — but there are plenty of other things you might need to do while gaming. There are also plenty of useful shortcuts that can be mapped to your mouse buttons for when you're not gaming at all — having 12 easily-accessible macro keys is fantastic for productivity, if you use them. Plus, if you're using a multi-button mouse built by a mainstream gaming company, the supporting peripheral software will usually allow you to set up game- and app-based profiles that switch based on your current active window. This can be finicky, however — as most peripheral softwares is — so I prefer to map my mouse buttons to generic extra modifier keys (e.g., F13, F14, etc.) This only works for actions that can be remapped within the game, of course — anything else, you'll need to map directly to the mouse. MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls Online have an autorun feature — a hotkey that lets you toggle forward movement, so you can move without having to hold down the W key for hours. I'm pretty sure binding ESO's autorun to one of my mouse buttons saved me from a repetitive stress injury. Many of the best gaming keyboards come with volume knobs (and other dedicated media controls) — but I don't have time to find and fiddle with a knob when my husband is trying to talk to me over my dogs barking. I don't use it so often that it needs to be foolproof, but I've never regretted mapping volume controls to my mouse. The default screenshot hotkeys — Print Screen for Windows, and F12 for third-party apps like Steam and ReShade — are not in a particularly convenient location. Some might argue that lightning-quick screenshot-taking isn't a critical aspect of gameplay, but I beg to differ. But you can make your keyboard significantly more efficient and one-handed by moving modifier keys — Ctrl, Fn, Shift... and the Windows key — to your mouse. Now, instead of having to use two hands to perform Fn shortcuts, you can hold down a mouse button with one hand and pump out those secondary keybinds like nobody's business. Multiple mouse buttons aren't just convenient and efficient in games — they can make powerful productivity tools, and you can usually set up app-specific profiles similar to the gaming-specific profiles using peripheral software. Anyone who uses a complex, shortcut-heavy app — basically any photo-, video-, or sound-editing software — knows how useful it would be if you could perform some of those shortcuts with the click of a mouse button. The most frustrating thing about having a large, high-resolution screen — or multiple large, high-resolution screens — is managing windows and tabs (it's hard enough to just find your mouse with multiple screens). (But you probably still don't want to start with the close tab shortcut — just in case.) Also, any task that requires you to either use a keyboard shortcut or find your mouse and move it very precisely somewhere on screen is worth considering (e.g. "Show Desktop"). Take a look at any gaming peripheral software and you'll see that there are several different types of keys and actions that can be mapped — some you may not have realized were options, and some you may not have wanted as options (I'm pretty sure Asus gives you the specific option of mapping Armoury Crate somewhere, as though anyone is so desperate for Armoury Crate that they'll dedicate an entire button to it (not to mention the fact that, if Armoury Crate isn't running, you probably won't be able to open it on an Asus-made peripheral until Armoury Crate is running). Just like you probably don't need to manually switch your Razer Chroma RGB lighting effects so often that you want to dedicate an entire mouse button to it — not even if you have a dozen mouse buttons. You also probably don't need to map more than one DPI or profile switch button, as it usually makes sense to just cycle through those. Individual keys that aren't associated with shortcuts aren't terribly useful, either — but text strings, if used often enough, can definitely be worth it. One of my mouse buttons is programmed to type "site:tomshardware.com " — space included, for quick, site-specific searches, but other text strings that come to mind are those that contain unusual characters or punctuation. I do have one of my mouse buttons programmed to insert an em-dash, for the rare occasion that I'm using a keyboard without a numberpad. I know plenty of people will insist that five or six buttons is more than enough, and that they wouldn't even know what to do with 12 buttons — let alone 19. All those buttons can be pretty intimidating, and it does take some time and experimentation to get a 19-button mouse set up perfectly, for you. But if you do put in the effort and take full advantage of how customizable gaming mice — and most peripherals, actually — are today, you'll quickly find that 19 buttons isn't nearly enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XR, or extended reality, headsets are on the outs, but smart glasses are eating more and more of what was once VR's slice of the face-mounted wearables pie. HTC, one of the few lingering pioneers of VR headsets with its Vive series, couldn't stand up to Meta's Quest for cheap consumer virtual reality, but it may be able to shoulder in some room with a new pair of smart glasses that goes tit for tat with Meta's Ray-Ban and Oakley HSTN smart eyewear. HTC is now fashioning a pair of stylish frames called the Vive Eagle. It's using a Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 chipset and comes with 32GB of onboard storage. The device can use AI image and text recognition if you need it to spell any text you're looking at. Vive is compatible with Google Gemini and ChatGPT for features like translation, though we don't have more details about what specific models users will have access to. Like Meta's glasses AI, the Vive Eagle has a “memory” feature that can recall people you've met or where you parked your car. HTC hasn't mentioned what apps Vive Eagle will be compatible with, and since the smart glasses are currently only available in Taiwan, it's unclear what sort of compatibility we can expect if it ever makes its way to the U.S. HTC promised the Vive Eagle can do a full 4.5 hours of continuous music playback, and it should last more than 36 hours on standby on its 235mAh battery. Meta promises users should get up to four hours on the Ray-Bans with moderate usage. The larger Oakley Meta glasses promise a up to five hours of audio playback at 100% charge. HTC promises the Vive Eagle will charge from 0 to 50% in less than 10 minutes with fast charging through its glasses case. 🔊 The audio is truly amazing with very little leakage. Loud & bassy.📷 12MP super wide FOV camera🎙️ 4x mic array, with a great directional mic to capture your voice even in noisy environments🔋 Large battery for lasting the entire day. Considering the specs and capabilities, HTC's biggest impediment will be price. It's currently asking for 15,600 new Taiwan dollars, or around $535. Some China-based companies are going hard into AR glasses, including ones with full screens housed in utterly massive frames. Other Ray-Ban Meta competitors, like these glasses from Xiaomi feature much longer battery life, closer to 8 hours of continuous music playback. We're still waiting to see what comes out of Android XR and Google's partnership with glasses maker Xreal. HTC's last big product, the Vive Focus Vision, was an expensive $1,000 headset for PC VR with a dated VR-focused chipset and Fresnel lenses, an older style of lenses found on the $300 Meta Quest 3S that are considered worse than pancake lenses found on the $500 Meta Quest 3. If HTC really wants to compete with other big smart glasses makers, it needs to show us a product we truly haven't seen before—preferably at a lower price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major source of cancer that's now almost entirely preventable through vaccination. But sobering research out today shows that Americans are largely in the dark about HPV and its many health risks, much less the HPV vaccine. A third of Americans don't know that the virus exists, they found, while most who do know are still unaware it can cause more than one type of cancer besides cervical cancer. People in certain regions of the country, particularly Midwest and Southern states, were even less aware of HPV, which likely helps explain why vaccination rates are lagging in these areas, the researchers say. “Some of these states have the lowest HPV vaccine coverage in the nation, which could be a reason why we are observing these differences,” lead study author Ashvita Garg, a public health researcher at MUSC, told Gizmodo. There are over 200 different types of HPV, which is spread through skin contact (including sexual contact), and HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Some types are low-risk, only causing unseemly but harmless warts along our skin or genitals. Other high-risk types can linger in the body and cause damaging changes to normal cells that raise their risk of becoming cancerous. HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer, accounting for nearly all cases. But high-risk HPV infections are also primarily responsible for several other kinds of cancer, including vaginal and vulvar cancers in women, penile cancer in men, and oral cancer in both men and women. All told, about 40,000 HPV-caused cancers occur annually in the U.S. Their sample ultimately included almost 23,000 responses collected between 2017 and 2022. Ignorance of HPV and the vaccine was especially high (over 40%) in seven states, including Kansas, Nebraska, and Illinois in the Midwest, as well as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama in the South. The team's findings were published Thursday in JAMA Oncology. Some countries have already started to effectively eliminate cervical and other HPV-related cancers through widespread HPV vaccination, but the U.S. is still lagging well behind. Overall, only around 57% of American teenagers in 2023 received the HPV vaccine as recommended, well below the 80% target goal that health officials are hoping to reach by 2030. The researchers say that much more effort is needed to improve people's knowledge of HPV and its dangers. “Improving HPV awareness would require a multifaceted approach, such as public education campaigns, improving patient-provider communication, and community and school-based outreach programs,” Garg said. Unfortunately, the federal government may not be so interested in HPV prevention these days. All that said, Garg and her team at MUSC are still dedicated to improving HPV vaccine coverage in their neck of the woods. “MUSC is also actively involved in public health outreach, particularly in South Carolina, where initiatives like the HPV Vaccination Van are helping to improve education and access to HPV vaccination.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, WIRED reported that the investment banking arm of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company led by the sons of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, was exploring creating a financial product for clients to bet on whether President Donald Trump's signature tariffs would be struck down in court. In response to WIRED's reporting, Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick on Wednesday demanding more information about the firm's activities. “Given that one of the purported architects of President Trump's tariff policy is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, your father and the former Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, the firm's actions raise obvious conflict-of-interest and insider dealing concerns,” the lawmakers wrote. Cantor is not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs,” Erica Chase, a spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in an emailed statement. Howard Lutnick ran Cantor Fitzgerald for nearly 30 years until he was confirmed by the Senate in February, when he turned over control of the firm to Brandon and his brother Kyle, who are both in their twenties. But according to WIRED's previous reporting, the investment bank that made Lutnick a billionaire was recently letting certain clients wager that Trump's tariffs will eventually be ruled unlawful, at which point companies that have paid the import duties could apply to get their money back. Experts said the proposed deals are a form of litigation finance, an increasingly popular category of investing in which financial firms seek to make money from potential legal settlements. Trump announced in February that the US would put steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). State officials and small businesses responded by filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the president exceeded his authority under IEEPA and the tariffs should be ruled illegal. In their letter, Wyden and Warren specifically asked Brandon Lutnick whether anyone at Cantor was in contact with the Trump administration about the tariffs. “Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any person within the Executive Branch, including President Trump, Secretary Lutnick, any individual employed by the Commerce Department, or any other individuals, about tariffs, refunds or exclusions and the legal cases involving IEEPA?” the letter asks. The senators requested that Brandon Lutnick respond to their questions by August 27.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The five-year initiative positions Ai2, as it's known, as a key player in building the technological backbone of U.S. artificial intelligence, while expanding its sources of support beyond its historic reliance on grants and philanthropy from the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. It marks NSF's first major investment in AI software infrastructure for science. The initiative “will supercharge the work we do at Ai2 and increase America's ability to deliver breakthrough AI developments,” Ai2 CEO Ali Farhadi said in a statement. The project, Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure to Accelerate Science (OMAI), will develop a family of large, fully open, multimodal AI models trained on scientific literature and data. The goal is to accelerate breakthroughs in fields such as materials science, biology, and energy. AI is becoming “not just a tool for research, but a catalyst for rethinking how discovery happens across every discipline,” said the OMAI project leader, Noah Smith, Ai2 senior director of natural language processing research and a computer science professor at the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. “The question isn't if AI will transform science — it's who will lead that transformation, and this investment helps ensure that the answer is America,” said Tess deBlanc-Knowles, special assistant for artificial intelligence at NSF, in a briefing with reporters this week. The project gives Ai2 a rare level of access to key AI hardware: Nvidia will supply its HDX B3-100 systems, built on the company's new Blackwell Ultra architecture, along with AI Enterprise software to accelerate training and inference for the new models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement about the project that the goal is “to generate limitless intelligence, making it America's most powerful and renewable resource.” Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, Ai2 has operated largely behind the scenes of the AI boom in recent years, focusing on research and open-source tools while for-profit giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta have dominated headlines. Ai2's work — from natural language models to scientific search engines — has earned respect in research circles, but the new federal and corporate backing stands to elevate its profile. In leading the OMAI project, Ai2 will build on its experience creating OLMo and Molmo, two families of high-performance open AI models, along with open datasets such as Dolma. Unlike many leading AI systems that are fully proprietary or only partially open, Ai2's models are released with the full weights, training data, code, and evaluation tools needed for researchers to inspect, adapt, and retrain them. The OMAI models will be designed for scientific workflows, helping researchers process and visualize data, generate code for analysis, and identify patterns they might otherwise miss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Update Aug 14 6:30 am ET: The opening of this story has been updated following a statement from Nvidia in response to accusations of chip tracking levelled at the Federal government. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that anonymous sources claim U.S. authorities are employing this tactic as part of their investigation into the alleged smuggling of banned AI chips into China. In a statement to Tom's Hardware, an Nvidia spokesperson simply stated, "We don't install secret tracking devices in our products." While the story in question lays the tracking at the feet of Washington, rather than any companies whose products are involved, Nvidia's staunch denail reflects a desire to distance itself from reports as it prepares to resume selling H20 chips in China. Despite the affordability and ubiquity of trackers, it will be prohibitively expensive to place several in all servers that are going through customs. It's more likely that the authorities are allegedly doing this to aid in a specific investigation. It's unclear when this alleged practice started for semiconductors, but those involved in the AI chip supply chain seem aware of these actions. The report cites individuals who claim that they had seen images and videos of trackers being removed from Dell and Super Micro servers, some of them as large as smartphones. Smugglers also apparently know this, with court documents in a recent case of smuggling millions of dollars' worth of chips to China revealing that a suspect instructed their co-conspirators to “pay attention to see if there is a tracker on it.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently denied that the company's most advanced AI chips are being diverted to China. However, multiple outlets confirm that there's a strong black market for these cutting-edge silicon, with a reported billion dollars' worth of Nvidia products being openly traded into the East Asian country in just the last quarter. Washington is trying to hamper China's progress in AI, especially as it's considered a ‘dual-use technology' that is applicable in both civilian and military purposes. Because of this, the White House — across multiple administrations — has applied export controls on state-of-the-art semiconductors, including the most powerful AI chips from Nvidia and AMD. However, Huang has said that the U.S. export control was a failure, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary also saying that holding back China's chipmaking progress is a fool's errand. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The U.S. has since backed down on this particular export control and has reopened the taps for these AI chips; the newer, more powerful variants of these semiconductors still aren't allowed to be shipped to China. In the most recent twist in the saga, AMD and Nvidia have struck a deal to share 15% of related sales revenue with the government in exchange for export licenses for its H20 and MI308, an unprecedented arrangement. American allies such as Singapore are taking action to stop the flow of these AI chips through their borders. Nvidia is against this, though, saying that these ‘permanent flaws' would make their devices vulnerable to hackers. Jowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle is laying off 161 workers in Seattle, according to a filing with the Washington state Employment Security Department. DatacenterDynamics reported Tuesday that the layoffs impacted Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) teams, as well as data center operations technicians, technical project managers for the AI/ML team, and others. In more recent years Oracle has established partnerships with both Seattle-area companies. Rising capital expenditures have created pressure to reduce operating costs through workforce reductions. Oracle is part of the $500 billion joint venture AI infrastructure project “Stargate” with OpenAI and SoftBank. It also inked a recent deal with Temu and helps power TikTok's servers.
