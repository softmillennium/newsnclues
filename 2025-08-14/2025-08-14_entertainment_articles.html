The Dakota Fanning-led horror movie Vicious is set to debut via streaming later this year after it was previously removed from Paramount Pictures‘ theatrical release calendar. Writer-director Bryan Bertino's feature will premiere at Fantastic Fest in Austin next month before its release on Paramount+ and digital formats Oct. 10. Kathryn Hunter, Mary McCormack, Rachel Blanchard, Devyn Nekoda, Klea Scott and Emily Mitchell round out the cast. RLJE Films, Shudder Pick Up Horror Thriller 'Night Patrol' for Theatrical Release (Exclusive) The film had initially been scheduled to hit theaters in August of this year, before its theatrical release was moved up to Feb. 28, 2025. Other features that were announced Thursday as set to premiere at Fantastic Fest include Paramount's Primate, Sony's Sisu: Road to Revenge, Universal's Black Phone 2 and Lionsgate's The Strangers — Chapter 2. A movie shifting its release from theatrical to a purely streaming launch has become less trendy in Hollywood of late, as studios have benefited from the attention that a project can get from hitting theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department has fired one of its own and charged him with felony assault after he threw a sub sandwich at a federal officer. Former Fox News Host turned U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro posted a video on social media Wednesday in which she bragged about having charged Dunn with a felony. Well, he doesn't think it's funny today, because we charged him with a felony assault on a police officer, and we're going to back the police to the hilt. So there — stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else,” she said before posing for the camera. FBI Director Kash Patel announced on Thursday that the individual had indeed been arrested and “charged with felony assault on a federal officer.” Attorney General Pam Bondi later wrote on social media that “if you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you.” “I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER. “You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement,” the attorney general wrote. Bondi does, however, have some level of tolerance for disrespect to law enforcement among her staff. Wise was filmed calling police officers protecting the Capitol “Nazi” and “Gestapo.” Wise also yelled “kill em,” as his fellow rioters clashed with law enforcement. Taylor Swift Unveils ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Cover, Sabrina Carpenter Feature Sabrina Carpenter Is Understandably ‘Freaking Out' About Her Feature on Taylor Swift's Album ‘This Is What It Looks Like to Live Under Authoritarianism' Bondi's Justice Department has nevertheless made a show of throwing the book at anyone who makes any sort of aggressive contact with law enforcement. Sommer was arrested in May after allegedly spitting on former U.S. Attorney Ed Martin during a televised interview.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The latest episode of Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast New Heights exploded in popularity thanks to the duo's in-depth interview with Taylor Swift. The pop mogul announced her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and gave what might be her longest and most candid interview ever, clocking in at more than two hours. 1, which had Jason's spouse and podcaster Kylie Kelce as the guest. A representative for Spotify said the episode generated a 3,000 percent increase in new listeners for New Heights, and the number of female listeners jumped 618 percent. Taylor Swift Reveals Tracklist and Release Date for New Album 'The Life of a Showgirl' On 'New Heights' Podcast Rogan's biggest episode on YouTube was a discussion about UFOs with Bob Lazar and Jeremy Corbell (64 million views), followed by Rogan's interview with Donald Trump last fall (59 million). 1, and it will be interesting to see if Heights moves into the top spot for a week, especially since the Swift episode is still racking up views. “We hit a glitch but will be back shortly” the New Heights X account posted before later tweeting, “Shoutout all the 92%ers and Swifties for actually helping us break the internet.” Oddly enough, WNBA star and Swift fan Caitlin Clark predicted, “Are we sure YouTube isn't going to crash tonight?” Yet a spokesperson for YouTube tells THR that the problem actually wasn't on their end. Also, after years of collaborating with Jack Antonoff, Swift has reunited with hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback, who previously worked with Swift on hits like “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off” — suggesting the album will feel more pop-driven rather than the more downbeat and minimalist style of her recent work. “It just comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life,” Swift said on the podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Take, for example, her first visit to boyfriend Travis Kelce‘s New Heights podcast on Wednesday night (Aug. 13). ET on Thursday (Aug. 14) — just 17 hours after its debut — the two-hour Swift episode had more than 10.8 million views, easily besting the second-most popular episode of the show to date, an 8 million view 2024 chat with Jason's wife, Kylie Kelce, as well as nearly doubling the views for a 2023 chat with Travis' Super Bowl-winning teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes. According to Spotify, based on an average of the previous five episodes, the Swift chat brought a 3,000% increase in new listeners to the show, as well as spiking an overall 2,500% increase in average streams of the episode and a 1,100% jump in tune in around 8:45 p.m. ET, which was an hour and 45 minutes into the show. Not surprisingly, Swift also helped increase female listenership to New Heights, with Spotify saying that the number of females tuning in is already tracking 618% higher than the average for the previous five shows on its first day of release. That figure becomes even wilder when you consider that female listeners already made up the majority (58%) of New Heights listeners. The already popular podcast that has nearly three million subscribers on YouTube got a major boost when Swift visited to reveal the details of her upcoming 12th album, which is due out on Oct. 3 and features a collab with former Eras Tour opening act Sabrina Carpenter on the title track. The LP is produced by Max Martin and Shellback, the dynamic studio duo behind some of her biggest hits from albums such as 1989 and Reputation. Swift, who rarely does sit-down interviews, once again proved to be the ultimate master of her album rollout narrative on New Heights, which racked up nearly 9 million views within its first 12 hours on YouTube, with The New York Times reporting that 1.3 million people tuned in simultaneously to a livestream of the episode before the crowd crush caused a brief technical glitch. In a comparison likely to further stoke the ire of Donald Trump — who earlier this month said he “CAN'T STAND” Swift after earlier saying he “HATES” the singer — the Times noted that, by comparison, an October episode of the very popular Joe Rogan Experience pod featuring then-candidate Trump hit around 11 million views in its first 12 hours on YouTube. At press time, the nearly three-hour Rogan chat with Elon Musk in 2018 is among the most viewed ever on YouTube, with more than 69 million views, though CNN host Kate Bouldan predicted that Swift's New Heights episode is already on its way to becoming “one of the most watched podcasts of all time.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Cruise has never had any issues jumping out of planes or riding motorcycles off cliffs, but boring old “scheduling conflicts” are apparently something even he can't conquer. According to The Washington Post, Cruise was offered one of the Kennedy Center Honors that Donald Trump announced yesterday, but declined due to said scheduling conflicts. Former and current Kennedy Center employees speaking to the outlet did not disclose any specifics on those scheduling conflicts or any other reasons why Cruise might have declined. Cruise has remained largely tight-lipped on the country's current political hellscape. When a reporter asked the actor to comment on Trump's proposed movie tariffs, Cruise responded by saying that  “we'd rather answer questions about the movie.” The final honoree list, all of whom apparently had some free time on their calendar, includes Kiss, Michael Crawford, George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, and Gloria Gaynor. It does not include Trump himself, although the president did say, “Next year we'll honor Trump, okay?” after whining about how he'd never gotten the offer before. Not everyone was so unenthusiastic about his role as emcee, however. He could be the host out of Applebee's!” she elaborated. “Anything that distracts him from running this country into the ground.” Alan Tudyk's weird and wonderful Resident Alien performance will be missed By Saloni Gajjar August 6, 2025 | 10:00am Sunset Boulevard is 75 and the pictures are smaller than ever By Matthew Jackson August 8, 2025 | 10:00am</p>

Now, GKIDS has announced that the restoration will premiere in North American theaters on Friday, November 19. Released in Japan on December 15, 1985, “Angel's Egg” was the third feature of director Mamoru Oshii, who is best known worldwide for his seminal cyberpunk animated film of a decade later, “Ghost in the Shell.” At the time of “Angel's Egg,” Oshii's only other directorial efforts were two spinoff films of the popular anime comedy series “Urusei Yatsura.” A completely original work, “Angel's Egg” was made in collaboration with artist Yoshitaka Amano, who is most famous in America for providing the character designs for the early “Final Fantasy” video games.

The Iranian filmmaker has been banned from filmmaking (though it seldom stopped him) and imprisoned multiple times for opposing his home country's government, most recently in 2022, when he had to rely on others to read messages on his behalf at global film festivals that screened his film “No Bears.” He was eventually released following a hunger strike in February 2023, and returned to work on a blistering moral dilemma film about an Iranian man who kidnaps the man who once tortured him in prison and, along with the man's other victims, is forced to make a decision about whether or not to kill him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, it's Muppet Babies TOS! So congrats to Spock, Chapel, Uhura, and Scotty—and sorry to Dr. M'Benga, whose status as a minor player on The Original Series apparently doesn't qualify him for the mission. After a season that has riffed on action epics, wedding comedies, zombies, 1960s detective stories, and Tomb Raider-style puzzles, this is yet another zippy action hour. That said, it also has me wondering about the limits of what Strange New Worlds has to offer to the Trek canon. Before we get into that, however, let's start with our leading man of the week. I've always found Wesley to be quite a fun addition to this early Trek universe, even if his Kirk doesn't really remind me of the original flavor. (If anything, Anson Mount is the one channeling Shatner's affable Kirk charisma.) Although given how often Strange New Worlds deploys Wesley in alternate-universe scenarios like the holodeck mystery in “A Space Adventure Hour,” it can be hard to remember just how little time we've actually spent with his “real Kirk” these past three seasons. the installment where he helps Uhura process her hallucinations of Hemmer). (Remember when he and Una had that whole musical number about the importance of connecting to your crew?) I guess the truth is that with only two previous “real” appearances under his belt, we haven't spent enough time with this version of Kirk to know what is and isn't out of his depth. It also helped to revisit season two and remember that Kirk was specifically supposed to be the youngest First Officer in Starfleet history—breaking his dad's record in the process. So I guess his brief crisis of confidence upon being made acting captain makes sense for a young newbie in his first “major” job. Although opening this episode with a personal log where he explains he's so bored he can barely remember the stardate anymore doesn't exactly drive home the idea that this is all still relatively new to him. In fact, between this and Star Trek Beyond, I need Trek writers to understand that a handsome white man zooming up the career ladder and then immediately getting bored is not a relatable or sympathetic character flaw. It turns out making bold leadership decisions in theory is a lot easier than when you're the one who has to live with the consequences. And a lot of this episode really is fun and charming to watch—particularly back on Enterprise, where the rest of the crew get to run around being scrappy action heroes led by Pelia installing old-fashioned landlines to circumvent a communications block from the raiders. (I'm still laughing about how Carol Kane delivers the line, “When the novelty wore off, you got a little creepy!” to a Kit-Cat Klock.) But I'm just not sure that what this already pretty scattered season needed was a Kirk-centric hour—especially when characters like Ortegas and Una have gotten so little focus in this batch (or in this series, frankly) and since it's not like we're lacking for Kirk-centric Trek elsewhere. Last season, it felt kind of revolutionary to use Kirk as a supporting player for an Uhura story. But using her as a supporting player in his is just business as usual—even if it's sweet to see her advocate for his potential while the rest of her friends consider declaring him mentally unfit and taking control of the ship. Starting Strange New Worlds seven or so years before The Original Series is just an odd amount of time to do “younger” versions of the characters we know and love (particularly for someone like Spock, who's got a two-century lifespan). Unfortunately, it's hard to do that kind of subtle character work in an episodic sci-fi show that's mostly just here to have fun—especially with a character who isn't a series regular. (The fact that he served under a Vulcan captain feels like it totally recontextualizes his relationship with Spock.) But because the show has to use its main cast and because this episode wants to lean into the TOS nostalgia, it has Kirk learn his lesson via his future Enterprise pals and Pike instead, which is a more “fun” but less interesting choice. And, unfortunately, it kind of feels like making the more fun but less interesting choice is Strange New World's default—even in an episode like this, which is all about adding shades of grey to what initially seems like a Good Starfleet vs. Bad Space Raiders premise. I was reminded of The West Wing scene where President Bartlett asks, “Why is a Kundunese life worth less to me than an American life?” and Will Bailey replies, “I don't know, sir, but it is.” Objectively, there's no reason the crew should have more empathy for these human space pirates than they would for an alien race with a similar origin story. But even a utopian society can't erase all instinctual biases. The whole thing becomes a lesson in radical empathy for Kirk, on top of the lesson in listening to your crew that he gets from his future TOS pals. But it's also kind of predictable and emotionally safe too. And there are times I wish Strange New Worlds wanted to be more than that. While the series launched by course correcting a lot of Discovery's flaws, it could gain something by embracing that show's ambitious attempts to say meaningful things too. It's just a little harder to appreciate because it comes wrapped up in another one of the more fanfic-y installments of the season. There's definitely room to make Strange New Worlds a show about Kirk befriending his future crewmates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A video clip posted on her Instagram page yesterday shows Del Rey driving as the song plays in the background, starting with the lyric in question: “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post/Think it's cute reenacting my Chicago pose.” Watch it on her Instagram page. While bits and pieces of the song have leaked over the years, this is the most substantial chunk yet of what appears to be a formal recording. Fans have surmised that the lyrics relate to Cain's apparent involvement with Salem's Jack Donoghue, Del Rey's ex. The mention of an Instagram post in the lyrics seemingly refers to a pair of posts, by the respective artists, in 2022: Del Rey with Donoghue outside a prison; Cain with him by a dam. (Del Rey subsequently took a pretend shift at a Waffle House in Alabama.) Cain is also thought to have alluded to Lana Del Rey on social media in the past. Del Rey recently debuted new music at Stagecoach festival. The new songs are believed to be in line for a new album that has been referred to either as Lasso or The Right Person Will Stay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the death of Brandon Blackstock, his obituary revealed that he had a girlfriend, Brittney Jones, who once worked for his ex-wife, Kelly Clarkson. Few details are known about their relationship, but according to a new report, the couple was very private. In an August 2025 report from Us Weekly, a source told the outlet that Jones was a “big part” of Blackstock's life before his passing. According to Jones' LinkedIn profile, she worked as a production assistant for Clarkson in 2016 and also worked as an executive management assistant for the “Idol” alum from 2018 to 2020. She moved to work with Blackstock in June 2020, the same month Clarkson filed for divorce. After leaving the entertainment industry, she worked with him to build Valley View Rodeo.” The insider added, “Brandon was very private, especially after leaving the entertainment industry — but his family embraced his relationship with Brittney.” The tribute shared by Axelson Funeral & Cremation Services notes, “Narvel Brandon Blackstock peacefully passed to be with the Lord on the morning of August 7th, 2025, after a brave and courageous 3-year battle with cancer. “Brandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.” On August 8, Jones' father paid tribute to Blackstock in a Facebook post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KISS felt like shouting out loud when Donald Trump revealed that they would be among the this year's Kennedy Center Honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13). The (allegedly) retired greasepaint rockers known for such beloved jams as “Love Gun,” “Black Diamond” and “Christine Sixteen” made the cut along with country icon George Strait, Broadway star Michael Crawford, disco singer Gloria Gaynor and Rocky/Rambo actor Sylvester Stallone. Despite previously disagreeing with Trump's actions during his first term, in quotes first reported by TMZ, the band's members were reportedly joyful about joining the ranks of such past Kennedy Center icons as Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Stevie Wonder and Garth Brooks, among many others. Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley added, “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off. Former guitarist Ace Frehley called it a “dream come true that I never thought would materialize” and former drummer Peter Criss said, “I feel so blessed. This is the greatest honor of our career.” Trump was the first president to never attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala during his first term and until recently he had never taken in a single program at the beloved D.C. arts center. The choice of sometime critics KISS is interesting because it comes a week after Trump unexpectedly fired the head of the non-partisan, technocratic Bureau of Labor Statistics after it released a jobs report he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged” to make him look bad. He changed his tune a short time later. The band turned down a reported invitation to play Trump's first inauguration and by the time Trump lost his second bid for office to President Joe Biden in 2020, Simmons had a very different view. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. When you get into a position of power, it does affect lives. He's out for himself, any way you can get there. It's Mob Boss behavior and politicians putting party over audits, investigations, court rulings & COUNTRY in an effort to overrule the will of American voters.” Stanley also referred to the violent horde of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “TERRORISTS,” calling the assault an “armed insurrection” by a mob who were all pardoned when Trump took office again earlier this year. The singer also noted back then that the “flames were fanned today & over time by the president [Trump] & specific senators who CANNOT be allowed now to distance from or denounce what they have directly caused. The Trump-hosted 2025 Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS in December. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first is Arrington de Dionyso, frontman of the feral blues-punk band Old Time Relijun, whose artistic practice includes communicating with trees, performing sacred mushroom songs, and emergency rituals to avert nuclear war. Although his recent output has largely rejected the mysticism of his earlier work, the clicking of rocks and sticks formed a recurring motif on Mount Eerie's recent Night Palace, like a spell to spur new growth in the scorched spaces in his songs. Maybe the leap of faith required to believe in magic is also a prerequisite for getting into GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND, which consists of Elverum turning the knob on a homemade gong-subwoofer contraption while Dionyso unleashes all manner of woodwinds. This is not music that required a lot of elbow grease to make, beyond the construction of the instrument itself—which is the kind of thing that'd merit a human interest story in the local paper even if these guys weren't already famous. If you find something inherently comical about noise music, Giant Mouth will not dissuade you; if you find something mystical about it, a fulfillment of the promise that music can invoke a presence bigger than the sum of its parts, you might listen with pangs of genuine awe. The album opens with an onomatopoeic scream, “AAAWAAHAAAL,” which almost certainly comes from Dionyso, unless Elverum has a killer hair-metal vibrato we didn't know about. (The two are karaoke buddies, and it was in fact Dionyso who recorded Elverum singing “Got Money” in one of the crucial pieces of Elverum lore.) “Ear Home” follows with a choir of woodwinds blowing madly, including a flute used in spirit possession rituals by the Kaili people of Sulawesi, to summon whatever it is the gong is supposed to represent: some kind of primal force, something big and ancient bearing down on you. That sound doesn't let up for the next 20 minutes, and though sometimes its shrieks are so pained as to seem ridiculous, there's always a low-end thrum tugging the music back towards the earth. You don't always know what channel it's going to come from. Dionyso and Elverum recorded this music in 2014 and let it sit for more than a decade, giving the music time to ferment like a pungent brick of tea, picking up funky new undertones upon ripening. For Elverum fans, the distance is crucial for another reason: This is the first music he's released since the passing of his wife, Geneviève, in 2016, that is not informed, either explicitly or implicitly, by her death. Even Night Palace, which was informed by nature-worshipping masterpieces like The Glow, Pt. Here, it's—well, a GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND. If the choice to bestow such a grandiose moniker upon a collection of tracks that take as long to listen to as they did to record doesn't make clear the disproportionately exalted intent behind this music's creation, the play-by-play on Elverum's increasingly essential Substack (“the earth folds in on itself”) certainly should. It feels like an acknowledgement of a truce with his younger and more credulous self that Elverum would release this music so casually, on his own label, with so little apprehension beyond his frank acknowledgment that this isn't something people who learned “You'll Be in the Air” on ukulele would necessarily want to pair with their morning coffee. It'd be easy enough to write off GIANT OPENING MOUTH ON THE GROUND as a byproduct of friends “just trying to blow each others' minds,” as Elverum described on The Microphones in 2020, but if you approach it with the sense of wonder with which its creators approached its making, you might start to feel the magic seep into your bones.
