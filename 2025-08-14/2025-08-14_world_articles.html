East Jerusalem is widely recognized by Palestinian authorities and allies as the site for the capital of a Palestinian state. “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize,” said Smotrich in remarks Thursday. “Anyone in the world who tries today to recognize a Palestinian state will receive an answer from us on the ground.” The plan is expected to receive final approval next week. The E1 plan has existed for decades as a longstanding goal of Israel and allies like the U.S. for Israel to conquer Palestine. Such proposals have existed under the guise of historic pushes for a two-state solution, which advocates for Palestinian rights often criticize as a distraction that allows Israel to continue its construction of illegal settlements, de facto annexation, and now genocide. He called Smotrich's announcement a “colonial, expansionist, and racist move.” But Israeli officials have been advancing the plan in recent months, and rights groups indeed say that it could prove a major impediment to the establishment of a Palestinian state. This comes despite the International Court of Justice ruling last year reaffirming that Israel's settlements are illegal and ordering Israel to return the land to Palestinians. Smotrich's announcement comes as a direct result of Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K.'s announcements that they are planning to recognize a Palestinian state — without announcing moves to hold Israel accountable and even as all of these states placed conditions on the recognition that favor Israel. Smotrich has moved in direct retaliation to such announcements before, collectively punishing Palestinians for foreign governments' actions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto-based AI company Cohere has hired former Meta executive Joelle Pineau and announced another round of fundraising.thibault camus/The Associated Press Cohere Inc. has raised US$500-million and hired a key executive from Meta Platforms Inc. META-Q as it seeks to compete against its much larger rivals and secure customers in the frenzied market for artificial intelligence. Cohere has also hired McGill University computer science professor and former Meta executive Joelle Pineau as its chief AI officer. This month, the company made its North platform available for wide release, which can access a company's internal data to draft documents and reports, and can be used to build AI agents to complete repetitive administrative tasks. “I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that,” co-founder Nick Frosst said. “I spend a lot more time thinking about the technology we're building.” The economics for Cohere are different than its competitors, he added. OpenAI, Anthropic and others have consumer-facing chatbots that require large amounts of money to operate. “We're able to add a ton of value for their business, and also be a sustainable business model for us. Some of the consumer applications have a pretty hard time doing that,” Mr. Frosst said. Cohere has also hired Francois Chadwick, a former Uber executive, as its chief financial officer. Dr. Pineau starts in September and will be based in Montreal, where Cohere recently announced plans to open an office and partnered with Mila, one of the country's AI research hubs. (Sara Hooker, who previously headed the lab, announced her departure earlier this week.) Her hiring in 2017 was part of a wave of Canadian AI talent getting snapped up by American tech firms, including Sanja Fidler, who leads Nvidia's Toronto research lab. “This isn't a vote of protest against AGI,” Dr. Pineau said. “I'm interested in real solutions, rather than a lot of talk and the hype.” She received many job offers after leaving Meta, she said, and she chose Cohere because of its focus on responsible AI deployment and in order to be part of a smaller, more agile team. She suggested to La Presse in July that she was also not comfortable with the U.S. tech industry's shift to support U.S. president Donald Trump. “I was at Meta for eight years or so through various political cycles,” she said. There are a number of fundamental research problems she hopes to tackle at Cohere, including how to evaluate the performance of AI agents and how these tools interact with one another.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US officials did not say who had the 16th-century page that was missing from Mexico's archives for decades Nearly five centuries after Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés signed it and decades after someone swiped it from national archives, a priceless manuscript page has been returned by the FBI to Mexico. “This is an original manuscript page that was actually signed by Hernán Cortés,” said special agent Jessica Dittmer, a member of the FBI's art crime team in New York. “Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history.” Cortés landed in Mexico with a small army in 1519, when he formed alliances with local groups that opposed the Aztec empire, which helped him capture the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán – modern-day Mexico City – just two years later. The document is dated 20 February 1527, just days before one of Cortés's top lieutenants was appointed co-governor of the conquered territory. The manuscript was initially stored in Mexico's national archives, but archivists microfilming the collection in 1993 found that 15 pages had gone missing. The New York City police department, US Department of Justice and Mexico's government were all involved in the investigation. In 2023, the agency returned a 16th-century letter from Cortés. “Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering offering Moscow access to Ukraine's natural minerals in the Russian-occupied territories, a move Ukrainians say would be illegal and damaging to Washington's reputation. The news comes as Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15 the war in Ukraine, without inviting Kyiv. According to the Telegraph, Trump's team is putting together proposals to incentivize Putin to reach a peace deal that include exploiting Ukrainian minerals, sanctions relief, and access to resources in Alaska, rich in oil and gas.The suggestion that Trump could greenlight Russia's exploitation of its resources in its mineral-dense regions has both baffled and alarmed industry experts in Ukraine. "It will mean that international law does not exist anymore and global international relations will transform not even to realpolitik, but to Squid Game (the Netflix hit where contestants play lethal games for a huge cash prize)," economist Volodymyr Landa told the Kyiv Independent. Russia is already plundering resources from the occupied territories of Ukraine, particularly iron ore, which it exports via the Kerch Bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia. It would violate international law and require Washington to recognize the occupied territories as part of Russia, which no other country has done, Taras Kachka, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told the Kyiv Independent in an interview published in July. "This would not be favorable for America's reputation," Gennadiy Chyzhykov, president of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told the Kyiv Independent. He believes that Trump could be repeating his minerals deal playbook, where he first proposed to Kyiv a widely criticized "colonial" style agreement before negotiating down to a more mutually beneficial joint investment fund. He could be gauging where Ukraine and the international community's middle ground is by starting off with an “absurd” proposition, said Chyzhykov. Washington could more realistically offer up its Alaskan resources to Moscow. They could sign projects or review former development projects in the Arctic," George Popov, an investment analyst at Ukrainian firm BrightOne Capital, told the Kyiv Independent. The plan was scratched in 2018 due to Western sanctions on Moscow. Following the Russia-U.S. summit in Saudi Arabia in February, Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's Direct Investment Fund, said that the two sides had discussed cooperating on energy projects in the Arctic, although he did not provide details. Trump has a keen eye on the region too, particularly as China develops its own Arctic strategy, proposing to purchase Greenland for America's "national security." "If Trump wants to share Alaska resources with Putin, that may be a better option for Ukraine than Ukrainian resources in the Russian-occupied territories," said Landa. He has written for a number of publications including the Financial Times, bne IntelliNews, Radio Free Europe/Liberty, Euronews and New Eastern Europe.

At full maturity, whale sharks measure around nine or 10 meters long and can weigh from 15,000 to 40,000 kilograms. Whale sharks have a broad, flat head and are typically brown or gray in color. Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日） https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang Whale shark reproduction has long been a mystery for scientists. However, a significant discovery in 1995 off the eastern coast of Taiwan provided valuable insights. Researchers examined a pregnant female of the species and found over 300 embryos inside her body, ranging from about 40 to 60 cm in length. This discovery revealed that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. Instead of laying eggs in the ocean, the mother carries them internally until they hatch, giving birth to fully developed live young. Their bright feathers and graceful movements have fascinated humans for centuries. Let's explore peacocks' unique characteristics and cultural significance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In ancient Celtic folklore, Tír na nÓg is the land of eternal youth, where time stands still and people don't age. Today, in the west of Ireland, they've come close to bottling it. A facility operated by the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company AbbVie employs at least 1,300  local people and about 500 additional contractors  – an economic backbone to a town of barely 7,000 people. Therapeutic Botox – used for conditions that include muscle spasticity, migraines, overactive bladders, certain eye conditions and excessive sweating  – brought in $3.3 billion for AbbVie last year, with sales of cosmetic Botox, often used to smooth facial wrinkles, generating $2.72 billion. But last week, US President Donald Trump took a step toward his goal of bringing that multi-billion-dollar industry home, announcing 15% tariffs on all pharmaceutical exports from the European Union. Inside the sprawling 61-acre campus – a sleek industrial presence nestled below Croagh Patrick, one of the country's most storied pilgrimage sites – vials of Botox are processed and packaged in powder form, before export to some 70 countries, according to industry estimates. It's embedded in the community, powering everything from infrastructure to sports teams and local charities. No employee of AbbVie would speak on the record with CNN. But daycare center owner Anne-Marie, who chose not to give her surname for privacy reasons, said she had heard many parents who work at the plant – and leave their children in her care – voice anxiety about what could lie ahead. Are they going to have a job this time next year? “Westport doesn't know what it's like without an American pharmaceutical treatment place. And I don't think we'd like to find out what it looks like without it,” said Cusack, whose 25-year-old daughter also works at the plant. Last month, after weeks of uncertainty, the US-EU trade deal was finally agreed upon. The calm after its announcement was to be short-lived. Singling out Ireland – the world's third-largest pharma exporter and home to pharma giants Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer – Trump said last Tuesday that upcoming tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could reach 250% over the next 18 months. “We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” he said. But tariffs alone aren't likely to spark a mass move. While the idea of bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US resonates with Trump's base, putting it into practice is fraught with challenges. Experts say that while some drug production may shift to existing US facilities, full-scale reshoring is unlikely due to high costs, regulatory hurdles, supply chain challenges, and the long timelines for building or relocating high-tech plants – delays that could outlast any political changes. Anne-Marie suggested that the US president's moves could be purely political but said they have still managed to sow widespread concern. “When he goes out of power, it's just gonna all change again  – like it did the last time,” she said, referring to Trump's first term in office and noting that people's lives can't be dictated by what she characterized as the whims of one man. It's an attitude that is felt around the town. As traffic buzzed through the area, Mayo councillor Peter Flynn told CNN that while the tariffs have created “a real headache,” people there are “getting on with their lives.” “This kind of ‘lift and shift' approach that Donald Trump is talking about – it's nonsensical,” he said. He argues that moving operations is extremely difficult, even domestically—let alone overseas—because of the gross logistical challenges it brings, let alone the skilled workers it requires, many of whom he says are now leaving the US “at speed.” Plus, he added, “anyone that's considering a location to move to – be it India or some of these other locations where a lot of graduates come from – are now taking the US off their map.” Other major drugmakers have also announced that they'll be scaling up American investment in response to the new tariffs. Ahead of the tariff deal, Ireland appeared to proactively fast-track exports: €20 billion ($23 billion) worth of pharma goods were shipped to the US in the first two months of this year, according to official trade data. And while a trade war appears to have been averted for now, American consumers could be at the receiving end of soaring drug costs. Consumers could shoulder the burden over time through higher health insurance premiums and increased drug prices at pharmacies. For products like cosmetic Botox, which isn't covered by US health insurance, the costs of procedures already considered a luxury could also rise, analysts say, putting a further strain on wallets. Driving to pick up his American guests, who were horse riding at a nearby beach on Clew Bay, where he runs an equestrian trekking outfit, Lennon said he wasn't so worried about the Westport plant taking a hit. “There's innovative thinking in every one of our businesses… and I think we'll adapt,” Lennon said, as his jeep rattled along the Wild Atlantic Way, a scenic route along the country's rugged coast. “My worry would be that it (the increase in tariffs) could upset the American economy, and we need all these Americans coming to Ireland.” He then recalled a conversation he had with a Trump-supporting guest, who told him: “What's good for America is good for Ireland.”</p>

The talks are scheduled to start at 11.30am local time (8.30pm BST) and will be followed by a press conference. “This will be followed by negotiations between the delegations, which will continue over a working breakfast,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said. Putin and Mr Trump will then hold a press conference, during which they will “summarise the results of the negotiations,” Mr Ushakov added. The leaders will come face-to-face at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Mr Trump has visited the military base a number of times since he first took office in 2017. With Alaska's closest point to Russia being just three miles across the Bering Strait, the location appears to be a win for both leaders. Mike Dunleavy, Alaska's Republican governor, described the northwestern state as a “bridge between nations”. He said it is “the most strategic location in the world,” given its close proximity to Russia, and it “stands ready to host this historic meeting”. Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the US in 1867 for $7.2m (£5.4m), and Russian nationalists have long dreamed of reclaiming it. Mr Trump added that he would seek an immediate second meeting, this time involving Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, after the initial talks. The US president will present money-making opportunities, including opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow and lifting some of the American sanctions on Russia's aviation industry.</p>

MOSCOW, August 14. /TASS/. Special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries, Chief Executive Officer of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev will take part in the Russia-US summit in Alaska on Friday, August 15 as part of the official delegation, informed sources close to the delegations told TASS.

"Kirill Dmitriev will take part in the summit of the leaders of Russia and the US on August 15, Friday, as part of the official delegation," sources said.

Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said on Thursday, August 7, that Russia and the United States had agreed on a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Putin confirmed that preparations were underway for such a meeting, indicating mutual interest.

This announcement followed a visit by US Presidential Special Representative Steven Witkoff to Moscow on August 6, during which he was received by Putin.

According to the US Department of State, the summit is scheduled to take place in Alaska on August 15. Putin's last visit to the United States was in 2015.</p>

He also took over Tankokai, an incorporated association composed of tea ceremony instructors and others, and worked to expand the organizations, while leading the largest number of disciples among tea ceremony schools. Drawing on his wartime experiences, he advocated the idea of “peacefulness from a single cup of tea.” He made a total of over 300 trips to more than 70 countries to advocate world peace while introducing tea ceremony culture. He performed tea ceremonies at the U.N. headquarters in New York in the presence of the U.N. secretary general and representatives from various countries in 2000, 2010, 2015 and 2023. In 2002, he transferred the title to his eldest son and named himself Sen Genshitsu as a master of the tea ceremony. In 1970, he established a  study abroad program for the tea ceremony. Through this program, more than 500 people from at least 40 countries visited the Urasenke school in Kyoto to study tea and Japanese culture. He continued his overseas visits after assuming the name of Sen Genshitsu. In his later years, he was vocal about the promotion of peace and defense issues based on his wartime experiences, giving lectures in Okinawa Prefecture and his hometown of Kyoto.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. HAPPYMON JACOB is Founder of the Council for Strategic and Defense Research, a New Delhi–based think tank, and Editor of India's World magazine. In the past 25 years, India and the United States have become closer than ever before, building strong economic and strategic ties. Their partnership has rested on shared values and shared interests: they are the two largest democracies in the world, home to vast multicultural populations, and both have been concerned about the rise of India's northern neighbor, China. Trump's actions have disregarded several of India's core foreign policy concerns, crossing sensitive redlines that previous U.S. administrations tended to respect. The United States once treated India as an important American partner in Asia. India finds itself dealing with a higher tariff rate than even China, the country that, at least until recently, Washington wanted New Delhi to help contain. And to make matters worse, Trump announced a deal in late July with India's frequent adversary Pakistan, under which the United States will work to develop Pakistan's oil reserves. These tariff woes follow on the heels of another shock to the Indian system: Trump's intervention in May in a clash between India and Pakistan. India vehemently denied that claim—New Delhi has long resisted any external mediation of its disputes with Islamabad, and American officials have been careful not to offend Indian sensitivities in this area—but Trump doubled down. No doubt he was offended by Indian pushback, just as he was pleased by Pakistan's immediate embrace of his claims and its eventual nomination of him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Indian officials are seething, but they understand that anger is unlikely to work where reason has failed. And yet Trump's actions won't encourage a great revision in Indian foreign policy. Instead, New Delhi will survey the shifting geopolitical landscape and likely decide that what it needs is more productive relationships, not fewer. Since its independence, in 1947, India has mostly followed a policy of nonalignment, eschewing formal alliances and resisting being drawn into competing blocs. Now its foreign policy community stresses a commitment to multialignment, which consists of the diversification of partnerships, the refusal to join military alliances, the promotion of a multipolar world order in which no single superpower or pair of great powers is predominant, and a willingness to engage in issue-based cooperation with a wide variety of actors across geopolitical fault lines. This policy is driven both by pragmatism and by the hope that India can serve as a pole in the order to come. Indian policymakers believed that the country's economic, strategic, and military needs could not be fulfilled by a single partner or coalition. As American tariffs take effect, the Indian economy will face increasing headwinds, most likely slowing economic growth. India's strategy presumed a number of structural conditions that Trump has thrown into flux. India assumed, for good reason, that it played a crucial role in the great-power competition between the United States and its allies in one camp and China and Russia in the other. Pakistan seemed peripheral to this larger contest; Islamabad's global standing had diminished after its security establishment facilitated the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. After all, Washington's perception of New Delhi as a potential regional counterweight to Beijing cemented India's strategic value. Russia's war on Ukraine then provided India with a unique opportunity to demonstrate its policy of multialignment and raise its profile in global geopolitics. In the process, India was able to maintain ties with both the United States and Europe, even as it bought Russian oil at favorable rates. Through that lens, Washington has much more to gain from China than it does from India; the war in Ukraine must end because supporting Ukraine is not worth American taxpayers' money; and Europe's problems with Russia are Europe's problems, not those of the United States. In such a worldview, India's geopolitical profile invariably shrinks. Indian governments have traditionally maintained a high tariff structure to protect domestic manufacturing and agriculture, generate revenue, and manage trade balances. India has long justified these tariffs as essential for its developing economy, but the United States is unhappy about the persistent trade deficit in goods with India, agricultural subsidies that limit U.S. access to the Indian market, and India's omnivorous geopolitical maneuvering, including its membership in the coalition of nonwestern countries known as BRICS and its continued reliance on Russian oil and defense equipment. Previous U.S. governments tended to overlook these infelicities, allowing India to liberalize its economy and decouple from Russia at its own pace. Washington's revised approach to great-power competition has not only transformed its own policy toward New Delhi but has also influenced the choices and decisions of other major players—with significant implications for India. As Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, he seeks to punish India for buying Russian oil—a policy that the United States previously encouraged. With Trump in the White House, Russia has more options and needs India less. Indeed, Moscow feels a diminishing obligation to New Delhi and is unwilling to offer more support than it receives, which explains its lukewarm backing during India's clash with Pakistan in May. Russia's public statements at the time were vague: they neither mentioned Pakistan by name nor endorsed India's military reprisals, but simply called for settling disagreements diplomatically. In a sense, Russia echoed India's own messaging after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Indian analysts suspect that Russia refrained from doing so because it didn't want to irritate China, which has become a close strategic partner of Pakistan and provided it with a great deal of new weaponry. Sensing victory in Ukraine, Moscow has new priorities: it now seeks partners capable and willing to challenge the United States and Europe, not merely offering commercial relationships. China can do that, but India is only interested in trade. If Russian support for India is doubtful during a conflict with Pakistan, it's safe to assume that Russia will do little to help India in any future conflict with China. Trump's relative indifference to South Asia will invariably mean a free pass for China, which will attempt to tilt the regional balance of power in its favor through a combination of debt-trap diplomacy, military agreements, and growing political and diplomatic ties with South Asian states. And if China can burrow even deeper into South Asia, it will have Trump to thank. The U.S. president is seeking a trade deal with China while trying to bully India into submission; he evinces little interest in the geopolitical fate of the Indo-Pacific, in general, and South Asia, in particular. During the May clashes with Pakistan, most of India's partners were more concerned about a potential nuclear exchange in South Asia—even if that remains extraordinarily unlikely—than interested in helping India diplomatically, politically, or militarily. They echoed India's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India's position of not siding with either Russia or Ukraine, a stand born out of the policy of multialignment, didn't satisfy either Russia or Western governments, and so nobody stood with India when it faced a crisis. India imagined that it would benefit from great-power competition, maneuvering between China, Russia, and the United States to its own advantage. It worked until the dynamics of that competition changed dramatically. New Delhi saw itself as a central player in Asia. His imposition of very high tariffs this month blindsided Indian policymakers who thought that the White House, in its own interest, would always treat India with due consideration. In such a world, India's geopolitical importance declines dramatically. In that shared doubt about the United States, however, lies a potential salve for India's injured foreign policy. India could strengthen partnerships with European countries and major Asian powers, such as Japan and South Korea, who face their own balancing dilemmas because of the unreliability of the Trump administration. It could also seek to cultivate, or at least signal, closer ties to China and Russia; indeed, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed this month that Putin will visit India later this year. It has already begun considering how to better strengthen its defenses, source its weapons platforms, and establish reliable partnerships and supply chains. India will survive this geopolitical whirlwind with some deft diplomacy and patience, but this turbulent period is likely to have several long-term consequences for New Delhi's foreign policy and strategic outlook. Bilateral relations between India and the United States will suffer acutely. For an Indian foreign policy establishment that is doggedly consistent in its commitment to the status quo, Trump is a constant puzzle. The very inadequacies of multialignment may in fact push India to become only more multialigned. If Washington is not a viable or reliable partner, New Delhi will seek and cultivate other partnerships. Trump's outreach to Beijing and Moscow will now prompt New Delhi to follow suit, reversing India's earlier policy of gradually distancing itself from China and Russia. India's policy of multialignment has just undergone a geopolitical stress test and emerged rather winded.
