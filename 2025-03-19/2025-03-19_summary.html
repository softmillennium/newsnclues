Live view from outside Istanbul's City Hall after Turkish police arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a popular opposition leader and a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor — a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  — and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. The detention of Ekrem Imamoglu was a dramatic escalation in a crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.

The state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued warrants for Imamoglu and some 100 other people. Police raided his residence near dawn and detained the mayor at around 7:30 a.m., his wife said. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun and two district mayors.

Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Turkish police have arrested Istanbul's mayor, part of a series of probes into alleged corruption and terror links.

“We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,” Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video post on social media.

Authorities closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.

Despite the ban, people gathered at Istanbul's police headquarters, carrying posters of the mayor and banners with his photo around their shoulders. Others chanted slogans and raised their fists in the air as riot police cordoned off the facility.




Thousands of people later joined a rally outside the city hall, where the leader of the mayor's party, the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, accused the government of carrying out a “coup.”

“Let's call it what it is: a coup attempt,” Ozgur Ozel told the crowd. “Today, the will of the people is being seized and usurped through a judicial coup targeting the people of Istanbul.”

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters the arrests had nothing to do with the government. “Linking investigations and cases initiated by the judiciary to our President is, at best, presumptuous and inappropriate,” he said.

Erdogan, a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. His current term runs until 2028 but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer — something he could achieve with a constitutional change or if early elections are called.

The Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over the news, triggering a temporary halt in trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. Trading later resumed but was again halted in the afternoon. The Turkish lira lost some 3.5% of its value against the dollar.

Anadolu, the news agency, said that Imamoglu and several others are suspected of a multitude of financial irregularities. 

Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the agency said. The PKK, behind a decadeslong insurgency in Turkey, is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies. 

The Istanbul chief public prosecutor's office later obtained a court order for authorities to seize a construction company partly owned by Imamoglu, based on reports from the the country's Financial Crimes Investigation Board, HaberTurk and other media reports said.

A day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from the next presidential race — a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.

The mayor's party was to hold a primary on Sunday where he was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. With all the arrests Wednesday, that vote was in doubt but Ozel, the party's chairman, said it would go ahead as planned.

In a message conveyed through his lawyer, Imamoglu said his morale was high and encouraged his supporters to “keep their spirits high.”

“We will emerge stronger from this process,” his lawyer Mehmet Pehlivan quoted him as saying.

Earlier, hundreds also gathered outside CHP's headquarters in Ankara as the party's lawmakers protested inside the parliament, disrupting proceedings before marching out.

Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody. 

Imamoglu's arrest was a “disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,” Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.

Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock describing the arrests as a “blow to democracy in Turkey.”

“We are seeing clearly that the space for opposition politicians is getting smaller and smaller,” she said.

Turkey has been trying for decades to join the European Union, but its accession process is held up over concerns about its commitment to democracy and other values like respect for the rule of law.

“The arrest of the mayor is deeply concerning,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Brussels. “Turkey must uphold the democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials.”

Amnesty International said Imamoglu's detention marked an escalation in Turkey's crackdown on the opposition.

“While the weaponization of vague anti-terrorism allegations to detain and prosecute opponents is not new, these latest detentions and associated restrictions represent an alarming intensification of the targeting of real or perceived critics,” said Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty's deputy director for Europe.

Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X even as he himself was being arrested, though at the time he apparently didn't know that Imamoglu was also being taken into custody.

“I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation,” Ongun said.

Separately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.

Meanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.

In nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its business faculty, a decision Imamoglu said he would challenge.

Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.

He is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes on Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said.

Wednesday 19 March 2025 19:16, UK

Israel says it has launched a "limited ground operation" to retake part of a key corridor in Gaza.

The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive that shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January.

As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which bisected northern Gaza from the south and had been used by Israeli forces as a military zone.

It came as an international United Nations worker from Bulgaria was killed and five others seriously wounded in a strike on a UN guesthouse in the Gaza Strip.

Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the UN Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike that killed the worker in the central city of Deir al Balah but said the explosive ordnance was "dropped or fired" and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.

The UN body, known as UNOPS, carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world.

Oren Marmorstein, spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Sky News that the country carried out an initial investigation which found there was "no connection" between the strike and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Speaking to Mark Austin on the News Hour, he said: "Of course, we express our sorrow when it comes to the death of a Bulgarian citizen, a UN worker.

"But no connection has been found. And even more so, we are now working in order to evacuate the body and the wounded will be treated in hospitals in Israel."

Mr Marmorstein did not say who Israel believes is responsible for the strike but said it may be connected to a "terrorist organisation".

The IDF, which has carried out a massive series of airstrikes throughout Gaza since early on Tuesday, had earlier denied reports that it had targeted the UN compound.

But Mr Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the worker was killed.

He said the agency had contacted the IDF after the first strike and confirmed that it was aware of the facility's location.

The UN's secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply saddened" by the staff member's death and condemned attacks on UN personnel.

The war in Gaza has been among the deadliest conflicts ever for humanitarian workers, according to the UN.

At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes, the Gaza health ministry said.

Mr Marmorstein insisted on Sky News that the figures are "anything but accurate".

The IDF claims it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Gaza's health ministry records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it had overnight attacked a Hamas military site from which the militant group planned to launch strikes into Israel.

The IDF targeted the site in northern Gaza as it was where "preparations were being made to fire projectiles at Israeli territory", the military said in a statement.

The Israeli navy also struck several vessels in the coastal area of Gaza as they were intended to be used for "terrorist activities", the IDF claimed.

Israel issued fresh evacuation orders on Wednesday for different areas across the Gaza Strip and told people to move to known shelters in Khan Younis and western Gaza City.

Middle East correspondent

Israel is facing increasing international opposition to its new assault on Gaza, and from some of its close allies including Britain and France whose leaders have both voiced concerns today.

But in actions, and words, the Israeli government is defying those calling for it to stop the attacks.


The Israel Defense Forces has announced what it describes as “limited” ground operations in central and southern Gaza, but limited for how long?


Israel's defence minister has warned of "total devastation" if Hamas doesn't surrender.

Beyond the threats, it's not clear what Israel's strategy is. 

The government failed to achieve its two war aims - to eliminate Hamas and return the hostages - during fifteen and a half months of brutal fighting, so how will it have more success now?


One answer might be Netanyahu's belief that President Trump won't try to rein him in as Joe Biden did. 

But for how long will the White House support a new phase of the war in Gaza?

Trump is an impatient man, and he wants a Gaza peace deal as part of his wider ambitions to resolve the world's conflicts. 


If Netanyahu's new offensive doesn't deliver quick results, the White House might not remain so supportive. 

The latest strikes come weeks after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages for prisoners and were set to negotiate an extension to the truce that was meant to bring about an eventual end to the war. But those negotiations never got off the ground.

Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war.

Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war.

During the ceasefire period, 33 hostages were released, along with nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners.

There are 59 hostages still in captivity, of whom Israel believes 35 are dead.

More than one million people risked being left without food parcels in March if aid was not allowed into Gaza, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the Food Security Sector as saying.

The war, sparked by Hamas' 7 October 2023 killing of 1,200 people and capture of 250 more in southern Israel, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in the Strip, Gazan health officials say.

China's embassy in Canada says it is ‘rule of law' country and those convicted of breaking laws ‘must be held accountable'

Canada's foreign affairs ministry has said it “strongly condemns” the execution of several of the country's citizens in China this year, highlighting sustained tensions between the two countries.

Global Affairs Canada confirmed on Wednesday that an unspecified number of citizens were executed earlier this year. The revelations were first reported by the Globe and Mail.

“Canada strongly condemns China's use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” a GAC spokesperson, Charlotte MacLeod, said in a statement to the Guardian. “Canada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere.”

McLeod said Canada was providing consular assistance to the victims' families and asked media “respect the family's privacy during this difficult time”.

China's embassy in Canada said in a statement it is a “rule of law” nation and that anyone convicted of breaking laws “must be held accountable”.

“Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognized worldwide as extremely harmful to the society, and will be faced with severe penalties in all countries. China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a ‘zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem,” the embassy said, adding it had “solid and sufficient” evidence in all the cases in which prisoners were executed.

“The Chinese judicial authorities have handled the cases in strict accordance with the law, and have fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned.”

China has a conviction rate of more than 99%, a result that has elicited skepticism and criticism from human rights groups over the years.

The embassy called on Canada to “respect the rule of law and China's judicial sovereignty” and to “stop making irresponsible remarks” in order to improve relationship between to the two countries.

Relations between the two countries hit a low point between 2018 and 2022, after the prominent Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver at the request of US authorities.

Her detention in Canada prompted China to quickly detain and charge two Canadians living in the country, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, eventually charing the pair with espionage.

But the upgrading of charges against a Canadian in prison further cemented views in Canada that China was engaged in “hostage diplomacy”.

In 2014, the Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg was accused of attempting to smuggle 225kg of methamphetamine to Australia. He has maintained his innocence, but in December 2018 he was sentenced to 15 years. That charge was upgraded to execution in 2019, during the fervour of China's diplomatic spat with Canada. At the time, Canada issued a travel warning to its citizens going to China.

MacLeod confirmed on Wednesday that Schellenberg was still detained and said the federal government “continues to advocate for clemency”.

German defence minister says Putin ‘is playing a game here' and calls Russian president's demands ‘unacceptable'

European leaders have reacted sceptically to the limited ceasefire in Ukraine agreed by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, saying it has made it abundantly clear that the Russian president is not serious about seeking a peaceful end to the three-year-old conflict.

During a call with the US president, Putin agreed to a partial ceasefire that would stop his forces targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but declined to commit to the 30-day full ceasefire plan pitched by Trump last week and agreed to by Ukraine.

Further doubts about the deal arose after Russia launched a wave of attacks on targets across Ukraine hours after Trump and Putin spoke. Russia also reported a series of attacks by Ukrainian drones.

“Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated,” Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in an interview with the German broadcaster ZDF. “Putin is playing a game here and I'm sure that the American president won't be able to sit and watch for much longer.”

Pistorius said Putin's commitment to stop attacks on energy targets was “basically nothing” because such infrastructure in Ukraine was already the “best protected”.

The minister also described as “unacceptable” the Kremlin's insistence that a key condition for peace would be a total halt of western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.

“This is very transparent,” Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from “further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”.

The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said their countries would continue sending military aid to Ukraine. “Ukraine can count on us,” Scholz said.

The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, also dismissed Russian demands that help for Kyiv be halted. “Ukraine has an undeniable right to defend itself on its own and supported by its partners,” he said on Wednesday. “This right cannot be restricted in any way, not now, and not in the future.”

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, downplayed the US-Russian deal. She said: “It is clear that Russia does not really want to make any kind of concessions.” She added that Kremlin demands to stop arming Kyiv could not be accepted.

Spain's foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was equally cautious about the prospects for peace. In an interview with Radio Nacional de España on Wednesday morning, he described the conflict as “one man's war”, adding that there was “no real will from Putin to stop this war”.

He asaid: “It's positive that there's talk of a ceasefire and talk of peace with Russia, but we're still very far from the peace that Spain and the European people want.”

Others, however, were more optimistic. On Wednesday, China applauded the deal between Putin and Trump.

“The Chinese side has advocated resolving the crisis through dialogue and negotiation from the very beginning,” its foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We welcome all efforts toward a ceasefire and consider it a necessary step toward achieving peace.”

Gustav Klimt's portrait of an African prince, painted when his people were displayed in a “human zoo,” was first dismissed because it didn't “look like a Klimt.”

An oil painting of an African prince created by the Austrian master Gustav Klimt, unearthed in recent years and almost dismissed for not looking like one of his more famous works, is now on sale for $16.32 million (15 million euro).

The 1897 oil painting named after its subject, Prince William Nii Nortey Dowuona, was first displayed at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, this past Thursday and already has several interested parties, including a museum and private buyers, said Lui Wienerroither, co-owner of Wienerroither & Kohlbacher, the gallery selling the piece.

“Klimt gives him such a dignity and warmth,” Wienerroither said of the prince in a phone interview with The Washington Post. “It's showing a turning point in his oeuvre.”

The image was painted the same year Klimt founded what became known as the Vienna Secession movement, in which he and other artists split from the Austrian art establishment's conservative style.

Wienerroither said the value of the painting was not immediately apparent when the current owners walked into his gallery carrying a photograph of it in 2023. A young gallery assistant initially sent them away, believing the image — which was covered in dirt at the time — didn't “look like a Klimt,” he said.

“It was not imaginable that this was a Klimt, it was very dirty,” Wienerroither said. But after his co-owner, Ebi Kohlbacher, tracked the couple down at a coffee shop near the gallery, Wienerroither called his friend and colleague, art historian Alfred Weidinger, who said he had been “searching for this painting for twenty years,” having known of its existence through a black-and-white photograph, Wienerroither said.

The portrait's subject, the prince, was one of around 120 members of the Osu tribe, part of the Ga people, from what is now modern-day Greater Accra in Ghana, Weidinger said in a statement this month. The prince had traveled to Vienna to take part in a “Völkerschau,” a type of exhibition that was popular across Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and often featured people and animals put on display, said Weidinger, who is also executive director at the OÖ Landes-Kultur GmbH, a cultural institution in Austria.

An Austrian zoo worker had — with the support of British colonial administrators in Africa — recruited the prince and members of his tribe to be displayed in Vienna, Weidinger said. After a 53-day journey, the prince and the group took part in a “guest performance”  in Austria's Tiergarten am Schüttel from April to  October 1897, watched by around 10,000 people each day, Weidinger said.

Marie Rodet, an expert in West African history at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said those taking part in “human zoos” were “probably exploited” and left with little choice. She said two types of exhibitions were popular across Europe at the time: those run by states to showcase colonial exploits, and commercial ventures.

“These people were dehumanized in these exhibitions; they were used and exploited, and in a context in which actually it was almost about affirming the superiority of the White race over the rest of the world,” she told The Post, adding such shows were designed to showcase “power.”

It was during this period the prince's portrait was painted by Klimt and fellow Austrian artist Franz Matsch from different angles, Weidinger said, adding it was unclear if this was done on a whim or as part of an established practice. The location of the painting is unknown, he said.

Weidinger said the fact that Klimt's painting remained unsigned, while Matsch's had his signature and a frame, suggests that a potential client may have chosen Matsch's version.

The painting features a stamp that shows the painting is “almost certainly from the estate of Gustav Klimt,” Weidinger added. It was auctioned in Vienna in May 1923 and sold to a wealthy family, but they fled the country when the Nazis came to power in Austria in 1938, leaving their home abandoned. The painting was later revealed to have been part of a private collection since the 1950s, according to Weidinger.

Klimt was a key figure in Vienna's art nouveau movement, perhaps best known for “The Kiss” (1907-1908). This past April, his “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” — a vivid painting of a woman believed to be Henriette Lieser, who was deported and killed by the Nazis — sold for $32 million after it was rediscovered nearly 100 years after being painted.

Wienerroither said the 1897 painting has all the hallmarks of Klimt's early work, including emerging floral forms, which became a feature of his later paintings, such as “Portrait of Sonja Knips” (1898).

Wienerroither described the price tag for the prince's portrait as “very reasonable” for a work he said he had seen move someone to tears.

“It is touching, because you feel this is a person you know,” he said.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the first batch of survey data from its €1.4bn Euclid mission. The release includes a preview of its ‘deep field' where in just one week of observations, Euclid already spotted 26 million galaxies as well as many transient phenomena such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The dataset is published along with 27 scientific papers that will be submitted to the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The dataset also features a catalogue of 380 000 galaxies that have been detected by artificial intelligence or citizen-science efforts. They include those with spiral arms, central bars and “tidal tails”, inferring merging galaxies.

There has also been the discovery of 500 gravitational-lens candidates thanks to AI and citizen science. Gravitational lensing in when light from more distant galaxies is bent around closer galaxies due to gravity and it can help identify where dark matter is located and its properties.

“For the past decade, my research has been defined by painstakingly analyzing the same 50 strong gravitational lenses, but with the data release, I was handed 500 new strong lenses in under a week” says astronomer James Nightingale from Newcastle University. “It's a seismic shift — transforming how I do science practically overnight.”

The data released today still represents only 0.4% of the total number of galaxies that Euclid is expected to image over its lifetime. Euclid will capture images of more than 1.5 billion galaxies over six years, sending back around 100 GB of data every day.

“Euclid shows itself once again to be the ultimate discovery machine. It is surveying galaxies on the grandest scale, enabling us to explore our cosmic history and the invisible forces shaping our universe,” says ESA's science director, Carole Mundell. “With the release of the first data from Euclid's survey, we are unlocking a treasure trove of information for scientists to dive into and tackle some of the most intriguing questions in modern science”.

Euclid was launched in July 2023 and is currently located in a spot in space called Lagrange Point 2 – a gravitational balance point some 1.5 million kilometres beyond the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The Euclid Consortium comprises some 2600 members from more than 15 countries.

European Space Agency's Euclid mission spots spectacular Einstein ring

Euclid has a 1.2 m-diameter telescope, a camera and a spectrometer that it uses to plot a 3D map of the distribution of galaxies. The images it takes are about four times as sharp as current ground-based telescopes.

Euclid released its first images in November 2023 and began routine observations in February 2024, releasing a first data batch in May 2024.

The mission's first “cosmology data” will be released in October 2026.

The United Nations' Secretary-General condemned on Wednesday attacks on UN personnel and added in a statement from his spokesperson that all parties in Israel's incursion into Gaza knew where the UN's premises were based."The Secretary-General was deeply saddened and shocked to learn of the death of a United Nations Office for Project Services staff member, when two UN guesthouses in Deir al Balah were hit in strikes," a spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote.  "The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability," the statement continued."The Secretary-General sends his deepest condolences to the family of the staff member killed," he said, adding that at least 280 UN staff had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, 2023.

Jared Kushner, special envoy Steve Witkoff, conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump Jr. have been in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's political opposition, Politico reported on Wednesday.The high-ranking Trump allies have been speaking with Ukrainian opposition leader and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko as well as senior members of ex-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's party, Politico reported, citing three Ukrainian parliamentarians and a Republican foreign policy expert.The talks centered around potentially triggering a presidential election in Ukraine. The country has delayed elections in accordance with its constitution because Kyiv has instated martial law due to the ongoing conflict within its borders.   The Trump administration believes that Zelensky would lose in a potential election because of war fatigue in the country. The US president previously called the Ukrainian president a “dictator without elections” who “has done a terrible job," echoing Kremlin talking points. FOLLOWING THE exchange involving US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week in the Oval Office, European leaders came out of the woodwork to give words of encouragement to Ukraine even as they still fund Russia through energy purchases. (credit: BRIAN SNYDER/REUTERS)Trump calls Zelensky a dictatorWhile Zelensky's ratings have gone down over the course of his presidency, his recent spat with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance bolstered his approval ratings, the New York Times reported. British independent pollster Survation reported that nearly 44% of those polled intend to vote for Zelensky in the next election, which would put him comfortably above any other candidates. Zelensky dismissed the notion that he would step down unless it was in exchange for NATO membership in his country and reportedly intends to run in the next Ukranian election. “You would have to prevent me from participating in the elections,” he told reporters in London earlier in March, Politico reported. Both Tymoshenko and Poroshenko have publicly stated their opposition to holding elections during the hot conflict and haven't recently criticized Zelensky for his relations with the US.Poroshenko, Zelensky's immediate predecessor and noted critic, said that any criticism after the ill-fated Washington meeting was inappropriate. “Some people expected me to criticize Zelensky,” he said, as reported by the New York Times. "But no, there will be no criticism because that's not what the country needs right now.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

And people who would consent to many of the things that Zelenskyy is not agreeing to,” the expert said. Both politicians confirmed their conversations with Trump's allies but again confirmed that elections should not be held during the war.  Tymoshenko said her team was speaking with allies “who can help ensure a just peace as soon as possible.” Poroshenko critiqued Zelensky's "lack of communication with the Trump administration" but also stated his opposition to elections at this time.“We work publicly and transparently with American partners, aiming to preserve bipartisan support of Ukraine,” he said, as reported by Politico. "The essence of our conversations with representatives of the American side has always been down to two principles — security first and peace through strength. Namely weapons, intelligence, sanctions against Russia, financial support, democratic resilience (freedom and democracy), and transatlantic unity. Our team has always been and is adamant against elections during a war.”

Administration accused of deliberately flouting James Boasberg's ruling to halt deportation of 200 immigrants

Donald Trump has repeated his declaration that he would not defy a court ruling, even as controversy swirls about whether his administration has already ignored several of them following a spate of negative judgments that threaten to block his governing agenda.

Anger among the president's supporters has been simmering against a federal judge, James Boasberg, who ordered a halt to the deportation of more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants last weekend.

The deportation flights to El Salvador went ahead nevertheless, with administration officials claiming that the planes had already departed when the judge issued his order. That, in turn, triggered accusations that Trump had deliberately flouted the courts.

Asked by Laura Ingraham on Fox News if he would ever defy a court ruling, Trump said he would not but launched an attack on Boasberg, without naming him.

“I never did defy and I wouldn't in the future, no. You can't do that,” he said. “However, we have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think at a certain point you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge.

“The judge that we're talking about is you look at his other rulings … He's a lunatic.”

Trump renewed his assault in a later post on his Truth Social platform: “If a President doesn't have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our country because a radical left lunatic judge wants to assume the role of president, then our country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!”

The comments followed a rare rebuke from John Roberts, the conservative-leaning chief justice of the US supreme court, who criticised demands by Trump and his supporters, including his wealthiest backer, Elon Musk, that Boasberg be impeached.

Fears over the administration's readiness to defy the courts – widely seen as the only obstacle to Trump's rampant agenda in the absence of meaningful resistance from a Republican-ruled Congress – seemed likely to intensify after high-profile negative rulings on Tuesday.

In one, a US district court judge, Theodore Chuang, ruled that Musk and his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit had violated the constitution in “multiple ways” in attempting to dismantle USAid.

A separate ruling barred the Pentagon from enforcing Trump's order banning transgender people from serving in the military, saying it was “soaked in animus”.

Another order on Wednesday by Judge Jesse Furman rebuffed the administration's effort to dismiss an attempt by Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, to fight a deportation order and said the case must be heard in New Jersey, rather than Louisiana, where he is now detained.

In yet another case, the government has been forced to rehire more than 7,000 workers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who had not finished their probationary period after they were sent unsigned letters telling them they were being fired for poor work performances.

The letters were sent despite an IRS lawyer warning officials that they contained “false statements” that amounted to “fraud”, ProPublica reported.

Trump's insistence that he would obey the courts is at odds with previous statements from the vice-president, JD Vance, who has suggested he should defy them.

In a 2021 interview with Politico, Vance said Trump – if he were re-elected – should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, [and] every civil servant in the administrative state … and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.'”

The statement attributed to Jackson, president from 1829 to 1837, is widely believed to be apocryphal.

Vance reiterated the sentiment in a social media post in February of this year following an earlier injunction against Doge.

“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal,” he wrote. “If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.”

Legal commentators have warned that a president openly ignoring court orders could portend a slide into dictatorship.

Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, told NBC that Trump had already “declared war on the rule of law”.

“In the past few weeks, the president himself has led a full frontal assault on the constitutional rule of law, the federal judiciary, the American justice system and the nation's legal profession,” Luttig said. “America is in a constitutional crisis.”

US President Donald Trump has pledged to help Ukraine get more air defence equipment from Europe as Kyiv's forces battle Russia, the White House said Wednesday.

In a phone conversation Tuesday, Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky also agreed that their defence staffs will "share information closely" as the battlefield situation evolves, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.

Moves to roll back 31 pollution regulations risk public health and big annual healthcare savings, Guardian analysis shows

A push by Donald Trump's administration to repeal a barrage of clean air and water regulations may deal a severe blow to US public health, with a Guardian analysis finding that the targeted rules were set to save the lives of nearly 200,000 people in the years ahead.

Last week, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provoked uproar by unveiling a list of 31 regulations it will scale back or eliminate, including rules limiting harmful air pollution from cars and power plants; restrictions on the emission of mercury, a neurotoxin; and clean water protections for rivers and streams.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA's administrator, called the extraordinary series of rollbacks the “greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” and declared it a “dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion”. One of the most consequential actions will see the EPA reconsider a landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health, which has been used to underpin laws aimed at addressing the climate crisis.

But the rules targeted by Zeldin have immediate, measurable benefits to Americans' health even without considering the longer-term impacts of the climate crisis. In total, the regulations on the hit list will prevent nearly 200,000 deaths over the next 25 years, by helping avoid an array of heart, respiratory and other health problems worsened by air and water pollution, according to assessments conducted by the EPA itself.

Trump's EPA has said its immolation of environmental protections will “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes' on US families”. However, the agency's own analyses shows that the regulations save the US economy far more money than it costs businesses to implement new pollution controls, by a factor of around six to one.

The regulations slated for repeal, affecting coal plants, cars, trucks and other sources of pollution, had been set to deliver at least $254bn in economic benefits annually via lowered healthcare costs and fewer sick days, among other improvements. By contrast, the cost of complying with the regulations is around $40bn a year.

“The costs of these regulations are a fraction of their benefits,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA staffer, now senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network (EPN), a group made up of former EPA employees.

“For every million dollars of favors that Trump's EPA is handing out to corporate polluters, the public suffers $6m in public health costs through asthma attacks, cancers and heart and lung disease. That's a great deal for the wealthy corporate polluters who backed Trump but it's a bad deal for anyone else who breathes.”

The Guardian's analysis is drawn from the findings of an EPN report published last year that broke down the costs and benefits of EPA rules. The study looked at evidence gathered by the EPA when formulating each new rule, factored in inflation and verified with the agency a uniform extrapolation of these figures to 2050.

Of the 31 rollbacks announced by Zeldin, 11 can be analyzed in this way as they include assessments of health and economic impacts. The estimates used by the EPA are almost certainly undercounts as they often do not factor some health conditions, such as cancer, nor do they account for damages from wildfires, floods, storms and other disasters that are being worsened by a climate crisis that is being driven by fossil fuel pollution.

As well as scores of deaths, a wave of other harms would likely be unleashed if the targeted regulations were removed. More than 20,000 emergency room visits for cardiovascular problems would occur by 2050 if not for the rules, the analysis finds, while children would have to restrict their activities for a collective 89m days due to excess pollution.

About one in 12 Americans, meanwhile, have asthma and are particularly vulnerable to air pollution. The current limits upon emissions from coal-fired power plants, cars, trucks and other sources are on track to avoid 100m symptomatic asthma incidents across the US by 2050. “If you carry around an inhaler, these rollbacks are a nightmare,” said Symons.

“The rollback of these critical public health interventions will increase heart attacks, hospitalizations, cognitive impairment, respiratory disease, and healthcare costs,” said Gaurab Basu, an assistant professor of medicine climate expert at Harvard University. “It will leave our children facing an increasingly unstable planet Earth.”

The Trump administration is attempting to severely shrink the EPA, firing hundreds of employees and drawing up plans to remove as many as 1,155 scientists while dissolving the agency's office of research and development. But it cannot simply sweep aside EPA regulations, which require several years of grueling agency work and public comment to replace.

John Walke, a director at the green non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, said it will be difficult for officials to justify the changes. One now-slashed Biden-era rule limiting power plants' emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants, for instance, simply saw regulators codify pollution standards that most power providers had been meeting for years.

“If this administration tries to go in to change that, they're going to have to show that somehow is impossible for those facilities to meet standards they were already meeting,” he said. “They're just not going to be able to make that showing.”

Environmental groups have vowed lawsuits to fight the rollbacks, meaning that a diminished EPA is faced with a mountain of legal and administrative paperwork just as Zeldin has promised to cut the agency's spending by 65% this year.

“A rule is based on science and study, you have to come up with alternative science that makes sense,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was the EPA administrator under George W Bush. But Whitman said that recent mass firings of EPA staff and a drop-off in enforcement activity will in practice make it difficult to uphold existing anti-pollution laws.

“The message to businesses is ‘we won't enforce what we are already doing,'” she said. “Real people will be hurt, especially children. We need to all be concerned about this. What this administration is doing is endangering our lives – ours, our children's, our grandchildren's.”

A deeper fear expressed by former EPA administrators last week, from prior Democratic and Republican presidencies, is that the agency won't bother to even craft weaker regulations to replace the existing rules. The goal may be “not to reconsider the rules but to bury them”, said Gina McCarthy, the EPA chief under Barack Obama. “If that's the case that's now being thrust upon us then shame on the EPA's leadership.”

McCarthy said the announcement of the mass rollbacks was the “most disastrous day in EPA history” and signaled a stark break from its historic mission. The agency was founded in 1970 under Republican president Richard Nixon with a task of protecting the environment and public health. Under Trump, however, the EPA has installed industry lobbyists in key positions and its stated priorities now include boosting the US car industry and aiding the advance of artificial intelligence.

“Alongside President Trump, we are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry,” Zeldin said last week.

William Reilly, who was EPA administrator under George HW Bush, said that such a vision is a “catastrophe” and threatens to plunge the US back into a pre-1970s era when cities were routinely shrouded by dangerous smog and rivers were so polluted by chemicals and waste that in some cases they caught fire.

“We are almost going to an honors system where we are going to trust corporations behave as if there are laws, when there are no laws,” Reilly said. “I honestly wonder if the malefactors are going to give us more burning rivers.”

An EPA spokesperson said: “No longer will the EPA view the goals of protecting our environment and growing our economy as binary choices. We will and we must choose both.

“Under President Trump, EPA is fully committed to fulfilling all of our statutory obligations under the many bipartisan landmark laws that help ensure clean air, land, and water.”

At least 147 patients were evacuated after a Russian attack struck a medical facility in Sumy, Ukraine, causing damage to both the building and a nearby children's hospital.

Russia struck a medical facility in the Ukrainian city of Sumy late Tuesday, damaging the building and a nearby children's hospital. 

At least 147 patients, including those with restricted mobility, were evacuated, with no injuries reported. 

The attack came as Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Following a call between US President Donald Trump and Putin, air raid sirens and explosions were reported in Kyiv, urging residents to seek shelter.

Sunita Williams Return: Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returned to Earth after spending over nine months at the International Space Station (ISS) due to unexpected delays. Their spacecraft, SpaceX's Dragon Freedom capsule, successfully splashed down off the Florida coast near Tallahassee, at 5.57 pm ET on Tuesday (3:27 am IST, Wednesday)....Read More

‘Butch and Suni' were accompanied by astronauts Nick Hague and Aleksandr Grebyonkin who reached the ISS in December as part of a rescue mission planned by NASA and SpaceX. “On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” radioed SpaceX Mission Control in California. An hour after their 17-hour-long journey, the astronauts were out of their scorched capsule, waving and smiling at the cameras while being hustled away in reclining stretchers for routine medical checks. Political undertones of the successful rescue were hard to miss as The White House claimed that the rescue mission was due to President Trump's efforts. “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.

Sunita Williams live updates: Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore spent 286 days on the International Space Station, where they conducted over 4500 orbits and travelled more than 121 million statute miles, NASA said in its commentary.

Sunita Williams live updates: NASA's 45-day post-mission rehabilitation program is designed to help astronauts recover from the physical effects of spaceflight, particularly those experienced after long-duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS) or other space environments.

While the program lasts 45 days, full recovery may take longer, especially after extended space missions. Some astronauts report lingering effects even months or years later, particularly in bone density and cardiovascular health.

Sunita Williams live updates: Another physical challenge faced by astronauts during their space stays is "fluid shift"—the redistribution of bodily fluids toward the head in microgravity. This can increase calcium levels in urine, raising the risk of kidney stones.

Fluid shifts might also contribute to increased intracranial pressure, altering the shape of the eyeball and causing spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), causing mild-to-moderate vision impairment. Another theory suggests raised carbon dioxide levels are the cause. (AFP)

All submissions have been received for an international essay contest on global economic development which is being held as part of the upcoming Open Dialogue ‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth'. The forum aims to envision how major global shifts will shape the way people live for decades to come.

The event, scheduled for April 28-30 at the National Centre RUSSIA in Moscow, will bring together experts, leading economists, and representatives from various sectors worldwide to discuss current economic challenges and shape strategies for future growth.

The contest has generated “tremendous interest,” and the geographical diversity of participants is “impressive,” center director Natalia Virtuozova said in a statement on Monday.

A total of 695 papers were received from 101 countries. According to Virtuozova, participants from Russia, Mexico, India, China, Oman, and Italy were among the most active. Submissions also came from Egypt, Vietnam, Türkiye, Colombia, Canada, France, and Transnistria.

The ideas were delivered in the form of a five-page essay or a 10-minute presentation in the authors' native tongues. The number of applications and the interest in the event prompted an extension of the submission deadline from March 9 to March 15.

The essays focus on four key topics: ‘Investments in Human Capital', ‘Investments in Technology', ‘Investments in the Environment', and ‘Investments in Communication'.

The ‘Human Capital' section covers issues such as the effective pursuit of demographic policy amid aging populations; migration and economic development; the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the labor market; strategies to reduce youth unemployment; the use of new technologies in learning and education; strategies for enhancing the well-being of the population; and the prospects and effects of promoting a healthy lifestyle.

The ‘Technology' section focuses on technologies being used in order to ensure food security; breakthrough technologies in industry; AI as a key end-to-end technology; the optimization of healthcare using advanced technology; the prevention and minimization of the consequences of natural disasters; water resource management in the context of climate change; technology for providing accessible and sustainable energy and the development of smart cities.

The ‘Environment' section includes green infrastructure or creating sustainable and environmentally friendly urban spaces; transport accessibility for everyone; creating a comfortable environment subject to climate change; corporate social responsibility; managing natural hazards; barrier-free and inclusive environments; conscious consumption as the basis for conscious supply; and sustainable tourism as a way to enhance the quality of the urban environment.

The ‘Communication' section covers issues such as the future of trade; new logistics routes in the Global South and East; worldwide challenges and the responses of the insurance industry; improving financial flows; digital currencies as a tool for improving the international financial network; data mobility as part of global communication; and E-commerce and logistics platforms.

“Most of the essays focus on investment in people. The authors are concerned about access to education and the preservation of national identity. Regarding investment in technology, the central topic, of course, is artificial intelligence. For investment in communication, authors mainly discuss participation in international trade, while those from smaller countries emphasize access to reliable information. As for investment in the environment, the authors are primarily concerned about the future of cities—what future cities will look like and, most importantly, how people will live, work, and feel in them,” Natalia Virtuozova has said.

Now with all submissions received, the organizers have started preparing a schedule for discussions based on the topics covered in the papers.

The selection process has also begun.

Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defense is the flavor of the season in India. The country's defense manufacturing sector is rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of New Delhi's strategic and economic ambitions, and government policies are focusing on making sure that modern weaponry is both designed and manufactured in India, or, at the very least, is “Made-in-India.”

The Indian military has identified over 5,000 items that must be manufactured in the country rather than imported. Called the positive indigenization list (PIL), the initiative began in 2020 and aims to offer defense items to be indigenized by Indian manufacturers, including small and medium enterprises and startups. It has already yielded results, according to the Defense Ministry.

Defense production and exports are being monitored at the highest levels of the executive. Ambitious targets are being set: 75% of the defense capital budget has to be spent procuring India-made products. The private sector is being encouraged to enter defense production, which was hitherto public-dominated. Some big industrial groups have entered defense, but there are also large numbers of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups that are producing international quality components and subsystems to global manufacturers. 

It was different for the newly independent India. In the early 1950s, the country's economy was greatly influenced by the Soviet “socialist” approach, and evolved its five-year plans. Perhaps that was the best for those times.

Throughout the 1950s, there was Soviet assistance and technology transfer in multiple industrial sectors such as steel, defense, railways, construction equipment, metal, mining, petrochemicals, and much more to India. A very important part was the building of military aircraft, aero-engines and avionics factories. At one point the Indian armed forces had nearly 85% of military equipment of Soviet or Russian origin. 

Back then, India's private sector was relatively small and primarily focused on meeting the daily needs of the masses. The government utilized public funding to establish essential infrastructure, nationalizing key industries such as banking, car manufacturing, and aircraft production. This approach may have been suitable for that time.

Over the long term, both public and private sectors exhibited distinct strengths and weaknesses. The public sector benefits from government funding but operates under the bureaucratic control of government departments. Decision-making can be complex, and progress monitoring is similarly cumbersome. With taxpayers' money at stake, accountability tends to be lower. Salaries are fixed according to government scales, and once hired, employees find it difficult to be dismissed for poor performance, resulting in generally lower productivity compared to the private sector.

After the collapse of Soviet Union, Russia realized the need to compete with the rest of the world through market forces. India too realized that it had to diversify its defense sourcing. 

After the economic reforms of 1991 that deregulated markets, reduced import tariffs, and lowered taxes, India's economy began to grow. This growth enabled significant investment in the defense sector and marked the emergence of a robust private sector. Manufacturing capabilities expanded, resulting in the mass production of cars and motorcycles. Additionally, the previously protected defense sector began to open up to private players. 

The private sector attracts top talent with competitive salaries and can quickly dismiss non-performers. Its efficiency allows tasks to be completed with fewer workers, and it can easily raise funds from banks and international institutions. Unlike the public sector, which faces complex governmental approvals for joint ventures and foreign collaborations, the private sector can pursue these opportunities swiftly. Foreign corporations prefer working directly with Indian companies to avoid bureaucratic hurdles. Additionally, the private sector can acquire essential technologies and raw materials based on commercial needs, improving operational agility.

Interestingly, 41 of the top global defense companies are from the US. All are private. These companies had $317 billion in arms revenues, which was half of the total revenue of the top 100 companies. The top five arms companies were all US-based. Nine Chinese, three Indian, and two Russian companies are in the top 100. All these were public sector companies. 

New Delhi has launched a host of programs and policies in the past few years to attract private companies to participate in defense manufacturing. 

This includes Innovation for Defense Excellence (iDEX), which aims to spark innovation in defense and aerospace by creating prototypes that enhance national security; and the Defense India Startup Challenge, which supports startups and small and medium companies in building prototypes and commercializing solutions for national defense. Additionally, the 2020 Defense Acquisition Procedure reserves certain orders (worth of up to 1 billion rupees or $11.5 million) for small and medium sector companies.

The Defense Ministry has also encouraged industry bodies to create dedicated defense chapters and help connect the industry with the government and address concerns. Lastly, the government is pushing public sector banks to develop loan schemes tailored for the defense industry, with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) already offering specific options.

The government has also insisted that state-run companies and agencies in defense, including the largest one, the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), which was created in the late 1950s to support defense equipment research, should offer support to the private sector by providing their facilities. 

Setting up an independent nodal umbrella body for testing, trial, and certification requirements of defense systems should improve access to existing facilities while reducing the need for investments to recreate the capital-intensive infrastructure.

Currently, India has 16 Defense Public Sector Units (DPSUs), over 430 licensed companies, and approximately 16,000 MSMEs. Notably, 21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward defense self-reliance.

There has long been a feeling that state-owned defense companies are keeping their technology R&D cards very close to their chest and are reluctant to share with private sector. They also continue to treat them as competitors rather than partners. Meanwhile, the government has offered increased governance and control rights to foreign companies.

While major foreign defense manufacturers have chosen to partner with major Indian conglomerates like Tata, Reliance, Adani, L&T, and others to invest in defense in India, similar projects with the public sector have been few. 

The Indian government's defense procurement policies have lured several global players, such as Airbus, BAE, Boeing, Collins Aerospace, Dassault Aviation, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Pilatus, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Rafael, Safran, and Thales, to set up operations and form joint ventures in India.

For instance, Lockheed Martin and Boeing joined with Tata group manufacturing aero-structures and sub-systems for global supplies, while Adani group is making UAVs and drones with Israeli's Elbit group. 

The Airbus C295 is built by Tata group in India. This first-of-its-kind ‘Make in India' aerospace program in the private sector is expected to involve more than two dozen small and medium-sized suppliers, producing over 60% of the 30,000 detail parts, sub-assemblies, and component assemblies locally. 

The Defense Ministry issued an expression of interest (EoI) to the private sector to participate in the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program through a special-purpose vehicle. The project will include ADA, HAL and a selected private company under the PPP model. The name is expected to be announced by mid-2025. 

There are many private companies making defense electronics, large aero-structures components, advanced technology components, and sub-systems. Dynamatic Technologies makes assemblies of vertical fins for Sukhoi 30 MKI fighters. They are also supplying aero-structures to Airbus for its A320 family of aircraft and the wide-body 330 aircraft. Hyderabad's VEM Technologies manufactures centet fuselage for LCA Tejas.

The BrahMos is JV is a joint venture between the DRDO and Russian NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which together have formed BrahMos Aerospace and have had significant success in missile production and exports. The AK-203 assault rifle is being produced in India through a joint venture between Russia and India. Russia has recently offered to make the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 in India through a JV with Indian partners. Interestingly, the Russian Army wears boots crafted in India's Hajipur district in Bihar.

Overall, India's aerospace and defense sector has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, with the private sector contributing a staggering 20% to its turnover. Developing a strong research base in India and a robust supply chain for components and sub-systems, most currently sourced from abroad, will help create the market for civilian and defense systems in the aerospace sector.

Domestic defense production in India has already reached $14.5 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. The target to procure 75% of all defense capital acquisitions domestically will give a huge boost to the “Make-in-India” initiative. The target is $19 billion in the current fiscal year with aspirations to achieve $34 billion in defense production by 2029. 

Meanwhile, India's defense exports reached $2.4 billion last year, and the government set a defense export target of $5.7 billion by 2028-29. Currently, India exports to over 100 nations, with the top three destinations for defense exports in 2023-24 being the USA, France, and Armenia.  

To move beyond traditional defense manufacturing, India needs to boost public funding for investments in key future technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, autonomous vehicles, hypersonic technology, directed energy weapons, augmented and virtual reality, and blockchain. These investments will lay the groundwork for future innovations in both commercial and military applications. Developing intellectual property is vital for India to secure a prominent place in global defense manufacturing.

            Turkish authorities detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu – a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – on Wednesday as part of corruption and terrorism investigations.
    


            Detention orders were also issued for around 100 others connected to the mayor, including his press adviser Murat Ongun, according to state-run news agency Anadolu Agency. Among those detained are elected Istanbul district mayors Resul Emrah Sahan and Murat Calik.
    


            The move came just days before the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was scheduled to hold a primary election where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen as its presidential candidate.
    


            CHP leader Ozgur Ozel called the detention “a coup attempt against our next president.”
    


            Video from CNN Turk showed police wearing riot gear and dozens of security vehicles outside Imamoglu's home.
    


            “I am saddened to say, a handful of people who are trying to steal the will of the people, have sent the dear police, the security forces implicating them in this wrongful doing,” Imamoglu said in a video posted to X on Wednesday as he got dressed in what appeared to be a closet.
    


            “Hundreds of police officers have been sent to the door my house — the house of the 16 million people of Istanbul.”
    


            Critics denounced the detentions as politically motivated and part of an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition following Erdogan's major defeat in local and mayoral elections last year.
    


            “Making decisions on behalf of the people, using force to replace the will of the people or to obstruct it is a coup. There is currently a force in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,” Ozel said in a post on X.
    


            Following Imamoglu's detention, Istanbul's governorship suspended the right to demonstrate in the city until March 23 “to maintain public order.” It also announced the closure of some metro stops and roads in downtown Istanbul.
    


            According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, access to X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok has been restricted in the country.
    


            Meanwhile, the mayor's detention sent shockwaves through Turkey's financial markets, deepening investor fears and triggering sharp losses in the currency and stock market.
    


            The Turkish lira plunged more than 10%, trading above 40 against the dollar – its weakest level on record – as Imamoglu's detention spooked investors.
    


            Stock trading in Turkey got off to a rough start, as a sharp drop in the main BIST 100 index triggered a temporary trading halt. By 6:30 a.m. ET, the index had fallen 6.7% for the day.
    


            Imamoglu and around 100 others linked to him are accused of being members of a criminal organization, extortion, bribery and aggravated fraud, according to a statement from the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, Andadolu reported.
    


            Imamoglu is also under investigation for allegedly aiding the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), which Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations, Anadolu said, citing the prosecutor's office.
    


            Dilek Imamoglu, wife of the detained mayor, said of the accusations against her husband: “One can only laugh at such a thing.”

            “Such a thing is of course impossible,” she said, according to Reuters. “It is completely a huge slander. Everything will come out in the open anyway.”
    


            The move to detain the mayor of Turkey's largest and most populous city, a key political battleground, comes after Istanbul University said on Tuesday it had annulled Imamoglu's degree over irregularities, dealing a blow to the opposition and dashing the mayor's presidential ambitions.
    


            Without a university degree, Imamoglu would be disqualified from running for president.
    


            Imamoglu said the university's decision was illegal and outside its jurisdiction, and that he would launch a legal challenge. “The decision of the Istanbul University Board of Directors is UNLAWFUL” he said. “The days when those who made this decision will be held accountable before history and justice are near.”
    


            Imamoglu was elected mayor in 2019 and again in 2024. The next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but some analysts say Erdogan could call for early elections which would allow him to bypass term limits.
    


            “We are up against a huge bullying. But I will not back down,” the mayor said in his video message.

Every year, thousands of travellers flock to India to join the Holi festivities filled with vibrant colours and centuries-old traditions. While it can be an enriching experience for most, the Holi celebration in India could be an uncomfortable experience particularly for women.

For Danielle, a foreign solo traveller, Holi 2025 in India was marred by an unsettling reality faced by many women during the festivities -harassment and groping.

In a post shared on Instagram, Danielle, who makes videos about budget trips to various countries across the world, began to express how much she loved her time in India, emphasizing the incredible warmth and hospitality of the people.

However, she couldn't stop herself from sharing her Holi experience, one that was far from the joyous occasion many would expect.

"For me (and a lot of other women it seems) Holi was ruined by the fact that SOME men clearly see it as a prime opportunity to harass women and grope them WHICH IS NOT ON," Danielle wrote in the caption alongside a video of her Holi celebration.

A post shared by danielle // solo budget traveller (@daniellestravel.s)

She further explained that some men used the celebration as an opportunity to grope women turning a fun event into an uncomfortable and distressing one for many.

"It's a massive shame that such a beautiful festival leads to a negative experience for a lot of women," she further wrote underscoring the unfortunate reality some women face during Holi.

However, her message was not one of complete bitterness or anger.

An apparently optimistic Danielle made it a point that she wouldn't let that experience define her time in India.

"HOWEVER, I am not letting the actions of a few ruin the amazing memories i've already made here and the ones that are gonna come in the next few weeks too," she wrote.

Her message also included a call to avoid generalizing an entire country based on the actions of a few. "I've met so many lovely people in India, and I beg people not to generalize the whole country,” she emphasized. Holi was celebrated across the country on March 14.

A new report from the World Meteorological Organization delivers a stark warning: climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The State of the Global Climate report confirms global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.

The report, compiled with data from 101 countries and various scientific organizations, provides a comprehensive look at the state of the planet. Here are five key takeaways from the WMO's findings.

2024 set a new global temperature record, averaging over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. For years, climate scientists have warned that exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming would lead to increasingly disastrous impacts around the globe, and it is a key goal of the Paris Climate Agreement to try to keep warming below that threshold.

"While a single year above 1.5 °C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies and to the planet," said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.

Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.

According to John Kennedy, scientific coordinator and lead author of the report, the primary driver of this heat was the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions, with El Niño playing a smaller role in the spike. "Maybe a tenth of a degree or two-tenths of a degree from El Niño and other factors," Kennedy said.

Greenhouse gas emissions continued their upward trend, the report says.

Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide all reached record levels in 2023 — the latest year global data was available — surpassing pre-industrial concentrations by significant margins. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, fueling global warming and its cascading effects.

Over 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean, and in 2024, ocean heat content reached a new high in 65 years of observational records. The report notes that 2024 was the eighth consecutive year of record-breaking ocean warming.

This warming is contributing to widespread coral bleaching, disrupting marine ecosystems and accelerating sea level rise.

The WMO report states, "The ocean will continue to warm for the foreseeable future — a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales."

The long-term rate of increase has more than doubled — from 2.1 mm per year between 1993 and 2002 to 4.7 mm per year between 2015 and 2024. For coastal communities, even minor increases can lead to more frequent and severe flooding.

Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking at alarming rates. Between 2021 and 2024, glaciers experienced the most severe three-year mass loss on record, the report says.

Arctic sea ice reached a minimum daily extent of 4.28 million square kilometers on Sept. 11, 2024, marking the seventh-lowest in the 46-year satellite record. That was 1.17 million km² below the 1991-2020 average — meaning an area of ice nearly equivalent to the size of South Africa had been lost.

Antarctic sea ice has remained at historically low levels, with its extent falling below 2 million km² for the third consecutive year. These losses contribute to rising sea levels, disrupt water supplies for millions of people, and threaten ecosystems that depend on stable ice conditions.

From deadly hurricanes and historic floods to devastating wildfires and droughts, 2024 was marked by extreme weather events. In the U.S., hurricanes Helene and Milton caused more than 250 deaths and tens of billions of dollars in damage.

Extreme weather events linked to climate change are also displacing millions of people worldwide. In 2024, climate-driven disasters triggered the highest number of new displacements in 16 years, exacerbating food shortages and economic instability worldwide.

In Brazil, devastating floods overwhelmed parts of Porto Alegre, displacing approximately 420,000 people and causing extensive economic losses. In West and Central Africa, widespread flooding affected multiple countries, with Chad and Nigeria among the hardest hit. More than 1 million people were displaced, and over 639,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

"We are working together with all the scientists around the world and the countries to ease the problem of people around the world, in developing countries, in small island developing states, so we hope that this will continue, despite the differences in politics and internal changes," said Dr Omar Baddour, chief of climate monitoring at WMO.

He suggested the report should prompt greater action to help protect our planet.

"The report highlights that, despite the rapid pace of change, there are still viable pathways of mitigation and adaptation. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains essential, with rapid expansion of renewable energy playing a crucial role."

Power, Politics, and the Olympic Prize: IOC Race Heats up on Greece's Sunlit Shores

By Ossian Shine

PYLOS, Greece - The slow-burn race for the most powerful job in world sport roared into life on Wednesday, set against the dazzling backdrop of the Ionian Sea, where the seven contenders for the International Olympic Committee presidency made their final moves ahead of a vote that will shape the sporting landscape for the next decade.

Behind the gilded facades and five-star hospitality of the Costa Navarino resort in Greece's southwestern Peloponnese, whispers of alliances and voting tactics swirled as IOC members met for the 144th Session – the last with Thomas Bach at the wheel.

The winner of the presidential election will lead the world's wealthiest multi-sports organisation with revenues of about $7 billion per four-year cycle.

With the Mediterranean breeze carrying hints of salt and ambition, the seven seeking to replace Bach had to navigate a gauntlet of flashing cameras and microphones as they were ushered to lunch on a terrace overlooking the sea.

"I'm still here," quipped Britain's Sebastian Coe, considered one of the frontrunners, as he walked briskly past the bank of reporters, flashing a smile but making no further comment.

Kirsty Coventry, considered another frontrunner and believed to be Bach's preferred candidate, was similarly circumspect, stopping only to make one brief comment to German media before the Zimbabwean headed to the terrace.

MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF VOTING

MORE:  

Last to leave the Session Hall was Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, son of the IOC's seventh president who led the body from 1980 to 2001.

"It's very easy in this (Olympic) world, so close, to confuse a smile for a vote, a friendship for a vote, a nice word for a vote," smiled the Spaniard when asked how he felt the race was going. "We all have to be very careful in making that translation.

"It's a very good system. All the IOC members have one thing which is extraordinarily precious, which is a vote and its confidentiality.

"That gives each one of us the full independence to decide whatever we think is better. And that we will only know, it's only possible to know when the real votes are cast. So we will see."

Samaranch Jr rounds out the trio widely thought to be the favourites, but is taking nothing for granted. "I don't know if we will win or lose votes (in the remaining hours before the vote), but I can promise you that I will be working until the very last second, until 3:59:59 tomorrow afternoon."

French candidate David Lappartient, head of the world cycling federation, insisted the race was wide open, and that he expects multiple rounds of voting before a decisive winner emerges.

"GLOBAL COMMUNITY"

With just over 100 ballots set to be cast at the Greek seaside resort the winner will need an outright majority. If nobody secures a majority, the lowest scorer is axed, triggering another round of voting until one candidate emerges victorious.

"In the race, still in the race," Lappartient smiled, before leaning on a cycling analogy. "I think that it's riding fast, but I'm still in the first part of the bunch. I've not been dropped from the bunch, so I still believe it's possible.

"I respect my fellow colleagues, also candidates, but I think I'm one of the potential options to be the winner tomorrow."

Other candidates Johan Eliasch and Morinari Watanabe would not speculate. Japanese Watanabe, head of the world gymnastics federation, smiled and simply said: "I am waiting," while president of the world ski and snowboard federation Eliasch said: "We shall see tomorrow."

"Tomorrow is the big day," Swedish-born Eliasch added. "I am sure the outcome will be a good one – we have seven good candidates."

The final candidate, Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan, said: "I have spoken to more members in the last 3-4 months than in the last 4 years, and that for me has been the great takeaway of this – engagement.

"This is a global community and we should use that for our advantage."

Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey spoke to BBC Radio Newcastle about the prospect of Dan Burn making England's 2026 World Cup squad: 

"He's got every chance. If he gets his opportunity and does well, and I'm sure he will, how many times do we see players get picked when their club form hasn't been the best? 

I'm not saying that it hasn't been good [for Newcastle], but managers tend to pick players who do well for England.

"If he can be consistent for England, which he certainly has been for Newcastle, then  why not? Yes he's going to be 34, but why not?"

The US says "peace has never been closer" after a Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelenskyy phone call. Zelenskyy called the conversation "frank" and "positive" as he asked for air defence help. There was also an update on intelligence sharing. Listen to The World as you scroll.

Live reporting by Ollie Cooper

Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke returns tomorrow for his weekly Q&A on the Ukraine war - covering anything from the battlefield to the negotiating table.

He'll tackle as many of your questions as he can at 1pm - submit yours in the box above.

In these talks for a ceasefire, the Russians first want all of their issues addressed, our military analyst Michael Clarke said today.

That's a stark contrast to the Ukrainians, who haven't set conditions for a pause - and this puts strain on the Americans, who want a "quick-ish" deal.

Clarke added: "The question is how much patience have the Americans got to play this game?

"The Russians are very good at this, and I keep saying Putin is an old KGB man, he's been doing this his whole career, he knows how to do all this.

"I'm not so sure the Americans with their business background are really so accomplished at this sort of thing.

"The business community want to move in, make a quick-ish deal and move on, but in political terms, these things can go on for a very long time."

Will Trump turn on Putin?

Trump is capable of "turning on a dime" against Putin, Clarke added, but so far there is nothing to indicate that's likely to happen.

"Putin's calculating how long he can needle Trump into more concessions - what will he get? Or will Trump turn on him and say 'enough'," Clarke said.

"The longer this goes on, the bigger the turnaround would be."

The relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been complex over the years.

Relations between the two presidents extend as far back as 2019, the year the Ukrainian leader took office.

It has since weathered the start of the war in Ukraine, Trump's re-election and last month's heated exchange in the Oval Office, in which Zelenskyy was accused of being "disrespectful" to his country's most powerful ally.

Here, news reporter Lauren Russell looks back at the key moments that have helped shape the pair's relationship and how it has changed over the years.

In this post, we'll examine the differences and similarities we've noticed in the readouts and information surrounding Donald Trump's calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy respectively. 

Length

Trump said his call with Zelenskyy lasted around an hour, while his chat with Putin went on for around an hour and a half. 

That could be because they had more to discuss - or because the US leader's call with his Russian counterpart may have required translation at both ends - whereas Zelenskyy speaks strong English. 

Tone

Our correspondent David Blevins noted that Trump's message after the chat with Zelenskyy was markedly calm in tone - without the capitals letters usually sprayed across his social media posts. 

It's similar to his post yesterday on his call with Putin, where there was only one word in capital letters - the word 'end', as in to end the conflict.

The readouts

The readout of the Putin call was 226 words and released by the White House, whereas the Zelenskyy one was issued by Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz on behalf of the president and was a whopping 480 words. 

Read into all of that what you will...

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that Russian drone strikes on Ukraine last night targeted energy facilities, despite Vladimir Putin agreeing with Donald Trump on Tuesday to stop attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure. 

Sky News has pinpointed the locations of several Russian strikes which happened overnight in the Donetsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Sumy oblasts. Downed Russian drones were also found on the outskirts of Kyiv. 

The map below shows where strikes verified by Sky News occurred, and where major energy facilities are in those areas. The blue pins show Russian strikes from last night, and the yellow pins show major Ukrainian energy facilities. 

In a post on X last night, Zelenskyy said attack drones had been spotted over the Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.  

Energy ceasefire 'shaky from beginning'

As negotiations continue, Ukraine's energy infrastructure could still be a target, despite the Trump-Putin call this week - according to security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke.  

"There are so many different infrastructure targets in a big country like Ukraine that it will always be a point of contention as to which of them might be classed as clearly, and only, 'energy infrastructure' targets. 

"So, the very limited ceasefire agreed by phone between presidents Trump and Putin is looking shaky from the beginning."

What does Ukraine say Russia targeted after Putin-Trump call?

Speaking in Helsinki with the Finnish president this morning, Zelenskyy said 150 drones struck energy infrastructure and transport in Ukraine overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday.  

Zelenskyy added Ukraine was willing to provide a list of its energy infrastructure facilities to implement a halt on strikes.  

Ukrzaliznytsia, the state administration of railway transport in Ukraine, said in a post on X that Russian strikes had hit their energy facilities in the Dnipro region overnight.  

Large energy facilities have been targeted in Ukraine before, but smaller-scale infrastructure is also a target.  

The Donetsk prosecutor's office reported shelling in Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region. Local reporting said that part of the city is now without electricity. 

Civilian infrastructure was also hit overnight. 

In Sumy oblast, two hospitals were hit by Russian strikes, Sumy Regional Hospital and Krasnopil Hospital. 

The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in statements made on Telegram that all patients from both hospitals had been successfully evacuated. 

By David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington DC

The readout of the call from President Zelenskyy was conciliatory, repeatedly thanking Donald Trump for military support and for his peace efforts.

In agreeing to a partial ceasefire, he held out the prospect of US investment in Ukrainian power - perhaps deeming that more of a security guarantee than the minerals deal (see previous post for more on Trump's team apparently moving on from this).

"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure."

Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz readout of Trump-Zelenskyy call

Trump agreed to continue sharing intelligence but when Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence, he said he'd see what was available in Europe.

That's a vague response from the US president as he seeks to keep both Ukraine and Putin on board.

Those ambiguous words and the change in tone are both indicative of the sensitive point they've reached days before fresh negotiations in Saudi Arabia.

The US has moved "beyond" a previously agreed minerals deal with Ukraine, Karoline Leavitt said during her news conference a short time ago. 

"Now, we have moved beyond the economic minerals deal, we are at a place of peace, we're at a partial ceasefire," she said.

She offered no further details. 

The deal was put on hold following the disastrous Volodymyr Zelenskyy visit to the White House last month, but it was understood it would be picked up again once relations recovered. 

This statement comes to us from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and Mike Waltz, Donald Trump's national security adviser after the president's call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

"Today, President Donald J. Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a fantastic phone conversation. President Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for a productive start for the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah on 11th March. The meeting of the senior officials from both nations significantly helped in moving towards ending the war.

"President Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for the support of the United States, especially the Javelin missiles that President Trump was first to provide, and his efforts towards peace. The leaders agreed Ukraine and America will continue working together to bring about a real end to the war, and that lasting peace under President Trump's leadership can be achieved.

"President Trump fully briefed President Zelenskyy on his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the key issues discussed. They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defence staffs as the battlefield situation evolved. 

"President Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.

"The two leaders also agreed on a partial ceasefire against energy. Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the ceasefire to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. They agreed this could be the first step towards the full end of the war and ensuring security. 

"President Zelenskyy was grateful for the President's leadership in this effort and reiterated his willingness to adopt a full ceasefire.

"President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

"President Zelenskyy also thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian concerns, including the exchange of POWs. He noted they had just had a successful exchange and thanked the President for his leadership. 

"President Trump also asked President Zelenskyy about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted. President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.

"They agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The presidents noted the positive work of their advisers and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Adviser Waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg, and others. 

"The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire. The presidents instructed their advisers and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible. 

"The presidents emphasised that in further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing towards lasting peace and security."

Following on from our last post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also confirmed that US intelligence sharing with Ukraine would continue. 

Vladimir Putin said yesterday he wanted all intelligence sharing and arms supplies for Kyiv halted by the US and other Ukrainian allies. 

"It was emphasised that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv."

Kremlin readout of the Putin-Trump call yesterday

It appears this demand is not being met by the Trump administration at present, as Leavitt says: "Intelligence sharing in terms of Ukraine defence will continue." 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has just read out a US statement on today's call between presidents Trump and Zelenskyy - which described the call as "fantastic" and "productive".

It "significantly helped" in efforts to end the war, it said.

Zelenskyy thanked the US for Javelin missiles in particular - which were first provided to Ukraine by Trump.

The leaders also reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely, the statement continued.

Trump also suggested that the US take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.

Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence missiles to protect Ukraine's civilians - interestingly, Trump replied by saying he'd work with him on this, but that they'd look particularly at what was available in Europe.

Further talks will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the coming days, the statement added.

Zelenskyy also thanked Trump for pushing for prisoner exchanges - like the successful one today.

Zelenskyy also asked about Ukraine's missing children. Both parties agreed to work to ensure those children are returned home.

The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the details of implementing a partial ceasefire.

Discussions would also include expanding any ceasefire to the Black Sea.

"We have never been closer to peace," Leavitt added.

Watch a clip from her news conference here...

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had a "positive, very substantive and frank" conversation with Donald Trump. 

He said he began by thanking the president for his efforts to bring about a ceasefire. 

"One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it," he said. 

"The American side also proposed an unconditional ceasefire on the frontline, and Ukraine accepted this proposal as well," he added, saying work continues to reach this step. 

"I also provided an update on the battlefield situation and the consequences of Russian strikes. 

"We spoke about the situation in the Kursk region, touched on the issue of the release of PoWs, and the return of Ukrainian children who were taken by Russian forces."

Zelenskyy also said he asked around strengthening the Ukrainian air defence. 

"Ukrainian and American teams are ready to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to continue coordinating steps toward peace."

Ending his statement, the Ukrainian leader said he "highlighted the importance of President Trump's concept of peace through strength".

"We agreed to maintain constant contact, including at the highest level and through our teams."

With his governing coalition facing possible collapse by the end of the month, the Israeli leader needs to lock in support from his far-right allies.

JERUSALEM — After Israel launched airstrikes against Hamas on Tuesday, killing hundreds of people in one of the deadliest days of the war, some Israeli and U.S. officials said the surprise operation came in response to the militant group's recalcitrance during recent negotiations. Others said it was to preempt an imminent attack that Hamas was plotting against Israel.

But leaders from across Israel's political spectrum and analysts say the decision to resume fighting was also influenced by the mounting domestic pressures on Benjamin Netanyahu.

In recent days, the Israeli prime minister has publicly feuded with officials from the country's security establishment, including many who favor reaching a deal with Hamas to recover all the hostages left in Gaza. He has announced his intent to fire his internal intelligence chief, prompting calls for mass street protests. And most pressing, Netanyahu is facing a March 31 deadline to corral enough votes in the Knesset to pass a national budget — or otherwise see his government forced to dissolve under Israeli law.

In resuming war, the Israeli leader not only sought to redirect the country's attention, political observers say, but also cemented a governing coalition that can help him get past his most immediate political hurdles. As Netanyahu prepared to enter delicate discussions with his coalition partners over the budget this week, some members of allied ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties threatened to withhold their votes and derail its passage. Instead, Netanyahu shored up support from far-right political parties that have insisted that he resume the war, said Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser.

“There is a military case to be made that Hamas wasn't destroyed and is in the process of reconstituting, but there is no way to divorce this from the political events,” Freilich said. “I don't think anyone can ignore the timing.”

Hours after the start of the Israeli air campaign, Itamar Ben Gvir, leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, welcomed Israel's return to “intense fighting” and announced that he would rejoin Netanyahu's government, bolstering its number of parliamentary votes. But opposition leaders — including Yair Golan, the head of the left-leaning Democrats, the centrist Yair Lapid, and Gadi Eisenkot, a key figure in the center-right National Unity party, challenged Netanyahu's decision to resume fighting and his motives for doing so. Moreover, they questioned whether the move would doom the chances of freeing the remaining hostages.

The decision also provoked a surge of anger from the families of hostages, who called for more protests. Einav Zangauker, an Israeli mother whose son is one of 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, accused Netanyahu of favoring “cheap politics over our children, brothers and sisters in captivity” and led demonstrators near the Gaza border, saying she would help form a human chain to block an Israeli ground invasion.

In response, Netanyahu said Tuesday evening that he had refrained for weeks from restarting the Israel Defense Forces offensive against Hamas in hopes that the militant group would compromise during negotiations but that it refused. Now, “military pressure is a necessary condition for the release of the hostages,” he said.

“I hear the commentators claiming that the IDF's actions are driven by political motives,” Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement. “They have no shame. They are echoing Hamas propaganda.”

Israeli officials said the planning for the strike was underway for weeks, as negotiations between Israel and Hamas showed little signs of progress.

Netanyahu had favored a proposal by President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to negotiate for the release of up to 10 living hostages instead of entering a second phase of the ceasefire, as Israel and Hamas had earlier agreed. Under the framework deal reached in January, the second phase would require the return of all Israeli hostages in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners and a permanent cessation of hostilities — something Netanyahu vowed he would not accept until Hamas was destroyed.

On Friday, Hamas proposed releasing only one living hostage — the Israeli American dual national Edan Alexander — in an offer that highlighted the size of the gulf between the two sides. Soon after, Netanyahu chose the option of launching the air campaign, which could be ratcheted up in “phases” to include a full-on ground assault, Israeli officials said.

Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. State Department official, said Netanyahu not only was motivated by domestic political considerations but also felt reassured by support from the Trump administration. After Israel launched its strikes, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Israel had consulted the United States before the operation and then used a phrase favored by Trump. “All hell will break loose,” she warned Hamas.

“What would've been a fight from the Biden administration is now welcomed by Trump,” said Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “At least on Gaza, you have nothing short of a Vulcan mind meld between Trump and Netanyahu.”

By contrast, Netanyahu has found himself at odds with his director of the Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, who has argued for putting a priority on the release of hostages over prolonging the war. On Tuesday night, an estimated 40,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv to protest Netanyahu's decision, announced Sunday, to dismiss Bar.

In recent weeks, the tensions between Bar and Netanyahu spilled dramatically into public view, with Bar's supporters — who include retired spy chiefs and army generals — and Netanyahu accusing each other of corruption, unethical behavior, disloyalty and blackmail.

Avi Melamed, a former Israeli military intelligence official, said the high-level infighting and mass protests have been ramping up the pressures on Netanyahu but would not deter him. If anything, they motivated him to keep fighting.

“At the end of the day, Netanyahu's government is hanging by a thread, and it depends on the far right,” he said. “And they have been very clearly pressuring him not to stop the war, but to resume the war.”

Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Give us back the Statue of Liberty, Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party  | Photo: Pexels


	Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France.


	So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the US is no longer worthy of the monument, which was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.


	Raphael Glucksmann, as a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, can't claim to speak for all of his compatriots.


	But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants reflects the broad shockwaves that US President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe.


	Give us back the Statue of Liberty, Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled, on Sunday.


	It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us, Glucksmann said.


	The White House brushed back on the comments Monday, saying France instead should still be grateful for U.S. support during World War I and World War II. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is eternal, but added: If the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe." 
	No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty, he wrote in X posts. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone.


	Can France claim it back? 
	Dream on.


	Unesco, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is US government property.


	It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.


	But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Frdric-Auguste Bartholdi.


	The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision made that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.


	Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled on Oct. 28, 1886.


	Is France's government offering asylum to Lady Liberty? 
	No French-US relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.


	For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand, but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.


	Macron has let his prime minister, Franois Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the brutality that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine.


	Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an authoritarian manner and is preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter to Russia.


	In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the mighty woman with a torch who promised a home for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.


	Today, this land is ceasing to be what it was, Glucksmann said.


	What is the White House saying? 
	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about Glucksmann's comments, responded that the US would absolutely not be parting with the landmark in New York Harbour.


	Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in a lawsuit by The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.


	My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now," Leavitt said Monday, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I. They should be very grateful.


	But the debt of gratitude runs both ways. Leavitt skipped past France's key role in supporting the future United States during its war for independence from the United Kingdom.

WHEELING — Alliances of teams from Ohio and Marshall counties made the finals at the West Virginia State Middle School Robotics Tournament Tuesday, and earned themselves a trip to the world championships in Dallas.

In total, five local teams earned their spots at the world championships during the state tournament at Fairmont State University on Tuesday.

The “Return of Self Destruct” from Moundsville Middle School, aligned with the “Robo-Raiders” from Triadelphia Middle; and “Lil' George” from Sherrard School, partnering with  “Steel Vikings” from Warwood School, all made the finals at the state championships.

The teams all won spots in the VEX Robotics World Championships, which is scheduled for May 6-14 in Dallas.

“Lil' George” then won the “Excellence Award,” which double-qualified them for the world competition. This freed up a spot and permitted another Sherrard Middle School team, “Killer Frequency,” to go to the world championships.

When the local teams competed against each other for the state championship on Tuesday, the “Self Destruct/Robo-Raiders” alliance came out on top, defeating “Lil' George/Steel Vikings” 40 to 9.

The “Self Destruct/Robo-Raiders” alliance dominated throughout the competition, finishing first and second among the 32 teams competing in the qualifying rounds. They agreed to a partnership in the final rounds.

Members of “The Return of Self Destruct” are Juda Jones, Leo Nguyen, Isaiah Toothman and Kingsley Zheng. Those on the “Robo-Raiders” team are Katelyn Maloney, Sebastian Molina, Evan Clatterbuck, Chris Zelek, Amos Racer and Temperance Emmons. The “Robo-Raiders” team also won the state championship in 2023.

The “Lil' George Team” won the “Skills Award” during the event, in addition to the “Excellence Award.” Members are Zane Gast, Evan Cunningham, Gavin Pickett, Kabe Blake and Joziah Baker. The “Steel Vikings” members are Max O'Connell, Oliver Kovach, and Miles Wharton.

Those on “Killer Frequency” are Kolson Shepard, Blake Oliver, Nathan Spangler, Chase Nolan and Josh Naome.

Teams from Ohio and Marshall counties accounted for 16 teams, or half of the entries in the 32-team tournament.

Six teams at the state competition won seats at the world competition. The sixth team, winning the “Design Award” and qualifying, was “Sci-Botics” from Westwood School in Morgantown.

In addition to being finalists, the Robo-Raiders won the “Build Award,” and the “Steel Vikings” took home the “Amaze Award.”

“From the large group of sixth graders who joined us this year, to the incredible group of eighth graders who have grown so much over the last three years — and to everyone in between —  they are dedicated and diligent workers who persevere every day to hone their skills, skills that will serve them not only in robotics but in their lives,” said JoJo Shay, director of innovation for Ohio County Schools. “They are the future of OCS Robotics, and the future is shining bright!  We could not be more proud of these students and of our program.”

The middle school teams will join four local high school teams in Dallas that also won their way to the Vex Robotics Championship this week. These teams are the  “Iron Patriots:X-Ray,” “Iron Patriots:Yikes” and “Iron Patriots: Platypus” from Wheeling Park High School, and “George Drinks Water” from John Marshall High School. 

In total, nine local teams will be representing West Virginia's Northern Panhandle at the world championships this spring.

The FBI on Wednesday shared a wanted poster for Chinese national Baoxia "Emily" Liu, adding that the State Department is offering a reward of up to $15 million for information on her and others accused of smuggling U.S. drone weapons to Iran. 

Liu and three other fellow Chinese nationals were charged by President Joe Biden's Justice Department in January 2024 in an alleged years-long conspiracy in which they unlawfully exported and smuggled U.S. export-controlled items through China and Hong Kong to entities affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), which supervises production of Tehran's missiles, weapons, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).Her co-defendants are Li Yongxin, also known as "Emma Lee;" Yung Yiu Wa, also known as "Stephen Yung;" and Zhong Yanlai, also known as Sydney Chung.

The Department of State, now under President Donald Trump, said on Wednesday its Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $15 million "for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms" of the IRGC and its various branches, including the IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), which are designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). 

"The IRGC has financed numerous terrorist attacks and activities globally, including via its external proxies such as Hamas, Hizballah, and Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq," the State Department wrote in its announcement. "The IRGC funds its terrorist activities — in part — through sales of military equipment, including UAVs, or drones." 

Beginning as early as 2007, Liu and her associates "allegedly utilized an array of front companies in the People's Republic of China (PRC) to send dual-use U.S.-origin electronic components to IRGC-linked companies that could be used in the production of UAVs, ballistic missile systems, and other military end uses," the State Department said, noting the IRGC and its supporters "generate and move millions of dollars around the world by establishing and relying on front companies to procure cutting-edge technology to evade sanctions and trade controls."

The announcement comes after Trump ordered U.S. strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the weekend, and Israel bombarded Gaza, ending its ceasefire with Iran-backed Hamas after the terror group refused multiple hostage release deals. 

Hezbollah, another Iran-backed terror group based in Lebanon, also launched a missile toward Israel, but it was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 

Trump said he sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei two weeks ago offering direct negotiations with Tehran to deter them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The State Department said Liu and her three co-defendants "allegedly misrepresented the end users of dual-use U.S.-origin electronic components, leading U.S. companies to export goods to PRC-based front companies under the guise that the ultimate destination of these products was China rather than Iran."

"As a result, a vast amount of dual-use U.S.-origin products with military capabilities have been exported from the United States to IRGC-linked companies Shiraz Electronics Industries (SEI), Rayan Roshd Afzar, and their affiliates, in violation of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations," the department said.

The IRGC and MODAFL "have utilized the U.S.-controlled technology to develop and manufacture arms and weapons systems, including UAVs, that are sold to governments and groups in allied countries such as Russia, Sudan, and Yemen," it added.

Donald Trump has proposed the US take over the running of Ukraine's energy plants “for security”, in a phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky.

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since last month's infamous White House row.

A White House statement following the call read: “President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise, American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”

Mr Zelensky hit out at Vladimir Putin over strikes on Ukraine's energy grid – which came within hours of the Russian leader's promising to halt such strikes for 30 days.

In a social media post, Mr Trump said the call was to “align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs”, as he sought to bring about a ceasefire.

“We are very much on track,” Mr Trump added.

On Tuesday, the Russian autocrat promised to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to back a complete month-long ceasefire.

An overnight Russian missile attack left part of Slovyansk city without electricity, military officials said.

The White House said President Zelensky thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian [sic] including the exchange of prisoners of war.

“President Trump also asked President Zelensky about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted, and President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home,” the White House statement said.

“They agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The presidents noted the positive work of their advisers and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg and others.

“The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire.

“The presidents instructed their advisers and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible.

“The President's emphasis on the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security."

Ukraine's President Zelensky says he had a “positive, very substantive and frank” conversation with President Trump the first time the two leaders had spoken since Mr Trump and JD Vance verbally attacked Mr Zelensky in the Oval Office.

Mr Zelensky said he thanked the US president for a good and productive start to the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah.

The meeting significantly helped in moving toward ending the war, he said.

“We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace,” he went on.

“We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year.

“President Trump shared details of his conversation with Putin and the key issues discussed.

“One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.”

18:04 , Jane Dalton

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says she will present a proposal to EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday to provide Ukraine with two million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

The bloc's diplomatic service last week circulated a discussion paper saying the EU should be prepared to go as far as doubling its military aid to Ukraine this year to 40 billion euros, but several countries made clear they were not ready to back that plan.

Now Kallas is pushing for one part of the plan to be agreed as a first step, writing in a letter addressed to EU foreign and defence ministers that two million rounds, valued at 5 billion euros, "is available on the market and could be delivered in 2025".

"Ukraine is relying on us to act now," she wrote, adding: "I intend to present this proposal to European leaders tomorrow at the European Council meeting and stress the importance of supporting this objective."

17:53 , Jane Dalton

The US will share battlefield intelligence again with Ukraine, President Trump has told President Zelensky.

According to a White House briefing on a call between the two leaders, President Trump “fully briefed President Zelensky on his conversation with Putin and the key issues discussed.

“They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.

“President Zelensky asked for additional air defense systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, and President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.”

Two weeks ago, Mr Trump suspended intelligence-sharing for several days.

Donald Trump has proposed the US take over the running of Ukraine's energy plants, in a phone call with President Zelensky.

A White House statement following the call read: “President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants.

“He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise, American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”

Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukraine's energy infrastructure over the past three years.

Ukraine's president Zelensky has again made clear his ambition for his country of joining the EU and Nato.

After meeting Finnish politicians, including the parliament's Speaker, Mr Zelensky wrote on social media: “Our state, together with its partners, is developing a plan to achieve peace and ensure reliable security guarantees for Ukraine.

“Special attention was paid to supporting Ukraine on its path to EU and NATO membership.

“We are glad to be among friends, and I thank the Parliament and all political groups for their unanimous support of Ukraine and our people.”

The West has until now resisted Ukraine membership of Nato, as it could lead to direct war with Russia.

Donald Trump has hailed a “very good telephone call” with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which lasted around one hour.

“Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed. That Statement will be put out shortly.”

Ukrainian boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk visited a destroyed energy plant in central Ukraine, shortly before Vladimir Putin agreed to immediately halt attacks on energy infrastructure in Ukraine.

Standing among the devastation of the central Ukrainian plant, the 38-year-old heavyweight saw first-hand the effects of Russia's systematic and repeated attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in its attempt to weaken Kyiv's war effort.

Usyk visited the site on Monday, just one day before Putin agreed to temporarily halt all attacks on energy infrastructure in a phone call with US president Donald Trump on Tuesday.

In their first talks since late February, presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky will almost certainly be discussing the partial ceasefire agreed by Vladimir Putin yesterday.

The Russian autocrat agreed to halt all attacks on energy infrastructure for around a month during a phone call with Mr Trump on Tuesday.

But Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of striking energy facilities after the city of Slovyansk lost power overnight.

Moscow countered the claims, stating that it called off a drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and had shot down seven of its own drones. The Kremlin also accused Ukraine of targeting Russian energy targets overnight, including an alleged attack on an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya.

Mr Zelensky does not trust that Putin is an honest candidate for peace, and will likely make that clear to the US president.

Speaking on X yesterday about last night's attacks, he said: “The fact that this night is no exception shows that the pressure on Russia must continue for the sake of peace.

“Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire. It would be right for the world to respond by rejecting any attempts by Putin to prolong the war.”

Volodymyr Zelensky is currently speaking with US president Donald Trump for the first time in just under three weeks.

The last time the pair spoke produced one of the most infamous scenes in recent history, when Mr Trump and vice president JD Vance teamed up in a verbal attack of the Ukrainian president, who they accused of not showing enough gratitude to the US for its military support.

News anchors were left open-mouthed as Mr Zelensky was subsequently booted out of the Oval Office by his US counterpart, who told him not to return until he was “ready for peace”.

“You're playing cards, you're gambling with the lives of millions of people,” Mr Trump told Ukraine's war leader. “You're not in a good position right now,” Mr Zelensky was repeatedly told, in remarks which drew outrage from leaders around the world.

It kicked off when Mr Zelensky - who was officially at the White House to sign a crucial minerals deal with the US - repeatedly reiterated the need for US security guarantees in any future peace settlement, before Mr Vance accused him of not being grateful enough to the US.

President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are speaking by phone as Kyiv continues to weather attacks on energy infrastructure despite Russian leader Vladimir Putin's claim to have ordered a halt to such attacks following a phone call with Trump one day earlier.

The White House said the call would take place Wednesday morning, and White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the two leaders had been connected and were speaking as of 10:38 am ET.

Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed Wednesday's prisoner exchange, describing it as “one of the largest” which has been held.

A total of 197 Ukrainians were released from Russia, including 175 detainees and 22 who were released “through measures beyond exchanges”.

“Thank you to our Ukrainian POW [prisoner of war] search and exchange team for this important work, for the results that give hope. And we are grateful to all our partners, especially the United Arab Emirates, for making today's exchange possible,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram.

“Ukraine remembers each and every one of our heroes, and we will definitely bring all of our people home.”

President Vladimir Putin wants Donald Trump to formally recognise the four Ukrainian regions occupied by Russian forces, a Russian outlet has reported.

Putin wants his US counterpart to recognise the eastern Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which have been occupied since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, Kommersant reported, citing sources who attended a business event with Putin on Tuesday.

Moscow does not fully control any of the four regions.

The Russian autocrat also wants the US to recognise Crimea, southern land seized and annexed by Russia in 2014.

In return for recognition “in the near future”, Putin would not attempt to lay claim to the southern port city of Odesa or any other part of Ukraine, the report added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday Putin and Trump had not discussed the idea on their Tuesday call.

14:10 , Alex Croft

Russia and Ukraine have each released 175 prisoners of war in an exchange finalised during last night's call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian Defence Ministry said.

Moscow handed over an additional 22 badly wounded Ukrainian prisoners, the ministry added, in what it says was a goodwill measure.

The deal, which will see Russian soldiers freed from Ukraine via Belarus, was mediated by the United Arab Emirates.

Political correspondent Archie Mitchell reports live from Westminster:

Downing Street has refused to say Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted after he was accused by Ukraine of attacking energy infrastructure within hours of promising to halt the strikes.

The prime minister's official spokesman would not be drawn on whether the Russian dictator can be relied on to keep his word as peace talks continue.

But the spokesman said: “That is why we are always going to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.

“We are going to support Ukraine as long as it needs, both now and in the event of a potential peace deal.

“Clearly we all want to see an end to the fighting, we share president Trump's ambitions there.

“But you've seen from Russia's barbaric war in Ukraine they will go to any extent to impose suffering on the Ukrainian people.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday he hopes President Donald Trump will increase pressure on Russian individuals and entities violating U.S. sanctions.

He made the remark at a talk in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and said Russian President Vladimir Putin will look for any possibility to avoid a full ceasefire with Ukraine.

13:15 , Holly Evans

Vladimir Putin has broken his promise to Donald Trump to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure just hours after his agreement with the US president.

In a readout of the call between the two leaders, the Kremlin said Mr Trump had requested that Russia refrain from striking energy infrastructure. It added that Mr Putin had responded “positively” to this request and had “immediately given the Russian military the corresponding command”.

But Russia fired several ballistic missiles and nearly 150 drones across Ukraine a few hours later, cutting off electricity in the eastern city of Slovyansk, damaging two medical facilities in the northeast Sumy region, and wounding people in the capital of Kyiv.

An international effort to trace and rescue tens of thousands of children kidnapped from Ukraine to Russia and prosecute those responsible has been crippled by the US state department's deletion of evidence.

The Trump administration cut funding to Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab, which was compiling a database of alleged Russian war crimes, including the abduction of an estimated 35,000 children from occupied areas of Ukraine, last month.

Using satellite imagery and other surveillance systems provided through the US government, the Yale researchers were monitoring 116 sites in Russia.

US ‘deletes evidence' of Russia's kidnap of thousands of Ukrainian children

Zelensky, in a joint briefing in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, said Putin's words were not enough and that Ukraine would provide a list of energy facilities it hopes the U.S. and allies would help monitor.

"I really want there to be control. But I believe that the main agent of this control should be the United States of America," he said, adding that Kyiv would be ready to commit to a ceasefire.

"If the Russians will not strike our facilities, then we will definitely not strike theirs," Zelenskiy said.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russia had suspended its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure after a Tuesday phone call between Putin and Trump and had shot down its own Ukraine-bound drones while they were in the air.

In the call, Putin agreed to stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities temporarily but declined to endorse a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump hoped would be the first step toward a permanent peace deal.

Germany's outgoing government has agreed to release additional 3 billion euros (£2.5 billion) in military aid for Ukraine this year after lawmakers passed plans for a fiscal overhaul, a finance ministry document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.

The move is widely seen as a breakthrough after outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz had insisted on making the easing of borrowing rules a prerequisite for the additional aid.

As uncertainty grows about the future of US security guarantees under President Donald Trump, European states are under increasing pressure to show their commitment to Ukraine in its war with Russia, including with military spending.

Finance Minister Joerg Kukies has informed parliament's budget committee that the requirements for authorisation of the extra funds have been met, according to a submission to the committee from his ministry.

An exchange of 175 prisoners of war and some wounded soldiers, talks covering Iran and Israel, Russia's “legitimate interests” in the field of security and “expert groups” convened to discuss an eventual peace settlement over Ukraine. Even ice hockey games.

There was plenty of ground that presidents Trump and Putin covered during their 90-minute discussion – but only a limited ceasefire, for a month, covering energy and infrastructure, coupled with a proposal to end the flow of arms and intelligence to Ukraine. President Putin has given the least he could possibly get away with to President Trump without actually saying “nyet”. The fighting on the front line goes on.

Nothing that has emerged about Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin – one that reportedly went “very well” – suggests that the Russian president is in any hurry to settle the war he started three years ago.

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russian troops were "completing the defeat" of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region after a seven-month incursion by Kyiv's forces.

The incursion, which began in August, was aimed at diverting Moscow's forces from eastern Ukraine, gaining a bargaining chip in any future talks, and at riling Putin.

11:44 , Alex Croft

What a surprise - Putin rejects an unconditional ceasefire. He wants to keep bombing and killing innocent Ukrainians. He wants Ukraine disarmed. He wants Ukraine neutralised. He wants to make Ukraine a vassal state of Russia. He isn't negotiating. He's laughing at us.

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have agreed to shackle Ukraine after hours of talking on the telephone over ceasefire terms, which won't work but are intended to further divide Ukraine and Europe from the White House.

“The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,” the White House said in a statement about the call.

The Kremlin added: “It was emphasised that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be a complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.”

Poland plans to plant mines on its borders with Russia and Belarus, the country's deputy defence minister has said.

"We have no other choice. The situation on the border is serious. I'm talking about the Polish-Belarusian and Polish-Russian border,” Paweł Bejda said according to European Pravda.

It will be an element of Poland's East Shield security project, he said, adding that Poland does not yet have anti-personne mines but has the “capacity to produce them”.

"This [the production of landmines] will be carried out by the factories of the Polish Armed Group, but I don't want to go into details. We're talking about an order for several hundred thousand, we can talk about a million," Mr Bejda said.

Vladimir Putin is “playing a game”, German defence minister Boris Pistorius has said following Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure overnight.

“I'm sure that the American president won't be able to sit and watch for much longer,” Mr Pistorius said, adding that the Kremlin's insistence that the US must end military support to Ukraine as a condition of a ceasefire is “unacceptable”.

Speaking to German broadcaster ZDF, Mr Pistorius said: "Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated.

"This is very transparent," Mr Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from "further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”.

The next meeting between the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia will be less of a matter of diplomacy and more to address the technicalities of a partial ceasefire.

Volodymyr Zelensky is asked about the prospect of the US withdrawing military aid to Ukraine - something Russian president Vladimir Putin has demanded as a condition for a full ceasefire.

“No one can influence the United States,” he said. “The decision is the personal decision of president Trump, in my opinion.

“Russia would like that our partners would stop helping us because that weakens the Ukrainian position,” he added.

“If you really want peace, why are you then worrying about the Ukrainian army, doing everything to weaken our army or weaken the defence of our people?”

Ukraine would never agree to the territory currently occupied by Moscow being recognised as Russian, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

Speaking in Finland, he added: “So far the Russians are not showing that their ready to finish the war. With regard to the Crimean territory, that would be one of the sensitive and complex issues.”

Moscow and Kyiv need to “cross some ground” to get towards a full ceasefire, he added.

Ukraine is considering a “complete, full ceasefire” as a step towards long-term peace, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

“Now, as a result of global efforts, we can stop Putin. We have to do it together, all of us.

“Ukraine would like to thank the American side, to thank president Trump for meeting our teams. It was a productive meeting, a good meeting. We are hoping that agreements about the ceasefire will by the end be realised, we hope that America will carry on putting pressure on Russia.

“We are considering complete, full ceasefire as one of the steps towards peace.

“We need security guarantees for Ukraine, though, otherwise Putin will come back with war. 25 years with Putin in power: he either had war somewhere or he was ruining other countries.”

Volodymyr Zelensky has said Vladimir Putin's claim that Russia will halt strikes on energy infrastructure is “very different from reality”.

“Putin allegedly said he has given the order to stop strikes, but 150 drones attacked Ukraine's infrastructure, including hospitals and transport,” he said.

“Putin's words are very different from reality, and specifically for that we need defence, pressure on Russia, and so I am grateful to Finland for its support of our defence.”

One person was killed and four were wounded due to shelling in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district, Gladkov said in a video posted on Telegram.

Russian authorities have accused Ukraine of firing dozens of drones and attacking an oil depot, hours after Vladimir Putin agreed to a limited ceasefire.

Moscow said 57 Ukrainian drones were destroyed overnight, 35 of them over the border Kursk region - but the total number launched is unclear.

A small fire was sparked in the depot near the village of Kavkazskaya and spread 20 square meters without causing any injuries. 30 employees were evacuated from the site, the administration of the Kavkazskaya region said.

Russian SHOT Telegram channel posted a video of blazes at what appeared to be an industrial area. The channel says the Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point is an important facility designed to transport Russian oil for exports railway

Vladimir Putin's promises to Donald Trump to pause Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have lasted just a few hours.

Footage is emerging online showing the devastation wrought by Russia's latest missile and drone strikes.

Ukraine's air force said Russia fired at least two ballistic missiles, four anti-aircraft guided missiles and 145 attack drones at targets across Ukraine.

The city of Slovyansk was hit by a Russian missile, knocking out the power for around 100,000 people.

In Sumy, in the northeast, two Russian drones hit a medical facility just after 1am local time, according to Ukraine's emergency services. The facility was partially destroyed. As rescuers arrived to help 22 patients trapped in the building, emergency services say Russia fired five more drones.

The blast wave also damaged the premises of a children's medical facility, local emergency services reported.

In Kyiv, two people were injured, including a 60-year-old man after drone debris fell on the city.

Below, you can see the aftermath of the Sumy strikes, posted by Ukraine's emergency services.

Since returning to the White House in 2025, US President Donald Trump has dramatically reshaped US policy toward Russia, adopting a markedly softer stance on Vladimir Putin and the ongoing war in Ukraine. This approach has included cutting military aid to Ukraine, and pressuring Kyiv to accept unfavourable terms to end the fighting.

Trump is also weakening America's negotiating position by repeatedly and prematurely signalling the concessions the US is willing to make.

Historically, Russia has responded to strength, not appeasement. As US diplomat and historian George Kennan famously stated in his 1946 Long Telegram, the Soviet Union understood only the language of power. He was proven right – throughout and since the Cold War, Western concessions have often invigorated rather than calmed Russian aggression.

The Trump administration has slashed a government-funded initiative which tracked the mass deportation of children from Ukraine, Democratic lawmakers have said.

As part of its widespread slashes to foreign aid and US government programmes, the White House has ended the initiative at Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab (Yale HRL).

Researchers have lost access to vast amounts of information about some 30,000 children taken from Ukraine, including satellite imagery and other data.

In a letter to secretary of state Marco Rubio and treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the Democratic lawmakers say they believe the data has been “permanently deleted” in a move which would have “devastating consequences”

The Trump administration took “$26 million of US taxpayers money used for war crimes data and threw it into the woodchipper, including the dossiers on all the children”, a person familiar with the programme told Reuters.

"If you wanted to protect President Putin from prosecution, you nuke that thing. And they did it. It's the final court-admissible version with all the metadata," the source said.

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have agreed to shackle Ukraine after hours of talking on the telephone over ceasefire terms, which won't work but are intended to further divide Ukraine and Europe from the White House.

There has not been a Russian agreement to a ceasefire. But if there is to be one, then all foreign military and intelligence assistance has to stop.

That means the Anglo-French efforts to create a coalition of the willing to back Ukraine and support a long-term peace with military muscle must stop. US assistance must stop, again. All intelligence sharing, by both the US and other Nato members, must also be ended.

Ukraine, Russia has demanded, must be hog-tied, muzzled and blinded before substantial talks can begin.

China has said it is ready to assist countries involved in the Ukraine conflict with post-war reconstruction.

Beijing has remained a close ally to Russia throughout the war and refused to condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion, while offering to act as a mediator for peace.

"We are ready to continue to provide assistance within our capacity according to the wishes of parties involved, which, of course, includes post-war reconstruction," said Li Ming, spokesperson for the China International Development Cooperation Agency.

He added that Beijing has already delivered four batches of humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia's all-out invasion.

China remains committed to being a "positive force for world peace and stability and a progressive force for global fairness and justice," the spokesperson said.

A view is pictured of the United States Institute of Peace building headquarters on March 18 in Washington, DC.

(CNN) The US Institute of Peace has filed suit against the Trump administration after the Department of Government Efficiency's takeover of the independent organization and gutting of its board.

A lawsuit filed Tuesday in DC district court seeks “the immediate intervention of this Court to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute and irreparably impairing Plaintiffs' ability to perform their vital peace promotion and conflict resolution work as tasked by Congress.”

The suit was filed after DOGE personnel, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week. That dramatic escalation followed the Trump administration's Friday gutting of the organization's board. The Trump administration has faced several losses in the courts.

USIP, which works to resolve conflict, is not a federal agency. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984, and USIP owns and manages its headquarters.

A declaration filed as part of the lawsuit from the institute's chief security officer alleges that the one USIP employee who “possesses the technological capability to access the Infrastructure and to grant others access” was traveling to Washington, DC, “at the behest of DOGE … in order to access the Infrastructure and grant access to DOGE as soon as the evening of March 18, 2025.”

Another memorandum of support states that “USIP also has reason to believe that Defendants or those working in concert with them are currently in the USIP building, causing physical damage to the premises and physically accessing and disposing of USIP financial records.”

It included a photo taken Tuesday of a trash can full of files, some of which appear financial, marked “SHRED.”

The complaint argues the administration's actions, including alleged destruction and modification of files, are causing “irreparable harm” against USIP. It asks the court to block the “trespass by Defendants against real and personal property belonging to the Institute” and prohibit them from “maintaining, retaining, gaining, or exercising any access or control over Plaintiffs' offices, facilities, computer systems, accounts, or any other records, files, or resources, and from acting or purporting to act in the name of Institute, and from using the Institute's name, emblem, badge, seal, and any other mark of recognition of the Institute.”

The complaint specifically calls on the court to declare the Trump administration's efforts to oust the USIP board of directors and its acting president “null and void.” It asks for an injunction saying that those individuals may not be removed unless the court finds that it complies with the law and gives its “express permission.”

Under the USIP Act, most of the bipartisan board of directors is appointed by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Last week, the White House said they were terminating most of those members, who include President Donald Trump's former ambassador to Russia. According to the lawsuit, the termination emails from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel “did not state any justification for the purported terminations.”

The three remaining members of the board – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin – said they were removing the acting president, Amb. George Moose and installing Trump appointee Kenneth Jackson. The suit alleges that appointment is not valid and asks the court to declare that Moose “lawfully remains the president of the Institute.”

The case has been assigned to Judge Beryl Howell.

FIRST ON FOX – The Biden administration buried for more than a year a final draft report that failed to prove that an increase in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals was linked to a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas emissions, according to a copy of the findings, exclusively previewed to Fox News Digital.

The Biden administration stalled the release of the information, senior Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital, delaying sharing the data with House Oversight Committee Republicans. The Daily Caller News Foundation first reported that the Biden administration "intentionally buried" the study. 

The impact that new U.S. LNG exports had on the environment and the economy had been reviewed by U.S. Energy Department scientists and federal contractors, who by September 2023 had completed their work and had a draft final report ready for publication.

Fox News independently reviewed a copy of that draft study, titled, "Energy, Economic, and Environmental Assessment of U.S. LNG Exports." That report and its findings were slated for publication in 2023 — months before then-President Joe Biden, who was still seeking re-election at the time, announced a pause on all new U.S. LNG export terminals in January 2024, citing the need to better consider environmental and economic impacts.

The draft report found that across all modeled scenarios, an increase in U.S. LNG exports and natural gas production did not change global or U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, nor did it correlate with a strong uptick in energy prices for consumers, Trump administration officials said.

"​​Secretary Granholm, and Biden White House told Americans that the increase in LNG exports would disproportionately increase prices for American consumers as well as from the environment," an official said.

"And both these claims were refuted in the report that the Biden administration hid from Congress and the American public," the official said.

A copy of the report was shared Wednesday morning with the House Oversight Committee, which had been requesting the Energy Department to share its findings on LNG since March 2024.

A September 2024 court filing from Government Accountability and Oversight (GAO) revealed that the Energy Department was conducting an LNG study in 2023, Comer's office told Fox News Digital. But DOE repeatedly declined to provide this study to the House Oversight Committee or comply with other requests for information.

"Biden Administration officials, who religiously claimed to ‘follow the science,' abandoned it to undermine American-made energy production, appease climate activists, and achieve their predetermined outcomes," House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. told Fox News in response to the report's release. 

"I am grateful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for providing the transparency the American people deserve and for taking action to restore America's energy dominance."

The 2023 findings present the most definitive data to date that the Biden administration, and then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, misrepresented the impact LNG exports would have on the U.S.

At the time, Biden was facing mounting criticism from progressives in the party to scale back LNG exports, which during his term rose to an all-time high. The U.S. became the world's largest energy exporter in 2023, underpinned by new demand in the EU, following Russia's war in Ukraine, and its abrupt cutoff of nearly all piped gas supplies to the bloc.

To help alleviate the deep energy security concerns, the U.S. ramped up exports to Europe to a record-high, supplying more than 50% of their LNG, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That prompted fierce pushback from progressive Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., which put new pressure on the administration for the pause.

However, rather than come forward with the report, the Biden administration continued to stall on releasing the study and declined to comply with requests from the House Oversight Committee to testify or share their findings, Trump administration officials said.

That's far less significant than the data eventually released by the Biden administration in December 2024, after the presidential election, which suggested the rise in exports could cause consumer prices to rise by as much as 30% in the coming years.

That sparked fierce backlash from both industry groups and Republicans, who panned the study as exaggerated and failing to justify the administration's 10-month pause.

President Trump signed an order in January to release the remaining records.

The National Archives on Tuesday released thousands of pages of declassified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

The records were posted to the National Archives' website, joining recently released records posted in 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2017-2018.

"This release consists of approximately 80,000 pages of previously-classified records that will be published with no redactions," said the announcement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "Additional documents withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and records subject to section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, must be unsealed before release."

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 23 directing the release of all remaining records related to the assassination, saying it was in the "public interest" to do so.

Tuesday's initial release contained 1,123 records comprising 32,000 pages. A subsequent release on Tuesday night contained 1,059 records comprising 31,400 additional pages.

Among the material was the long-awaited, unredacted text of a June 1961 memo on the CIA, sent to President Kennedy by aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr. The memo contained harsh criticism of the spy agency just months after the CIA backed the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion of Fidel Castro's Cuba.

Previously-released versions of the 63-year-old memo had contained more than a full page of redactions -- classification markings that generated a great deal of interest among researchers and conspiracy theorists, particularly those who hold the unsubstantiated view that the CIA may have played a role in Kennedy's killing.

Schlesinger had argued to Kennedy that the CIA's reliance on "controlled American sources" had been encroaching on the traditional functions of the State Department, and that the CIA may have been seeking to infiltrate the politics of America's allies.

"CIA today has nearly as many people under official cover overseas as State," Schlesinger wrote in 1961, adding that in certain countries, the CIA's presence "outnumbers regular State Department personnel."

The previously-classified portion of the memo cites the specific number of CIA personnel that had been stationed at the U.S. embassy in Paris, where "CIA has even sought to monopolize contact with certain French political personalities, among them the President of the National Assembly," the memo said.

Schlesinger also details the number of CIA sources in Austria and Chile, information in the memo that had been classified until now.

Several of the newly-released pages detail how the CIA went about tapping telephones in Mexico City between in December 1962 and January 1963 to monitor the communications of the Soviets and Cubans at their diplomatic facilities, which Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald visited in the months before the assassination.

The previously-redacted pages spell out specific instructions for CIA operatives on how to wiretap, including the use of certain chemicals to create markings on telephone devices that could only be seen by other spies under UV light.

For decades, the CIA has urged the continued secrecy of these details out of fear that they would reveal the methods of the agency's spy craft.

One 79-page record contains 15 newly unredacted pages -- though several of them remain unreadable due to the degraded quality of the typeface after many rounds of photocopy duplication.

The newly-disclosed portions detail CIA surveillance of Soviet embassies in Mexico City and efforts to recruit double agents from Soviet agency personnel -- and reveal the names and positions of those who were recruited. The CIA officials writing these memos tout the efficacy of their efforts, with one trumpeting, "I cannot help but feel that we are buying a great deal for our money in this project."

The memo also details the CIA's surveillance of an American man described as a Communist living in Mexico. The bulk of the memo is a listing of phone numbers that were tapped by the U.S. government. This file has long been sought by researchers due to Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City, but the document includes no mention of Oswald by name.

"The first JFK files release of 2025 is an encouraging start," Jefferson Morley of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a nonprofit that operates a database of government records on the Kennedy assassination, said on X. "We now have complete versions of approximately a third of the redacted JFK documents held by the National Archives (1,124 of approximately 3,500 documents ). Rampant overclassification of trivial information has been eliminated and there appear to be no redactions, though we have not viewed every document."

"Seven of ten JFK files held by the Archives and sought by JFK researchers are now in the public record. These long-secret records shed new light on JFK's mistrust of the CIA, the Castro assassination plots, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and CIA propaganda operations involving Oswald," Morley posted. "The release does not include two thirds of the promised files nor any of 500-plus IRS record, nor any of the 2,400 recently discovered FBI files. Nonetheless, this is most positive news on the declassification of JFK files since the 1990s."

Many of the documents have long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret.

One such document from August 1966 recommends a "certificate of distinction" for a CIA official who led the spy agency's technical division. Previous releases of the same document contained redactions striking sentences that described how this individual led a team that "conceived and developed" the use of "fluoroscopic scanning" and X-rays, which allowed the CIA to "detect hidden technical listening devices" for the first time. The official, James McCord, would go on to become head of security for Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972 -- and gain infamy for his role as one of the Watergate burglars whose break-in precipitated the Watergate scandal of the 1970s.

The release of the JFK materials comes a day after Trump announced to reporters that the administration would begin releasing the records on Tuesday, prompting a scramble inside the Justice Department to free up attorneys to assist with the declassification process.

Congress voted in 1992 to require the government to release and declassify all records related to the assassination and subsequent investigations by 2017, but that deadline was repeatedly pushed back by Trump and President Joe Biden due to national security concerns.

Tuesday's release represents a small, outstanding tranche of the more than six million pages of Kennedy assassination records collected by the National Archives -- the majority of which have already been declassified and are available online or in person for review, according to the agency.

Also released Tuesday were 57 documents referencing Martin Luther King Jr., 35 of which relate to his 1968 assassination, and 77 documents referencing Robert F. Kennedy, two of which relate to his assassination the same year.

An intelligence document from 1968 -- previously released in 2018 -- discusses how RFK's assassination stoked interest in his brother's assassination and New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation into the matter.

"The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion against the United States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister 'political murder conspiracy,'" the dispatch said.

Some of the other documents detailed operations to potentially overthrow Castro in Cuba. According to a 1964 document, two intelligence assets discussed potentially assassinating Castro under the administration of Lyndon Johnson.

"CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however, inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY Would have no part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been brought up again for consideration," the document said.

Another previously released document detailed RFK being briefed on potential plans to kill Castro.

"RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again," a footnote of the document read.

Some of the documents appear to have originated from the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission. In a 1964 intelligence document, a station chief noted an interest in developing a source whose daughter is a secretary in RFK's senate office. That document was released in 2018.

WASHINGTON, March 18, 2025 – Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins celebrated National Agriculture Day, reinforcing the importance of American farmers, ranchers, and producers as outlined in President Donald J. Trump's official proclamation marking the occasion.

“Today on National Agriculture Day, we recognize the people who make it all possible. The farmers, the ranchers, and the producers who dedicate their lives to feeding, to fueling, and to clothing our nation,” said Secretary Rollins. “Every day, through challenges and triumphs, the men and women in agriculture show up. They adapt, they solve problems, and they push forward ensuring that future generations can continue this proud tradition. To every farmer, to every rancher, and to every producer, we see you, we appreciate you, and we thank you.”

In his proclamation, President Trump underscored the essential role of American agriculture in the nation's economy and way of life: 

 “From the earliest days of our Republic, our farmers and agricultural communities have been the source of American success — enduring the elements and defying hard conditions to cultivate our land and feed the people. Farming is indelibly engrained in our history, customs, and culture, and stands to this day as the bedrock of our economy and way of life." 

 “For centuries, American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of the American economy.  Today and every day, we extend our unending gratitude to the dedicated men and women in farming communities who embody the timeless virtues of hard work and self-reliance.  As we continue our new chapter of American prosperity, we commit to embolden the heroes of our agricultural community who work tirelessly with their unwavering American pride to nourish our Nation, feed our families, and fuel our way of life.” 

 In honor of National Agriculture Week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is highlighting the voices of farmers, ranchers, and producers from across the country who embody the resilience and commitment that sustain American agriculture.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation and economic growth amid uncertainties stemming from President Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Fed officials now see inflation staying higher this year than previously estimated and economic growth going lower than prior predictions.

Policymakers estimate that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) measure of inflation will be 2.8% at the end of 2025, compared with 2.5% previously.

And the US economy is now projected to grow at an annualized pace of 1.7% instead of 2.1%. The unemployment rate is seen edging up to 4.4% from 4.3% previously.

"There are so many things we don't know," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday, and "uncertainty is remarkably high."

But what is known about tariffs is that they "tend to bring growth down and they tend to bring inflation up."

He acknowledged that the new Fed view on inflation this year can be attributed at least in "good part" to the tariffs, but his "base case" is that the inflationary effect from tariffs will be transitory.

While progress on bringing inflation down to the Fed's goal "is probably delayed for the time being," Powell noted that officials do see the goal still being reached by 2027.

Powell has also consistently stressed a wait-and-see approach to assessing the economic impact of policy changes and did the same Wednesday at his press conference, telling reporters that the Fed is focusing on "separating the signal from the noise" when evaluating how Trump's policies may affect the economic outlook.

"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance," Powell said.

The Fed has now held borrowing costs steady for two consecutive meetings, maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25%-4.5%. The pause follows three consecutive rate cuts in late 2024.

The central bank also announced it will begin slowing the pace of Treasuries being drawn off its balance sheet starting in April, reducing the amount of Treasuries allowed to roll off from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Fed, however, will maintain the pace of mortgage-backed securities being drawn down by $35 billion per month.

Fed governor Chris Waller dissented in Wednesday decision because he would have preferred to continue the current pace of decline in letting bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet. He agreed with the decision to hold rates steady.

Waller and his Fed colleagues on Wednesday kept their median estimate first made in December for two rate cuts in 2025, even as a much-studied "dot plot" showed a large number of policymakers favored fewer or no cuts.

Nine officials see 2 cuts, while 4 officials see 1 cut and 4 see no cuts.

The biggest challenge for the Fed going forward may be how to balance both sides of their mandate — maximum employment and price stabilities — as uncertainties mount about both of those goals.

One large concern for investors is the possibility of a scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises — a dynamic known as stagflation that was last seen in the US during the 1970s.

Powell downplayed any comparisons to that time, saying in response to a question from Yahoo Finance that "I don't see any reason to think we are looking at a replay of the 70s."

On the inflation front, the next reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge of core PCE could reveal some new complications.

The metric is likely to show the gauge remained elevated in February, rising to 2.7% from 2.6% seen in January, when it is released next week.

That is still far from the Fed's eventual goal of 2%.

He acknowledged that consumer surveys show short-term worries about inflation but said that the relationship between survey data and hard data "isn't tight." Long-run inflation expectations "really haven't moved."

"We will be watching very carefully for signs of weakness in the real data."

He acknowledged that "it's going to be a challenge" for the central bank to navigate the coming period as new policies from the Trump administration are put in place.

It's “really hard to know how this will work out,” he added.

After previously collaborating with the House of Mouse, the Hundreds co-founder will now oversee merchandise and licensed products for the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations.

Bobby Kim, better known as Bobby Hundreds in the fashion world, is heading to the House of Mouse.


	The Hundreds co-founder has been named vp of creative for the Americas at Disney Consumer Products. The author revealed the news Tuesday on Instagram following the announcement that his apparel label closed its longtime flagship on streetwear corridor Fairfax Avenue. Kim is also stepping down as creative director of the 22-year-old company, which will continue to sell online and at other retailers. 




	Kim, who previously led The Hundreds' Disney collaborations through the years, will report to Marcus Rosie, Disney svp of global creative, and will oversee development of toys, apparel, books and more merchandise and licensed products sold at the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations, Disney theme parks and other retailers.

	“With more than 20 years of experience, Bobby's creativity and cultural influence transcends fashion,” Rosie said in a statement. “His commitment to innovation and authenticity makes him the ideal candidate to lead our Americas creative teams, as we continue to surprise and delight consumers through our licensed, theme parks and Disney Store businesses.” 


	Kim co-founded The Hundreds in 2003 with then-fellow Loyola Law School student Ben Shenassafar, and was known for his prolific blog posts under the brand, eventually landing a book deal. In 2019 he released a memoir, This Is Not a T-Shirt (MCD), about building the company — known for its “Adam Bomb” mascot — into a multi-million-dollar global brand. Kim also co-founded the fashion-meet-streetwear festival, Family Style, which was acquired in 2024 by Complex.


	At The Hundreds, Kim's handful of Disney collaborations included a 2008 collection that reimagined the Lost Boys of Peter Pan for a new audience. 


	He previously told The Hollywood Reporter, “I remember when I got my publishing deal, one of the things that I was pitching to the publishers is that I don't think they necessarily look at young teenage men, twenty-something guys, as an ideal audience. We had a lot of licensing and collaborative partners throughout the brand's history that felt the same way. I remember at that time [Disney] really only targeted children and female audiences. They said, ‘We have no inroads with men.' And I said, ‘If you work with us, I'll show you.' It opened up an entire new lane; more young guys were getting into Disney. It was the same thing with the book. I wanted to open up this world of young men really getting into literature, into books, into fiction or nonfiction.”

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was leaving interest rates unchanged — but warned of rising uncertainty about the direction of the economy, in part due to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.  

The Fed said its key federal funds rate, which serves as a benchmark for interest rates throughout the economy, would remain at approximately 4.5%.

Though it said current economic conditions were solid, the central bank lowered its forecast for gross domestic product, a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within the U.S., for the rest of the year to 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. It also warned that a key measure of inflation would now be closer to 3% than 2%.

Eighteen of 19 policymakers now say there's increased risk that GDP will fall, compared with just five in December. Meanwhile, 11 policymakers say the unemployment rate could climb to as much as 4.5% this year, up from five previously.

"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased," the Fed's statement said.

In a press conference following the release of the statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the dynamic between Trump's tariffs and stronger near-term price growth wasn't totally clear given other trends in the economy. But the tariffs are certainly a factor in rising expectations that price hikes will accelerate, he said — though for now, firmer inflation would likely be "transitory."

“Inflation has started to move up now, we think, partly in response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress in the course of this year,” Powell said.

Stocks surged on the news — but bond purchases also increased, the latter reflecting concerns about future growth prospects. Investors seek out bonds when they believe they can get a better return on them than other assets. 

“The Fed is as lost in the wilderness as the rest of us trying to decipher the continual shifts in economic policy from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” Omair Sharif, managing director of Inflation Insights consultancy, said in a note to clients following Wednesday's rate decision.

A host of indicators, not to mention comments from Trump administration officials themselves, suggest that consumer spending and employers' hiring are both slowing. After an initial burst of optimism upon Trump's election, growth now looks to be more subdued. Meanwhile, federal workforce cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have also raised concerns about pressure on local economies, not to mention the ability of newly jobless workers to receive unemployment assistance.

Sweeping White House policy changes have already unnerved investors. Last week, the S&P 500 slipped into correction territory, marking a 10% drop from its latest peak, for the first time in three years.

As surveys suggest consumer and business confidence are declining, Trump and senior officials have changed their messaging since the campaign, warning consumers to brace for potential economic pain and declining to rule out the possibility of a recession. Trump has signaled the economy may be in for a period of “transition” as his policies take effect, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the U.S. must “detox” from its reliance on public spending.

The upheaval has created new difficulties for the Fed to navigate as it sets borrowing rates. The central bank is charged by Congress with helping keep unemployment and inflation low. Right now, both are fairly subdued. Yet multiple analysts noted Wednesday that the Fed's latest outlook signals the prospect of stagflation — higher inflation despite lower overall growth — albeit far short of the 1970s' shock caused by that decade's oil crisis.

"Revisions to [policymakers'] projections had a somewhat 'stagflationary' feel with forecasts for growth and inflation moving in opposite directions," Goldman Sachs managing director Whitney Watson said in a note Wednesday afternoon. "For the time being the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious.”

That has drawn multiple interpretations among analysts looking for signs of the Fed's thinking.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the revised projections indicate the central bank may soon start paying closer attention to the labor market, wary of letting unemployment rise too high. Fed policymakers are still indicating that they expect "rate cuts will be necessary in the near future — they just need a full set of information to give them the green light," she said.

Inflation Insights' Sharif, by contrast, said the fact that the Fed still foresees no more than two rate cuts this year suggests a more "hawkish" stance, with policymakers focusing more on controlling price growth than on keeping unemployment in check.

He said the situation was reminiscent of 2022, when the Fed decided to not signal rate cuts were forthcoming because inflation remained elevated.

"The Fed saw downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment, but they continued to power ahead with rate hikes," Sharif said of policymakers' approach at the time. "They're saying now that they will err on the side of making sure inflation does not get out of hand again."

Oops, something went wrong

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to take questions from journalists after the central bank held interest rates steady amid increasing economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's agenda.

The Fed held interest rates at current levels for the second straight meeting after three consecutive rate cuts to end 2024. In recent months, many Fed officials have made clear they are increasingly concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025.

Independent movies make up the bulk of projects selected to receive tax credits, reflecting major productions increasingly opting to shoot in other regions with more generous incentive programs. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	A record 51 films will receive tax credits to shoot in California amid a historic downturn in production in the state fueled by an increasingly tit-for-tat incentives race to host Hollywood.


	The total marks the highest number of titles selected in a single round of the state's film and TV tax incentive program, according to the California Film Commission. The productions are estimated to employ 6,490 cast and crew, paying nearly $347 million in wages, and generate roughly $578 million in economic activity.




	“While other states try to chase California's on-screen success, everyone knows the Golden State is the entertainment capital of the world – built through decades of innovation and hard work,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. “Today's awards are vital to keeping production where it belongs – generating thousands of good-paying jobs ‘below the line,' and supporting the local businesses that rely on a thriving film and television industry.”

	The upcoming, yet-to-be-titled film from Everything Everywhere All At Once directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert headlines the projects tapped for this application window. NBCUniversal is expected to receive $20.8 million in tax credits.


	The only other major studios chosen to receive incentives this round are Twentieth Century Studios for Business Women and Warner Bros. for Cut Off, which will get $5.7 million and $10 million in credits respectively.


	The bulk of this allocation round was directed toward a slate of 46 independent movies, reflecting big budget productions increasingly opting to shoot in other regions with more generous tax incentives, like Georgia and the U.K. The majority of those films are projected to shoot in regions outside of Los Angeles, with plans to film more than 360 days in Contra Costa, Oakland, Ojai, Merced, and San Diego Counties, among others, according to the film commission.


	Independent films chosen to receive tax credits include Animals, Not Her, TBTN, Phantom, A Bobby Thing, and Reenactment.


	In a statement, California Film Commission director Colleen Bell stressed the disruption in production caused by Los Angeles' wildfires earlier this year. “These disruptions have impacted employment for thousands of cast and crew members, affecting everything from production schedules and financing to housing and location access,” she said. “Now more than ever, this program is a critical tool to help productions recover, keeping jobs and investment here in our state, all while ensuring that California remains the heart of the entertainment industry.”

	











	Kwan and Scheinert underscored the significance of the state film and TV tax incentive program to keeping production in California. “We are LA filmmakers, with very dear LA friends, who happen to be some of the greatest creative talents we've worked with,” they said in a statement. ““On ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once' we received the California tax credit, and had we not, it would have been utterly impossible to make that film.”


	Last year, Newsom unveiled plans to double California's current cap for the state's film and TV tax incentive program from $330 million to $750 million a year. It's an aggressive bid to revitalize production across the state after it was decimated by the strikes and curb the yearslong flight of production away from the region. Details are still being ironed out.

What Pirates LaunchPad Accelerator graduates say about the program: 

"The Pirate Accelerator gave me the tools and the support to launch Pesto Joe LLC,
                                       which was barely an idea when I initially signed up. Following the program, I was
                                       able to complete a proof of concept at local farmers markets and quickly gained a
                                       following. That was when I knew I had a viable business. I took the following months
                                       to learn about the food industry, build my network and attain my food handler's certificate.
                                       It is crazy to look back and remember where I was two years ago. I simply had an idea,
                                          and I am already leaps and bounds ahead of where I was when I started the accelerator.
                                          I am currently preparing for a busy farmers market season and recently began to sell
                                          my products online. Nothing can stop a Pirate when they are on a mission, and I am
                                          grateful for the accelerator for pointing me in the right direction!" - Carina Castagna,
                                           ‘21/M.P.A. ‘22, founder & CEO, Pesto Joe.

                                             the Pirates LaunchPad Accelerator.

"Pirates Launchpad provides a great network and formula to turn your ideas into reality.
                                       The program  helped to guide us as we embarked on a major business expansion last
                                       summer and opened an One-Stop Eco-Shop retail store in Toms River. The store supplements
                                       our online consumer products businesses." – Brooke and Madison Loza, founders of One-Stop

                                       and NJIT New Venture Competition.  

 

"My goal when I entered Pirates LaunchPad was to expand my existing online business,
                                       including revamping my website. I was able to accomplish these goals and more." -

To make the "Magnificent Seven" trade great again, its historical top dog will have to spring back to life.

"I don't think the Mag 7 is going to work without Nvidia working," EMJ Capital founder and Nvidia bull Eric Jackson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).

As Jackson pointed out, the Mag 7 has "sucked wind" in 2025 as fears deepen on the complex's valuation and potential of peak AI spending.

Apple (AAPL) is off by 14% year to date, Microsoft (MSFT) 9%, Amazon (AMZN) 12%, Google (GOOG) 14%, and Tesla (TSLA) a stunning 49%. Meta (META) has outperformed the group with a modest drop, in part as cofounder Mark Zuckerberg has cozied up to the Trump administration.

As for Nvidia, its stock is down 12%, mostly on peak AI build-out fears.

But Nvidia is seen as the straw that stirs the drink for the cohort, given how its AI chips are laying the foundation for the Mag 7 to build out their AI infrastructure.

If the bears aren't going to buy into the Nvidia growth narrative, warming up to the other six names, even on their relative lows, will be a tough sell, Jackson said.

Nvidia did its part to jump-start its stock at its annual GTC spectacle on Tuesday.

There were lots of details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, which could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity.

Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang dropped a host of big numbers around artificial intelligence's potential. None were bigger than his prediction that Nvidia's data center infrastructure revenue will hit $1 trillion by 2028.

 

The company even took some wraps off a future AI chip called Feynman, set to drop in 2028.

By the end of the presentation, Huang had displayed Nvidia's full product roadmap through 2028 — impressive given how much innovation the company has done on AI chips in the past two years alone.

Nvidia's stock still fell 3.4% by the close of trading on Tuesday, which pressured the broader Mag 7. Shares of Nvidia and the Mag 7 rebounded only slightly on Wednesday as the Street voiced its letdown with the event.

Jackson added on the markets: "Hope springs eternal that this is just like a recent pullback that is healthy and the market can catch its breath and move forward, including the Mag 7 names."

Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid. You can find more episodes on our video hub or watch on your preferred streaming service.

Morgan Stanley is preparing to reduce its 80,000-person workforce by 2,000 employees later this month, marking the bank's first significant round of layoffs since CEO Ted Pick took over in January 2024.

The workforce reduction will affect divisions across Morgan Stanley, except for its 15,000 financial advisers, per Bloomberg. The cuts are meant to keep costs down as executives face low attrition, or a low rate of employees leaving an organization through resignations, terminations, or retirements.

Some employees impacted by the layoffs will be let go due to performance issues, while others will be cut because AI and automation have replaced their roles within the bank. A source told Bloomberg that the bank expects to make more job reductions due to AI in the coming years.

Morgan Stanley isn't the only major bank planning to cut roles due to AI. A Bloomberg Intelligence report released earlier this year surveyed chief information and technology officers at 93 major banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and found that executives expect to lay off an average of 3% of their workforce within the next three to five years as AI takes over tasks. That means up to 200,000 jobs on Wall Street are at risk of being cut due to automation.

Morgan Stanley has released several internal AI tools for employees. In September 2023, the bank rolled out an AI knowledge assistant tool that quickly finds information within Morgan Stanley research for financial advisers. In June 2024, the bank released another AI tool that takes notes and finds action items for financial advisers during their video meetings with clients.

Pick told investors in June that the AI tools could save employees between 10 to 15 hours per week.

"This is potentially really game-changing," he stated at the time, per Reuters.

Morgan Stanley executives credited the new AI technology with helping the bank report record revenue and profits. Pick told CNBC in October that AI makes the bank more cost-effective and productive. In 2024, Morgan Stanley achieved record net revenues of $61.8 billion, up from $54.1 billion in 2023.

Morgan Stanley is the latest bank to plan layoffs. One of its rivals, Goldman Sachs, is aiming to cut 3% to 5% of its 46,500-person workforce in the coming months. Goldman will reportedly ask some managers located in major hubs like New York City to move to emerging locations like Salt Lake City and Dallas.

SAXONBURG, Pennsylvania — Small businesses have been the backbone of the United States since its founding. The Hotel Saxonburg, which has also been known as the Vogeley House, the Belvedere House, the Laube House and the Central Hotel, opened in 1835 and has lasted most of our nation's existence.

Yesterday, the new owners abruptly closed the hotel after purchasing it two years ago. This not only shuttered the historic restaurant and hotel that served as a cultural touchstone for nearly 200 years, but it also caused people to lose their jobs.

Because the business was small, those job losses, likely around 50 people total, were a statistic that didn't gain attention from the national press. However, when you consider that more people in the U.S. work for small businesses than any other sector, those numbers start to add up.

According to the Small Business Administration, which draws its data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 60% of U.S. businesses are small businesses. They range from employing a handful of people (think your favorite food truck) to 100 people (think a local machine shop).

Before 2020, most Americans worked for small businesses that employed under 500 people. The last four years have upended that number. Now, only 53% of Americans work for businesses with 500 or more workers.

In short, the U.S. is no longer a nation of small businesses. In February, the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau showed that shift. It also showed that the biggest change of all has been the increase in the number of people working for companies with 10,000 or more workers and the decrease in the number of people working at firms with under 100 workers.

Case in point: Last year, there was a story about a local independent grocery, Ferri's, that closed after 70 years in a snowball effect that began with the unexpected shuttering of the small independent pharmacy located inside the grocery.

The beloved family grocery posted a note on the building's large glass front windows and on Facebook, saying they were closing “with a heavy heart” after serving as “a cornerstone of our community and … fostering connections that have spanned generations.”

Ferri's general manager, Gary Silvestri, said the loss of rent and traffic from the pharmacy had a significant impact, as it was 20% of the grocer's business.

Another factor was the economic pressure of Target being located a couple of miles to the east, Walmart a few miles to the west, and Giant Eagle, a massive local grocery store chain, within a half mile of Ferri's. All three of those companies employ well over 10,000 people and have the buying-power advantage to lower prices over a mom-and-pop grocery.

Jeff Hastings of Wholesale Central, the leading publisher of content for the wholesale merchandise industry, wrote that ever since the dawn of the big-box store in 1962, the year Walmart, Kmart and Target all opened their doors, small local businesses, from hardware stores to clothing and shoe stores to pharmacies and groceries, have struggled to compete.

He cited the 2006 Walmart move into the west side of Chicago as an example. Eighty-two local stores went out of business and cost an estimated 300 retail jobs in neighboring ZIP codes.

It isn't just groceries, restaurants or hotels that are falling to larger entities with 10 to 100 employees. Small local gas stations, clothing stores and even small insurance companies that either close or merge with larger companies are also losing ground as big companies expand.

Locals in Saxonburg were sad that the hotel closed and that people lost their jobs, but they also felt confident that someone would come along and revive the historic hotel and restaurant as a gathering place for the community and visitors.

The good news for small businesses, and why many economic experts expect a turnaround, is the surge in construction, manufacturing, retail and service industries in January of this year. Optimism levels exceed the 51-year average, according to the latest Small Business Economic Trends survey from the National Federation of Independent Business Research Center.

That quarterly report revealed that the overall small business population is signaling renewed confidence despite persistent economic challenges. That just might turn around this current trend.

Wix's launch of Wix Functions represents a strategic enhancement to their SaaS website building platform, enabling customers to implement sophisticated business logic without writing code. This significant product addition addresses a critical gap in Wix's offering by allowing businesses to create customized workflows and real-time business rules through a visual interface.

The feature introduces considerable value by enabling dynamic pricing rules, conditional checkout processes, and tailored loyalty rewards across six major Wix applications (Stores, Bookings, Restaurants, Donations, Forms, and Loyalty Program). From a competitive standpoint, this capability reduces a key friction point that often forces growing businesses to migrate to more technically advanced platforms as their operational needs become more complex.

Financially, Wix has implemented a freemium monetization strategy for this feature - offering basic functionality at no cost while reserving unlimited actions and premium capabilities for paid upgrades. This approach creates new upsell opportunities within Wix's existing customer base while potentially improving customer retention by eliminating technical limitations.

This product launch strengthens Wix's position against competitors by elevating its platform beyond basic website building into more sophisticated business operations territory. By empowering non-technical users to implement complex business logic that previously required developer resources, Wix is expanding its addressable market and reducing a key pain point that drives customer churn to more technically advanced platforms.

Wix Functions empowers users to create customized business flows, automate pricing and checkout rules, and tailor app behavior

NEW YORK – Wix.com Ltd. (NASDAQ: WIX), the leading SaaS website builder platform globally1, today launched Wix Functions, a no-code interface that allows users to customize outcomes for various business scenarios, enabling businesses to operate more smoothly and effectively. With an intuitive visual function builder, businesses can define custom business logic, such as adding dynamic pricing rules, enforce checkout conditions, and tailor loyalty rewards, ensuring their operations adapt to their specific business needs.

With Wix Functions, users can define custom outcomes using conditions, variables, formulas, and dynamic values. Users can start from scratch or customize a template designed for a specific Wix app. By selecting input data from an app, such as cart and checkout details in Wix Stores, users can then apply the  logic to create conditions. The builder visually represents the logic, helping users understand how different criteria affect the function's output. For example, users can apply location-based fees, trigger a discount for returning customers in the checkout based on purchase history and implement custom form validations. The function then outputs the desired action, which the Wix app executes in real-time. This enhanced customizability of business flows is particularly beneficial as it allows users to implement more custom steps when rendering checkout or validating forms.

Wix Functions ensures that checkout, rewards, and other workflows wait for the function's output before proceeding. Users can choose from pre-built function templates or create custom rules from scratch. Functions are triggered by app activity, process the required logic, and return a result that immediately impacts the business flow—whether it's adjusting a fee, displaying a discount, or restricting a purchase.

“Wix Functions lets businesses extend and customize Wix apps to fit their unique needs—without writing a single line of code,” said Tomas Petras Rupšys, Head of Wix Functions at Wix. “Building on top of our new Automation builder, Wix Functions gives businesses even more control over their operations, enabling them to customize more workflows, further automate processes and implement advanced business rules. The function's output directly influences how the Wix app behaves in real-time, ensuring that businesses can seamlessly adapt their operations to meet unique needs, further empowering business owners to operate more efficiently and scale with ease.”

Wix Functions complements Wix Automations by enabling real-time customization, while automations manage ongoing tasks. Together, they provide a comprehensive suite of tools to help businesses automate and optimize their operations effortlessly.

Wix Functions is now available on Wix and Wix Studio for Wix Stores, Wix Bookings, Wix Restaurants, Wix Donations, Wix Forms, and Wix Loyalty Program, with free access and optional premium upgrades to access business solutions such as checkout and payments. Users can unlock unlimited actions through premium upgrades.

Golf Ireland is to launch a new campaign aimed at helping golfers and clubs fully understand the World Handicap System.

Ahead of this initiative, golfers across Ireland may already start noticing one change, as new options relating to Playing Handicap allowances become available to clubs, introducing greater flexibility to club competitions.

The measure, which gives clubs options to increase or decrease the Playing Handicap allowance in their competitions, is being rolled out following feedback from club officials and golfers, including through a tracking survey conducted by Golf Ireland in 2024.

While the options will be available from April 1, clubs will have ultimate discretion in whether they adopt a change – and may decide to retain the current Playing Handicap allowance for their club competitions. Likewise, a club may decide not to introduce a change immediately, but on another date following 1 April.

In singles counting competitions, the current 95% allowance for Playing Handicaps can be increased to 100%, or decreased to as low as 85%, at the club's discretion. In this regard, the measure responds to feedback Golf Ireland has received through its annual tracking survey which strongly suggests that golf clubs want additional options to address local issues they might have with the application of the WHS, and that in a number of cases clubs have found that lower handicappers are struggling to compete in club competitions – and in some cases playing less competitive golf at club level as a result. 

The change is being rolled out in Ireland with the agreement of the other Home Nations – England, Scotland and Wales – with a decision to follow ahead of the 2026 season on whether to roll it out across GB&I fully in 2026, potentially with additional options depending on feedback received.     

The option to amend the Playing Handicap allowance can also be applied to four-ball competitions.

Mark Wehrly, Championships & Rules Director of Golf Ireland, said: “The options which clubs will have from 1 April are being rolled out in response to two things we've heard fairly consistently – that clubs want more choice in how they apply the WHS within their club and that in a number of cases there is a concern that lower handicappers are struggling to be competitive in club competitions.

“We've looked at these concerns with an open mind and considered them in light of the data and guidance available to us, in close and detailed consultation with our colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales as well as with The R&A.”

This measure also comes during a period in which Golf Ireland has introduced a significant change to the handicap eligibility rules for inter-club competitions, which resulted in the adjustment of the Handicap Index of 159 players for eligibility purposes ahead of the 2025 season.

Wehrly continued: “We've done a considerable amount of work in sifting through the data, both in terms of club competitions but also in our own competitions, where we have acknowledged that a substantial number of rounds are played in non-counting formats and may therefore be contributing to concerns that some might raise about the fairness of handicapping in our inter-club competitions.

“We'll continue this data-driven approach, as well as kicking on with our annual handicap awareness campaign in the coming weeks, which will address a wide range of issues including player responsibilities and – in particular – addressing actions which give rise to handicap manipulation, another issue on which we've received plenty of engagement from clubs and golfers. We're also very grateful to be working with our colleagues in the other Home Nations, and with The R&A, on a joint communications campaign which will be rolled out over the coming months and which will reinforce these messages.”

The UK Golf Federation has announced that GolfBIC is returning in 2025 with two exciting events, the first of which, sponsored by inrange, takes place at the RAC Club, Pall Mall on Wednesday, 30th April

The PGA of GB&I has announced the first PGA Excel awardees of 2025, with four PGA Members achieving Advanced Fellow status and 12 others earning designations within the membership categories of Professional, Coach and Manager.

The Loop, the newly formed PR and Marcomms agency, has unveiled its initial client list of 18 social media influencers and creators which cover a wide range of content niches in the game.

Ramsey Solutions financial expert George Kamel weighs in on Americans working past retirement age and provides advice for investors.

It isn't always easy to save for retirement, in part because for many people it is so far away that there's no sense of urgency.

New research suggests a solution: Make the future feel closer.

"People struggle to save for the future, and part of the reason why is people struggle to connect with the future," says Katherine Christensen, an assistant marketing professor at Indiana University and the study's lead author. "We wondered, based on past research, if people felt more connected to their future selves, would they be more likely to save?"

After conducting and analyzing a series of 20 experiments to test this hypothesis, Christensen says the answer is yes.

The research found that when we think about the future, more than 80% of the time, we actually start off by thinking about the present. 

"What we did is essentially flip that," Christensen says. Start the thought process by imagining that future before you turn your thoughts back to the present and the savings goals you need to meet to make it happen.

THIS MIDWESTERN STATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO RETIRE, NEW STUDY SAYS: SEE THE LIST

While the difference is subtle, it has been shown to motivate people to save more. In one experiment carried out by the research team with more than 6,700 customers of a Swedish fintech company, people with low-balance savings accounts were 14% more likely to invest in a long-term savings product when they received a notification with language prompting them to think about the future first.

Hal Hershfield, professor of marketing, behavioral decision-making and psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the study's authors, says the prompts were designed with deliberately simple verbiage. "[We] had language along the lines of: ‘The year is 2034…rewind back to 2024 and consider saving for 2034 you,' " he says. 

While the research was tailored to give institutions like banks insights into how to make customers save more, Hershfield says individual savers can apply their findings using similar wording. 

"The key here is to start in the future and rewind back," Hershfield says, "rather than the traditional approach of only starting now and zooming ahead to the future."  

SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS TO INCREASE FOR PUBLIC PENSION RECIPIENTS

The authors of the new study based their hypothesis on earlier findings that people perceive trips to unfamiliar locations as lengthier than return trips of identical duration. In other words, we perceive traveling home as quicker than journeying to an unknown destination.

This cognitive quirk takes place because uncertainty creates mental distance, Christensen says. That is, people perceive the unfamiliar as being further away than the familiar. This "going home effect," as scientists call it, holds true for how we think about years as well as miles—which is where the connection to saving for future events or life stages comes in. 

POLITICS SHOULD BE DIVORCED FROM INVESTING

You're more likely to save for a future that feels imminent, Christensen says. "Since the present is more certain than the future, we're reducing the feeling of uncertainty" by anchoring subjects with a mental destination of familiar present-day reality, she says. "In our nudge, you basically move towards certainty."

Ben & Jerry's has said its chief executive, David Stever, was being removed by its parent company, Unilever, in a growing dispute over the ice cream company's political activism.

The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that says Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its "social mission".

Unilever did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. 

It comes a month after the ice cream company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump.

"Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission," the filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said. 

Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social issues since it was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.

It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

The ice cream maker was bought by Unilever in 2000 through a merger agreement that created an independent board tasked with protecting the ice cream brand's values and mission. 

But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank.

The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza.

In November, the ice cream company filed a lawsuit saying Unilever had tried to stop it from expressing support for Palestinian refugees.

Last month, in another court filing, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever had tried to ban it from publicly criticising Donald Trump.

Mr Stever has been with Ben & Jerry's since joining the firm in 1988 as a tour guide. He was appointed chief executive in 2023. 

Ben and Jerry's court filing said the decision to oust Mr Stever was made without any consultation, as required in the merger agreement between the two companies.

"Unilever...attempted to force the independent board into rubberstamping the decision," it added.

The Club Management Association of Europe (CMAE) has announced the launch of CMAE Scotland, marking an exciting new chapter for club management professionals in the region.

Formerly known as the Scottish Golf & Club Managers Association (SGCMA), the organisation recently voted with an outstanding majority at its Annual General Meeting to transition to CMAE Scotland, aligning itself more closely with the broader CMAE brand, while maintaining its strong regional identity.

CMAE Scotland will serve as the regional arm of the CMAE, dedicated to delivering high-quality education, professional development, and networking opportunities for club managers and industry professionals across Scotland. Through a series of regional educational events, workshops, and networking forums, CMAE Scotland will provide valuable support and resources to members, ensuring they stay at the forefront of best practices and industry trends.

“I am delighted to support the announcement of SGCMA's rebranding as CMAE Scotland, marking an exciting new chapter for club management professionals in the region,” said CMAE Commercial Director Craig Cotterill. “This evolution strengthens the collaboration between Scotland and the wider CMAE family, ensuring enhanced access to quality education, professional development, and broader networking opportunities.

“The commitment of the CMAE Scotland board has been instrumental in driving this progressive change, and I extend my sincere thanks for their vision and dedication in shaping a stronger future for their members. This step forward will not only benefit club managers in Scotland but also contribute to the ongoing growth and connectivity of CMAE professionals across the UK, Europe and MENA.”

David Addison, Chairman of CMAE Scotland, added: “We are delighted to rebrand SGCMA to CMAE Scotland and excited for what the future holds for our members. Becoming closer aligned with CMAE furthers our commitment to education, development and support to our club managers in Scotland.”

For more information about CMAE Scotland and upcoming events, contact Chris Spencer on secretary@cmae-scotland.uk and 07745 801501 or Claire Middleton at education@cmae-scotland.uk and 07808 079483.

A business that sits right at the entrance of the Sunriver Business Park thinks the newly announced and unique roundabouts coming to Sunriver are a "great idea." Deschutes County Road Department says the roundabouts are needed due to the congestion and safety issues that arise, especially on…

SUNRIVER, Ore. -- Sunriver is getting three new roundabouts and some locals say it's needed at one intersection in particular. Some of the designs for that location aren't ones drivers see all that often.

All three roundabout locations are on South Century Drive. Construction is already set for one standard roundabout at Huntington Road in July, but Deschutes County is asking for public input on the designs for the two others.

The largest project is planned at the intersection of South Century Drive and Venture Lane, which is right at the entrance to the Sunriver Business Park, and it comes with some unusual design suggestions.

Fly & Fields Outfitters in the business park overlooks the intersection.

"It's a great idea," Fly & Fields guide and retail manager Jordan Romney said. "This intersection is just not very controlled with the stoplight and the confusion of which way people are turning. Who has to stop where. We constantly see people almost in accidents, if not in accidents."

The intersection is also a road many use to drop off and pick up their kids from Three Rivers School. 

"That intersection, along with an adjacent intersection, internal to the business park doesn't function that well as a signalized intersection. They're way too close together. During school, pickup, drop off, during other times when there's a lot of business activity, there's safety and congestion issues," Deschutes County Road Department Director Chris Doty said.

Those adjacent intersections are just about 100 feet away from each other and form a sort of "I" shape. The section between the two intersections is narrow and creates a blind corner for drivers turning left out of the business park to get onto South Century Drive.

"It's not a typical solution, so it's going to take an atypical solution to solve those problems," Doty said.

The designs for the planned roundabout are unique, with the road department calling one of the concepts a "peanut," and the other a "teardrop." There's also a "barbell," which is two separate roundabouts, and a roundabout plus a turn lane.

Despite the potential impacts construction could bring to the foot traffic coming into the business park, Romney says he's not concerned.

"I think the people who want to come down here to shop for fishing goods or come see the tap house are going to come anyway. I think in the long run it's just gonna help traffic move better through this intersection," Romney said.

There is also a standard roundabout going in at the intersection of South Century Drive and Spring River Road. The two projects are currently estimated to cost $7 million.

An online open house is available through April 17 at this link. Viewers can see conceptual alternatives for the improvements at Venture Lane and Spring River Road, information on how it will improve traffic flow and a chance to provide feedback.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 12 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) stands against other best bitcoin stocks to invest in.

Bitcoin was the top-performing asset of 2024, driven by the launch of new ETFs and optimism about potential deregulation under a new US administration. However, the cryptocurrency remained volatile, with significant price swings throughout the year. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin had more than doubled in value from its starting price of around $40,000, reaching nearly $94,000, according to a report by CNBC. The most significant surge occurred in the weeks following the US presidential election. By mid-December, Bitcoin surpassed $108,000 for the first time, fueled by expectations that President Donald Trump's victory over former VP Kamala Harris would lead to clearer regulations and increased investment in the crypto space.

​​One of the main factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements is the halving mechanism, a fundamental feature of its network. Bitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism in the Bitcoin network that reduces the rewards miners receive for processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This event occurs roughly every four years, or after 210,000 blocks are mined, gradually slowing the introduction of new bitcoins into circulation. Its main purpose is to regulate Bitcoin's supply, ensuring it remains limited to a maximum of 21 million coins. Halving can influence Bitcoin's value by reducing the number of new coins entering the market. The first halving took place on November 28, 2012, cutting the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoins. This was followed by a significant price increase, a trend observed in later halvings. The most recent halving occurred on April 20, 2024, at block 740,000, reducing the reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, halvings have been linked to price increases as the reduced supply can boost demand. This scarcity strengthens Bitcoin's role as a digital store of value, often compared to gold. Additionally, market anticipation around halving events tends to drive investor interest and trading activity, further impacting Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin's growing influence is also reflected in broader financial markets and institutional investment trends. By the end of 2024, global investable assets surpassed $200 trillion, with cryptocurrencies accounting for over $3 trillion, or 1.5% of the market. Institutional investors increasingly embraced Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), with inflows surpassing $34 billion as Bitcoin gained wider acceptance in multi-asset portfolios. Bitcoin has solidified its status as both a benchmark for the crypto market and a measure of investor risk appetite. Its fixed supply and decentralized structure set it apart from traditional investments, making it an alternative growth asset in today's changing economic environment. This view is further supported by the US proposal to classify Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The proposal comes as the US faces rising debt and borrowing costs. President Trump's “America First” policies which combine tax cuts and tariffs could add to inflation concerns, which are already evident in bond markets, where 30-year yields neared 5% in early 2025.

Despite the cryptocurrency sector's volatility, some billionaire investors remain optimistic about its future. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of a leading business intelligence firm, was the top crypto billionaire gainer by percentage on Forbes‘ 2024 list. The software company he founded in the 1990s has since transformed into a major Bitcoin investment entity. By 2024, it held approximately 193,000 bitcoins, making it the largest corporate bitcoin holder globally, according to its CFO. Tech billionaire Mark Cuban is also investing in crypto. He believes its value could rise as adoption increases and it becomes more integrated into the global financial system. In fact, he has even speculated that it could one day replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.

To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of billionaires' stock holdings and picked the top 12 companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry with the highest number of billionaire investors in Q4 of 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors.

Global M2 money supply is at an all-time high — so why isn't Bitcoin surging? Is something broken, or is a delayed breakout coming?

Table of Contents

Markets are heading into the Federal Reserve's Mar. 18-19 meeting with mounting uncertainty as economic conditions remain volatile. Stock markets have stumbled, inflation remains persistent, and investors are reassessing their expectations for interest rate cuts.

Adding to the unpredictability, President Trump's tariff policies and federal layoffs have raised fresh concerns about the broader economic outlook, injecting further instability into an already fragile market.

Despite the turbulence, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25-4.5%, with CME Group's FedWatch tool assigning a 99% probability to no immediate adjustments.

However, the real focus is on the timing of the first rate cut. Current projections suggest a potential reduction in June, with a 55% chance that rates will move to 4-4.25%. 

Overall, investors anticipate a cumulative reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point in 2025, which could bring the Fed's benchmark rate down to 3.5-3.75%.

Amid this uncertainty, financial markets have responded sharply. The S&P 500 has dropped more than 8% from its Feb. 19 all-time high, while the Nasdaq plunged 4% on Mar. 10 — its worst trading day since 2022. 

Meanwhile, the volatility index has surged to its highest level since August, reflecting the difficulty investors face in maneuvering shifting policies, particularly Trump's tariff hikes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has also struggled to find its footing, remaining range-bound around $82,300 as of Mar. 18 — down nearly 25% from its all-time high of $109,114 in January.

The question now is: What comes next? How will markets react if the Fed signals a shift in policy? And what does all of this mean for crypto in the coming weeks?

Global liquidity is surging, and history suggests that risk assets like Bitcoin may soon react. As of Mar. 10, global M2 money supply reached an all-time high of $108.2 trillion, marking a 3.5% increase from its 2025 low of $104.5 trillion recorded on Jan. 6.

Yet, in this cycle, Bitcoin's price action has shown inconsistencies despite the rise in liquidity, raising questions about whether a delayed response is at play.

M2 money supply serves as a broad measure of global liquidity, encompassing cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money assets.

When M2 expands, liquidity typically finds its way into high-yielding investments, leading to rallies in stocks, commodities, and Bitcoin. Conversely, contractions in M2 often coincide with risk-off periods, where assets struggle to find upside momentum.

Keep an eye on changes in global liquidity – it's one of the most important long term factors driving Bitcoin.In fact, using data from 2013 to 2024, BTC has a 94% correlation with global M2. Now you know why so many people are begging for an end to QT & even a return of QE. pic.twitter.com/E27bkhS5Vx

A closer look at historical data highlights Bitcoin's strong correlation with M2 growth. Bitcoin's most significant bull runs have occurred during periods of rapid liquidity expansion, whereas downturns in M2 have preceded price declines or prolonged consolidations.

However, a key observation is that Bitcoin does not react immediately to liquidity surges. Research suggests an average lag of approximately 10 weeks before Bitcoin fully reflects changes in M2 growth.

The above M2 chart further supports this narrative. Bitcoin's recovery from its 2022-2023 lows coincided with a significant uptick in M2 growth. Similarly, in mid-2024, a renewed expansion in M2 was followed by Bitcoin reaching new highs.

However, in early 2025, Bitcoin entered a period of consolidation despite M2 continuing its ascent. The missing ingredient appears to be the rate of change in liquidity rather than its absolute level.

A deeper analysis of Bitcoin's year-on-year returns relative to the YoY change in M2 reveals a clearer pattern — Bitcoin's strongest bull runs tend to emerge when liquidity growth accelerates rapidly rather than when it remains steady.

Hence, mere liquidity expansion isn't enough to trigger a breakout — acceleration in M2 growth is the critical factor.

The Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) program, which has been running since June 2022, may be approaching its final stretch.

As of Mar. 18, over $6.2 million has been wagered on Polymarket, with traders assigning a 100% probability that the Fed will end QT by Apr. 30.

At its core, QT is the opposite of quantitative easing (QE). Instead of injecting liquidity into the system by purchasing bonds, the Fed has been allowing assets to mature off its balance sheet, effectively pulling money out of circulation.

This policy, alongside aggressive rate hikes, helped curb inflationary pressures but also created liquidity constraints that have weighed on markets. While stocks and crypto assets managed to rally despite QT's tightening effects, concerns have emerged that continued balance sheet reduction could drain liquidity at a time of rising economic uncertainty.

The minutes from the January FOMC meeting revealed that several policymakers were open to either slowing or pausing QT, largely due to uncertainties surrounding the federal debt ceiling and evolving money market conditions, Reuters reported.

Analysts note that the Treasury Department's extraordinary measures to keep government operations funded have been injecting temporary liquidity into the system. 

This has made it harder for the Fed to accurately assess true reserve levels, creating a risk that it could withdraw too much liquidity too quickly, increasing financial market volatility.

Despite rising expectations of a near-term end to QT, not all analysts agree on the timing.

Barclays maintains its projection that QT will conclude between September and October, arguing that pausing in March or May only to restart reductions later would be inefficient.

Meanwhile, Wrightson ICAP analysts believe the Fed is more likely to slow the pace of asset runoffs rather than halt them entirely, noting that a full stop could force the Fed to resume asset purchases later, creating communication challenges for policymakers.

Others, like research firm LH Meyer, caution that any pause in QT could risk turning into a full stop, as resuming the process later could prove difficult — especially if market conditions remain fragile.

The Fed's ability to gauge the right stopping point has been complicated by mixed signals from liquidity indicators.

A survey of major banks and money managers conducted before the last policy meeting suggested QT could conclude between June and July.

Fed holdings, which have already declined to $6.8 trillion from a peak of $9 trillion in 2022, are expected to fall further to around $6.4 trillion by the end of the process.

However, estimates suggest that bank reserves will only dip to $3.125 trillion from the current $3.3 trillion, while the Fed's reverse repo facility — a measure of excess liquidity — has remained below $100 billion throughout February, indicating that financial conditions may already be tighter than intended.

Historically, unwinding QT has been a delicate process, and if the Fed signals a stop in the coming months, it may effectively mark the end of the program.

If that happens, the implications could be broad—lower long-term interest rates, a weaker dollar, and potentially increased demand for risk assets like Bitcoin and equities.

While rising M2 money supply has been a strong precursor to Bitcoin bull runs, on-chain indicators and institutional developments suggest that the short-term outlook may not align with this trend just yet.

Despite global M2 reaching a record high, Bitcoin's price action has shown signs of exhaustion. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, warns that “every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” pointing to fresh liquidity drying up and new whales offloading BTC at lower prices.

His analysis, which applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to various metrics, suggests that Bitcoin's price may not immediately react to rising liquidity.

One of the key metrics is MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which compares Bitcoin's market value to the price at which coins last moved, helping to determine whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued.

Another critical metric is SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which measures whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a profit or a loss.

Additionally, NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) tracks the overall profitability of Bitcoin holders based on unrealized gains and losses across the network.

Based on these indicators, Bitcoin may be entering a 6–12 month consolidation phase — a pattern historically seen after major bull runs. 

If this holds true, Bitcoin's reaction to rising liquidity could be delayed rather than immediate, mirroring previous cycles where liquidity expansions took months to translate into bullish price action.

At the same time, institutional headwinds are mounting. The U.S. recently adopted a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, marking a key shift in how the government views Bitcoin as an asset.

However, this move has not been well received by global financial institutions. Max Keiser, a longtime Bitcoin advocate and senior Bitcoin advisor to El Salvador's government, notes that the IMF and credit rating agencies have begun lowering the U.S. credit rating, citing Bitcoin's “destabilizing influence.”

The IMF (and various credit rating agencies) are lowering US credit rating citing the destabilizing influence of Bitcoin. They recommend the US to immediately liquidate their BSR (Bitcoin Strategic Reserve).

Keiser adds that the IMF is now recommending the immediate liquidation of the BSR, raising concerns about potential political pressure on the U.S. Bitcoin holdings.

If the U.S. government begins selling its Bitcoin reserves under such pressures, it could introduce additional downward momentum, at least in the short term.

Investors should remain cautious of near-term volatility while closely monitoring liquidity trends and government actions. Bitcoin's movement in the coming months may require patience before the next major move takes shape. 

Trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Key Takeaways:

As investment products surrounding crypto-assets see a global surge and Japan embraces a new regulatory environment, South Korea is considering its next steps towards Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Now, South Korea is reportedly monitoring its neighbor closely. Traders speculate that Seoul is likely to follow Tokyo's decision on crypto ETFs.

Japan, which had been extremely skeptical of digital assets, is now contemplating a major policy overhaul. In February, Nikkei reported the FSA is considering designating cryptocurrencies as financial products alongside traditional securities, and possibly allow crypto ETFs.

News of the potential policy change is drawing attention across Asia. Japan's move is reportedly influencing South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which has shared its analysis of Japan's legislative trends on digital assets with relevant institutions in South Korea. This indicates a significant level of interest in Japan's policy changes. Given the close economic and financial ties between the two nations, it is not surprising that South Korea is closely monitoring Japan's next move. Historical patterns suggest that South Korea often aligns its financial policies with major regional players to ensure competitiveness and market stability.

Japan's talks are expected to drag into the first half of 2025 before a legislative plan is drafted and submitted to the National Assembly in 2026, but even the mention of them is enough to rouse debate in South Korea.

Amid the excitement, South Korea is keeping its guard up. “I have continued to say that I would carefully review (spot Bitcoin ETFs), and it is similar in the broader context. There are countries that have not yet introduced it. There are England and Japan,” Kim So-young, vice chairman of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, said after a virtual asset committee. Some nations, such as England and Japan, have yet to introduce this.

Of course, there's South Korea's track record with strict crypto regulations. In the meantime, last year, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) imposed restrictions on asset managers offering ETFs linked to crypto-related companies, such as Coinbase. This more cautious stance is somewhat in line with South Korea overall's outlook on cryptocurrency, which has seen both excitement from the public and skepticism from officialdom.



Regulatory headwinds in South Korea are still amajor hurdle. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju likened South Korea's cautious approach to crypto regulation to that of the US SEC, where Gary Gensler stalled the approval of crypto ETFs for a decade until 2024.

The government has thus to walk a tightrope between encouraging innovators and protecting asset owners, with more than 30% of South Korean citizens investing in crypto assets. While it offers potential risks, regulators are carefully evaluating the impact of a volatile crypto market.

The Financial Services Commission previously announced that the universities and charities will be able to sell cryptocurrency donations starting from the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was also served with a suspension notice for possible Know Your Customer violations. Upbit has apparently also lodged a complaint against South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit to rescind the business penalties. It illustrates an ongoing struggle to gain control of the industry.

To revive its capital markets, South Korea's Exchange Chairman, Eun-Bo Jeong, is keen on launching crypto-based ETFs this year.

South Korea's financial markets lagged global peers as the domestic economy was contracting and export growth had been slowing, Jeong pointed out. The soaring success of Bitcoin ETFs worldwide has led to a quest for solutions to these challenges, including cryptocurrency-based ETFs.

South Korea is at a crossroads. While pushing an ETF has proven to be an uphill battle, the global momentum behind Bitcoin ETFs and potential regulatory changes in Japan have pressured Seoul to reconsider its stance. It is worth noting just how influential other countries' decision-making processes are within the South Korean government. Other countries have significantly influenced various sectors of the South Korean economy. For instance, many believe that the early development of South Korea's auto industry was shaped by the American auto sector.

 To start accepting BTC payments, small businesses can use a crypto payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions and ensure compliance.  

And it's not just a rehash of old news. For years, you might have seen luxury brands like Gucci and telecommunications companies like AT&T accepting Bitcoin. But today, crypto payments are much more than an easy bit of PR — they're seamlessly integrating into e-commerce, hospitality, travel and even your neighborhood coffee shop.

What started as a niche trend in the early 2010s has accelerated over the years. As of 2025, over 659 million people worldwide — roughly 1 in 13 individuals — are using cryptocurrency. Moreover, approximately 15,000 businesses globally accept Bitcoin (BTC), including around 2,300 in the United States.



While there are considerations to keep in mind, many view accepting BTC and other cryptocurrencies, even as a small business, as a win-win. The benefits often outweigh any challenges, with minimal downsides and significant potential rewards.

The following sections explore the whos, the whys and the hows.

As briefly touched upon, it's not only niche crypto-specific sectors that are accepting Bitcoin payments. Here are some sectors that you might not have considered, with accompanying case studies.

Did you know? The first-ever real-world transaction using Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Today, those 10,000 BTC would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, making it one of the most expensive pizza orders in history. This event is now celebrated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day in the crypto community.

So, all the big brands are in. But what's driving this trend, and can small businesses benefit, too?

One of the most significant advantages is lower transaction fees. Traditional payment processors and credit card companies typically charge businesses between 2% and 4% per transaction, while crypto payment gateways often reduce this to less than 1%. For businesses processing high volumes of transactions, these savings can be substantial.

Another key factor is the ability to access a global market without the restrictions of currency exchange rates and international banking fees. Cryptocurrency payments enable seamless cross-border transactions, allowing businesses to serve international customers without friction. This is especially beneficial for industries like travel, luxury goods and digital services, where cross-border commerce is common.

Security and fraud prevention also play a role. Cryptocurrency transactions are final, eliminating chargebacks — something that costs businesses billions of dollars annually in fraudulent disputes. This makes crypto payments particularly appealing to merchants in industries where chargebacks are common, such as e-commerce and online services.

Did you know? In 2025, chargeback fraud, particularly friendly fraud, has become a significant concern for merchants. Notably, a recent survey revealed that 55% of Generation Z and 49% of Millennials earning over $100,000 annually admitted to engaging in digital shoplifting — a form of first-party fraud where consumers falsely claim issues with online orders to secure refunds or avoid payments. 

Additionally, businesses recognize that accepting cryptocurrency aligns with the preferences of a growing demographic of crypto users. Companies integrating crypto payments position themselves as forward-thinking and innovative, appealing to solvent, tech-savvy consumers who prefer digital transactions over traditional banking systems.

Finally, some businesses are drawn to the potential of holding crypto as an asset. While many use payment processors that instantly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency to avoid volatility, others see it as an opportunity to gain exposure to a growing asset class. With major corporations like Tesla and MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, smaller businesses are following suit, recognizing the potential long-term value.

Small businesses stand to benefit the most here, as accepting crypto payments is an easy way to carve out a niche for the brand, reaching far more customers than would be possible by offering only fiat payments. The strategy might well mean the difference between failure and success in a competitive startup environment.



Did you know? A survey by Deloitte found that 85% of merchants see crypto payments as a way to reach new customers.

While accepting crypto payments is often seen as a win-win, businesses must also be aware of potential risks in doing so on their own, without proper accounting systems and crypto processing partners.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are known for significant price fluctuations. For example, in early 2025, Bitcoin's price dropped from $109,071 to around $80,000 — a nearly 25% decline within a short period. Such volatility can impact the value of received payments if not promptly converted to stable currencies.

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies by jurisdiction and is continually evolving. For example, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, which introduces complexities in tax reporting and compliance. Businesses must stay informed about applicable regulations to ensure adherence to tax obligations and avoid potential legal issues.

Accepting cryptocurrencies necessitates the use of digital wallets and exchanges, which can be susceptible to cybersecurity threats.Without robust security measures, businesses risk unauthorized access and theft of digital assets. Implementing strong cybersecurity protocols is essential.

Integrating cryptocurrency payment systems requires technical knowledge that some small business owners may lack. Establishing digital wallets and navigating digital currency exchanges can be challenging, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies or errors. Investing in employee training or consulting with experts may be necessary to overcome these hurdles.

Despite growing adoption, cryptocurrencies are not universally accepted or understood. Some customers may be hesitant to use digital currencies due to concerns about security or unfamiliarity, potentially limiting the perceived benefits of offering crypto payment options. Businesses should assess their customer base to determine if accepting cryptocurrencies aligns with their clientele's preferences.

It's unlikely that, as a small business, you'll take this road alone — especially when leading crypto payment processors offer zero up-front integration costs:



The next section will explore a number of crypto processing providers that you may wish to choose from as a small business.

Founded in 2011, BitPay is a pioneering cryptocurrency payment processor. As of 2024, it holds a 6.26% market share in the Bitcoin payment processing sector, serving over 523 customers. 

BitPay caters to a diverse clientele, including retailers, investment banking firms, and nonprofit organizations. The company offers direct crypto-to-fiat settlements, helping businesses avoid volatility while ensuring seamless integration with existing accounting systems. 

Its security infrastructure includes two-factor authentication (2FA) and encrypted transactions, making it a trusted option for enterprises looking to accept cryptocurrency payments.

Established in 2014, CoinsPaid has grown into a comprehensive crypto payment gateway, processing over 41 million transactions worth 23 billion euros. The company facilitates approximately 8% of all onchain Bitcoin transactions, making it a major player in the crypto payments sector. 

Supporting over 30 cryptocurrencies, CoinsPaid serves industries such as IT, marketing, financial services, real estate and gambling. The platform offers a business wallet, an over-the-counter (OTC) desk for large-volume transactions and software-as-a-service solutions tailored for crypto integration. 

CoinsPaid is licensed in Estonia and complies with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations while undergoing regular independent security audits to maintain its reputation for secure and compliant processing.

Launched in 2018 by Coinbase, Coinbase Commerce enables merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet. It provides seamless integration with major e-commerce platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce, allowing businesses to accept ETH, Litecoin (LTC) and USDC (USDC). 

Notably, in February 2024, Coinbase Commerce ended support for Bitcoin and other unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based coins. To make Bitcoin payments, users will need a Coinbase account. The decision comes as Coinbase faces challenges in implementing updates to its Ethereum Virtual Machine payment protocol for Bitcoin.

While specific market share data is limited, Coinbase Commerce is widely used by small to mid-sized businesses across sectors such as computer software, utilities and telecommunications. 

The platform offers a straightforward setup with no transaction fees apart from standard network costs, making it an attractive option for businesses looking for a simple crypto payment solution without intermediaries.

Binance Pay, introduced by Binance, is a cryptocurrency payment solution that enables merchants and users to conduct transactions using various cryptocurrencies. It supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH and BNB (BNB), allowing for versatile payment options. 

The platform offers zero transaction fees for both merchants and users, making it an attractive option for businesses aiming to integrate crypto payments without incurring additional costs. Binance Pay also emphasizes security by incorporating features such as 2FA and encrypted transactions, ensuring safe and reliable payment processing.



Despite a run-in with the Lazarus Group last year, CoinsPaid continues to operate as a major crypto payment gateway, maintaining competitive setup costs and fees. As such, this section will walk you through the steps you'd be expected to take when integrating any crypto payment processor, using CoinsPaid's flow as an example.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate CoinsPaid into your business, offering your customers the option to pay with cryptocurrencies. 

With lower transaction fees, access to a global customer base and protection from chargebacks, crypto payments provide clear advantages over traditional payment methods.

The risks associated with crypto payments — such as volatility, regulatory compliance and security concerns — are easily mitigated by using a trusted payment processor like CoinsPaid, BitPay or Coinbase Commerce. These platforms handle everything from instant fiat conversion to security and compliance, making the transition to crypto seamless and low-risk.

With major brands already embracing digital currencies, there's no reason for small and medium-sized businesses to be left behind. Crypto payments are fast, borderless and cost-effective, making them a no-brainer for any forward-thinking business. 

Whether you're a startup looking to gain a competitive edge or an established company seeking new revenue streams, integrating cryptocurrency payments is an investment in the future.

 BTC price pressures are everywhere as risk-asset traders wait for what they hope will be hints of positivity from the US Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell. 

Bitcoin (BTC) passed $84,000 into the March 19 Wall Street open as markets geared up for the US Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed local highs of $84,358 on Bitstamp.

The nature of subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell was of more concern to traders. Already hawkish, Powell faces pressure from US trade tariffs as inflation markets only just begin to fall.

“Tonight's FOMC meeting is highly likely hold rates steady. However, we will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers on the day. 

While holding above $80,000 throughout the week, Bitcoin's fate hung in the balance as US stocks saw notable downside.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index traded down 4% and 8.7% year-to-date at the time of writing compared to 10% for BTC/USD.

“TC has found some support at the $80k, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” QCP continued.

Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter identified a potential silver lining in the form of increasing equities allocation by US retail investors.

“Retail net inflows into Nasdaq 100 index stocks as a percentage of market cap have reached 0.1%, the highest in at least a year. Retail flows have DOUBLED in just a few weeks,” it wrote in a post on X.

Analyzing BTC price action, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital hoped that the upside gap in CME's Bitcoin futures market would be fully “filled” with a spike to $87,000.

Such gaps, as Cointelegraph reported, continue to act as short-term price magnets.

“Bitcoin continues to successfully retest the CME Gap as support (orange box, $78k-$80.7k),” Rekt Capital explained alongside an illustrative chart.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, meanwhile suggested that a dovish Powell could have a clear impact on price momentum.

“A dovish tone that reduces recessionary fears could send Bitcoin price above the 200-Day and 21-Day MAs, and avert what seemed like an imminent death cross between those two key MAs,” part of an X post stated.

Alan referred to two nearby simple moving averages, with the 200-day and 21-day MA sitting at $84,995 and $84,350, respectively.

Bad news, on the other hand, could spark a retest of multimonth lows at $76,000, he warned.

 Investor sentiment hinges on the FOMC meeting and Fed Chair Powell's signals, which may sway Bitcoin's next price move, according to crypto analysts. 

Bitcoin may stage a recovery above the key $90,000 psychological mark amid easing monetary inflation concerns in the world's largest economy.

Bitcoin's (BTC) over-two-month downtrend has raised numerous alarms that the current Bitcoin bull cycle may be over, defying the theory of the four-year market cycle.

Despite widespread investor concerns, Bitcoin may be on track to a recovery above $90,000 due to easing inflation concerns in the United States, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research.

“We can see some counter-trend rally as prices are oversold, and there is a good chance that the Fed is mildly dovish,” Thielen told Cointelegraph, adding:

Investor confidence may also be improved by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments indicating that the Fed will “remain on hold amid rising uncertainty among households and businesses,” wrote 10x Research in a March 17 X post, adding:

Meanwhile, investors are eagerly awaiting today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting for cues on the Fed's monetary policy for the rest of 2025, a development that may impact investor appetite for risk assets such as Bitcoin.

Traders and investors will be watching for any hints about the ending of the Fed's quantitative easing (QT) program, “a move that could boost liquidity and risk assets,” according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at Nexo digital asset investment platform.

“The upcoming Fed decision could be a major catalyst for further movements,” the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“However, persistent inflation concerns or a reaffirmation of tight financial conditions, such as elevated interest rates or continued liquidity tightening, could limit upside potential,” added the analyst.

Markets are currently pricing in a 99% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Still, investors have slashed their exposure to US equities by the most on record by 40 percentage points between February and March, according to Bank of America's latest survey, raising concerns that recession fears may hurt Bitcoin's price action.

The Bitcoin price was placid early Wednesday after the Bank of Japan decided "by unanimous vote" to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.5%.  Now, traders are waiting to see if the Federal Reserve will do the same.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver his remarks today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin had gained 1.7% on the day and was changing hands for roughly $83,765, according to CoinGecko data.

But it's still the case that not much BTC is changing hands at all. Trading volume over the past 24 hours was $25 billion—a far cry from the $42 billion daily volume average it saw last week.

Users of decentralized prediction market MYRIAD, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are confident that Bitcoin will manage to maintain this price level through the weekend—with over 68% expecting that Bitcoin will still be above $83,000 by the end of the week, up from 52% at the start of the day.

Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has lost 2 points since yesterday, leaving it stuck in "Fear." It had been coasting along in "Neutral" territory as recently as last month. Since the start of the year, the index—which ranges from 0 for extreme fear to 100 for extreme greed—has reached as high as 84 two days after President Donald Trump's inauguration. But it's experienced a bumpy descent since then as geopolitical tensions and global trade tirades have plagued markets.

Traders are waiting to see whether Powell will offer any hope of a rate cut later this year. They seem to have already given up hope that he will announce a surprise rate cut later today, with 99% of traders expecting the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

But BRN analyst Valentin Fournier thinks they're looking to DC for a different reason—and perhaps, with more optimism.

"The dominant narrative driving this cycle is Bitcoin accumulation at a national level," he wrote in a market note Wednesday. "While immediate actions are awaited, their potential impact is expected to be sudden and significant."

This comes after Bo Hines, executive director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, told several participants at a closed-door roundtable hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute on last week that the White House is intent on acquiring as much Bitcoin as it can.

An analyst from multinational bank Standard Chartered believes that crypto exchange Coinbase “proactively sold” 12,652 Ethereum (approximately $37 million) throughout Q4 2024. They explained that Coinbase's layer-2 network Base drives demand for Ethereum but the company's profit taking is hurting the underlying blockchain's price action.

Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000 earlier this week. At the time, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the bank, claimed that layer-2 network Base had removed $50 billion from ETH's market cap—now, he's saying this is because of profit taking.

“My view is that increased activity on Base increases demand for ETH in the first instance,” Kendrick shared with Decrypt. “But then all of Base's profits (which are circa 80% of all Base revenue) are sold (ETH-USD selling) to effectively repatriate profits back to Coinbase.”

To back up his claim, the analyst points to Coinbase's quarterly Ethereum holdings for investments and operations which Kendrick then subtracted from the Base profits.

“This tells me that in Q4 2024 Coinbase proactively sold 12,652 ETH,” he explained. “Over the 3 quarters the net proactive selling was 1,558 ETH. So while there are only 3 quarters of relevant post-Dencun data so far, I think we can conclude that Coinbase is not in the business of HODLing Base's ETH profits.”

Taking the average price in Q4 2024, using the quarter's open and close, this works out to approximately $37.68 million sold by Coinbase.

Ethereum's Decun upgrade went live in March of last year and significantly reduced the gas fees on layer-2 networks. Since then, the analyst believes, Coinbase has shown its intention to sell as part of a “normal risk adjusted decision process.”

A spokesperson for Coinbase told Decrypt that Base, "earns ETH from sequencer fees, and the ETH we earn is primarily held for long term investment or used for operational expenses, including tax liabilities and reinvesting in growth via things like salaries, grants, acquisitions, and public goods funding."

They added that, "Separately, we also hold some ETH for long-term investment, and Coinbase reports our crypto assets specifically held for long -erm investment as part of our public quarterly earnings filing." Citing the firm's 10K, the spokesperson noted that, "crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term...we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them," adding that, "Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024."

In the Standard Chartered analyst's note from earlier in the week, he argued that making transactions via layer-2 networks negatively impacts the underlying blockchain because Ethereum receives less fees overall. In turn, this lowers the “GDP” of the Ethereum blockchain and the amount of gas fees it collects from transactions, meaning the Foundation mints more new coins to pay expenses.

Created by Coinbase, Base is a layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum that aims to help extend the capabilities of the underlying blockchain, as well as offering a bridge off of the popular centralized exchange.

The Standard Chartered analyst believes that looking at Coinbase's Ethereum holdings over the past three quarters reveals even more about its goals as a company.

“The fact they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick added.

Despite Standard Chartered's target price for Ethereum being slashed, the cryptocurrency is up 5.6% on the day and 4.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko, while Bitcoin has traded mostly flat during the same time.

As a result, over 70% of users on decentralized prediction market MYRIAD—launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN—believe that Ethereum's relative price to Bitcoin will be above $0.023 by the end of the week.

Oops, something went wrong

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech National Bank board member Jan Kubicek is "sceptical" about the inclusion of bitcoin among the bank's hefty reserves, wary of legal uncertainties and concerns around volatility of the digital currency.

CNB Governor Ales Michl put bitcoin up for consideration earlier this year, and the bank has begun an analysis looking into broadening the asset classes it holds in its reserves portfolio.

"We will assess different classes of assets. Bitcoin is just one of them," Kubicek said in an interview on Tuesday. "My position is rather sceptical about bitcoin."

He said bitcoin's legal status was one concern, and that direct ownership would mean developing many new processes in accounting or auditing, for example.

Volatility was another worry and assessing market price developments was difficult, he said.

"We cannot be certain that bitcoin's volatility in the coming years will mirror the patterns observed over the past decade because I suspect that, if more institutional investors accept bitcoin as an investment asset, it will start to behave differently from what we have seen so far."

The bank's study on new asset classes could come by October, Kubicek said.

Holdings of international corporate bonds could be explored, he said, as well as the possibility of investing in more targeted equity indices, such as for technology, and property investment funds.

CNB Vice Governor Eva Zamrazilova has said bitcoin is not a suitable asset for reserves, while European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde has also said Europe's central banks are not the place for it.

The Czech central bank's reserves - at 142.8 billion euros ($155.75 billion) - are around 45% of gross domestic product, and it has diversified holdings in recent years, gradually purchasing gold, and shifting a larger portion of the portfolio into equities.

($1 = 0.9168 euros)

Ether (ETH) zoomed nearly 7% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among majors as traders await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.

ETH's gains were coupled with a 4% gain in memecoin dogecoin (DOGE), which historically tends to act correlated to the asset's movements. Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.

Elsewhere, majors XRP, BNB Chain's BNB, Solana's SOL and Cardano's ADA rose 3%. Tron's TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a no-fee update in the Sunpump platform.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.

The widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.

Ether rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).

Testing began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.

“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won't attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”

“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.

Meanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.

“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its "digital gold" role,” Lee added.

The adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors has accelerated in recent years, reshaping the financial landscape. Institutions, including banks, hedge funds, and asset managers, are engaging in crypto institutional lending, a process where institutions lend out their idle crypto assets through specialized platforms to earn interest, facilitating liquidity and capital efficiency in the market. This enables capital efficiency, liquidity provisioning, and yield generation. Alongside lending, they are also participating in trading and custody services. This shift is driven by various factors, such as regulatory clarity, market maturity, and technological advancements.

One of the catalysts for institutions' adoption of digital asset is the establishment of clear regulatory guidelines. Governments and financial authorities worldwide are developing frameworks that facilitate compliance and risk management. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Union's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations aim to provide legal clarity, reducing uncertainties for institutional investors. Regulatory compliance in crypto ensures transparency, security, and legitimacy, encouraging large-scale participation.

The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, offering institutions robust trading platforms, liquidity solutions, and reliable price discovery mechanisms. The emergence of crypto institutional trading platforms provides secure and regulated environments for institutional investors to engage in digital asset markets. Moreover, enhanced liquidity and sophisticated risk management tools have reduced volatility concerns, making crypto a more attractive asset class.

A key barrier to institutional investment in crypto has been the security of digital assets. The development of institutional-grade custody services, provided by reliable firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, has significantly reduced these risks. These solutions offer secure, insured, and compliant storage for digital assets, allowing institutions to manage large crypto holdings safely.

Traditional banks have started integrating blockchain technology for institutions, leveraging its benefits for efficiency, security, and cost reduction. Some notable examples include:

The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions has facilitated institutional access to cryptocurrencies without requiring direct ownership. These financial instruments have bolstered crypto market growth, attracting institutional investors looking for regulated and easily accessible investment tools.

As mentioned earlier, secure custody solutions tailored for institutions have significantly improved the landscape. By addressing security concerns, these custody services have enabled hedge funds, asset managers, and banks to participate in the crypto space more confidently.

The tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, stocks, and bonds, is revolutionizing financial markets. By leveraging enterprise blockchain solutions, institutions can enhance liquidity, reduce settlement times, and provide fractional ownership opportunities. Companies like BlackRock and HSBC are exploring tokenization to improve efficiency and accessibility in traditional finance.

The rise of decentralized finance solutions for institutions, increasing corporate treasuries' crypto allocations, and partnerships between fintech firms and traditional banks indicate a strong institutional commitment to the crypto ecosystem. These institutional crypto trends highlight the continued integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.

North Carolina has joined over a dozen other states in pursuing the creation of a state Bitcoin reserve, introducing a bill on Tuesday to position the state as a “leader in state-level cryptocurrency adoption.”

Senate Bill 327 (SB327) calls for North Carolina's State Treasurer to allocate up to 10% of public funds to Bitcoin.

Introduced by Republican Senators Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash, and Timothy Moffitt—the bill envisions Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina's economic standing.

Under SB327, the Treasurer should ensure Bitcoin will be stored in multi-signature cold storage and subject to monthly audits for transparency and security.

The bill enforces strict controls on the use of Bitcoin, limiting liquidation only to instances of a “severe financial crisis” and requiring approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly for any sale.

It further mandates the creation of a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board, tasked with providing ongoing guidance on the reserve's management.

The three senators also included the possibility of Bitcoin mining operations in the bill as a way to increase the state's holdings at a lower cost.

Any sale of Bitcoin holdings will require the approval of at least two-thirds of both chambers of the General Assembly, says the bill.

SB327 authorizes the State Treasurer to engage in Bitcoin-backed investment strategies, including staking, lending, and other regulated yield-generating activities.

The introduction of SB327 is part of a larger push in North Carolina to incorporate crypto into state policy.

Alongside SB327, the state's lawmakers recently proposed House Bill 92 (HB 92), to allow the State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs).

HB92 proposes to allocate up to 10% of public funds and retirement systems into these ETPs, which must track digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $750 billion over the past twelve months, with the only asset fitting the criteria being Bitcoin.

The state-level push for Bitcoin as a reserve asset comes as President Donald Trump unveiled plans earlier this month for a national Bitcoin reserve, aiming to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world.”

Several states are already in the race, but a few others have rejected such proposals at the outset.

Arizona is currently one of the frontrunners in this movement, with three Bitcoin reserve bills under discussion.

On Tuesday, the state's Bitcoin 'Legal Tender' Bill SB1062 passed the House Commerce Committee by a vote of 6 - 4.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Senate Bill 21 (SB21) seeks to establish a state-managed investment fund dedicated to Bitcoin and other high-market-cap cryptos.

Utah was initially poised to become the first U.S. state to establish a Bitcoin reserve, but its bill, HB230, underwent significant amendments.

While the bill still provides protections for Bitcoin custody and mining, the provision for a state-managed Bitcoin reserve was removed in the final stages of the legislative process.

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal-Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin, Boxford Police said in a news release.

The bitcoin (BTC) price showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Wednesday, a decision that aligned with market expectations, as policymakers assessed the potential impact of U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump on Japan's export-driven economy.

The BOJ highlighted “high uncertainties” surrounding trade policies, with Governor Kazuo Ueda emphasizing the need to monitor how the tariff plans could ripple through global and Japanese markets.

The decision comes ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, where rates are also expected to remain steady as Trump's tariff policies loom large.

Japan's monetary policy and bond yields have often influenced BTC markets. A stronger yen and rising yields tend to weigh on bitcoin by attracting capital to traditional assets while a stable or weaker yen supports the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative store of value.

 That said, when the bank raised rates in January, the bitcoin price held steady because attention was focused on potential policy developments under Donald Trump's residency.

Wednesday's rate decision keeps Japanese bond yields in check, limiting pressure on bitcoin's price.

A Bitcoin bill has been presented to the Minnesota state senate that proposes allowing investments in Bitcoin and promotes cryptocurrency use in certain areas.

In a March 18 statement, Senator Jeremy Miller, who introduced the bill, said the Minnesota Bitcoin Act (SF2661) aims to modernize the state's financial landscape and position Minnesota as a leader in digital assets.

Under SF 26661, the Minnesota State Board of Investment would be allowed to allocate state funds to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, treating them similarly to traditional investments like stocks and bonds.

Further, state employees will have the option to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their retirement plans.

The legislation would also allow residents to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin, following in the footsteps of states like Colorado and Utah. 

Additionally, the bill includes tax incentives for cryptocurrency earnings, allowing certain gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be subtracted from taxable income.

“I believe global digital currencies are here to stay, and it's inevitable that they become more and more mainstream,” Miller said.

According to him, cryptocurrencies would benefit Minnesota by providing “new financial opportunities” and giving the state a “strategic position to take advantage of being on the forefront of this digital revolution.

“Crypto is a versatile digital asset that can be used in multiple ways, including as investments, global currency, or a hedge against inflation,” he added.

Minnesota follows over a dozen other U.S. states that are mulling state cryptocurrency investments. Some states like Arizona and Texas have introduced multiple bills.

On March 11, Texas state lawmakers presented House Bill 4258, which allows Texas' chief accountant and financial watchdog to invest up to $250 million of the state's economic stabilization fund balance in Bitcoin or other kinds of crypto assets.

The following day, Senator Cynthia Lummis presented an updated version of her July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which allows the government to hold more than 1 million Bitcoins.

 Several crypto executives have told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is moving as expected given macro conditions, with the market just waiting for a new narrative. 

Bitcoin's correction from its January peak is a typical cycle pullback and is not out of the ordinary, with a price top still on the horizon, crypto analysts and executives tell Cointelegraph.

“I don't think the bull run is over; I think the peak of the cycle has been pushed back due to macro conditions, and global liquidity isn't pretty, which isn't helping crypto,” Collective Shift CEO Ben Simpson told Cointelegraph.

“It is only the third or fourth correction we've had over 25% we've had in Bitcoin this cycle compared to 12 last cycle,” Simpson said. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 24% from its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 amid uncertainty around US President Donald Trump's tariffs and the future of US interest rates, but Simpson called it “a normal correction.”

“Things got overheated, and they needed to cool down, and the market needed to find a new foundation, and now we're waiting for the next new narrative,” he said.

Derive founder Nick Forster shared a similar view, telling Cointelegraph that Bitcoin “is likely in a normal correction phase, with the cycle peak still to come.” 

“Historically, Bitcoin experiences these types of corrections during long-term rallies, and there's no reason to believe this time is different,” he said.

After Trump's election in November, Bitcoin surged almost 36% over a month, hitting $100,000 for the first time in December. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $82,824, according to CoinMarketCap.

However, Forster added that the six-month fate of Bitcoin seems increasingly tied to traditional markets. Similarly, Independent Reserve CEO Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph that it isn't just Bitcoin being impacted by the macroeconomic conditions.

“This is pervading all asset classes and may lead to a spike in global inflation and a contraction in international growth,” Przelozny said.

Forster said Bitcoin's current price trend aligns with past behavior before a price rally, even though it appears “tumultuous” at the moment.

Collective Shift's Simpson said the next narrative will likely revolve around US rate cuts, easing quantitative tightening, and increasing global liquidity.

However, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said he isn't so sure if the Bitcoin bull run is over or not.

The odds are “50:50, in my opinion,” Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“Yes, from an onchain perspective at present, but that could change quickly if the Fed starts easing in the second half of the year, stops balance sheet reduction, and dollar liquidity grows as a result, which I think has decent odds of happening,” Edwards explained.

The comments come a day after CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju declared that the “Bitcoin bull cycle is over.”

“Expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action,” Ju said.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) prices face resistance around their key levels; a firm close above indicates recovery on the cards, while Ethereum (ETH) price finds support at its critical level, suggesting a bounce ahead.

Bitcoin price has faced resistance around the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,496 since Friday and trades below it. This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the Bitcoin price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.

If bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

Ethereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.

If XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC will drop its appeal against Ripple. The victory follows rumors of Ripple's lawyers negotiating more favorable terms than the company got in Judge Torres' ruling last August.

Dogecoin price hovers around $0.168 on Wednesday after bouncing off its 200-week EMA last week. Santiment's data shows that DOGE's utility and whale wallets are rising, hinting at a potential rally for the dog-themed memecoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $83,300 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing resistance around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,500 since last week, with a break above this level suggesting a potential recovery. 

XRP open interest and funding rates have remained largely negative in recent weeks. Investors remained calm despite the high bearish sentiment in the futures market, likely due to their large profits.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

 Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller has made his state the latest to float investing in Bitcoin after he went “from being highly skeptical” to a crypto believer. 

Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller has introduced the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, which he drafted after completely changing his stance on Bitcoin.

“As I do more research on cryptocurrency and hear from more and more constituents, I've gone from being highly skeptical to learning more about it, to believing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Miller said in a March 18 statement.

Miller said the bill aims to “promote prosperity” for Minnesotans by allowing the Minnesota State Board of Investment to invest state assets in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, just as it invests in traditional assets.

Several other US states have introduced similar Bitcoin-buying bills, with 23 states having introduced legislation to create a Bitcoin reserve, according to Bitcoin Laws.

Under Miller's bill, Minnesota state employees would be able to add Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their retirement accounts.

It would also give residents the option to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin. Colorado and Utah already accept crypto for tax payments, while Louisiana allows it for state services.

Investment gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would also be exempt from state income taxes. In the US, up to $10,000 paid to the state can be deducted from federal taxes under the state and local tax deduction, but any amount beyond that is subject to both state and federal tax obligations.

The increasing number of US states proposing Bitcoin reserve bills follows Senator Cynthia Lummis' July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which directs the federal government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years, totaling 1 million Bitcoin.

However, on March 12, Lummis proposed a newly reintroduced BITCOIN Act, allowing the government to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin as part of its newly established reserve.

Bitcoin has shown significant gains compared to traditional assets in recent years. From August 2011 to January 2025, Bitcoin posted a compound annual growth rate of 102.36%, compared to the S&P 500's 14.83%, according to Curvo data.

Oops, something went wrong

Ahead of a much-anticipated phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's president Vladimir Putin, Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) price action remains closely tied to the outcome of a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.

What Happened: According to Polymarket data, a ceasefire in Ukraine has a 61% chance of being announced until July and a 76% chance of being announced until the end of the year.

Vladimir Putin has signaled openness to the idea of a 30-day ceasefire, but voiced conditions that would first have to be fulfilled.

The outcome of ceasefire negotiations could have a significant impact on Bitcoin:

A successful ceasefire might stabilize global markets, boosting investor confidence and driving Bitcoin higher.

If sanctions on Russia are eased, Russia's need for Bitcoin in trade might decrease, potentially reducing demand and exerting downward pressure on price.

A failed agreement could increase volatility, with additional sanctions potentially pushing Russia toward greater Bitcoin adoption while dampening broader market sentiment.

An escalation might trigger risk-aversion among investors, leading to sell-offs in Bitcoin, as seen during the initial stages of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, when Bitcoin prices dropped below $40,000.

Thus, the impact on Bitcoin demand remains mixed.

What's Next: Market observers will be closely watching the outcome of the Trump-Putin negotiation call, as it could significantly impact Bitcoin's price action and broader market sentiment.

If geopolitical tensions ease, Bitcoin could find a strong bid from institutional investors, while continued uncertainty may heighten short-term volatility.

While the likelihood of a ceasefire remains uncertain, its potential market effects underscore Bitcoin's evolving role in the global financial landscape.

The giant sea spiders can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters).

Scientists have captured stunning video of a dinner-plate-size sea spider crawling on the seafloor off the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of volcanic islands near Antarctica in one of the most remote areas of the world.

Sea spiders, also known as pycnogonids, are distant cousins of the creepy-crawly arachnids we see scuttling about on land. These creatures can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) — nearly double those of the largest land spiders, whose leg spans top out at around 12 inches (30 cm).

According to the Schmidt Ocean Institute, which shared the footage, the spider's massive size is a result of deep-sea gigantism, the tendency for deep-sea creatures to grow significantly larger than their shallow-water relatives. In this case, the pycnogonid was filmed at a depth of 6,903 feet (2,104 meters).

"Immense pressure and frigid temperatures, while insurmountable obstacles to land-lovers like humans, allow some animals to have very slow metabolisms and the ability to reach gargantuan proportions," Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives wrote in a Facebook post.

Larger animals can also move faster and farther to find food or to locate a mate, which is important when both are scarce.

Deep-sea gigantism is particularly prevalent toward the poles, where freezing temperatures facilitate slower metabolisms. Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives described sea spiders as both "abundant" and "abundantly large" in polar regions.

There are roughly 1,500 species of sea spider known to science and likely many more yet to be discovered, according to the post. Sea spiders inhabit oceans around the world and range just a few millimeters to the size of a serving platter. The species of spider in the video from the Schmidt Ocean Institute has not been specified.

The largest members of this group are usually found at depths between 7,200 and 13,100 feet (2,200 to 4,000 m), according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

Instead of spinning webs or creating burrows as land spiders do, sea spiders use a specialized tube-like mouth structure, called a proboscis, to slurp up prey such as sea anemones, jellies and other invertebrates.

This latest footage was taken by remotely operated vehicle pilots as part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute's South Sandwich Islands expedition, a mission to locate and describe new species in these frigid waters. According to the institute, scientists have discovered only 10% of ocean life.

Adam Kucharski's new book Proof is a life raft in a sea of fake news and misinformation

I have something of a reputation as a party-pooper in the New Scientist office. At our weekly meeting to discuss the latest and greatest ideas in science, colleagues will eagerly describe some incredible new theory or spectacular find, then sit back to field questions. I can already hear the groans before I open my mouth to say: “Yes, but what is the actual evidence?”

I don't do this because I enjoy shooting down ideas (OK, maybe I do…

Feedback, a Lego fan, delves into a new science-related set, and learns that the model of a DNA double helix is the wrong way around. Time for some jokes about mirror organisms...




                                    19 March 2025

Feedback is New Scientist's popular sideways look at the latest science and technology news. You can submit items you believe may amuse readers to Feedback by emailing feedback@newscientist.com 

Feedback may be well into middle age, verging on dotage, but we aren't ashamed to admit that we enjoy playing with Lego, to the point of having a special cabinet in our home office in which to house our more prized sets. So, we were naturally intrigued to learn of a set, released on 1 March, called “The Evolution of STEM” (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).

The build is a cornucopia of STEM-related objects: a DNA double helix, a space shuttle, an apple tree with Isaac Newton stood nervously beneath it and more. They all erupt out of the pages of an open book, accompanied by minifigures of chemist Marie Skłodowska-Curie and agricultural scientist George Washington Carver.

It's a bit chaotic-looking, but there is a deeper problem, highlighted in a Reddit thread flagged to us by news editor Jacob Aron, and noted by at least one reviewer. It's quite simple: the DNA is the wrong way around. Many biological chemicals can be either left or right-handed, and in Earthly life, DNA is always right-handed – but Lego's DNA molecule is left-handed.

Feedback was going to suggest this was Lego subtly arguing that, despite what the experts say, we should go ahead and construct a mirror organism in which key molecules have the opposite handedness to existing life – even if it might kill us all. But then we saw that Jay's Brick Blog had already made that remark in their review.

So instead, we call on the world's palaeontologists to find something wrong with the metre-long T. rex skeleton kit Lego released on 15 March. We need to stop ourselves buying it.

With a certain weary inevitability, many big energy companies have rolled back their commitments to renewable energy, preferring to chase the immediate profits from fossil fuels.

In late February, BP announced it was boosting its investments in oil and gas by about 20 per cent, while cutting renewables funding by more than $5 billion. This was, it said, about maximising returns for shareholders. Alas, the firm's net income was a mere $8.9 billion in 2024. Oh, how their hands were tied.

On the day this announcement was made, the story was presented on the UK's BBC News homepage – next to one headlined “Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told”. Feedback briefly joined some dots in our addled mind, before reminding ourselves that it's fine: the people in suits know what they're doing.

After all, BP isn't alone. A few weeks earlier, Shell released its full 2024 results, which noted that it had cut its capital spending on renewables from $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion. Last year, it abandoned its 2035 emissions target. Likewise, in December, Exxon set out a plan to boost its oil and gas output by 18 per cent by 2030.

To paraphrase Futurama‘s Philip J. Fry: Feedback is shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked.

The whole saga leads us to wonder if “corporate strategy” might be an oxymoron on a par with “military intelligence”. In the early 2000s, BP rebranded itself from “British Petroleum” to “Beyond Petroleum”, to signal its intention to embrace renewables. Then it abandoned the whole thing after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill cost it a lot of money, bringing its focus back to fossil fuels. Fast-forward to 2020, and the company announced a raft of new renewables targets – many of which it is now slinking away from with this recent drop in funding.

If Feedback were this indecisive, we would, er, struggle to decide how to wrap this up, um.

Reporter Michael Le Page draws our attention to The Journal of Geek Studies. Despite its (somewhat) formal-sounding name, it isn't peer-reviewed, but it will publish “any original contribution that combines an academic topic with something geeky”.

Hence the paper that Michael found, published on 8 March, titled: “Is a bone a viable weapon when combating a Rancor? Estimating the bite force of an intergalactic mega-predator“.

For readers unfamiliar with what a Rancor is, it's the great big reptile-like monster in the basement of Jabba the Hutt's palace in Return of the Jedi, which Luke Skywalker fights off. Another Rancor appeared in the 2021 series The Book of Boba Fett, but the less said about that the better.

Authors Thomas Clements and Stephan Lautenschlager seek to understand one key moment from Return of the Jedi. To avoid being eaten, Luke picks up a long bone and lodges it vertically in the Rancor's mouth, locking its jaw open. However, Luke's reprieve is only temporary, as the Rancor bites down so hard it snaps the bone in two.

Is this feasible? The pair simulate the muscles and bones of the Rancor's jaw and estimate it could bite with a force of around 44,000 newtons – “more than capable of vertically snapping a large long bone”. Reassuringly, “no living vertebrate's bite force comes close to the Rancor”, with great white sharks and saltwater crocodiles topping out around 16,000 to 18,000 newtons.

During our journalistic career, Feedback has repeatedly been told by editors to write stories that lead to practical advice, or “news you can use”. Well, here it is. Readers: every time you venture into crocodile territory, carry a femur or two with you, just in case.

As Venus approaches its inferior conjunction, astrophotographers have snapped some striking shots of the crescent planet looking like a giant rainbow in space.

New photos have revealed the "love planet" Venus looking unrecognizable as it prepares to line up for a striking conjunction later this week. The hellish world has transformed into a slim crescent, which can look like a giant fiery rainbow under the right conditions.

On March 23, Venus will reach its inferior conjunction, or the point at which it lies directly between Earth and the sun. On this day, the sun's glare will make it almost impossible to see the planet. But even if we could see it, it would be covered in shadow, similar to a new moon. Over the last few weeks and months, the planet has been waning as it gets closer to alignment, giving it an increasingly crescent-like appearance.

Astrophotographer Douglas Kostyk set out to capture the disappearing planet on March 8 at the Marian and Max Farash Center for Observational Astronomy in Ionia, New York — when only around 7% of Venus was visible. But his photos also showed that the crescent looked like a cosmic rainbow.

The striking rainbow effect is caused by particles in Earth's atmosphere refracting, or splitting apart, different wavelengths of light like a prism, according to Spaceweather.com. "When Venus is near the horizon, refraction separates the red crescent from the blue," Spaceweather.com representatives wrote. "The crescent is so thin, the splitting of colors is obvious."

The same effect was also captured by Kevin R. Witman, who snapped a less-detailed image of Venus' rainbow crescent from Cochranville, Pennsylvania on March 9. In this image, the rainbow's colors are inverted compared to Kostyk's photo because the planet was in a different part of the sky relative to the observer.

More recently, on March 16, astronomer Raffaello Lena captured video footage of the rainbow effect from near Rome, Italy. In this instance, atmospheric turbulence caused the light coming from Venus to shimmer and become distorted, making it appear as if the rainbow was "on fire," Spaceweather.com reported.

Venus has become unusually bright in recent weeks as it gets closer to Earth, which has made it a prime target for astronomy enthusiasts since early February onwards. During this time, the hellish world also starred in a rare planetary parade, when all of the solar system's worlds appeared in the night sky at one point or another.

Venus was one of the most clearly visible planets throughout the parade, often appearing close to the moon and occasionally right alongside other planets like Mercury. It was also one of the most easily identifiable bodies when all seven planets were photographed in a line in late February.

Bright Venus is easily spotted with the naked eye, but to make out its crescent-like appearance you'll need a strong pair of stargazing binoculars or a good backyard telescope.

The planetary parade is now over. However, several planets will remain easier to spot than usual in the coming weeks and months. After the upcoming inferior conjunction, Venus will begin its waxing phase and transition from a slim crescent to its more usual filled-in appearance. As this happens, the rainbow effect should still be visible for a few weeks if the conditions are right.

Venus reaches an inferior conjunction approximately every 18 months. The next time this happens will be on Oct. 24, 2026.

String theory may be our best attempt at a theory of everything, except that it can't describe an expanding universe like ours. Now a radical new twist on the idea could finally fix that – but it requires us to completely reimagine reality

By Jon Cartwright


                                    19 March 2025

String theory is the best candidate we have for a theory of everything. Bend to its rule and the various tangled theories of conventional physics emerge as part of a sublime, higher-dimensional tapestry. It can unify all four of nature's forces, including the most troublesome of all, gravity. With any luck, it can also tame big bangs and black holes without losing the thread.

There's just one catch: string theory can't explain a universe like ours. Its maths can describe gazillions of different possible universes, just not one expanding at an accelerating rate, which is precisely what we see ours doing. To be sure, no one knows what is driving this acceleration – a mysterious “dark energy” is the usual placeholder. According to theory, though, it probably shouldn't be happening at all.

The laws of physics appear to follow a mysterious mathematical pattern

For 25 years, this has been a big problem, but now we may have found a way past it. Superficially, the answer won't shock anyone used to the extravagance of modern physics: we just have to rethink our universe as part of a much grander enterprise. Do this, and it can balloon to its heart's content – indeed, accelerated expansion seems to come naturally. But this new scheme may be the wildest yet, one in which our familiar space is delicately poised between high-dimensional hyperspace and complete nothingness. “In our proposal, our existence is like a shadow – a projection onto a wall at the end of the world,” says Antonio Padilla, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in the UK.

For all its present-day grandeur, string…

A quartet of small, rocky exoplanets likely circle Barnard's Star, around 6 billion light-years from Earth, putting them in contention as targets of missions for future human generations.

A quartet of Earth-like worlds, each about 20% to 30% the size of our planet, circle one of our closest stellar neighbors, a new study reveals. The rocky alien worlds are close enough that future generations of humans may be able to visit them with futuristic rocket propulsion technology. However, it is unlikely that we will find any life there.

Astronomers have long suspected that there was at least one exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star — a red dwarf with a mass around one-sixth that of the sun. At 5.97 light-years from Earth, it is the fourth-closest star to our solar system, after the three interconnected stars of the Alpha Centauri system. (Five potential planets have also been detected around the stars of Alpha Centauri, though not all of them have been confirmed yet.)

In the past, researchers assumed that Barnard's Star was circled by a gas giant exoplanet similar to Jupiter, because the star frequently wobbles closer to and then farther from Earth. This suggests that something is gravitationally tugging on the star, similar to how the moon pulls on our planet and causes Earth's tides. However, proving the existence of such a planet has remained elusive.

But in a new study, published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, researchers say they have discovered that this wobbling is not caused by the pull of one gas giant but instead by the combined force exerted by four smaller, rocky worlds, each around four times more massive than Mercury.

"It's a really exciting find," study lead author Ritvik Basant, a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago, said in a statement. "Barnard's Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it."

The newly detected worlds, which have not been officially named yet, are "so close to their home star that they zip around the entire star in a matter of days," the researchers wrote. "That probably means they are too hot to be habitable."

The new findings also likely rule out the possibility that any other exoplanets circle within the habitable zone of Barnard's Star, they added.

But that doesn't mean this system will remain uninhabited forever. Although Barnard's Star is currently out of reach for humans using current rocket propulsion technology, future human generations might be able to travel to and colonize these newly discovered planets using new forms of rocket propulsion, such as nuclear fusion engines or light sails.

Most exoplanets are discovered when they pass in front of their home star and block out some of the light shining toward Earth. However, in this case, researchers think we are looking at Barnard's Star from above, meaning its planets do not pass in between it and us. As a result, scientists often refer to our stellar neighbor as "great white whale" of planet hunting, researchers wrote.

To get around this problem, the study team turned to MAROON-X, an instrument attached to the Gemini North telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. Over 112 nights during a three-year period, the telescope detected subtle shifts in the movement of Barnard's Star in order to "tease apart the number and masses of the planets that must be circling the star to have this effect," the researchers wrote.



Initially, MAROON-X identified only three planets. However, in another study, published in October 2024, researchers identified another planet using a similar device, dubbed ESPRESSO, at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. By combining these data with their own, the researchers could see this fourth planet for themselves.

Using data from both MAROON-X and ESPRESSO also challenges the idea that the researchers are being misled by anomalies in either data set, making them more confident in their results.

—Exoplanet with iron rain has violent winds 'like something out of science fiction'

—Nearby exoplanet has grown a tail 44 times longer than Earth — and it's acting like a giant 'stellar windsock'

Red dwarfs are the most common star type in the universe, but most are too far from Earth for researchers to easily spot planets around them. However, the new results hint that small, rocky planets could be abundant around these miniature stars.

But for the study team, the most exciting thing about the new research was finding worlds that are so close to Earth.

"We found something that humanity will hopefully know forever," Jacob Bean, an astronomer at the University of Chicago who specializes in exoplanet systems, said in the statement. "That sense of discovery is incredible."

Google X has introduced the Taara chip, a fingernail-sized invention that taps the "virtually limitless" potential of light-based internet connectivity.

Google X has revealed the Taara chip, the latest development in its quest to harness the power of light for inexpensive, cable-free, high-speed internet.

This "fingernail-sized" chip uses software-controlled light emitters to steer data-encoded light beams between two points. In tests, researchers successfully transmitted data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) over 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) outdoors using two Taara chips.

"We believe this is the first time silicon photonics chips have transmitted such high-capacity data outdoors at this distance," Mahesh Krishnaswamy, the general manager of Taara, said in a statement.

The researchers at X, which is Google's research and development arm, hope Taara can deliver fiber-like internet speeds to regions that are difficult to access with traditional fiber-optic cables. These traditional cables are typically buried deep underground, making them impractical for remote areas or challenging terrains, such as mountains and forests. This, however, isn't a problem for Taara.

Similarly, because the light frequencies Taara uses don't overlap with radio frequency bands like 5G, Taara doesn't have to contend with other signals taking up bandwidth.

He added that the goal was to make high-speed connectivity cheaper and easier to deploy by reducing the size and cost of the infrastructure, specifically by creating a mesh network of multiple Taara devices connected together.

These devices could then exchange data directly, providing high-speed, easily-scalable coverage wherever Taara nodes exist.

"Using chips deployed in a global mesh network, we see opportunities to bring high-speed internet to underserved regions, rethink the way data centers are built and operated, enable faster, create safer communication for autonomous vehicles, and so much more."

Fiber-optic cables contain tiny plastic or glass strands that transmit data as pulses of light. These are extremely effective at carrying high-speed data over long distances — far more so than older, copper-based cables, which carry data as slower electrical signals that are more prone to interference.

Taara also sends data as optical signals; however, it avoids the need for underground cables and networks that require physical maintenance. This means it can be installed "in hours instead of the days, months, or even years it can take to lay fiber," Krishnaswamy said.

—Scientists use TV tech to test light-powered internet connections that can be 100 times faster than Wi-Fi

—Key to faster 6G speeds lies in letting new AI architecture take control, scientists say

—Wireless data speeds hit 938 Gbps — a new record and 10,000 times faster than 5G

The Taara chip is actually a newer, smaller version of an existing Google X invention called Taara Lightbridge, which is about the size of a traffic light.

Lightbridge featured a physical housing and mechanisms consisting of "mirrors, sensors, precision optics, and smart software" to align light beams to where they need to be. When two beams lock onto each other, they create a secure link capable of transmitting data up to speeds of 20 Gbps up to distances of 12.4 miles (20 km).

Krishnaswamy said the Taara chip will be available in 2026 in X's next product — which the company has not disclosed. In the meantime, Google's research arm has invited researchers and tinkerers to get in touch to explore potential applications.

The European Space Agency has released the first batch of large-scale images from the Euclid space telescope, which astronomers have already used to find hundreds of strong gravitational lenses

Extraordinary images from the Euclid space telescope have captured 26 million galaxies, some as far off as 10.5 billion light years.

Euclid was launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in July 2023 and sent back its first images in November that year. During a six-year mission, it will image about one-third of the sky, building the most detailed 3D map of the cosmos ever created. Once complete, this survey will help to illuminate how dark matter and dark energy behave on cosmic scales.

ESA has now released the first large-scale data from this mission, beginning with three “deep fields” – areas where the telescope will peer in more detail than in the rest of its survey area. These three spots represent just 63 square degrees of sky, an area equivalent to that covered by the full moon 300 times over. In the coming years, Euclid will pass over these regions between 30 and 52 times, building up an ever more detailed image.

Will Percival at the University of Waterloo in Canada says the current batch of images is less than half a per cent of what Euclid will gather over the mission, but there is already plenty for researchers to work with. “For a lot of individual galaxies and their properties, there's so much science you can do, and that's because nobody has done a space-based survey in the near infrared and the optical like this before,” he says. “It's not quite the same quality as HST [the Hubble Space Telescope], but it's very close, and we're not just pointing and shooting at individual objects – we're doing a survey.”

Researchers have already used the Euclid data to find hundreds of strong gravitational lenses. These phenomena are formed when the gravity of an object in the foreground distorts light from a distant galaxy, creating an arc shape or even a full ring. Previously, scientists had to hunt these down individually and get HST to point at them and collect more images. Now astronomers can search the survey data from Euclid and find many at once, which will help gather insights into the evolution of galaxies and the universe.

Using an AI model, researchers were able to find and catalogue 500 galaxies with strong gravitational lensing in this first batch of data alone, doubling the total found to date. “The statistics are phenomenal,” says Percival. “Euclid's going to get 200 times this amount of data in the end.”

The data released so far represents just a single week of images from Euclid, but it adds up to some 35 terabytes – the equivalent of 200 days of high-quality video streaming. The next batch of data, due to be released late next year, will be a whole year's worth of images covering 2000 square degrees and requiring more than 2000 terabytes of storage space.

Looking at each galaxy manually could take over a hundred years, so AI has been used to massively speed up the process, says Mike Walmsley at the University of Toronto. “We can ask new questions in weeks, rather than years,” he says.

After finding the debris of two colliding stars swimming in the ocean, researchers are after more evidence from the lunar soil.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — The wreckage of some of the universe's most violent explosions has crept closer than you might think; in fact, you may have taken a swim in it during your last dip in the ocean.

By analyzing samples from the deep sea, researchers have found a unique variety of radioactive plutonium that appears to be debris from a rare breed of cosmic explosion called a kilonova, which likely detonated near Earth some 10 million years ago. But proving this explosion's existence will require more evidence, and the researchers think they know where to find it: on the surface of the moon.

"We live in a supernova graveyard," Brian Fields, an astronomer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a March 17 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society Global Physics Summit. "[Supernovas make] tiny specks of rocks that can literally rain upon the Earth. They'll accumulate in the depths of the ocean, and they'll also hang onto the moon."

Fields has theorized about this cosmic rubble since the 1990s. But it wasn't until 2004 that researchers started sifting out supernova remnants from ocean samples. They found traces of a radioactive version of iron that doesn't occur naturally on Earth and can only be explained by a nearby supernova sometime in Earth's recent history.

In the following years, about a dozen more samples from both the ocean and the moon painted a more detailed picture of this explosive history. Fields and his colleagues' refined theories pointed to two separate supernova events that occurred 3 million and 8 million years ago. "This is direct observational evidence that supernovas are radioactivity factories," Fields said.

The plot thickened in 2021, when researchers discovered an even rarer substance sprinkled in with those same samples: a radioactive isotope of plutonium. This finding required an origin story even more unusual than the violent star deaths that birth supernovas.

The plutonium variant the researchers found is thought to come from kilonovas — eruptions that occur as two binary neutron stars spiral toward each other in a cataclysmic collision. Kilonovas are also factories for some of our planet's rarest elements, like gold and platinum, and astronomers have long tried to unravel the mechanics of this class of explosion.

Now, Fields and his colleagues suspect that a separate kilonova event predated those two previously identified supernovas, erupting at least 10 million years ago. These different explosions formed a sort of radioactive cocktail, embedding a hybrid iron and plutonium signature in the samples.

"We had a kilonova that made plutonium — like it loves to do — and blasted it all over the place," Fields said. "Then, with the stirring of material by a supernova, it got all mixed up, and some of that fell to Earth."

But Fields and his team still want to run more tests to bolster their theory. With renewed efforts like the Artemis missions to return humans to the moon, the researchers are optimistic that the lunar samples they hope to analyze won't be in such short supply.

"Right now, our lunar soil is so precious because it's all we've got," Fields told Live Science. "The hope is, eventually, we'll be taking routine trips to the moon, so it's no big deal — sampling a kilogram won't sound like a lot to people."

With more soil, Fields and his colleagues hope to verify that this kilonova indeed happened, as well as pinpoint when and where it occurred. Because of its simpler geology, the moon should provide a clearer snapshot of exactly how the cosmic debris landed there.

—The universe's water is billions of years older than scientists thought — and may be nearly as old as the Big Bang itself

"On Earth, things sink to the bottom of the ocean, and you have to worry about currents and the atmosphere," Fields told Live Science. "But the moon is awesome because when stuff lands, it just lands."

With the next phase of the Artemis mission not set to launch until at least next year, Fields and his team are still a ways away from formally requesting access to this hot commodity. But in the meantime, they're convincing the scientific community that the research is a worthwhile investment.

"We're writing papers to prove to the Artemis community that this is something to seriously think about," Fields said. "The samples are coming back anyway. We just want to piggyback off of it."

Bedmap3 is the most fine-grain map to date of the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice. Scientists created it using more than 60 years' worth of data from satellites, ships and dog-drawn sleds.

Scientists have unveiled the most detailed map yet of the landscape hidden beneath Antarctica's ice.

The high-resolution map reveals what the frozen continent looks like beneath its miles-thick blanket of ice and snow, and will help researchers predict how Antarctica might evolve in a fast-warming climate.

"Imagine pouring syrup over a rock cake [or a chocolate chip cookie, if that's more familiar to you] — all the lumps, all the bumps, will determine where the syrup goes and how fast," Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the lead author of a new study outlining the research, said in a statement.

The same process will occur in Antarctica if a significant amount of the ice sheet melts, Pritchard said. "Some ridges will hold up the flowing ice; the hollows and smooth bits are where that ice could accelerate," he said.

Bedmap3 builds on two previous studies that digitally stripped Antarctica of its ice. The new map incorporates all of the data used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2 — including measurements gathered by planes, satellites, ships and even dog-drawn sleds. But the team also sourced an extra 52 million data points to refine these previous results, according to the study, published March 10 in the journal Scientific Data.

In total, more than six decades' worth of data was compiled to construct Bedmap3, the researchers said in the statement. "This is the fundamental information that underpins the computer models we use to investigate how the ice will flow across the continent as temperatures rise," Pritchard said.

The new map is color coded to show the height of Antarctica's bedrock above sea level, highlighting the continent's tallest mountains and deepest valleys. The topography is revealed in the finest detail yet, providing new insight into understudied areas, including around the South Pole, according to the statement.



The researchers used radar, seismic and gravity measurements to map the bedrock and estimate the thickness of the ice sheet above it. Against their expectations, they found that the place with the thickest ice in Antarctica is an unnamed canyon in Wilkes Land, a district in the east of the continent.

Previous surveys placed Antarctica's thickest ice in the Astrolabe Basin in Adélie Land. The difference in ice thickness between the two areas is small: The Astrolabe Basin has a thickness of around 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers), while Wilkes Land is almost 3 miles (4.8 km) thick, according to the study.



The new research also reveals, in unprecedented detail, the shape of the ice sheet and ice shelves that float around the fringes of the continent.

"In general, it's become clear the Antarctic Ice Sheet is thicker than we originally realized and has a larger volume of ice that is grounded on a rock bed sitting below sea level," study co-author Peter Fretwell, a mapping specialist and geographic information officer at the BAS, said in the statement.

Although thickness in itself is not a problem, the fact that much of the ice sits below sea level is concerning, because relatively warm seawater can flood into the ice sheet, Fretwell said. "This puts the ice at greater risk of melting," he added.

"What Bedmap3 is showing us is that we have got a slightly more vulnerable Antarctica than we previously thought," Fretwell added.

The podcast "Closing the Round" has reached the middle of its fifth season, covering topics from investments to technology. Guests
included Mykhailo Fedorov and other influential figures.

The technology podcast "Closed Round", partnered by the IT company FAVBET Tech, has reached the middle of its fifth season, reports UNN.

Behind us are 26 episodes and dozens of hours of conversations about investments, startups and technologies, as well as an overview of popular culture phenomena and interviews with people who are changing the Ukrainian technology market. Let's recall the most popular and resonant ones.

The first episodes of the season began with deep analyses of cases of global and Ukrainian companies and iconic personalities: how Sam Altman turned OpenAI into a commercial phenomenon, why startups vitally need creativity (says Ihor Finashkin from I AM IDEA), and what happens when technology giants like Google become too influential.

Next, the hosts of "Closed Round" analyzed in detail how the largest venture fund Softbank "drained" 100 billion dollars, how Victoria Tigipko created a successful investment portfolio of TA Ventures, and also talked about the influence of Peter Thiel on the American elections and the phenomenon of the popularity of vertical micro-series of Ukrainian production.

One of the most popular episodes of the season was an exclusive with Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, who shared details of the Ministry of Digital Affairs' work, the development of the "Diia" project, and his own productivity secrets. Viewers were no less actively watching releases about startup niches according to Y Combinator, investment strategies of Andriy Fedoriv, as well as about the success of a neobank for cryptocurrencies and the case of Stripe - the most expensive fintech in the world.

"In the fifth season, we decided to talk not only about traditional technological projects, such as SoftBank, or investments in the industry, but also about how the technological world affects classic industries, such as the creation of vertical series or how social networks made Formula 1 popular again. It is very interesting to understand this," says co-author Ilya Kabachinsky.

The latest episodes are dedicated to the hottest technology news and trends: the big deal to acquire Uklon and Tabletki.ua by Kyivstar, the phenomenon of the Chinese AI giant DeepSeek, and the impact of popular podcasters on US politics ("How Joe Rogan and podcasters brought Trump to power"). In addition, they talked with Alna Mysko about the success of the Ukrainian startup Fuelfinance and with the ex-president of Kyivstar Petro Chernyshov about his approach to technology investments.

"In the new season, we started inviting guests who talk about niches, for example, how payments work. It turned out that the audience is interested in this, the views are large, and most importantly, organic," adds podcast co-author Anton Poleskov.

Anton Poleskov and Ilya Kabachinsky assure that even more interesting guests and unexpected topics await the viewers. "We already have so many guests ahead, our editor is already working even on weekends. It seems that we have not covered even 3% of those we can call" - say the presenters.

The constant partner of the podcast is the IT company with Ukrainian DNA FAVBET Tech, a developer of solutions for the entertainment industry and an active participant in the technological community of Ukraine. The company is a resident of Diia.City, a member of the IT Ukraine Association. FAVBET Tech is among the top 50 product IT companies in Ukraine.

European Union Lays Out How Apple Must Open Its Tech up to Competitors Under Bloc's Digital Rules

LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday outlined the steps that Apple must take to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to work better with competing technologies.

It's the first time the EU has moved to compel a technology company to comply with the bloc's digital Digital Markets Act — a wide-ranging set of regulations designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies from cornering markets. 

After the DMA took effect a year ago, the EU's executive Commission moved swiftly to open a raft of investigations into Big Tech companies. 

Brussels also opened two “ specification proceedings ” in September to spell out what Apple needs to do under the DMA, which aims to make digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable” by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company's products or services. 

In its legally binding decision, the commission detailed measures that the iPhone maker has to take involving nine connectivity features for its iOS operating system. 

The measures will give device and app makers better access to iPhone features that work with devices. For example, iPhone users will have “enhanced possibilities” to receive notifications on non-Apple smartwatches, including receiving pictures and the ability to reply to them. Users could also benefit from more seamless pairing of wireless headphones from other brands. 

Access to Apple's wireless file transfer technology would let third-party developers create apps similar to the AirDrop feature. 

The commission also laid out a second set of measures to make the process for software developers requesting access to iPhone features more transparent and effective. Among the changes are better access to technical documentation not yet available to third parties, it said. 

With its decision, Brussels is "providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera said in a press release. 

“Effective interoperability" for will mean “better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices,” she said. 

European consumer group BEUC hailed the decision. 

“For too long, Apple has operated a walled garden around its products and prevented interoperability," Director General Agustin Reyna said. 

Apple, however, voiced its unhappiness, saying it's bad for the company's products and for European users.

“Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,” the company said in a statement. 

Apple said it will continue to work with the European Commission to "help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”

The Commission also said Wednesday that Google wasn't doing enough to comply with DMA. Despite making changes, including removing flight listings, Google was still giving preference to its own services in search results, it said. 

Google is also failing to let app developers steer users to cheaper options outside its Google Play Store app marketplace, the commission said in preliminary findings. While it's acceptable for Google to charge a fee for downloading an app in its app store, the company is charging fees that "go beyond what is justified," for every purchase of digital goods or services, it said. 

Google said the EU findings will require the company to make even more changes to how it displays some search results, “which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses. This is, quite simply, misguided.”

The commission's app store findings, meanwhile, “create a false choice between openness and security" and risk exposing Europe users to more “malware and fraud,” it added. 

Google now has the chance to reply to the findings. 

If the commission decides Google is in “non-compliance” with the DMA, it can issue a fine of up to 10% of the company's annual global revenue. But officials have said that they want to avoid issuing blockbuster fines and instead negotiate with companies to get them to comply. 

The EU's crack down on the global tech industry has irritated President Donald Trump, who recently blasted the bloc's hefty antitrust fines for U.S. tech companies. Vice-President JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation, in a rebuke aimed at the EU's sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.

However, both companies have been under pressure in the U.S. too. Apple is facing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing it of engineering an illegal smartphone monopoly. Meanwhile, federal antitrust regulators are seeking to break up Google after a federal judge ruled Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

A B.C. crowdfunding company that facilitates fractional investments as low as $1 per share in real estate developments has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine to the B.C. Securities Commission for unregistered trading.

Since July 2018, Addy Technology Corp. had not been registered in any capacity — including as a securities dealer — but commission investigators found it to be engaging in activities similar to a registrant, by soliciting investors through its online platform, email and social media.

Addy was also conducting what the commission described as "intermediating" trades and also receiving compensation in the form of fees.

Addy agreed to the fine in a March 17 settlement agreement after voluntarily providing information to investigators and admitting to the misconduct.

The platform matches small-scale investors to the likes of real estate investment trusts (REIT) and developers across Canada, known as issuers in legal terms.

For example, an issuing company in Victoria recently obtained financing for an 18-unit, purpose-built rental complex from 420 Canadians, according to addyinvest.ca.

Between July 9, 2018, and Feb. 14, 2025, Addy traded in approximately $26 million of securities of the issuers using the Addy platform. The average amount invested in the issuers was approximately $700 per investor, according to the settlement.

Addy charges investors $50 annual membership fees for early access to certain properties and additional features on Addy's online platform.

Addy tried to use exemption rules but was not eligible.

For instance, some of the issuers Addy was promoting were owned by Addy principals, according to the agreement, and this negated Addy's ability to utilize national crowdfunding rules that exempt those registration requirements, which otherwise provide a level of investor protection in the alternative lending space.

“By engaging in the above conduct, Addy engaged in the business of trading securities without being registered and without an exemption, contrary to the [B.C. Securities Act],” the agreement stated.

Addy has since made an application for registration as a dealer of securities, according to the commission.

	IT services firms Wipro, TechMahindra, and L&T Technology on Wednesday announced individual partnerships with chipmaking giant Nvidia for AI-based solutions for various industries.


	These software firms are showcasing the solutions leveraging Nvidia technologies at the US-based chip major's ongoing annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in California.


	Tech Mahindra has unveiled an autonomous pharmacovigilance (PV) solution powered by Nvidia AI software to enhance drug safety management. By leveraging agentic AI and automation, the solution improves the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of PV processes, addressing challenges like manual delays and data overload.


	It integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise tools, including NeMo, NIM microservices, and AI Blueprints, to optimise case intake, data transformation, quality control, and compliance.


	The AI-driven PV solution instantly flags prioritises, and processes the request by eliminating human intervention that could potentially lead to delays and errors.


	The solution reduces turnaround times by up to 40 per cent, enhances data accuracy by 30 per cent, and cuts operational costs by 25 per cent.


	"As the pharmaceutical industry navigates volumes of data during trials and post-launch, our collaboration with Nvidia leverages generative AI and multi-agent systems to streamline the pharmacovigilance process," Nikhil Malhotra, Chief Innovation Officer & Global Head of AI and Emerging Technologies of Tech Mahindra, said.


	Wipro has introduced new Agentic AI services aimed at enabling nations worldwide to harness their unique infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks to develop and implement artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.


	The solution integrates Wipro's WeGA Studio with Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an Agentic AI-powered ecosystem.

By driving public sector innovation, it aims to stimulate economic development.


	Additionally, the solution offers pre-built responsible AI accelerators, allowing clients to swiftly create tailored use cases and high-performance models aligned with their specific goals.


	"Organisations are seeking AI solutions that are not only effective but also ethical and transparent.


	"By working together with Nvidia, we will be able to quickly deploy AI agent systems and technologies while addressing the increased concerns many government agencies and organisations have over data privacy, security, and national sovereignty," said Nagendra Bandaru, President and Managing Partner, Wipro Technology Services.


	L&T Technology Services (LTTS) announced the launch of TrackEi -- an AI-powered railway track inspection solution.


	The solution uses the Nvidia Jetson platform to deliver real-time defect detection and support predictive maintenance, enhancing safety for rail networks worldwide.


	TrackEi will be showcased at the Nvidia GTC 2025 AI Conference.


	"Traditionally, rail inspection involved manual processes or slow-moving trolleys, which are time-consuming and sometimes fail to detect critical flaws in time to prevent derailments.


	"TrackEi addresses this challenge by automating high-speed inspections at over 60 Miles Per Hour, utilising high-resolution cameras and laser profiling to identify issues, such as broken rails, cracks, track misalignments, and other structural defects," a company statement said.


	Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference is being held in San Jose, California, from March 1721, 2025. It is a premier event to showcase the latest advancements in AI and accelerated computing. It features keynote presentations, workshops, and exhibits highlighting real-world applications of Nvidia technologies across various industries.

With a market capitalization of $18.6 billion, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON is a leading global semiconductor company specializing in high-performance energy-efficient solutions. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company designs and manufactures a diverse portfolio of power management, sensing, and connectivity solutions that cater to key industries, including automotive, industrial, and communications.

Companies valued at over $10 billion are often categorized as “large-cap stocks,” a distinction ON Semiconductor fits this category through its strong market position. Renowned for its innovations in electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and power efficiency technologies, ON Semiconductor plays a critical role in driving the next generation of intelligent and sustainable electronics.

However, it hasn't been smooth sailing, as the stock has plummeted 45.8% from its 52-week high of $80.08, which it reached on July 29 last year. Over the past three months, the stock has dropped 33.1%, compared to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLK 3.9% decline over the same time period.  

ON Semiconductor has been caught in a relentless downtrend, plunging 41.2% over the past year and 38.5% in the last six months, a stark contrast to XLK, which dipped a mere 2.3% in six months and even managed a 2.8% gain over the year.

The stock has also exhibited sustained bearish momentum, trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since early December. 

ON Semiconductor, a key player in analog chips and silicon carbide for EVs, saw strong growth post covid but is now facing headwinds. The EV and industrial markets are slowing, leading to a 14% revenue decline in 2024 and a 23% drop in earnings. While the company remains confident in its long-term strategy, its weak price action suggests investors may want to stay cautious amid market uncertainty.

In early March, ON Semiconductor made a $6.9 billion all-cash acquisition offer for Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. ALGM at $35.10 per share, a 31% premium over its prior closing price. Allegro's board rejected the bid, deeming it inadequate. Following the rejection, Allegro's stock surged 8%, while ON's shares dropped more than 5% to a three-year low. Analysts expressed skepticism over the deal's profitability due to interest expenses, while speculation remains on whether ON will return with a higher offer.

In a similar downtrend, ON's competitor, STMicroelectronics N.V. STM, has also struggled, with its stock falling 8.3% over the past six months and plunging 42.5% over the past year, reflecting broader weakness in the semiconductor sector.

Despite its recent slump, ON Semiconductor is still catching analysts' attention, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. The stock holds a consensus "Moderate Buy" rating from 31 analysts, and with a mean price target of $61.16, it suggests a compelling 40.9% upside from current levels.

Ubisoft is banking on the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows to fight its way out of financial troubles as the French videogame publisher grapples with falling revenue, a sinking stock price and takeover speculation.

The title, which will be launched on Thursday, marks a return to the company's best-selling franchise after a string of high-profile flops including Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws cast doubts on its strategy of licensing new intellectual property to create games.

Ubisoft's stock took a beating last year, falling more than 40 percent last year and drawing interest from an activist investor. The company's founding Guillemot family, its largest shareholder, has also been exploring talks with Tencent and other investors on a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.

Ubisoft declined to comment on speculation of selling the company's intellectual property.

The launch of the latest game, however, has been marred by criticism on social media including from Elon Musk over its diverse set of characters, as backlash against diversity efforts gains momentum in the US following President Donald Trump's election.

"The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows is a bit of an existential moment for Ubisoft," said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer at NYU's Stern School of Business.

"If it does really well, it could go a long way toward repairing its financial position."

After two delays and multiple leaks, the newest entry in the best-selling franchise transports players to feudal Japan, a fan-favorite setting for gamers. It features two protagonists: Naoe, a stealthy female assassin, and Yasuke, a heavily armored African samurai inspired by the real-life eponymous figure.

Ubisoft has refined the series' core mechanics of parkour and stealth to enhance the dual-character system. "They're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but they really hope that what they tried with the previous games still works right now," said Jordan Van Andel, who has played the game and whose YouTube channel JorRaptor has over one million subscribers.

Van Andel, whose content has in the past been sponsored by Ubisoft, said the game offered a more polished experience than recent titles in the franchise but its story was disappointing.

He added that the game needs to attract a player base beyond core fans to match the financial success of "Assassin's Creed Valhalla," the last big release in the series that came out in 2020 and the first game in the franchise to make over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,652 crore) in revenue.

Diversity Conundrum 

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes the current US political climate could also pose challenges to the game, saying that Trump "has made it okay to be anti-DEI."

Since its reveal more than two years ago, "Assassin's Creed Shadows" has faced criticism from groups over its creative choices such as having a black samurai and a female assassin.

"We could argue that the people that voted for him (Trump)... they would have hated the game anyway, but I think that they would have been less vocal," Pachter said.

North America accounted for over 53 percent of Ubisoft's total videogame bookings in its fiscal year 2024, as many of the company's franchises such as "Far Cry" have a broad appeal to the American audience.

Games with diverse characters have seen strong success in the past such as Sony's "Horizon", which features a female protagonist and is one of the company's most successful franchises.

Van Dreunen believes the controversy could work in Ubisoft's favor. "It's free press this only makes the game more interesting to a lot of players, I'm sure," he said.

Recently installed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight. (AP: Justin Tang)

Canada was always meant to follow the United States in acquiring world-leading Australian radar technology but "things moved quickly" after Donald Trump won the US presidency.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight, after a conversation with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Defence Minister Richard Marles says there are still some hurdles to clear, but the sale of the technology would be the biggest defence export in Australia's history.

For months, senior officials have been discussing exporting Australia's world-leading radar technology JORN to the United States, but after Donald Trump's return to the White House, Canada saw an opportunity and leapt.

Overnight, new Canadian leader Mark Carney spoke to his counterpart, Anthony Albanese, then flew to his country's Arctic territory of Nunavut to announce a $6.5 billion high-tech Australian military purchase.

"Today, I'm announcing that our government will be working with our long-standing defence and security partner Australia to build a new, long-range, over-the-horizon military radar system," he said.

"[It] will enable Canada to detect and respond to both air and maritime threats over our Arctic both faster and from further away. It will most fundamentally keep all Canadians safe."

Following President Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada and Greenland, Ottawa is purchasing the Australian-developed technology known as the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN) to build its new Arctic Over-the-Horizon Radar system.

Ottawa has been under pressure from Washington to step up its defence spending and the new radar system will support "NORAD", the joint US-Canadian initiative that detects incoming threats.

Now in its fourth decade of service, the high-frequency, sky-wave, over-the-horizon (OTHR) system is considered the most advanced in the world, providing wide-area surveillance of ships and aircraft out to 3,000 kilometres.

Unlike traditional radars that were limited by line of sight, Australian scientists designed JORN to beam a high-frequency radio signal skywards towards the ionosphere above the earth's surface, which then refracted the signal down to illuminate a target.

The echo from the target then travels by a similar path back to a separate receiver site and the data received is processed into real-time tracking information — a capability crucial to monitoring Australia's vast northern maritime approaches.

With the United States continuing its campaign of tariffs on foreign nations, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was good for Australia to "diversify" its trade relationships.

"[Mark Carney] certainly spoke to me about the over-the-horizon radar technology that Canada is interested in purchasing from Australia, it's important that we diversify our trade relationships," Mr Albanese said.

"It's important that we develop that diverse series of relationships and Canada is a very important one, we have so much in common."

In recent meetings, senior Australian officials have continued discussing exporting and installing the JORN technology on the United States' west coast, but the massive project faces uncertainty under the Elon Musk-led DOGE audit of Pentagon spending.

For well over a year, American military officials have privately expressed interest in purchasing Australia's JORN technology because of its potential to monitor military movements as far away as China's mainland.

One senior Australian official confirmed to the ABC that "the Canadians were always going to follow the US purchase and slipstream off that" but circumstances changed and "things moved quickly".

Following Canada's announcement, Defence Minister Richard Marles talked up the potential of the final JORN deal, which could end up being Australia's largest military export on record.

"There's a little water to go under the bridge, but what's in prospect here is potentially the biggest defence industry export that Australia has ever been a part of," he told ABC News Breakfast.

"That would obviously be very good for Australian industry."

The ABC has confirmed the United Kingdom, where the parent company of BAE Systems Australia is based, has also expressed interest in purchasing the JORN technology, but is yet to approve the idea.

The profusion of artificial intelligence tools in clinical practice is leading to the development of new health system roles such as the chief health AI officer. In one such move, the University of California San Francisco has named an inaugural executive director of AI monitoring in clinical care.In this new role within the Division of Clinical Informatics and Digital Transformation (DoC-IT), Jinoos Yazdany, M.D., M.P.H., will spearhead the development of the foundational components of the Impact Monitoring Platform for Clinical Care (IMPACC), a real-time AI monitoring platform designed to continuously evaluate the efficacy, safety, fairness, and overall value of AI tools deployed at UCSF Health. A central focus of her role will also be to expand access to data on AI implementations, ensuring that UCSF's research community can leverage these data to drive innovative research.Yazdany serves as chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and is the UCSF Alice Betts Endowed Professor of Medicine. As a rheumatologist specializing in systemic lupus, she practices at ZSFG and co-directs the UCSF Health Lupus Clinic.In her new role, she will work closely with Sara Murray, M.D., UCSF's chief health AI officer; Julia Adler-Milstein, Ph.D., chief of DoC-IT; and Hossein Soleimani, Ph.D., senior data scientist.“AI is no longer just hype—it's fundamentally transforming the way we deliver healthcare,” Yazdany said in a statement. “For example, the AI scribe I use in the clinic feels like a leap forward, freeing me from my keyboard so I can be fully present with my patients. What excites me most is ensuring we strategically deploy AI tools and evaluate whether they improve patient outcomes and increase the joy of practicing medicine.”

As AI becomes more deeply embedded in healthcare, we must take an active approach to monitoring,”  she added. “IMPACC will be essential to ensuring these technologies are not only safe but also fair and truly beneficial for both patients and our health system. Our team aims to set the gold standard for AI oversight, ensuring these tools earn our trust and truly enhance patient care.”In the near term, UCSF said IMPACC will deploy robust, readily implementable metrics to ensure AI tools are safe and effective, while simultaneously building a research pipeline to pioneer new monitoring approaches. Beyond UCSF, the open-source AI-monitoring metrics developed by the IMPACC team will enable institutions nationwide to learn from and tailor evidence-based strategies to their own needs.

Two local hospitals have been presented with the 2025 Patient Safety Excellence Award from Healthgrades, a website where customers can get information about medical care and hospitals, according to a press release from HCA Florida Healthcare.

The announcement about the two hospitals, HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital, was made public on Tuesday.

Hospital officials said it's the "eighth year in a row that HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital have been recognized as a Patient Safety Excellence Award recipient."

Both hospitals were recently recognized as among the nation's 250 Best Hospitals, which placed them "among the top 5% of hospitals in the country for clinical excellence," the release noted.

The hospitals have received other honors for orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, spinal surgery, prostate surgery and joint replacement surgery, hospital officials said.

“We at HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital are wholly committed to providing the Marion County community and its visitors safe, collaborative, and timely care,” Dr. Dave MacIntyre, chief medical officer for HCA Florida Ocala and HCA Florida West Marion Hospitals, said in the news bulletin. 

The release points out that HCA Florida Healthcare, a part of HCA Healthcare, is a family of more than 650 affiliated sites of care, including hospitals, physician practices, freestanding emergency rooms and urgent care centers.

JPMorgan Chase mismanaged employee health benefits, resulting in past and present employees paying inflated prices for prescription drugs and other health care costs, a lawsuit filed last week alleges.

Filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the lawsuit accuses central Ohio's largest private employer of failing its employees by agreeing to overcharges in prescription drugs by the company's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), CVS Caremark. As a PBM, Caremark sets the drug prices for JPMorgan Chase's employee health plans.

JPMorgan Chase employs roughly 20,000 people in central Ohio. The lawsuit is being brought by both current and former employees across the country.

The consequence, according to the lawsuit, is JPMorgan Chase itself and employees and their families paying an average of over 200 times the cost for hundreds of generic prescription drugs available at drastically cheaper prices, even for the uninsured.

One example includes the plan's purchase of the multiple sclerosis drug teriflunomide, which was allegedly bought at a price of $6,229. At retail pharmacies, the drug can be purchased for around $30 without insurance. A drug price like this paid by a health plan can result in higher out-of-pocket costs and higher premiums for participants, while much of the money is pocketed by a PBM.

The lawsuit further alleges that any lack of oversight by the company is "willful" and violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

ERISA is a federal law that aims to protect the interests of participants in a health plan, by setting industry standards and the fiduciary responsibilities of employers and others who control health plans. The lawsuit accuses JPMorgan Chase of abandoning that "fiduciary responsibility" by agreeing to inflated drug prices to the detriment of their employees, even though less expensive options and health plan models were available.

"No prudent fiduciary would agree or allow for its plan and participants/beneficiaries pay a price that is more than two hundred times higher than the price available to any individual who just walks into a pharmacy and pays out-of-pocket, and five hundred sixty times higher than the price available with just a few clicks online," the lawsuit reads.

JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH recently announced that its subsidiary, Molina Healthcare of Illinois, has been selected as one of four organizations to provide a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) in Illinois. This contract, awarded by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, positions Molina Healthcare for strategic growth while enhancing its service offerings for dual-eligible beneficiaries.

This new contract will replace Illinois' existing Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative, which currently covers approximately 73,000 beneficiaries. With the go-live date set for Jan. 1, 2026, Molina Healthcare of Illinois stands to gain from the transition as it strengthens its foothold in the state's healthcare landscape.

In December 2024, MOH secured wins by expanding its services to dual-eligible populations in Michigan and Idaho. Contract wins like these are expected to increase the overall membership and drive premiums. Premiums remain the most significant contributor to a health insurer's top line. As of Dec. 31, 2024, MOH's Medicaid and Medicare membership grew 7.7% and 40.7% year over year, respectively. For 2025, management estimates Medicaid and Medicare membership to be around 5 million and 250,000, respectively.

By integrating care services more efficiently under the new D-SNP model, Molina Healthcare can enhance patient outcomes while streamlining operations, potentially driving cost savings and improved member retention. This latest success reaffirms Molina Healthcare's commitment to serving vulnerable populations and positions the company for continued expansion in the competitive healthcare market. It expects total revenues to rise approximately 8% year over year in 2025.

Shares of Molina Healthcare have gained 7.6% over the past three months compared with the industry's 3.1% growth. MOH currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Former Bachelorette Katie Thurston is opening up about being diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at age 34.

"You're so devastated. It's so shocking," Thurston told ABC News' Eva Pilgrim in an interview that aired Wednesday on "Good Morning America." "As a 34-year-old woman, it's just, you're not prepared."

Thurston, who starred in season 17 of "The Bachelorette" in 2021, said the road to her diagnosis began when she noticed a small lump on one of her breasts, a symptom of breast cancer that she said she initially dismissed.

"When I felt my lump, it was sore, and as women were used to being told like, 'Oh, it's it's probably their time of the month,' or 'Oh, it's from working out,' so I brushed it off for a while," Thurston said. "And then finally I decided to go to the doctor."

After seeking medical care, Thurston said she was diagnosed with Stage 3 triple positive ductal carcinoma, a type of cancer where tumor cells have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 receptors on their surface, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.

For Thurston, the diagnosis meant she would need to undergo chemotherapy before she could have the cancerous tumor removed.

"You're on, like, survival mode. Like, you don't have a choice -- you show up, or you die," Thurston said of her experience being quickly thrust into the world of breast cancer treatment and appointments. "And I hate to say it that way, but, like ... every day you have an appointment, every day you have to show up. You don't have a choice."

Thurston received her diagnosis in February, just a few months after she became engaged to comedian Jeff Acuri. Instead of planning their wedding, she said she and Acuri began planning for their future in a different way.

"We thought we'd be planning a wedding. We thought we'd be trying for a baby," she said. "And instead, we know that this year is really dedicated to just treatment and getting better."

Thurston said she chose to harvest her eggs following her diagnosis in case she and Acuri try to have a child together in the future.

"We've done everything we can to be, you know, proactive for our future and our family plans," she said, adding that she and Acuri are also OK if their proactive steps ultimately don't work. "But in the event that IVF didn't work out, in the event that chemo did impact me in a negative way when it comes to my reproductive health, we're also OK being a childless couple."

Former 'Bachelorette' star Katie Thurston and Blake Moynes split

Thurston shared her breast cancer diagnosis publicly in an Instagram post on Feb. 15, writing that she found support and hope after her diagnosis in the stories of other women who also faced breast cancer.

Thurston told Pilgrim that she hopes sharing her story encourages people to be proactive about their own breast health.

"I think that's the biggest takeaway, is telling people like, 'Don't wait,' you know, 'Be proactive, get checked out,'" she said. "You could be doing yourself a favor in the future."

Most women with average risk should start screening for breast cancer at age 40, and get screened every other year through age 74, according to guidance from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed group of experts whose conclusions guide medical decision making and determine some insurance policies.

Breast cancer screening tools include a mammogram, which is an X-ray of the breast.

Dense breast tissue may make a mammogram more difficult to interpret, and may make detecting cancer more difficult, according to the National Institutes of Health. Women with dense breasts may be called back for follow-up testing, including ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

Women at higher risk of getting breast cancer may also receive an MRI scan.

Throughout their lifetime, women should also watch for new lumps, skin changes and nipple changes, including unusual discharge, pain, and redness.

Over 10 years, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability care providers. But intense pressures to turn a profit could harm quality, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.

Private equity firms have recently come under fire for their role in healthcare, including their management of hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

However, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says the financiers' inroads into disability care, which manages services including residential care, home health and personal assistance, is just as troubling, but has yet to garner attention.

Private equity firms are attracted to the industry because of growing demand for care, high levels of fragmentation across disability care, and its expected recession-resistant nature, according to the report.

But patients in disability care centers tend to be some of the most disadvantaged, and often have multiple comorbities, making them unable to stand up for themselves in cases of questionable management practices. The report accuses private equity firms of neglecting or abusing patients, adding that poor care is possible in part due to regulatory loopholes that allows for varying safety standards.

“Private equity firms are fundamentally altering these services in ways that put some of the most vulnerable members of our communities at risk,” said Eileen O'Grady, director of programs at PESP and lead author of the report, in a statement. “The private equity model prioritizes short-term financial gains, often at the expense of staffing levels, service quality, and even basic client safety.”

Investigations in Florida, Indiana, California and Illinois found cost-cutting measures by private equity firms led to problems that impacted patient care, including severe understaffing and improper use of restraints at some facilities. 

The watchdog organization said intense pressures to cut costs are in part to blame for the failures. In some cases, while the facilities were accused of neglecting patients, they were simultaneously funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to investors through debt-funded dividends. 

For example, Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group paid themselves more than $600 million in dividends from Sevita and Help at Home, even as the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says care standards declined.

In some cases cost-cutting measures resulted in direct harm to patients.

Regulators shut down Broadstep Behavioral Health group homes in Illinois after finding “significant deficiencies” in medication management, staff training and safety measures, including repeat violations in safety drills and deficient cleanliness. In Indiana, a patient reportedly died of neglect after weighing just 71 pounds at a facility run by Help at Home, according to the report.

“Home and community-based services are essential for hundreds of thousands of Americans with disabilities,” O'Grady said. “Private equity ownership imperils the effective delivery of these services and puts individuals with disabilities at risk.”

Regulators' assessment of customer support centers has spurred recent lawsuits from insurers. But the metric “is going to have a smaller weighting on star ratings moving forward,” the director of Medicare said.

This week, several vendors are partnering up and validating new tools to scale cybersecurity protections for providers, payers and healthcare innovators. 

Google announced on March 18 that it has signed an agreement to acquire Israeli cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion – it's the biggest and most expensive acquisition it's ever made.

The rapidly growing startup's technology will enable Google Cloud to improve cloud security and scale security across multiple clouds, the company says.

The Wiz security platform connects to all major clouds and code environments and can be used by organizations of all sizes to secure platforms they build and run in the cloud. 

"Enabling more companies to prevent cyberattacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents," Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, said in a statement.

"Businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions and greater choice in cloud computing providers," Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, said in a statement. "Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds."

The company's products will remain available on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and other platforms.

Nashville-based Clearwater said Tuesday that it is the first CancerX member company to focus on advancing cybersecurity and data privacy in oncology innovation. 

The company said it will contribute its expertise and resources to educate the public-private partnership's community members, including the recently announced 2025 Accelerator cohort. 

Clearwater will work with the cohort on building cybersecurity and privacy programs that align with best practices and healthcare industry standards.

"Clearwater is honored to join such a prestigious group of organizations that are dedicated to addressing critical challenges in oncology," Steve Cagle, the company's CEO, said in a statement. "As a champion, our role is to help ensure that innovation advances unabated by concern over the security and privacy of data and systems."

CancerX is hosted by the Moffitt Cancer Center, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.

DrFirst, a provider of end-to-end medication management solutions, announced Tuesday that all of its medication management products are now HITRUST-certified and protect against current and emerging threats. 

With validated controls, customers can address cybersecurity challenges and remain cyber-resilient over time, the company said. The controls protect and effectively manage data, mitigate information and cybersecurity risks, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including HIPAA requirements. 

"Strong cybersecurity measures are essential to protecting our organization and the stakeholders who rely on us," G. Cameron Deemer, CEO of DrFirst, said in a statement.

Both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly are pushing for healthcare reforms to provide price transparency and authorization efficiency for patients across the state, but questions remain about whether the House and Senate will unite in their proposals to approve health reform legislation during the 2025 session.

The Care First Act aims to eliminate red tape that causes delays in the authorization process that patients must endure in order to receive treatment. House Bill 434 requires timely decisions so that patients and doctors are not left wondering for weeks or months if the patient will receive the needed authorization for treatment coverage. 

The House proposal aims to reform the broken prior authorization process in North Carolina's healthcare system, which has become a major barrier for doctors and patients seeking timely care. During a recent press conference, the bill's sponsors and supporters from the medical community emphasized the need to restore doctors' authority in making medical decisions for their patients without unnecessary delays from insurance companies.

Representative Grant Campbell, R-Cabarrus, a practicing physician, highlighted that physicians currently spend an average of 13 hours per week navigating prior authorizations, which leads to delays and negatively impacts patient care. He shared a personal example of a six-week delay in surgery for a patient due to repeated authorization hindrances. Campbell pointed out that physicians sometimes have to appeal to out-of-field non-specialists, such as psychiatrists, for approval on treatments that require specialized knowledge in a different area of medicine.

“On one side, you have the doctor and the patient who have easily known each other for years,” explained Campbell. “That same doctor has examined them, discussed their options, looked at their testing; and on the other side, you have someone sitting in a cubicle in a corporate office that may be a physician, may not be a physician, may be in your specialty, may not be in your specialty, may be seeing patients anymore, and may not be seeing patients. The parade of people that are trying to interfere with the relationship with the patient and their physician has got to stop, and this is one of the great first steps to do that.”

The bill, supported by various medical organizations such as the North Carolina Medical Society and the NC Health Care Association, aims to streamline the authorization process. It also requires health insurers to consult with the doctors prior to a denial, in addition to setting time frames and minimum clinical standards.

The bill would purportedly save $1.8 billion annually, as the state health plan's reduces procedures requiring prior authorization from 2,600 to 1,600..

The House effort comes one day after senators introduced two bills targeting health care, which will be merged together during the committee process. Senate Bill 316, Lower Healthcare Costs, would help North Carolinians understand the costs and fees associated with their healthcare services by requiring disclosures for billable items. The price transparency would incentivize customers to shop around, say bill sponsors. 

The legislation takes other steps to reduce costs as well, such as tasking the state auditor with reviewing facility prices, deregulation to allow more dentists to practice more freely, and eliminating Certificate of Need review for inpatient rehab.

Senate Bill 315, More Transparency/Efficiency in Utilization Reviews, proposes reforms to prior authorization practices to keep costs down and ensure timely care. The bill requires urgent health care services to be reviewed in 24 hours or less, codifies the appeals process, and requires that any doctor conducting a review be actively licensed in that specialty for at least three consecutive years, according to a press release. 

“In order to make the best decisions for their care, patients need to have all of the information about their procedure at their fingertips,” said bill sponsor Sen. Amy Galey, R-Alamance. “Shedding light on the true costs of healthcare is good for patients and providers. These proposals will provide much-needed transparency for North Carolinians when they're making decisions about their health.”

The bills will be heard in the Senate Health Care Committee on Wednesday. While similar prior authorization legislation passed the House unanimously in 2023, the bill stalled in the Senate.

“We would like to applaud the efforts by both the House and Senate leadership to bring these issues to the forefront,” said a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina. “We support their efforts to work with stakeholders to hold everyone accountable for the costs and access to health care. We appreciate the efforts to respond to North Carolinians' frustrations with the health care system. We are committed to keeping health care affordable and look forward to working with anyone who shares that goal.”

Rep. Timothy Reeder, R-Pitt, expressed optimism that the Senate has acknowledged the issue of prior authorization in healthcare, but he also noted that the House bill includes several key provisions absent in the Senate's version, such as requirements for insurers to disclose authorization criteria, a shorter processing time, and a mandate for peer reviewers to be licensed in North Carolina. 

“There's a number of things that I'm hopeful that the Senate will consider as we debate both bills and move them forward,” said Reeder. “But I just really am happy and thankful that the Senate acknowledges that this is an issue that we need to deal with.”


						North Carolina could soon recognize November as Military Appreciation Month after the state House passed a bill unanimously on Tuesday aiming to honor those in the military.					


						With a little more than two months under his belt, North Carolina Democrat Gov. Josh Stein is in a strong honeymoon phase with approval ratings north of 50%. Stein is on par with previous governors at the beginning of their tenure, leading Cooper by five points, and trailing McCrory by one.					


						If a regulation created by officials in the executive branch is going to have significant economic impacts upward of $1 million, then the North Carolina General Assembly should have a statutory role in approving the proposed rule, said lawmakers on Tuesday. 					


						North Carolina Democrats are pushing to restore public access to General Assembly records, challenging Republican-led restrictions from 2023 that limited transparency in state government.

MISSOULA, Mont. – Concerns over healthcare funding brought dozens of protesters to the office of U.S. Senator Steve Daines in Missoula. The demonstration took place outside the Union Club, where activists gathered to express their worries about potential budget cuts.

Protesters held signs with messages like "Save Medicaid" and "Care, Not Cuts." The protest was in response to discussions on Capitol Hill regarding possible reductions in healthcare program funding.

Celeste Thompson, a home health worker who joined the protest, shared her concerns. "My job is on the line because I do home health and Medicaid dollars pays my wages," she said. "My clients and that... they... they will lose their hours, and then that will make me lose my hours."

In response to the protest, a spokesperson for Senator Daines provided a statement. "Senator Daines supports Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. He also supports efforts to address waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs – the same stance as President Trump. Senator Daines has been in close contact with the DOGE team and believes they are doing important work identifying instances of wasteful spending, and then the appropriate agencies are able to decide what to do from there."

Protesters say they will continue to push for answers, while Senator Daines' office focuses on addressing waste in the system.

DispatchHealth CEO Jennifer Webster will lead the combined company once the deal closes, which is expected in mid-2025.

Medically Home will become part of DispatchHealth when the deal closes, according to a press release. The combined company will employ more than 2,200 people, more than half of which will be frontline care team members, a Medically Home spokesperson told Healthcare Dive.

Jennifer Webster, CEO of DispatchHealth who joined the company in 2023, will lead the merged firm, the spokesperson said.

The merger is designed to help the systems expand care access, lower costs and improve capacity, according to Webster.

Founded in 2013, Denver-based DispatchHealth offers same-day medical care, recovery services after a hospitalization or serious health issue, and hospital-level care in the home.

The company has raised hundreds of millions in venture capital dollars, including a $330 million equity and debt financing round in late 2022. 

Boston-based Medically Home has also raised significant venture capital investment, including its most recent $110 million raise about three years ago. 

The startup provides a platform and support services for providers — including Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Yale New Haven Health and Cleveland Clinic — to deliver advanced care in patients' homes. More than 55,000 patients have received hospital-level services through the company's program, according to the company.

Delivering advanced healthcare at home isn't a new concept, but interest in the care model increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as an influx of patients strained hospital capacity. 

To boost available beds during COVID surges, the CMS created the Acute Hospital Care At Home program in 2020, which allowed approved Medicare-certified facilities to provide inpatient level care in patients' homes.

However, the program operates on a temporary waiver, and there's been uncertainty about whether flexibilities will continue indefinitely. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump signed a short-term government funding bill that extends the program through Sept. 30, along with telehealth flexibilities in Medicare.

Published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, the study aimed to provide robust insights into adolescent mental health trajectories in two different cultural contexts by comparing large samples of 11 to 16 years olds in London and Tokyo over time. The two studies are the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) and the Resilience Ethnicity and AdolesCent Mental Health (REACH) cohorts from South London. Both groups collected data in the period 2014 to 2020 and at three different time points as the teenagers grew older. 

Researchers used the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) to measure depressive symptoms. 

In both groups there was a difference between teenage boys and girls in the average level of depressive symptoms and this difference widened year-on-year. In the London sample the gender difference started slightly earlier (evident by 11-12 years) than in the Tokyo sample where it emerged between 11 and 14 years, and the average rate of change in depressive symptoms per year in London girls was around four times greater than among girls in Tokyo. By the age of 16 the difference in depressive symptoms between boys and girls in London was around twice as large as in Tokyo. The average level of depressive symptoms in teenage boys in Tokyo declined between ages of 11 and 16, whereas for boys in London it increased slightly over time, following a similar trajectory to that of teenage girls in Tokyo. 

Our study suggests that from around early adolescence onwards girls have higher levels of depression than boys in both Tokyo and London, but the disparity is larger, starts a bit earlier, and increases at a faster rate in London. The trajectory for boys in London closely mirrors the trajectory for girls in Tokyo. These findings suggest we need to rethink and challenge popular narratives around gender differences in mental health – for example, the idea that girls are naturally or inevitably more likely to struggle with their emotional health – and to understand the contexts and conditions that enable teenage girls and young people to thrive."

Dr. Gemma Knowles, First Author, Lecturer in Epidemiology and Youth Mental Health at IoPPN, King's College London

Currently the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) - an index designed to measure gender equality - ranks UK 15th out of 149 countries while Japan is ranked 125th. However, insights from young co-researchers from both cities suggests there are social influences at play which are not captured in these indexes. For example, teenage girls may assume adult roles and responsibilities at a younger age in London and there are lower levels of violence and crime in Tokyo. There are also differences in socioeconomic and political trends between the two places that could contribute to differences, for example, the prolonged period of austerity in the UK. 

Dr Knowles said: "This a complex area with a multitude of possible factors that may contribute to the difference between girls and boys and between the two places. We need to better understand the social contexts and experiences that give rise to gender inequalities in mental health and the conditions that support teenage girls to thrive. It's also important to understand how these social experiences interplay with young people's physical development at this age." 

An important part of this study was to investigate the extent to which scores derived from the measure SMFQ can be meaningfully and appropriately compared across genders, ages, and contexts. While these tests are not perfect, they found no evidence of incomparable measurement, which suggests that any differences in SMFQ scores between groups are due to real differences in depressive symptoms rather than differences in reporting. 

The study was funded by the Invitation Program for Foreign Researchers at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the ESRC Centre for Society and Mental Health, the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science, and the European Research Council.

Multiple staff members at Wales' biggest hospital are understood to be under investigation after claims that strangers were allowed in to watch surgery on unaware patients. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board is probing what it called "deeply concerning" allegations over practices at University Hospital of Wales' operating theatres.

In January we revealed the health board was undertaking a "comprehensive service review" of the hospital's theatres after claims of a toxic culture, racism, bullying and drug use. At that time we reported on sources' anger that the health board had not properly investigated concerns dating back to 2021 when staff members allegedly allowed their friends and family into theatres to watch surgery with no background checks. Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here.

A spokeswoman for the health board has now told WalesOnline: "During the theatres service review and subsequent investigations, it was identified that previous concerns regarding unauthorised people in theatres had been raised but not thoroughly investigated or completed." She went on to say: "Following the deeply concerning allegations made around allowing members of the public to watch operations, the health board has launched an internal investigation." We understand this is separate to the service review.

Andrew RT Davies, MS for South Wales Central and former leader of the Welsh Tories, said the Welsh Government should intervene to make sure the "shocking" allegations were investigated independently rather than in an internal probe. In response, a Government spokesman said: “Any concern about patient safety must be taken seriously. Cardiff and Vale UHB is undertaking a review of the reported incidents. It is important this is completed and the results considered.”

Speaking about the alleged surgery spectators, one hospital source claimed: "They had no background checks and it was during Covid. The very little PPE [personal protective equipment] was being used by unnecessary people. They would have been a huge infection risk to not only staff but vulnerable patients." They also alleged that staff were told not to speak about the matter and that it was "brushed under the carpet". WalesOnline understands multiple staff members are under investigation in connection to these allegations. When asked about this the health board spokeswoman told us they could not "provide any information regarding ongoing investigations".

When the service review began last October the health board told staff it would likely take 12 to 16 weeks. But the spokeswoman has now told us the review "is taking slightly longer than the anticipated timeframe" as there have been so many comments from staff.

WalesOnline has seen an internal letter sent by the health board's chief operating officer Paul Bostock in January stating: "Over 60 people have come forward to share their experience and thoughts about working in UHW theatres and people have been very measured and very honest." He added that "the allegation about allowing the public to watch operations is of great concern".

Mr Bostock also wrote that meetings with staff had made "clear there are clearly deep-seated issues which we will address in order to make theatres an attractive place to work and which provides high quality care to our patients". He asked employees to "resist engaging in public commentary on social media but to use the correct channels for addressing concerns".

One source claimed the concerns over operations being watched had been "raised so many times" since the pandemic, adding: "It's only now being taken seriously and investigated after the WalesOnline article". In response, the health board spokeswoman said: "We take the allegations of all colleagues, and those reported in WalesOnline, extremely seriously and we are now in the process of completing the internal review and investigating all concerns raised, regardless of the historic nature of these allegations."

The service review is investigating "serious concerns" over staff turnover, leadership, and "values and behaviours". A whistleblower claimed to WalesOnline that the health board was prompted to act after a staff survey revealed widespread anger over a toxic culture that had allegedly plagued the hospital's theatres for years. They claimed that recent staff turnover had been "huge" because of alleged bullying.

We previously reported allegations that one member of staff had been suspended after saying a group of Indian nurses needed name badges as they "all looked the same". Sources claimed the staff member returned from suspension and took diversity classes but was then suspended again over further allegations of bullying and racism.

One whistleblower claimed: "The department since the start of Covid has turned into the wild west. A member of staff was caught with the drug speed in their locker, suspended, then allowed back, and is still there now. There's a big increase in 'never events' [serious, preventable safety incidents] as experienced staff have left due to the way [the theatres] are managed. There are no experienced theatre staff to teach juniors."

The health board spokeswoman said "all colleagues affected" by the service review would receive the final report and recommendations when available, adding: “We are committed to providing a positive and equitable working environment for all colleagues. As part of our Speaking Up Safely process, we encourage all colleagues to speak up and raise any concerns they have with the confidence that their voices will be heard and suggestions acted upon.”

She continued: "There are occasions when members of the public have viewed operations, instances include, filming for Saving Lives in Cardiff and for media packages, but we would like to reassure colleagues, patients and their families that these are subject to strict policies and protocols that are adhered to at all times, especially in relation to patient consent."

University Hospital of Wales, in the Heath area of Cardiff, contains 12 theatres. The theatres department cares for children and adults undergoing surgery. Its work includes surgery and anaesthesia for emergencies, trauma and orthopaedics.

ATLANTA, March  19, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rimidi, a market-leading digital health company that supports healthcare providers in the delivery of remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management with EHR-integrated software, services, and connected devices, has introduced Rimidi 2.0, a next-generation platform enhancement designed to address the increasing complexity of healthcare delivery. 

While Rimidi's platform already enables clients to configure alerts, risk scores, and triage statuses to align with their specific protocols, care team structures, and clinical priorities — such as Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM) — Rimidi 2.0 takes these capabilities even further. With enhanced scalability, strengthened data security, expanded device integration, and a flexible framework designed for the rapid adoption of emerging technologies like AI, the upgraded platform provides both clinical and IT teams with a future-ready solution to optimize patient care, streamline workflows, and improve operational efficiency.

“Virtual care is evolving faster than ever, and healthcare organizations face mounting pressure to meet new demands while delivering excellent patient care,” said Lucienne Ide, MD, PhD, Founder and CEO of Rimidi. “Rimidi 2.0 supports today's needs and is designed to scale as the industry changes. This ensures providers can stay agile with expanding payment models, new workflows, and the rapid adoption of connected health devices.”

As the demand for more flexible and feature-rich healthcare platforms grows, Rimidi 2.0 meets the challenge by improving adaptability, cybersecurity, and overall performance. It is built on a microservices framework, a software architecture model that makes it easy to expand and enhance the platform over time. Instead of operating as a large static system, the platform is divided into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function. This means growing healthcare organizations can add capabilities quickly and efficiently without disrupting existing workflows — allowing them to get more value from their technology investments.

“The new framework is cleaner and more dynamic, allowing for rapid integration or adoption of emerging capabilities – whether that's AI, new advanced sensors or medical devices, or new policies surrounding reimbursable care models,” said Catriona Tarto, Vice President of Technology at Rimidi.

In addition to scalability, the upgraded platform supports several key pillars of healthcare, including:

Seamless Integration and Data Standardization with Connected Health Technologies





Enhanced Clinical Trial Support for Chronic Disease Research





Optimized Financial Sustainability through Reimbursable Care Models





With Rimidi 2.0, providers gain a more efficient, integrated, and future-proof solution designed to simplify workflows, enhance clinical decision-making, and improve care quality. The new version's launch underscores Rimidi's mission to equip healthcare organizations with the tools needed to thrive in a rapidly transforming industry.

As Saskatchewan awaits details of the 2025-26 provincial budget, the state of health care in the province is front of mind for many.

The government will “continue to deliver better access to health care and deliver on our commitment to increase the number of surgeries performed annually to reduce wait times,” Premier Scott Moe said in a social media post Monday.

His post went on to say that his government will “build on investments,” like the $15-million recently announced for the expansion, renovation and equipment upgrades at Saskatoon's City Hospital, and shorten surgical wait times “by ensuring 450,000 surgeries are performed over the next four years.”

But the Opposition has its doubts.

Saskatchewan has “fallen to the back of the pack” when it comes to health care, the NDP said in a news release issued Tuesday.

Saskatchewan to unveil first budget since class-complexity ruling

Saskatchewan's 2025-26 budget: Municipal revenue sharing to see an increase

“We need more doctors, nurses, and frontline health care workers — but instead of fixing the crisis, the Sask. Party is driving workers out and expanding the bureaucracy,” said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat in the release.

And the Opposition's critic for the status of women took issue with the fact that some Saskatchewan patients have had to go out of province for breast cancer screening.

“It shouldn't be too much to ask for a mammogram close to home,” Brittney Senger said in the release.

In late 2023, former health minister Everett Hindley said out-of-province mammogram referrals to a clinic in Calgary was a short term solution to cut down on surgical wait times. In February, the government renewed its contract with that clinic to continue referrals until March 31, 2026.

The province also announced multiple initiatives in 2024 relating to breast cancer care and screening, including a new Breast Health Centre in Regina, which is slated to open in spring 2025.

The 2024-25 budget allocated some $7.6-billion toward health. When released in March 2024, the government said that budget was intended to “stabilize” the health sector. But despite ongoing work through the province's Health Human Resources Action Plan (meant to recruit and retain health-care workers) and capacity pressure action plans put in place in Regina and Saskatoon, health-care unions have continued to ring alarm bells over staffing shortages, high patient numbers and overflowing emergency rooms.

The 2025-26 budget will be unveiled Wednesday afternoon.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Chang Robotics, an autonomous technology and engineering leader, is excited to introduce Curabotics, a new company dedicated to improving healthcare through automation, robotics, and AI. Curabotics seeks to transform hospital systems by addressing critical healthcare challenges, including labor shortages, burnout, inefficiencies, rising costs, and patient outcomes.

In response to inquiries regarding their new company, Chang Robotics' president and Curabotics co-founder, Kate McAfoose, shared, "Curabotics will focus exclusively on healthcare automation. In addition to our already proven Nurse-Assist robots and robotic pharmacy, Curabotics offers a comprehensive range of technology to improve efficiency, diagnostics, and patient outcomes."

"We have invited the best technology providers in the industry to participate in our platform," McAfoose added. "My mom is a career RN, so using our robotic capabilities to get this right is personal for me."

The name Curabotics, derived from the Latin word "Cura" (meaning "care"), reflects the company's mission to enhance patient care through robotics and automation.

Proven Results: The Need for Automation in Healthcare

The demand for hospital automation has never been more urgent. Staff shortages reached critical levels in 2024, with replacement costs exceeding $53,250 per nurse. When we examine the issues of staff shortages, burnout, early retirement, and turnover among licensed professionals (such as technicians, nurses, physician assistants, and doctors), the costs are staggering: each major hospital loses between $21 million and $43 million annually due to workforce issues. Conversely, every gain in operational efficiency creates significant additional revenue and opportunities.

A two-year pilot study conducted by Chang Robotics at a leading U.S. hospital demonstrated the impact of automation on nurse workload and patient care. The study identified a time savings of up to 40% when hospitals implement multiple robotic functions, allowing healthcare professionals to dedicate more time to direct patient care. 

Thus far, Curabotics has achieved the following use cases:

Use Case 1 - the Nurse-Assist Bots resulted in:

Use Case 2 - the Robotic Pharmacy resulted in:

Use Case 3 – the "autonomous building" resulted in robotic control of:

In all, we anticipate the Curabotics solutions will have a massive impact on efficiency and profitability gains in the coming seasons for healthcare organizations of every size.

A Holistic Approach to Healthcare Innovation

Curabotics will leverage deep engineering expertise and successful track record to develop and deploy innovative automation solutions tailored to the healthcare industry. The company offers a comprehensive suite of technologies to streamline hospital workflows and improve patient care. Key offerings include:

Process Automation:

Diagnostic & Surgery Innovation:

These solutions allow hospitals to improve operational efficiency and lessen the burden on providers, while unlocking new data insights.

Leadership Spotlight: Riyad Twahir, Managing Director of Curabotics

Riyad Twahir will lead the new company as the managing director of Curabotics. With a background in process transformation, enterprise technology solutions, and autonomous robotic systems, Twahir brings a vision for scaling automation to enhance healthcare efficiency. "I'm very excited about this opportunity to address the systemic issues in healthcare. These are universal problems, and I look forward to collaborating with healthcare partners to provide business-driven solutions that improve patient care," said Riyad Twahir.

A new guide from Relatient offers a checklist for healthcare providers to identify data that matters most so they can make more informed decisions.

Operational efficiency relies on understanding the right data. Failing to ensure your healthcare practice is monitoring the correct data means that inefficiencies can go unnoticed, driving provider burnout, staff overload, patient dissatisfaction, and missed opportunities for growth.

A healthcare practice's contact center plays a crucial role to ensure that improvements translate into a frictionless patient experience. For example, the rate at which waitlisted patients are successfully scheduled into newly available appointment slots can mean the difference between wasted opportunities for both providers and patients, and ensuring that provider time isn't wasted and patients receive timely care.

A new report from Relatient offers a checklist designed to help healthcare organizations optimize their performance.

“Patients expect more control and convenience throughout their healthcare experiences,” observed Relatient Chief Product Officer David Dyke in the report. “Empowering them with easy-to-use self-scheduling demonstrates a deep understanding of patient perspective early in the care journey, laying the groundwork for high patient satisfaction and optimal practice efficiency by reducing back-and-forth of appointment management for which healthcare is sadly famous for.”

As Congress mulls potentially massive cuts to federal Medicaid funding, health centers that serve Native American communities, such as the Oneida Community Health Center near Green Bay, Wisconsin, are bracing for catastrophe.

That's because more than 40% of the about 15,000 patients the center serves are enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would be detrimental to those patients and the facility, said Debra Danforth, the director of the Oneida Comprehensive Health Division and a citizen of the Oneida Nation.

"It would be a tremendous hit," she said.

The facility provides a range of services to most of the Oneida Nation's 17,000 people, including ambulatory care, internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics. The tribe is one of two in Wisconsin that have an "open-door policy," Danforth said, which means that the facility is open to members of any federally recognized tribe.

But Danforth and many other tribal health officials say Medicaid cuts would cause service reductions at health facilities that serve Native Americans.

Indian Country has a unique relationship to Medicaid, because the program helps tribes cover chronic funding shortfalls from the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans.

Medicaid has accounted for about two-thirds of third-party revenue for tribal health providers, creating financial stability and helping facilities pay operational costs. More than a million Native Americans enrolled in Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program also rely on the insurance to pay for care outside of tribal health facilities without going into significant medical debt. Tribal leaders are calling on Congress to exempt tribes from cuts and are preparing to fight to preserve their access.

"Medicaid is one of the ways in which the federal government meets its trust and treaty obligations to provide health care to us," said Liz Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, a nonprofit policy advocacy organization for 33 tribes spanning from Texas to Maine. Malerba is a citizen of the Mohegan Tribe.

"So we view any disruption or cut to Medicaid as an abrogation of that responsibility," she said.

Tribes face an arduous task in providing care to a population that experiences severe health disparities, a high incidence of chronic illness, and, at least in western states, a life expectancy of 64 years — the lowest of any demographic group in the U.S. Yet, in recent years, some tribes have expanded access to care for their communities by adding health services and providers, enabled in part by Medicaid reimbursements.

During the last two fiscal years, five urban Indian organizations in Montana saw funding growth of nearly $3 million, said Lisa James, director of development for the Montana Consortium for Urban Indian Health, during a webinar in February organized by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families and the National Council of Urban Indian Health.

The increased revenue was "instrumental," James said, allowing clinics in the state to add services that previously had not been available unless referred out for, including behavioral health services. Clinics were also able to expand operating hours and staffing.

Montana's five urban Indian clinics, in Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls, and Billings, serve 30,000 people, including some who are not Native American or enrolled in a tribe. The clinics provide a wide range of services, including primary care, dental care, disease prevention, health education, and substance use prevention.

James said Medicaid cuts would require Montana's urban Indian health organizations to cut services and limit their ability to address health disparities.

American Indian and Alaska Native people under age 65 are more likely to be uninsured than white people under 65, but 30% rely on Medicaid compared with 15% of their white counterparts, according to KFF data for 2017 to 2021. More than 40% of American Indian and Alaska Native children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, which provides health insurance to kids whose families are not eligible for Medicaid. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

A Georgetown Center for Children and Families report from January found the share of residents enrolled in Medicaid was higher in counties with a significant Native American presence. The proportion on Medicaid in small-town or rural counties that are mostly within tribal statistical areas, tribal subdivisions, reservations, and other Native-designated lands was 28.7%, compared with 22.7% in other small-town or rural counties. About 50% of children in those Native areas were enrolled in Medicaid.

The federal government has already exempted tribes from some of Trump's executive orders. In late February, Department of Health and Human Services acting general counsel Sean Keveney clarified that tribal health programs would not be affected by an executive order that diversity, equity, and inclusion government programs be terminated, but that the Indian Health Service is expected to discontinue diversity and inclusion hiring efforts established under an Obama-era rule.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also rescinded the layoffs of more than 900 IHS employees in February just hours after they'd received termination notices. During Kennedy's Senate confirmation hearings, he said he would appoint a Native American as an assistant HHS secretary. The National Indian Health Board, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for tribes, in December endorsed elevating the director of the Indian Health Service to assistant secretary of HHS.

Jessica Schubel, a senior health care official in Joe Biden's White House, said exemptions won't be enough.

"Just because Native Americans are exempt doesn't mean that they won't feel the impact of cuts that are made throughout the rest of the program," she said.

State leaders are also calling for federal Medicaid spending to be spared because cuts to the program would shift costs onto their budgets. Without sustained federal funding, which can cover more than 70% of costs, state lawmakers face decisions such as whether to change eligibility requirements to slim Medicaid rolls, which could cause some Native Americans to lose their health coverage.

Tribal leaders noted that state governments do not have the same responsibility to them as the federal government, yet they face large variations in how they interact with Medicaid depending on their state programs.

President Donald Trump has made seemingly conflicting statements about Medicaid cuts, saying in an interview on Fox News in February that Medicaid and Medicare wouldn't be touched. In a social media post the same week, Trump expressed strong support for a House budget resolution that would likely require Medicaid cuts.

The budget proposal, which the House approved in late February, requires lawmakers to cut spending to offset tax breaks. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees spending on Medicaid and Medicare, is instructed to slash $880 billion over the next decade. The possibility of cuts to the program that, together with CHIP, provides insurance to 79 million people has drawn opposition from national and state organizations.

The federal government reimburses IHS and tribal health facilities 100% of billed costs for American Indian and Alaska Native patients, shielding state budgets from the costs.

Because Medicaid is already a stopgap fix for Native American health programs, tribal leaders said it won't be a matter of replacing the money but operating with less.

"When you're talking about somewhere between 30% to 60% of a facility's budget is made up by Medicaid dollars, that's a very difficult hole to try and backfill," said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.

Congress isn't required to consult tribes during the budget process, Davis added. Only after changes are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state agencies are tribes able to engage with them on implementation.

The amount the federal government spends funding the Native American health system is a much smaller portion of its budget than Medicaid. The IHS projected billing Medicaid about $1.3 billion this fiscal year, which represents less than half of 1% of overall federal spending on Medicaid.

"We are saving more lives," Malerba said of the additional services Medicaid covers in tribal health care. "It brings us closer to a level of 21st century care that we should all have access to but don't always."

Union Health is making a new bid to Indiana regulators to buy its rival hospital in Terre Haute as the door looks poised to close on such deals.

The nonprofit health system is trying to leverage an existing state law to acquire Terre Haute Regional Hospital, the only other acute care hospital in Vigo County. After withdrawing its initial application in November amid pushback, Union has shifted its pitch to emphasize what it describes as Regional's "declining position" while offering more concrete promises, such as limits on price increases.

Union submitted its new application on Feb. 5 as Indiana lawmakers were attempting to nix such mergers in their state. Lawmakers then watered down a bill that threatened to forbid Union's deal altogether, with the amended legislation now barring mergers sought after Feb. 15, leaving an opening for Union. That means the proposed merger will next face a showdown with the administration of Indiana's new governor, which has signaled opposition to such deals.

Indiana is among the latest states reconsidering Certificate of Public Advantage laws that greenlight hospital monopolies. This year, Tennessee lawmakers introduced a bill to restructure state oversight of these mergers after an attempt last year to repeal its COPA law. In 2023, Maine repealed its COPA law, joining Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, and North Dakota.

"I would hope that they are reconsidering the laws because of the research on the long-run harms of COPAs," said Christopher Garmon, a University of Missouri-Kansas City economist who has studied COPA mergers.

Indiana is one of 19 states that still have COPA laws, which allow mergers that the Federal Trade Commission otherwise considers illegal because they reduce competition and often create monopolies.

In exchange for approval of these deals, the merging hospitals typically agree to meet conditions imposed by their state to mitigate the harms of a monopoly. But health care economists and the FTC have said that state oversight cannot replace competition and that these mergers ultimately harm patients.

Union Health's first application faced pushback. The state's Department of Health received hundreds of comments, with most opposing the deal, according to a review of documents KFF Health News obtained through a state public records request. Doctors, health economists, and the FTC were among those who called on state regulators to deny Union's proposal.

Union pulled its application in November, just days before the state was due to rule on the deal.

When Union filed its new application in early February, this time it promised a slew of concrete commitments and pledges to improve residents' health in the largely rural communities that surround Terre Haute. Among them were promises to keep both hospitals' emergency rooms open and inpatient services in operation, and to tie increases in hospital charges to the consumer price index for medical care, essentially establishing a cap so charges don't exceed medical inflation.

It also recast its pitch to describe Regional as a hospital in decline, which Union said puts the region at risk of losing access to services if the merger is not approved. Tennessee-based HCA Healthcare owns Terre Haute Regional.

In that scenario, Union warned, if Regional were to close, the health system would essentially have a monopoly anyway, "without any oversight, terms, or conditions" of a COPA. Instead, it argued, a green light from state regulators could avert a hospital closure and guarantee state oversight of the combined hospital system.

Union's first application did not argue that the merger was necessary for Regional to remain viable. In public comments submitted in September and March, the FTC argued to state regulators that both hospitals are "financially stable," adding that Regional is "part of the largest hospital system in the country with tremendous financial resources." It also cited hospital financial reporting that showed Terre Haute Regional Hospital's profits were better than those of most other hospitals in the country.

"This repackaged COPA application presents the same problems as before," Clarke Edwards, acting director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, said in a statement on March 17 after the commission unanimously opposed the merger.

HCA did not respond to questions about Union's characterization that Regional is a hospital in decline.

Despite Union's assurances that the merger would benefit the region, an analysis of the first proposal found the opposite. Zack Cooper, a health economist and an associate professor at Yale University, estimated that the price of care would rise by at least 10%, 500 jobs would be lost, and nurses' pay would decline by at least 7%.

Despite the new application and new promises, "the nature of the deal hasn't changed," Cooper said. He said that his findings remain unchanged and that Union stands to benefit — not the community.

"Life is easier for a firm if you face less competition," he said. "There's less pressure to compete on quality. There's less pressure to compete on price."

In January, state Sen. Ed Charbonneau, a Republican and a key architect of Indiana's 2021 COPA law, introduced the legislation to repeal the law, which would have foreclosed Union's chance at a possible second attempt at the merger.

In February, seated side by side at a state Senate health committee hearing, Union Health CEO Steve Holman, Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce President Kristin Craig, and state Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican representing the region, testified against the bill.

Holman told lawmakers the merger would improve the health of the region. He also noted that the hospital system had already spent $3 million on legal fees pursuing the deal. He said it seemed like lawmakers were attempting to cripple Union's chances. "Why has this come up now?" Holman asked.

The bill to repeal the COPA law advanced out of committee by a 7-4 vote. State Sen. Mike Bohacek, a Republican who represents a region a three-hour drive north of Terre Haute, said he voted against repealing the law out of deference to local officials.

"I have no dog in this fight," Bohacek said.

Charbonneau later amended his bill, winning support from Union and Goode. The new version sailed through the Senate. It is now backed by two powerful Republican representatives in the House: Brad Barrett, chair of the Public Health Committee, and Bob Heaton, House majority whip. Heaton represents parts of Vigo County.

Union Health spokesperson Amanda Scott said in an email to KFF Health News that Union and Regional Hospital "recognize the significance of a final approval" and that Union views this as its last chance to acquire its rival.

But Indiana's new governor, Republican Mike Braun, took office in January vowing to crack down on consolidation, especially in health care.

Earlier this year, Braun tapped Gloria Sachdev to lead a newly created Cabinet position overseeing the state's health care agencies, including the state Department of Health, which will decide on the merger.

As CEO of the Employers' Forum of Indiana, a coalition of businesses that has combated high hospital prices, Sachdev was an outspoken critic of the proposed merger in Terre Haute. In an October opinion piece in The Indianapolis Star, she urged regulators to consider how these mergers can crush communities.

Sachdev, now the state's secretary of health and family services, didn't answer questions on the new bid. After KFF Health News asked the governor's office whether Braun has final authority over the fate of Union's merger request, Department of Health spokesperson Greta Sanderson provided a joint statement from the agency and the office of the governor: "Gov. Braun will expect to be informed, ask questions, and ensure that whatever decision is made is thoughtful and objective with the best interests of Hoosiers in mind."

The state has until June 21 to review the merger application before rendering a decision, according to the Department of Health. The public can comment on the proposal through March 23.

Novak Djokovic is searching for a first title of the season at the 2025 Miami Open.

The Serbian star's form hasn't been the best in recent months, as Djokovic heads to Miami on a three-match losing streak.

Djokovic lost to Botic van de Zandschulp most recently at Indian Wells, 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, as he failed to advance to the third round.

He had lost one month earlier to Matteo Berrettini in his opening match at the Qatar Open, suffering his first career defeat against the Italian star.

The world number five will be looking for a much better showing at the Miami Open, as two mightily impressive records are within reach.

Djokovic could break two records at this year's Miami Open if he were to win the title, currently held by two of the ATP Tour's greatest-ever players.

Roger Federer is currently the oldest player to lift the trophy in Miami, doing so as a 37-year-old back in 2019.

If Djokovic wins in Florida later this month, he will do so 78 days older than Federer was when he beat John Isner in 2019. 

That's not the only record Djokovic can break, however, as a seventh title for Djokovic in Miami would see him edge ahead of America's Andre Agassi in the all-time leader board.

The pair are currently level on six, as Agassi dominated at the event during his time as a professional.

Djokovic could break two big records at this year's tournament, but there are several others that his fellow ATP and WTA Tour stars will be eyeing up before too long.

Serena Williams' record of eight singles victories in Miami is perhaps the most ‘unbeatable' of them all, considering just one active player has won multiple titles at the event.

Belarus' Victoria Azarenka is a three-time champion at the Miami Open but is highly unlikely to break the American's record as she approaches the latter stages of her career.

2022 champion and world number two Iga Swiatek looks like the biggest threat to Williams but will need to start racking up the wins if she wants to add another record to her glowing resume.

Only time will tell if she can do so, but she'll first focus on her first-round matchup against either Caroline Garcia or Anna Bondar.

Great Britain's Emma Raducanu cruised to a 6-2 6-1 victory over Japan's wildcard Sayaka Ishii in the first round of the Miami Open on Wednesday.

Raducanu started fast by claiming the opening two games before Ishii found her rhythm and levelled at 2-2 but the Brit reeled off four successive games to take the first set 6-2.

The 2021 US Open champion continued her dominance in the second set, extending her streak of successive games won to nine as her 19-year-old Japanese opponent, ranked 188th in the world, struggled in the Florida sun.

Ishii avoided a whitewash in the second set by holding serve in the sixth game before Raducanu took her first match-point opportunity to claim victory in one hour and five minutes.

It is Raducanu's first victory in Miami and she will face the tournament's eighth seed Emma Navarro in the second round.

Raducanu's win over Ishii saw her improve on disappointment at Indian Wells in her previous tournament appearance, a first-round straight-sets defeat by Moyuka Uchijima.

"I was just so focused on every point and trying to compete, that was my main objective today," Raducanu said on Sky Sports Tennis.

"I was just trying my best on every point and bringing some energy and competitiveness. Maybe that's been missing in the last couple of months, so I was really proud of that and it's nice to win.

"I was playing a tough opponent, young wildcards are so dangerous so I was pleased I managed to come through."

Speaking about facing Navarro in the next round, Raducanu said: "She can manoeuvre the ball well and has a lot of variety.

"It is deceiving how hard she hits the backhand especially. We're quite similar in terms of our build and our game I think it'll be an interesting match-up, and one that I'm looking forward to, and I guess right now one I don't have pressure on."

The tennis world now looks somewhat different since the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

For the better part of two decades the pair's rivalry and sustained excellence captivated millions of fans and took the game to new heights.

The pair pushed one another to raise their games and having a solid friendship despite their fierce rivalry was something to behold.

Since November 2024 the ATP Tour has been without both players and the World Number 15 Grigor Dimitrov explains why it feels different.

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, along with Novak Djokovic, dominated tennis perhaps longer than any other players before them.

They broke numerous records and provided fans with plenty of spectacular moments that will live long in the memory.

But since two members of the iconic trio have hung up her rackets, the game has had to adjust without them, and Dimitrov explains what that process looks like and how the tour is now different. 

“For me it's just different. I remember playing Berdych first round, Ferrer [second] round, to play you [Del Potro], Roger, Rafa and someone else in the final. Superman could not do that,” Dimitrov said during a Lacoste roundtable discussion on YouTube.

“So that whole part there were more steadier players, I think the gaps are bigger now in my opinion. Overall I guess I am saying is that the ball park of how everyone is, the gaps [are bigger].

“The aura was also very different, not only from these guys, but the guys who were seven, eight, nine,10, 11. They were players who it requires from you to do well. But I feel like the gaps are way different.

“Of course, the young generation are faster and stronger. I even remember back in the day when I got to the quarters of the Masters it was a huge thing.

“Now you have bigger gaps because the consistency isn't the same. But for me the different part is how different the game that everyone has is, I like that a lot as well.”

Dimitrov struggled against both Federer and Nadal during their illustrious careers.

Between 2009 and 2021, the Bulgarian played against the 14-time French Open winner on 15 occasions, and claimed just one victory.

That came at the 2016 China Open, when Dimitrov beat Nadal 6-2, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals.

Between 2013 and 2019, Dimitrov, who was nicknamed ‘Baby Fed' early in his career due to his playing style mimicking the Swiss Maestro, played Federer eight times.

Federer won seven successive matches, until Dimitrov claimed victory in their final meeting at the 2019 US Open, which went to five sets.

			Top Picks:		

Class 5's race for second

As in most other sports, Hampton Roads tennis teams comprise about half of the state's Class 5 squads, and VHSL bracketing ensures that one of them will reach the state championship match — albeit as an almost-certain underdog to a Richmond or Northern Virginia team. Hickory (19-3 last year) returns its entire top six, led by Will Katchmark, from a team that lost 5-4 in the region final to Cox. The '24 state runner-up Falcons, paced by Sam Dixon moving up a spot; usual Region B boss Maury, led by John Felts; Ocean Lakes and Kellam are among the other top contenders. Junior John-Paul Zano, a two-time region singles runner-up, leads Great Bridge.

Bay Rivers District is stacked

Watch out for Bay Rivers-contending Tabb, which will have two freshmen at the top: John Sunstone, a four-star recruit according to Tennis Recruiting Network, and three-star Jack Hiotellis. Sophomore Neel Dharni, a region singles quarterfinalist last season, and seniors Zain Moussa and Daniel Cho return from a solid team that reached the Class 3 Region A semifinals. But 2024 Class 3 state runner-up Grafton brings back John Lee, half of the state champion doubles team last season, and a solid core alongside him. Lafayette qualified for the state tournament last season. The only problem for these quality Class 3 teams: Western Albemarle, which has won a state team trophy for seven years, looms at the end. Class 4 Jamestown can bring back reigning region singles champ Keean Buirski.

Can Norfolk Academy go even farther?

The Bulldogs seek not only to keep dominating the Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools, but also to contend for the VISAA Division I championship against the likes of Richmond-area power St. Christopher's. Joseph Hobbs returns as the conference's best player, and fellow seniors Will Howerton and Lucas Varverud are back in the lineup after all-conference seasons. Nathan Rafal, Davis Doummar and eighth-grader Atish Akkina also could be a factor against what coach Michael Duquette called “one of the strongest schedules we have had in years.” The Bulldogs, who were 3-5 in non-TCIS duals a year ago and lost in the state quarterfinals, don't shy away from tough competition. They plan to play Hickory, Maury and First Colonial, plus perennial Class 3 state champ Western Albemarle.

Triple Crown Christoph?

Bruton's Christoph Schweitzer, the Class 2 singles runner-up last season, could achieve a rare VHSL “triple crown” of singles, doubles and team trophies. Having won the state doubles last season with former Panther Max de Winter and having led the Panthers to their first team crown, Schweitzer is joined by Alek Rivera this year. Senior starters Talien Barnes and Simphiwe Matibini also are back, and juniors Fernando Moreno and Bryson Jones are set to move into the top six for the first time. “We have the pieces needed to repeat if we grow throughout the season,” coach James Barr said.

Kellam's enthusiasm

Coming off a season when the Knights set a school record with 13 wins but fell 5-3 in the Class 5 Region A first round to First Colonial, “we are going to make some noise this season,” second-year Kellam coach Patrick Conde said. Junior Luke Fraim, French native and sophomore Mael Poitrasson, sophomore Drew McEntarfer, senior first-year player Walker Kieran, junior Easton Ford, senior Garrett Austin and Reed Kindley figure to start. “I encourage my players to yell, scream and celebrate after every point,” Conde said. “High school tennis is too quiet and too posh. … I tell my players all the time, ‘We are not country club kids. We are not even tennis players. We are competitors.'”

___

John Felts, Maury

A junior rated a 2-star prospect by Tennis Recruiting Network, he has trained hard in the offseason and gained valuable experience after being the Class 5 Region B singles runner-up last year. Since he's a Commodore, he's a threat to win a region triple crown.

Joseph Hobbs, Norfolk Academy

The senior occasionally dabbles in other sports, but he's the top dog in the TCIS and was a state Co-Player of the Year last season in VISAA Division I. As good as Norfolk Academy is, he was last season's only all-state Bulldog. If individual VISAA championships existed (they don't), he'd contend for them.

John Lee, Grafton

After teaming with Class 3 state singles champ Rainer Christiansen for the VHSL doubles first-place medals last season, Lee is ready to play No. 1 for the Clippers in one of the state's better districts. In an era with few one-handed backhands, the senior has a good one.

Nolan Macedo, Landstown

Virginia Wesleyan men's basketball coach Dave Macedo's son is a TRN 2-star recruit and the area's best Class 6 and Beach District player, though it will be difficult for the senior to reach the state semifinals because Richmond-area stars stand in the way. Deep Run star Grant Kroodsma — part of the state champion doubles pair last season — beat him 6-3, 6-2 in a 2024 region semi.

John Sunstone, Tabb

He seems like the Peninsula's best freshman in many years, thanks to a national ranking of 119 in his class — he was 73rd in 2022 — and could be an immediate state singles championship contender in Class 3. He figures to give coach Jennifer Wornom's Tigers a quick 1-0 lead on many days by taking his singles match at No. 1.

___

Great Bridge looks for encore or more

Thanks to the area's best top two, senior Kayla Kennedy and junior Chase London, the Wildcats reached the Class 5 state final and were competitive in their 5-2 loss to Douglas Freeman, which is on a four-year title streak. Between singles and doubles, Kennedy and London usually bring three of the five team points needed to win. That means less pressure on other returning players such as Micah Williams, Sarah Allen and Carmen Lewis-Jackson. Freshman Leoni Jones, the expected No. 6, is “very talented,” according to Great Bridge coach Andrea Machesney. “We are hoping for another chance at the state title.”

Class 5 depth

Behind Great Bridge, the race for a second state berth from Class 5 Region A seems wide open. First Colonial upset Great Bridge for the region championship last season but is rebuilding with two seniors among 10 players. One of those seniors is valedictorian Jordan Baker. Hickory coach Ron Weber's Hawks are coming off a 14-2 season, advancing to the region semifinals, though they have to replace three starters. Kellam was 8-4 in the Beach District last year, and coach James Yermal said, “Though our team is young, we should be competitive against all the Beach District schools.” More teams could emerge, too.

Jamestown hopes to continue success

The Eagles won the 2023 state Class 4 title and were Region A champs and state quarterfinalists last year, when they were 13-2 and 9-0 in the Bay Rivers District. They hope to replace Julia Clark, who starred at No. 1 for four years and now plays for Trinity College in Connecticut. Coach Karen Johnson returns three starters and three reserves and brings in eight new players. Senior Scarlett Gamez, who joined Clark in winning the 2024 region doubles title, senior Lyla Smith and juniors Michelle Zhou and Ashley Zhao figure to be among the starters.

State tournament stays home

For the fifth consecutive season, the VHSL Class 4, 5 and 6 team finals for girls (and boys) are scheduled for Huntington Park's 20-court facility in Newport News, next to the James River Bridge. So are the singles and doubles semifinals and championship matches. Former Bethel athletic director and Hampton Roads Academy girls coach Ray Smith again will direct the event from June 12-14.

Rewinding to the fall

Unlike their male counterparts, most girls area private-school teams compete in the fall. Norfolk Academy overcame runner-up Cape Henry Collegiate for the TCIS championship before losing in the VISAA Division I quarterfinals. First-team Andersen Legum and second-team Nora Clingenpeel earned all-state honors for the Bulldogs. Cape Henry then took its second Division II team championship in three years, paced by first-team all-state selections Katie Tserediani and Lauren Yue.

Tori Epps, Menchville

Having recently committed to compete in college for Loyola Maryland, the 3-star senior seeks her third consecutive Class 5 Region B singles title with her two-handed laser groundstrokes on both sides. The 2023 Class 5 singles runner-up also could return to the state tournament in doubles with Erin Pridgen and as the leader of the Monarchs. Her top competition in region singles could come from Granby's Ariana Pazos Delaguila.

Kayla Kennedy, Great Bridge

The 3-star senior has featured consistency since she arrived on the scene as a freshman by surprisingly winning the Class 4 state singles title, and she has added more offense over the last two years while adding two more region singles crowns. Kennedy took the Class 5 Region A triple crown (team, singles and doubles) last year and will contend for it again, and the state tournament figures to overlap some with her graduation.

Chase London, Great Bridge

Athletic, competitive and featuring excellent shot variety, she usually dominates on line 2 singles while playing behind Kennedy in the Wildcats' lineup. London would be No. 1 at about any other area school. Those two have been state doubles runners-up in London's first two years of high school, in different classes. They hope to take the final step this year.

Chloe Samuels, Landstown

The Eagles' powerful No. 1 was among the Beach District's best players as a freshman, and she again should contend for Class 6 Region A honors after reaching the singles and doubles quarterfinals last season.

Deja Thomas, Grassfield

Savvy and fast afoot, the Tennis Recruiting Network 2-star player enjoyed a landmark freshman season, beating the top two players from Richmond-area power Deep Run to take the Class 6 Region A singles championship on her way to the state semifinals. She and Cayley Griffith were the region doubles runners-up, and the Grizzlies were the only Hampton Roads-area team to reach the Class 6 Region A semis.

March 19th, 2025

Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., March 19th, 2025 – The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has announced that Palm Beach County, Florida, will host the prestigious 2025 ITF World Tennis Masters Tour World Championships, presented by Baptist Health, in May. 

This exciting international tennis tournament, will bring together the world's top amateur tennis players from around the globe for two incredible weeks of competition in the men's and women's 65+ and 70+ age divisions for singles, doubles and mixed doubles. The event will encompass both Team and Individual Championships, with the Team Championships featuring teams from over 35 countries, scheduled from May 11 to May 16, 2025, followed by the Individual Championships from May 17 to May 24, 2025.

The tournament will take place across two locations, the Palm Beach Gardens Tennis & Pickleball Center and The Country Club at Mirasol – both renowned for their exceptional facilities.

The championships are expected to draw significant attention to Palm Beach County, highlighting its status as a premier tennis destination and providing an economic boost to the local community. Tennis enthusiasts can look forward to witnessing thrilling matches, as well as enjoying a variety of entertainment and activities throughout the tournament.  In particular, the local community is encouraged to attend the Opening Ceremony to welcome athletes from all across the world on Saturday, May 10th, at 5pm at Palm Beach Gardens Tennis & Pickleball Center (attendance is free of charge).

“The Palm Beach County Sports Commission is proud to bring an international tennis event of this caliber to The Palm Beaches.

Supporting world-class events like this reinforces our commitment to the South Florida sports community, at both amateur and professional levels.”  Trish Faulkner, Tournament Director, commented: “Palm Beach County is a fantastic destination for this tournament. The players always love coming here as the location not only offers world-class facilities but also incredible experiences off the court.” She added: “We couldn't bring this event to life without the support of our dedicated sponsors and host venues, whose commitment helps make this a truly special event for players and the community alike.”  The event is generously supported by Host Sponsor, the Palm Beach County Sports Commission; Presenting Sponsor and Official Healthcare Provider, Baptist Health; and Ace Sponsors, Welch, USTA Florida, and The Gardens Mall (Official Dining and Shopping Destination).

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Ons Jabeur is a three-time Grand Slam finalist with more than $13 million in prize money by age 30, and as she looked out at the main court used for the Miami Open this week and next, she rattled off a lengthy list of things she thinks could be fixed in professional tennis to help all players.

“We need to improve the structure that we have. ... We can do better about the scheduling. The times of matches. There are a lot of tournaments, and health-wise, for the players, I don't think that helps. The balls changing every week is not a good thing. Players deserve to be paid better,” said Jabeur, a member of the executive committee of the Professional Tennis Players' Association, a group co-founded by Novak Djokovic several years ago. “Definitely a lot of things to work on.”

Those issues Jabeur mentioned were among those raised in a class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by the PTPA in federal court in New York on Tuesday, calling the groups in charge of the sport — the women's (WTA) and men's (ATP) tours, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the agency that oversees anti-doping and anti-corruption efforts (ITIA) — a “cartel.”

“The players really do demand to be heard, to have their issues taken seriously, to address these structural issues that plague tennis and really choke it as an international sport,” said PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar, “and to create a system that brings balance and equality and fairness to really the entire business of tennis.”

Here is a look at the lawsuit — and there are similar actions moving forward in Brussels and London — and what it could mean for tennis:




The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil and announced to the world just before the 2020 U.S. Open. The aim was to represent players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport; tennis does not have a full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements as in team sports. 

The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players — women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings — before going to court.

The lawsuit seeks more money for players, yes, and lays out a series of other complaints about the way the sport is run. 

That includes criticisms related to giving too little of the sport's revenues to players, limiting prize money each tournament can offer, preventing competition from rival tours or events, a “45-week-per-year schedule,” the increased number of combined WTA-ATP events that last 12 days apiece, match schedules that sometimes keep players on court well past midnight, a rankings system that restricts which events the athletes enter, and a “heavy-handed approach” by the International Tennis Integrity Agency that the lawsuit termed “arbitrary and selective.” 

“Player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,” Pospisil said.

The PTPA classified the four major events — Wimbledon, U.S. Open, French Open and Australian Open — as co-conspirators that fall under the ITF, rather than making them separate defendants. 

According to the filing, those four Grand Slam tournaments “generated over $1.5 billion collectively in 2024, while only paying between (10% to 20%) of revenue to players.”

But, Nassar said, “The Slams can't unilaterally fix the schedule. They can't fix anti-doping. They can't fix the medical issues. They can't fix the prize money conspiracy and price-fixing that exists at every other level at every other tournament.”

Pospisil is listed as a plaintiff — 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea, Varvara Gracheva, Reilly Opelka and Tennys Sandgren are some of the others — while Djokovic is not. 

“This is about much more than one player,” Nassar said, noting that Djokovic, as a member of the executive committee, is ”very involved, very up to speed.”

The WTA called the filing “regrettable and misguided.” The ATP said the case is “entirely without merit,” and added: “The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. ... The PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.”

As with many a lawsuit, it is hard to know what the long-term effects could be, of course, although this certainly puts in black and white the schism that exists between the sport's leaders and many of its athletes. 

Maybe there will be a settlement? Maybe the players will get nowhere and nothing will be different? Maybe there will be a court ruling that forces change? 

If the latter happens, PTPA lawyer Jim Quinn predicted, “It's going to require a restructuring.”

Australian tennis player John-Patrick Smith was forced to have “a copious amount of his blood” drawn on the eve of an Australian Open match, it has been revealed in an explosive legal action launched by players, including Nick Kyrgios, against tennis' controlling bodies.

The Professional Tennis Players Association, which was co-founded by 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, has lodged lawsuits accusing the sport's authorities of operating like an illegal cartel that colluded to suppress player earnings and disregarded player welfare.

Smith, a doubles specialist who was a finalist in this year's Australian Open mixed doubles event with compatriot Kimberly Birrell, is one of three individually named Australian plaintiffs in a US class action with Kyrgios and Anastasia Rodionova.

The 36-year-old is also used as a case study in documents filed with the US District Court Southern District of New York, with his globetrotting season in 2024 detailed to demonstrate a gruelling and unsustainable schedule faced by players.

Concerns were also raised about the circumstances of a drug test he was subjected to before he played at the Australian Open.

According to court documents, the left-hander was approached by investigators from the International Tennis Integrity Agency on the day before his opening match and required to provide a blood sample.

“Smith was given no reason for the sudden test,” the US court filing said. “Smith was forced to draw a copious amount of his blood, draining him of energy less than 24 hours before he was to begin playing in one of the biggest tournaments of his season.”

Smith was contacted for comment on Wednesday.

The plaintiffs also objected to a drug test that Czech teenager Jakub Mensik had to take midway through a match at the ATP Finals in December that he ended up losing.

The ITIA is listed as a defendant along with the ATP and WTA tours and the International Tennis Federation in antitrust suits filed in the US, United Kingdom and European Union, and came under fire for its anti-corruption and anti-doping processes.

“The ITIA's aggressive, unrelenting, and, at times, illegal investigative processes subject players to dozens of drug tests (both blood and urine), invasive searches of their personal cell phones, hours-long interrogations without counsel, and harassment by unaccountable and ill-trained investigators,” the US action claims.

The ITIA responded in a statement on Wednesday. “Credible international sport requires robust anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, and we are proud of our role in contributing to a clean and fair sport,” it said.

The lawsuit also takes aim at the handling of a doping case involving men's world No.1 and Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who had twice tested positive last year to traces of the prohibited substance clostebol.

The Italian told investigators his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara, had accidentally applied the steroid to his skin while massaging him after Ferrara had used a cream to treat a cut on his own hand.

Sinner was not suspended after an independent tribunal found he bore “no fault or negligence” and let him compete in the US Open, which he won. The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but last month agreed to a deal in which Sinner would serve three months on the sidelines before the French Open after accepting his explanation.

Kyrgios had been scathing of the leniency shown to Sinner and described the penalty as a “sad day for tennis”.

The class action claimed the Sinner affair showed the ITIA's heavy-handed approach was arbitrary and selective.

“There was no investigation that dragged for over a year into a prominent player who had not vocalised any issues with the cartel,” it was stated in the US court documents.

Djokovic himself was not listed as one of the 12 individual plaintiffs in the US but the players association he formed said the action was being taken to tackle a “corrupt” system in which the earnings of the stars were restricted, leading them to be paid far less than top athletes in sports such as American football, basketball and golf.

The ATP and WTA said they rejected the PTPA's claims and would defend their positions vigorously.

“ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game – towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans,” the ATP said.

The WTA said it was “fully committed to continuing to develop and evolve the structure and operations of professional women's tennis, listening closely as always to the views of our players”.

Tennis Australia, which manages the first major of the year, was not named as a co-defendant, but it was alleged players had been forced to play in excessive heat at the Australian Open, placing them “at risk of heat stroke and other harms”.

Matches stretching beyond midnight at the US Open and Australian Open were also raised as a welfare issue by Professional Tennis Players Association executive director Ahmad Nassar. Lleyton Hewitt famously took until 4.34am to finish off Marcos Baghdatis in a five-set thriller at Melbourne Park in 2008.

“I think that's a huge issue for the players because of the health effects of not only playing late into the night and early into the morning, but also actually waiting all day to play ... there is a much higher rate of getting injured,” Nassar told this masthead.

“There has to be a better system than going til 2am, 3am. There is no magic time … but I think we need to have something better than what we currently have, which is just kind of the show must go on.”

The legal bombshell does not question the Australian Open's spot in the tennis calendar. Nassar said most players liked starting the season in Australia and it was the seemingly “never-ending season” running until late in the year that was most problematic.

To address weather conditions, Tennis Australia has brought in a heat stress index and there are now three retractable roofs at Melbourne Park.

There were also changes made at this year's Australian Open to the number of matches in each session and to start times with an eye towards avoiding matches finishing too late.

The PTPA accuses the ATP, WTA, ITF and the ITIA of exploiting tennis players and jeopardising their health and safety.

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.

The PTPA, an independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action to end “monopolistic control” of the sport.

It said in a statement that, along with more than a dozen players, the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

“Tennis is broken,” Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the PTPA, said in the statement. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

“We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

In response, the ATP accused the PTPA of choosing “division and distraction” and having no meaningful role in the sport.

“We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,” the ATP said in a statement.

“ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game – towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for players, tournaments, and fans.”

The WTA defended its record of growing women's tennis, describing the lawsuit as “baseless”.

“Every decision taken at the WTA Board level includes the input of players via their elected Board representatives, and athletes receive substantial financial rewards and other benefits from participation in the WTA,” the organisation said.

Today marks a pivotal moment in the battle for fairness and integrity in tennis.

Meanwhile, Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios believes the lawsuit marks a “special moment” and that it was high time players' voices were heard.

Former Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios, who is among 12 current and former players listed as plaintiffs along with the PTPA in the suit, said the group was determined to do something for the future of the game.

“I know that myself and many of the players aren't happy with the structures and everything that's going on in tennis at the moment,” Kyrgios told Sky Sports.

“This will be a special moment in tennis, for sure.

“Things needed to change. It's a big day for tennis.”

The PTPA was formally established by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2019 to advocate for players.

Pospisil said the PTPA had spoken to more than 250 players and had plenty of support, including from the top players.

“The ATP/WTA has spread so much fear over the years that it's not easy to put your name on this publicly. Player support for this initiative is undeniable,” he added.

While player associations are common in professional sports, tennis is different in that the players operate as independent contractors.

“We're the only sport in the world that doesn't have a players' association. That was the PTPA's first goal, to get the players to be heard,” Kyrgios said.

“The ATP just had so much power, they don't have to show anything to anyone. Now things will have to change, they'll have to show things, how things operate and that's when people really realise that it hasn't really been done correctly.

“I don't think players ultimately have been very happy with what they earn on the tour compared to other sports and I think that's definitely one of the main reasons.”

Describing the various governing bodies as ‘a cartel', the PTPA, which has also begun legal action in the United Kingdom and the European Union, accuses them of paying “artificially low compensation to professional tennis players” and imposing a “draconian” ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.

The lawsuit calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and often in the early hours of the morning, that tennis balls chosen by the tournaments are a factor in chronic injuries, and that players' privacy rights are being abused by random drug tests.

Before filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.

CHICO, Calif. – Known for its thriving art scene and colorful murals, Chico is set to host a street fair this weekend that will not only add more vibrant artwork to the city but also celebrate the talent behind it.

Four top muralists are competing in the event, each transforming blank walls along Orange Street into striking works of art. The competition, held as part of an art festival organized by Maker Radio 94.5 FM, will allow attendees to vote for their favorite mural, with the winner receiving a $500 prize.

Dylan Tellesen, one of the participating artists, is putting the finishing touches on his mural titled Pulling Your Eyes Out.

“You know, sometimes people are frustrated and don't know what to do with the state of the world, so you've got to pull your eyes out sometimes,” Tellesen said.

While each artist brings their own unique style, one name stands out among the competitors: Shane Grammer, who gained national recognition for his artwork following the Paradise Camp Fire and is now bringing his talent to Orange Street with his piece, Robinhood.

Behind the artwork, the event is set to be a lively festival featuring live music, comedy performances, art galleries, and local artists showcasing their work.

“Our whole goal is to create opportunities for artists and creative folks to have a platform to show what they do and share their talents,” said Erin Banwell of Maker Radio 94.5 FM.

Tellesen emphasized the importance of public art, noting that murals make art accessible to everyone.

“I think public art is important. I think it's for everybody. You don't have to pay an admission fee or feel like you have to belong to enjoy it. So more public art, please, for everybody,” he said.

The event will take place on Orange Street between 6th and 7th Streets, which will be closed from noon to 10 p.m. on Saturday. Organizers anticipate a crowd of around 1,000 attendees.

Pete Davidson has a new girlfriend, and her identity has just been revealed. 

The comedian has dated his fair share of female stars, but his current partner is not a celebrity. An insider recently told Page Six that Davidson's new flame is "very different from anybody else he's ever dated." 

"She respects Pete and his desire for privacy. Although things are new for Pete, he really likes this woman," the source noted, in addition to unveiling that both the comedian's mother, Amy Waters Davidson, and sister, Casey Davidson, "approve of this relationship and love seeing Pete so happy." 

So, who is Pete Davidson's new girlfriend? 

That would be 29-year-old model Elsie Hewitt. But there's more. 

The model has dated celebs before and has been romantically linked to producer Benny Blanco, who is currently engaged to Selena Gomez, and actor Jason Sudeikis in the past, Page Six confirmed. 

According to the outlet, Hewitt dated Blanco in 2019, and the former pair split after a year. She allegedly dated Sudeikis in 2024, but the couple have since called it quits. 

Photos captured by Daily Mail show Davidson and the model packing on the PDA during a Wednesday (March 19) outing in Palm Beach, Florida. The Pete Davidson: Alive from New York standout, who has been romantically linked to Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, and Kate Beckinsale (to mention only a few of his former relationships), has yet to comment on his new connection as news of her identity surfaces.

Shonda Rhimes is looking back at her wildly successful series Grey's Anatomy, which is now on season 21 on ABC.

However, there is a moment that she thought would "kill" the entire show, and it happened way back in 2007.

Keep reading to find out more...

THR asked if she had a "rose" and "thorn" for her time with the medical drama, and she elaborated on the thorn moment.

"I think the thorn was having the bubble of joy burst so early on Grey's [with the Isaiah Washington incident] and not having anybody interested in helping us deal with it, because that really shaped a lot of how we looked at the world going forward — and a lot of how [creative partner Betsy Beers] and I processed working with other people going forward. I mean, that was the thing we thought was going to kill the show. And it's funny, every Grey's actor I talk to who was there during that time is still traumatized by that incident. People still talk about it. So, that was the thorn. But I also think that there were so many roses that the thorn stopped mattering. I mean, that was the thing we thought was going to kill the show."

If you don't know, Washington was fired from Grey's Anatomy back in 2007 after playing Dr. Preston Burke on the series after he used a homophobic slur.

In the Golden Globes press room back in 2007, Washington famously addressed the rumor that he used a derogatory term and said, “No, I did not call T.R. [Knight] a f—-t. Never happened, never happened.”

The title of the upcoming The Big Bang Theory spinoff series is being revealed!

The latest offshoot of the popular CBS comedy will be premiering on streaming service Max, and we have a new update, which coincides with other spinoffs of the flagship series. 

Keep reading to find out more...

According to Deadline, the new series will be titled Stuart Fails To Save The Universe, putting Kevin Sussman's Stuart Bloom at the center. 

Along with Kevin, Brian Posehn, Lauren Lapkus and John Ross Bowie are set to reprise their characters Bert Kibbler, Denise and Barry Kripke.

Big Bang co-creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre will serve as creator and writer, along with fellow franchise co-creator Bill Prady and Zak Penn. 

At this time, the series, which has been in the works for about two years now, has yet to be given an official green light. 

This would mark the third spinoff in the franchise, following Young Sheldon and the latest, Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage, which is currently in it's first season and has been renewed for a second.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos thinks the public is underestimating Meghan Markle — especially following the success of her With Love, Meghan series.

“I think Meghan is underestimated in terms of her influence on culture. When we dropped the trailer for the Harry & Meghan doc series [in 2022], everything onscreen was dissected in the press for days,” Sarandos, 60, said in an interview with Variety, published on Wednesday, March 19. “The shoes she was wearing sold out all over the world. The Hermès blanket that was on the chair behind her sold out everywhere in the world. People are fascinated with Meghan Markle.”

Serandos added that Meghan, 43, and her husband, Prince Harry, are “overly dismissed,” but not by the streamer.

“We're a passive partner in Meghan's company, and it's a big discovery model for us right now,” Serandos added, seemingly referring to her forthcoming lifestyle brand As Ever.



Meghan and Harry signed a deal with Netflix in 2020, initially appearing in the Harry & Meghan docuseries which premiered two years later. Late last year, Harry was named as an executive producer on the POLO reality series while Meghan stayed in front of the camera for With Love, Meghan, which debuted earlier this month.

A source teased the show to Us Weekly exclusively in August 2024, saying that the series would “be a take on her and the joy of living.” The eight-episode miniseries offered an inside look at Meghan's life in Montecito. While her family — Harry and kids Archie, 5, and Lilibet 3 — didn't make an appearance, they were referenced more than once.

The family even had some moments together offscreen, at least according to a crew member.

“Whenever Harry visited set, he was always super polite and friendly. But it was clear he wanted this to be Meghan's moment to shine,” the crew member told People in an interview published earlier this month. The insider went on to say that Meghan was “super attentive and doting” when Archie and Lilibet were on set.

“We would give them headphones so they could listen to audio,” they added.

Netflix renewed With Love, Meghan for a second season, which has already finished filming. Director Michael Steed is returning, and has spoken about working alongside the Duchess of Sussex.

“For me, imperfection is a wonderful thing,” he told People. “It was fun watching her trying to get used to the kitchen, because it's not her place, so we didn't hide that fact, and she's kind of walking and looking for things. I really wanted to embrace and celebrate all of the mistakes and mess and all that good stuff.”

Brittany Cartwright is firm in her stance about not getting back together with Jax Taylor — but that wasn't always the case.

“I've had, I'm not gonna lie, I've had like a couple of times where I was, like, lonely and was, like, ‘Whoa, what might happen?'” she revealed on the Tuesday, March 18, episode of the “I Do, Part 2” podcast. “But we never got back together and we will never ever get back together.”

Cartwright, 36, noted that there are times “where you feel weak” around your ex following a split, especially in situations like hers — she had been with Taylor, 45, for nearly a decade.

“You miss them and you feel lonely. And that's happened to me a lot,” she explained. “But I know I'm worth so much more and I can do so much better than what he put me through. That's a confidence that I never had before.”



While discussing her decision to end her marriage, Cartwright admitted she “would feel so dumb” going back to Taylor.

“I feel like I've gained so much more strength and I'm getting into such a better headspace. I'm so much happier and so much more confident since I've left him,” she continued. “If I went back to that, I feel like my peace would be all messed up again.”

Bravo viewers have had a front row seat to Cartwright and Taylor's ups and downs since they started dating on Vanderpump Rules. After documenting their 2019 nuptials for the show, the pair announced their departure one year later and took a break from reality TV before returning on The Valley.

Shortly before the spinoff premiered in early 2024, Cartwright and Taylor announced they were separating.

“So many of you guys have been asking me about Jax and I and our relationship. I just think it is important to be real and honest with you guys because we have shared so much of our life with you guys,” Cartwright said on a February 2024 episode of the “When Reality Hits” podcast. “I don't want it to seem like I am lying or anything like that. So I think it is important for me to say this.”

She continued: “With all the speculation online and stories running rampant, I wanted to be transparent with you. Yes, marriages are very hard, and I had a particularly rough year. Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health. I won't get into too many details right now because this is still really hard to talk about.”

Cartwright subsequently filed for divorce after Taylor checked himself into a mental health facility later that year. He recently revealed that he has been battling substance abuse issues for more than two decades.

“I've been dealing with this on and off since I was 23 and now I'm 45. There were times where I would stop doing it, but then there were times where I'd go heavy on it,” he said on the “Hot Mic” podcast earlier this month. “This year was probably the hardest year of my life.”

Taylor admitted his addiction “got worse” amid his divorce. “I've been doing it for a long time but the addiction got worse during my divorce and during my separation,” he continued. “I literally lost control. I hit rock bottom and I had to go to rehab.”

Cartwright subsequently defended her knowledge of Taylor's addiction struggles, as well as her attempts to get him help.

“His addiction unfortunately has done irreparable damage to my son and I,” Cartwright, who shares 3-year-old son Cruz with Taylor, wrote via Instagram. “I've spent years trying to help him. I wish more than anyone I could say how proud I am of him today but I'd be lying. His actions will speak for themselves.”.

Cartwright also addressed criticism of her staying with Taylor. “And to those asking why I stayed if I knew he had a problem all these years,” she concluded. “You can't help who you fell in love with. I've done absolutely everything in my power to get him the help he desperately needed. Unfortunately, I was naive and believed his empty promises and his pleas to change for years.”

While Love Is Blind star Sara Carton has publicly denied that she's dating costar Joey Levielle, his ex-fiancée, Monica Danús, says differently.

“I'm so sick of the lies. Just own up to it at this point,” Monica, 28, told Elite Daily in an interview published on Tuesday, March 18. “I texted Sara [before the reunion], ‘I'm hearing a lot of things about you and Joey. Is there anything you need to tell me?' And she called me and said, ‘Nothing's official, but we are seeing each other.'”

According to Monica, Sara, 29, allegedly revealed that she and Joey, 36, “didn't want to make anything official until any online hate dies down.”

“She told me this started a month ago, so that's at least two months ago now. I wouldn't be surprised if it was longer,” Monica alleged. “All this time when I was venting to her about Joey and she was saying she had my back, she was actually with him.”



Sara, meanwhile, has publicly denounced the dating speculation on multiple occasions.

“To be clear, me and Joey are not dating,” Sara said on the “Viall Files” podcast earlier in March, noting she only started speaking to Joey five months after production wrapped. “[Joey] and five other people visited me in Nashville and we called ourselves the ‘Yee-Haw Crew,' like, it's such a good time. We grew really, really close with each other just because of the support for each other, knowing what we've all been through and being able to be there for one another. It's been super important to me.”

She added, “This whole situation, I've felt very close with Joey. I'm fond of our relationship, but I [also] feel very well-supported by all those involved. I'm just very grateful that I've met him, but, yeah, we definitely have a friendship. We're definitely not dating.”

While Sara played coy about whether she'd date Joey down the line, she stressed that she had “no capacity to even think about” being in a relationship at the moment. (Sara similarly shut down the dating rumors in a since-expired Instagram Story upload on Tuesday. Joey also denied the reports during a Sunday, March 16, appearance on the “Curious Crossroads” podcast, noting he and Sara “discussed” if there's any dating potential. “Ultimately, we just decided, I don't think either of us are in the capacity to do that right now,” he added. “We're not dating.”)

Monica, however, believes Sara and Joey are in a secret romance, claiming to the outlet that it is a “betrayal.”

“It's very hurtful,” Monica told Elite Daily. “It's no surprise from Joey — I don't think very highly of him, and I don't want him in my life. But I'm hurt that Sara would do this to me.”

Monica and Joey were engaged throughout the duration of Love Is Blind season 8, ultimately breaking up on their would-be wedding day. Sara, meanwhile, similarly called it quits with fiancé Ben Mezzenga at the altar. According to Sara, she and Ben, 28, tried to date post-show before he ghosted her. He denied the accusations.

Ellen Pompeo is opening up about getting uncomfortable on the set of Grey's Anatomy.

The 55-year-old actress made an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, where she spoke about the time on the ABC drama on Season 2 when Meredith and T.R. Knight's George had a "moment."

“This is crazy. T.R. and I are such good friends, and we had to do a love scene,” she said.

“We were both crying… And the scene was so uncomfortable and awkward, and he didn't wanna do that. I didn't wanna do it. And when we filmed it, it was so bad. And then the network said there was too much thrusting," she went on to reveal.

“In your worst nightmare, [you] have to do it one time,” she continued. But “we had to reshoot that s—t… and do it twice.”

“I've never watched that scene,” she admitted. “I don't know how it was shot or covered or… edited, but I'm full-on in tears, the whole entire scene. And those are real tears.”

She also admitted a line she didn't want to say on the show!

“I didn't wanna say [to Derek], ‘Pick me, choose me, love me,'” she admitted. Luckily, series creator Shonda Rhimes “knew that was gonna pop. I was like, ‘Why would I beg?' And you know, you have to just suck it up and do it.

“And it ended up being [one of] the most iconic things ever,” she added. “So I'm not always the best judge of what's gonna [work].”

She also explained why she felt the need to step away from the show.

Bella Ramsey, who portrays Ellie in The Last of Us for HBO, has previously spoken about their neurodivergence before, but now, they are confirming they they were diagnosed with autism.

The 21-year-old performer shared in a new interview with British Vogue, “I've spoken a bit about neurodivergence before, but I always for some reason didn't want to…I felt like I didn't want to say what it was… Shoot.” Bella then said, “I got diagnosed with autism when I was filming season one of The Last of Us.”

Keep reading to find out more...

Bella says the diagnosis has been “freeing… It enables me to walk through the world with more grace towards myself about not being able to do the easy everyday tasks that everyone else seems to be able to do.”

Bella also revealed how the diagnosis came about, sharing, "a crew member with an autistic daughter assumed that Ramsey had [autism], setting [Bella] off on a journey that ended in a formal psychiatric assessment and diagnosis."

They added, “The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that's helped me to understand myself, but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I'm putting myself into a box. I feel trapped.”

Days after featuring his daughter North West on a controversial track with jailed rap mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, Kanye West is putting another of his four children in the spotlight.

West, 47, dropped three different versions of a film titled Bully, set to music from a forthcoming album of the same name, early Wednesday, March 19. The film features his son, Saint, 9, in a starring role.

The different cuts of the film range in length from 22 minutes to 45 minutes and feature Saint inside a wrestling ring. The youngster can be seen wielding a mallet as he faces off against various wrestlers.

“EVERY VERSION OF THE BULLY FILM,” West wrote via X, sharing links to three different versions of Bully, labeled “Screening Version,” “Post Hype Version” and “Post Post Hype Version.”



In February, West said the new album's title was inspired by Saint's behavior. “My son was playing with some kid, and then he kicked him. And I asked my son, I said, ‘Why did you do that?' and he said, ‘Cos he weak,' and I was like, ‘This man is really a bully,'” the rapper said during an interview with Justin LaBoy.

West shares daughters North, 11, and Chicago, 7, and sons Saint and Psalm, 5, with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

On Saturday, March 15, West released a song featuring North and Diddy, 55, titled “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” despite Kardashian's apparent attempts to stop its release.

In an alleged text message exchange between Kardashian and West, the Skims CEO told her ex-husband North could not be featured on the song because her name is trademarked. “I asked you at the time if I can trademark her name. You said yes. When she's 18, it goes to her. So stop,” Kardashian reportedly wrote, according to screenshots shared via TMZ.

“I sent paperwork over so she wouldn't be in the Diddy song to protect her,” Kardashian reportedly added, referencing the disgraced music mogul who was arrested in September 2024 and indicted on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. (Diddy has denied the allegations against him.)

In a tirade shared via X on Saturday, West claimed that the “Kardashian mob” was responsible for his alleged loss of parenting rights.

“Yes I have beef with people that froze my account took my kids away and tried to put me in jail AND ITS STUCK,” West wrote.

“I DONT WANT TO JUST ‘SEE' MY KIDS. I NEED TO RAISE THEM,” he added. “I NEED TO HAVE SAY SO OF WEAR THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND WHOS HOUSES THEY SLEEP OVER WEATHER MY DAUGHTERS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PERFUME ALL THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME BY THE KARDASHIAN MOB HULU AND DISNEY AND THE BIGGER AGENDA TO USE THE SELECTIVELY BRED BLACK CHILDREN TO BE PLATFORMS TO INFLUENCE BLACK PEOPLE.”

Christina Applegate recently revealed that she was hospitalized over "30 times" and suffered repetitive symptoms. 

The Bad Moms actress zoomed in on her Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis and the uncomfortable ailments attached to the autoimmune disease in the latest episode of her iHeartRadio podcast MeSsy with co-host Jamie-Lynn Sigler. 

The standout addressed a comment from a listener who was also diagnosed with MS and endured frequent diarrhea and vomiting. Applegate unveiled that nearly every time she goes to relieve herself, she also throws up. These symptoms, along with "excruciating" stomach pain, have landed the star in the hospital more than 30 times, and doctors are still unsure whether it has something to do with the disease despite Applegate having undergone "every test known to man." 

The Anchorman sensation has a colonoscopy scheduled to determine if the symptoms are related to MS, and advised listeners battling the condition to "Always have a little trash can next to your toilet. Because you can do both without it being messy."

Applegate was diagnosed with the disease in 2021, per TMZ, and has since been very open about her struggles. In December 2024, the standout shone a spotlight on a health complication she experienced while filming Netflix series Dead To Me in 2019. Applegate would constantly fall and lose her balance on set, only to find out years later that this was the "first sign" of the life-altering disease.

Ormax has released the list of top 10 actors by sharing a post on its Insta account. The caption with this post read, 'Ormax Stars India Loves: Most Popular Male Stars in India February 2025. The interesting thing is that in Ormax's list of top 10 stars, South stars have dominated Bollywood actors. 7 superstars of the South are included in this list while only 3 Bollywood actors could make it to the list. Among them, Prabhas is in the number one position. This is the list of top 10 stars:

Four South stars are in top 5 with just one Bollywood star

Let us tell you that Prabhas has also defeated Bollywood's Badshah i.e. Shah Rukh Khan in popularity. There are four stars from South in the top 5 and only SRK from Bollywood has managed to secure the third position. However, this list changes every week and its listing is done according to the buzz.

Prabhas Work Front

Talking about the most popular actor Prabhas, last year he created a ruckus at the box office with the film Kalki 2898 AD. His upcoming films now include Raja Saab which can be released by April 2025. At the same time, the work of Part 2 of Kalki 2898 AD has also started.

Heather Thomas experienced the dark side of Hollywood after her time on "The Fall Guy."

Thomas revealed on the "Still Here Hollywood" podcast that after her time on the hit show, she was bombarded with scary situations involving stalkers.

Thomas was on "The Fall Guy" from 1981 until the series concluded in 1986. She took on a few other roles after the show ended, such as in the films "Red Blooded American Girl" and "Against The Law," but she decided to leave Hollywood behind in the '90s.

"I was just getting so many stalkers," she said before explaining that it was "really bad." It got to the point where Thomas was dealing with two stalkers a week, she told podcast host Steve Kmetko.

"I had tons of restraining orders. I had two little girls, and a guy was jumping our gate with a giant buck knife. In those days, I don't know if this is true now, but people would fixate. You could be in a soap commercial, and they would fixate on you. There weren't a lot of stalker laws, and I just needed to be home anyway," Thomas said.

She described her experience as being "scary" and even received some threatening items in the mail.

"Someone sent me a box of bullets, and people would send me funeral wreaths they stole from a graveyard," the actress shared.

Thomas continued, "I always had a bodyguard in the house because that's where I didn't want to come home to a dark house."

She explained that things turned violent when a man attempted to break into her bedroom.

"I had one guy one night cut my screen in my bedroom and got in, and I shot him," she said while clarifying that she had rock salt in her firearm. Thomas is still unsure if the intruder ever went to jail.

Thomas said that she has not been open about her stalkers in the past because she did not want to be labeled as "the lady that was stalked."

During the podcast episode, Thomas also discussed being sexualized in Hollywood.

"I think there's a certain amount of disassociation," she said of the industry. "It was really my business. It would be like a woman who sold bathing suits. It was the way I sold things."

Thomas said she was "happy" with her body because she "worked hard" for it.

When Thomas made her debut in Hollywood, she was a student at UCLA and wanted to focus on writing and directing, but she quickly learned it was "rough" for women.

She ultimately chose to be on-camera as opposed to being behind-the-scenes because of the paycheck. Thomas said she was "making so much money" that she chose the path of "least resistance."

Led by London-based agents Shelby Schenkman and Beth Heard, the burgeoning U.K. unit continues to add creators across such topic areas as books, news, and celebrity news.

	Global talent, entertainment, sports and advisory company UTA has signed popular U.K. creators Jack Edwards, Madame Joyce, and Lewis Goodall for global representation in all areas.


	The deals fit into UTA's expansion of its U.K. Creator division which is part of its international growth strategy. The agency is looking to provide digital, gaming/e-sports, and audio talent and groups access to a wider network across unscripted and scripted TV, audio, live touring, publishing, news, and broadcasting.




	The three new signings have a combined audience reach of more than 5 million people across their social channels and broadcast platforms.

	Madame Joyce is a podcaster, presenter, and media personality with a combined audience of more than 2 million people whose podcast Cocktails & Takeaways delves into celebrity news, gossip, and discussions over drinks. She is being co-represented with Jackie Eyewe, manager and director of Makers Agency.

	Jack Edwards is considered the world's most influential BookTuber with an audience of more than 3 million across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.


	And journalist, presenter, broadcaster, and writer Lewis Goodall has emerged as a new voice in U.K. news and politics, since 2022 hosting The News Agents, which became the UK's biggest daily news podcast. He is a UTA Creator unit co-signing with the agency's literary arm Curtis Brown.


	Led by London-based agents Shelby Schenkman and Beth Heard, UTA's burgeoning U.K. Creator division has brought in a broad array of talent, including Madeline Argy, Jamie Laing and Sophie Habboo, Lissie Mackintosh, and Grace Campbell. 


	Its practice also represents such clients as Dave Portnoy/Barstool, Mr. Ballen/Ballen Studios, Emma Chamberlain, Alix & Ashtin Earle, Charli D'Amelio, Jake Shane, Kai Cenat, and Alex Cooper.


	UTA opened its creator practice in 2006 and says it became the first agency to have its own audio and digital talent division. It also led the way in launching a dedicated gaming and e-sports unit.

	A recent Statista forecast predicted that U.K. advertising spending in the influencer space would reach $1.31 billion this year. Marketing agency Digital Voices sees the global creator economy reach $480 billion in value by 2027.

	











	“Our U.K. Creator offering is an extension of the premium services we provide in the U.S, offering clients access to a vast global network, helping them scale their careers beyond local markets,” Ali Berman, partner & head of digital at UTA, tells The Hollywood Reporter.


	“The media and entertainment landscape is rapidly evolving, and UTA remains the go-to resource for connecting top talent with media and brand partners to navigate these shifts and continue building upward in the growing creator economy,” adds Oren Rosenbaum, partner & head of Audio, UTA. “Our global approach allows us to unlock opportunities that ensure long-term success for our clients.”

	Madame Joyce is set to embark on a U.K.-wide live tour in the coming months. She has struck collaborations with such brands as Sony Music, Cadbury, Spotify, Amazon and JD.  Edwards has collaborated with such brands as Valentino, Audible, and the BBC. Goodall is a former senior political journalist and presenter at the BBC and Sky News, and a former policy editor at BBC Newsnight, the public broadcaster's flagship political and current affairs show.

Phoebe Dynevor is to star alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in new movie Pendulum.

The motion picture, which will be produced by Darren Aronofsky and directed by Black Swan writer Mark Heyman, is a "terrifying new genre film", according to Deadline.

Bridgerton actress Dynevor and Gordon-Levitt will play young couple Abigail and Patrick, who head to a retreat in New Mexico following a traumatic event.

However, things take a turn for the worst when Abigail falls under the spell of the new-age retreat's leader.

It's one of many upcoming films for Dynevor, who will appear in thriller Beneath the Storm later this year, and she is to star opposite Diane Lane in thriller Anniversary.

What's more, the Fair Play actress recently wrapped on another thriller movie, Famous, which will see her star opposite Zac Efron, and she has joined the cast of M. Night Shyamalan's next film alongside Jake Gyllenhaal.

In January, Dynevor starred in Neil Burger's spy movie Inheritance, which was filmed entirely on an iPhone, and she admitted the process was a "daunting" challenge.

Speaking to Collider, she said: "I was very confused and baffled by it.

"I think we had to have a few Zooms before I really understood what he was trying to do, but then I became really excited about the guerrilla style of shooting and the fact that we could go to all these places and steal footage from all of these places, whether it was on aeroplanes or an Apple store, at the pyramids.

"It was such an exciting, very daunting prospect, so I was ready. I was really at a point where I wanted to challenge myself, and it really was that. It was a great challenge."

Ace filmmaker Shekhar Kapur's film Bandit Queen's name is included in the list of the most controversial movies in the history of Hindi cinema. The story of dacoit Phoolan Devi was shown in this movie. After running for some time in theatres, the censor board and the government banned this movie. However, the makers knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court of India and fought for his rights. After such a run and glorious years of recognition, the director of this film, Shekhar Kapur took to his X profile to express disappointment over its digital version.

For the unversed, Bandit Queen is available to watch on the OTT platform in today's time. Recently, Shekhar has watched his film online and has expressed his displeasure over it. The reason for this is the editing of the film and cutting of some scenes without his consent in the OTT version. 'I wonder if OTT platforms would let me make #BanditQueen the way I made it years ago. The Bandit Queen on #AmazonPrime is unrecognisable from my film. Someone has cut it beyond recognition. And yet it carries my name as Director. And no one asked me! Are we lesser beings than Western Directors? Would they have the guts to cut a Chris Nolan film without his permission?'



In this way, Shekhar Kapur lashed out at the OTT platform Amazon Prime Video for tampering with his film.

Hansal Mehta reacts

Another award-winning director, Hansal Mehta also reacted to Kapur's tweet and wrote, 'It is sad to know that a film that should always be India's pride gets treated this way. But then what's new? We've become so used to being treated as slaves of the West. No protest. No pushback. Total submission. Because they are doing us a favour. Our integrity as artists is neither protected by us nor by a guild that could potentially protect us. The so-called ‘association' is busy behaving like a political party or stoking divisive propaganda. In the meanwhile directors are rendered powerless and bereft of any support system. Maybe your status as one of the country's foremost artistic spokespersons to the world and as a government-decorated Padmabhushan will help bring about change. Until then back to our submissive selves? Members of the new content-driven colony that creates cattle feed to drive subscriptions while fulfilling the artistic ambitions of its Western masters.'

Bandit Queen was a box-office success

Of course, Bandit Queen was banned across the country. But Shekhar Kapur was praised for the courage he showed in making this movie. This movie was on the big screen for only a few weeks, and in that time it rocked the box office in terms of earnings and achieved success. The film Bandit Queen was released in theatres in 1994. Actress Seema Biswas played the role of Phoolan Devi in ​​this movie. Veteran actor Manoj Bajpayee made his debut in Hindi cinema with this film.
