Erdogan, a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. “We will emerge stronger from this process,” his lawyer Mehmet Pehlivan quoted him as saying. Separately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported. Meanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms. Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities.</p>

Global Affairs Canada confirmed on Wednesday that an unspecified number of citizens were executed earlier this year. “Canada strongly condemns China's use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” a GAC spokesperson, Charlotte MacLeod, said in a statement to the Guardian. Her detention in Canada prompted China to quickly detain and charge two Canadians living in the country, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, eventually charing the pair with espionage. That charge was upgraded to execution in 2019, during the fervour of China's diplomatic spat with Canada. MacLeod confirmed on Wednesday that Schellenberg was still detained and said the federal government “continues to advocate for clemency”.</p>

Police arrested dozens of people, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who was expected to be the opposition party's presidential candidate. Imamoglu, a popular politician and member of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, became mayor of Turkey's largest city in 2019 and won reelection last year in high-profile races where he defeated candidates from Erdogan's ruling party. Speaking at a televised news conference, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the investigation was carried out rigorously and warned against street protests, criticizing those who used “terms such as ‘coup'” to describe the arrests. Erdogan's communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, wrote on social media that critics were subjecting the president to a “smear campaign.” Turkey's next presidential election is scheduled for 2028, and analysts have said Erdogan may look to extend his rule then.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that they had a constructive call about moving toward a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow, with the White House suggesting the U.S. could take control of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue. But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. Shortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter. Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said.</p>

German defence minister says Putin ‘is playing a game here' and calls Russian president's demands ‘unacceptable' “This is very transparent,” Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from “further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”. The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, also dismissed Russian demands that help for Kyiv be halted. Spain's foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was equally cautious about the prospects for peace. He asaid: “It's positive that there's talk of a ceasefire and talk of peace with Russia, but we're still very far from the peace that Spain and the European people want.”</p>

An oil painting of an African prince created by the Austrian master Gustav Klimt, unearthed in recent years and almost dismissed for not looking like one of his more famous works, is now on sale for $16.32 million (15 million euro). But after his co-owner, Ebi Kohlbacher, tracked the couple down at a coffee shop near the gallery, Wienerroither called his friend and colleague, art historian Alfred Weidinger, who said he had been “searching for this painting for twenty years,” having known of its existence through a black-and-white photograph, Wienerroither said. She said two types of exhibitions were popular across Europe at the time: those run by states to showcase colonial exploits, and commercial ventures. Klimt was a key figure in Vienna's art nouveau movement, perhaps best known for “The Kiss” (1907-1908). This past April, his “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” — a vivid painting of a woman believed to be Henriette Lieser, who was deported and killed by the Nazis — sold for $32 million after it was rediscovered nearly 100 years after being painted.</p>

International rules of combat to deter impact on noncombatants have been loosened or ignored – and other regimes may follow Though it is too soon to determine how many noncombatants died in attacks that Israel says were directed at Hamas military commanders and political officials (casualty totals from Gaza's health ministry do not distinguish combatants from the uninvolved), the likelihood is that civilians will have been killed in large numbers. International humanitarian law, underpinned by the Geneva conventions, is intended to act as a check on armed conflict. Attacks against military objectives which cause excessive civilian casualties relative to the advantage gained are, in theory, a war crime. Last May, a leaked US state department review requested by Biden on whether countries receiving US arms were using them “in accordance with international humanitarian law” concluded that a determination was not possible because “Israel has not shared complete information” about its decision-making processes.</p>

EU launches scheme to buy more weapons in Europe as Russia remains ‘a threat for the foreseeable future' Last month Danish intelligence services warned that if Moscow perceived Nato as weak, Russia could be ready to wage a large-scale war in Europe within five years. Many countries say they want a bigger European defence industry, but oppose restrictions on military spending. Other member states, especially in southern Europe, are seen as reluctant to deepen their national debts for defence. But Donald Trump's rapprochement towards Russia and hostility to the EU has forced a change of thinking.</p>

On Tuesday, Mark Carney made his first major domestic visit as prime minister to the far-north city of Iqaluit in a bid to “reaffirm” Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty, adding the region was a “strategic priority” for his government. Carney's visit follows the completion of Operation Nanook, an Arctic military exercise involving nearly 650 personnel. The environments, once capable of supporting small roving groups, could not supply larger permanent settlements with enough fresh game. “As Inuit, we have endured a great deal in the name of Canadian sovereignty,” Nunavut premier PJ Akeeagok said during Carney's visit to Iqaluit. “Canada's national identity as an Arctic nation was built on the backs of our communities.”</p>

She said: “We do believe that the meeting between Trump and Conor McGregor was really very sinister and we have called it out for what it is, which is … an attempt to rebuild the very damaged reputation of Conor McGregor. Dressed in a green suit on Ireland's national day, McGregor was invited to speak in the official White House briefing room alongside the president's press secretary before going on to meet Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office along with his partner and children.

Many economists warn the Trump administration's plans to impose or increase US tariffs on goods from overseas risk raising prices further. “Surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook,” Powell said at a news conference.</p>

In yet another case, the government has been forced to rehire more than 7,000 workers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who had not finished their probationary period after they were sent unsigned letters telling them they were being fired for poor work performances.

Under the strategy, member countries will be urged to buy much of their military equipment in Europe, working mostly with European suppliers — in some cases with EU help to cut prices and speed up orders. They should only purchase equipment from abroad when costs, performance or supply delays make it preferable. In recent years, the 27 EU nations have placed about two-thirds of their orders with U.S. defense companies. “The security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken for granted,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.</p>

Moves to roll back 31 pollution regulations risk public health and big annual healthcare savings, Guardian analysis shows Trump's EPA has said its immolation of environmental protections will “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes' on US families”. The regulations slated for repeal, affecting coal plants, cars, trucks and other sources of pollution, had been set to deliver at least $254bn in economic benefits annually via lowered healthcare costs and fewer sick days, among other improvements. But it cannot simply sweep aside EPA regulations, which require several years of grueling agency work and public comment to replace. Environmental groups have vowed lawsuits to fight the rollbacks, meaning that a diminished EPA is faced with a mountain of legal and administrative paperwork just as Zeldin has promised to cut the agency's spending by 65% this year.</p>

The Israeli military said on Wednesday it launched a "limited ground operation" to retake part of a key Gaza corridor.

The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza, which shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January.

As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which it had used as a military zone and which bisected northern Gaza from the south.

After the economic reforms of 1991 that deregulated markets, reduced import tariffs, and lowered taxes, India's economy began to grow. Additionally, the private sector can acquire essential technologies and raw materials based on commercial needs, improving operational agility. Additionally, the 2020 Defense Acquisition Procedure reserves certain orders (worth of up to 1 billion rupees or $11.5 million) for small and medium sector companies.

A US federal judge has ordered the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, to suspend its dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID, responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance, has faced scrutiny over its role in political influence operations abroad. Musk has previously described court rulings obstructing DOGE as “an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges,” demanding consequences for those who make “truly terrible decisions.” That included the controversial travel ban targeting individuals from Muslim-majority countries and a requirement for women seeking abortion pills to obtain them in person. Both rulings were later overturned by the US Supreme Court.</p>

According to a joint statement published by Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Tshisekedi and Kagame reaffirmed their commitment to an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire during the meeting led by Qatari leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Angola-mediated peace talks between the two African states were halted last December after Rwanda demanded that Kinshasa engage directly with the M23. Relations between Kinshasa and Kigali have been strained due to the decades-long conflict in DR Congo's resource-rich east, where dozens of armed groups, including M23, are fighting the local authorities for power and minerals such as gold and diamonds. Rwanda has denied supporting the M23, insisting that its forces are only deployed on its borders with the DR Congo for security purposes. Brussels responded by also expelling Rwandan diplomats and canceling cooperation agreements with the former colony.</p>

It will probably put pressure on Giorgia Meloni, who has faced questions about the use of spyware in her government since revelations emerged in January that a handful of Italian activists and journalists had received warnings from WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Meta, that their phones had been targeted by spyware. Osama Najim, who is known as Almasri, is the director of a detention centre in Mitiga in Tripoli, which has been condemned by human rights organisations for its arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees. The Citizen Lab report has confirmed that several activists and associates of Yambio, including two personal friends of Pope Francis, were targeted by hacking software that is supposed to be used against targets in terrorism investigations and other serious crime. Researchers have not yet been able to determine the exact kind of spyware used against Yambio, but are continuing their investigation. She said: “We have seen this pattern before – denial, deflection, and ultimately, no justice for the victims.</p>

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Canada is “one of the nastiest countries to deal with” as trade tensions between the two historically friendly countries continue to escalate. @POTUS: "One of the nastiest countries to deal with is Canada. Apart from the ongoing trade war, Trump has continuously referred to Canada as the 51st state and even called Canada's former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “Governor Trudeau”. When asked by Fox News host Laura Ingraham on why Trump was “tougher” on Canada than their other “adversaries”, he said, "Only because it's meant to be our 51st state." He also said that the two countries will “sit down and have a conversation about our broader partnership with the United States” only after Trump stops making “disrespectful” comments about Canada's sovereignty.</p>

Researchers have uncovered “possible links” between Ontario's provincial police force and an Israel-based military-grade spyware maker called Paragon Solutions, raising questions about the extent and scope of Canadian authorities' use of cyber weapons. But the company's spyware, which can hack into any phone, was recently found to be used against an Italian journalist and several activists who support migrants. In a previous statement, a spokesperson said Paragon requires all of its users to “adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders”. Canada's use of spyware was a source of controversy in 2022, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police admitted – in what was called a “remarkable” disclosure – that the national police force used spyware to infiltrate mobile devices and collect data. Additionally, a 2023 judgement from the superior court of justice in Toronto described a joined investigation by Toronto police and York regional police services where investigators “considered” the use of a spyware surveillance tool, which in Canada is referred to as an “on-device investigative tool” (ODIT).</p>

An article history detailing Jackie Robinson's military career has seemingly been taken down on the Department of Defense's website as a purge of articles considered to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) continues. Robinson, who Donald Trump last month described as helping “drive our country forward to greatness”, is widely considered a national hero in the US. However, on Tuesday night ESPN'S Jeff Passan noted a page detailing Robinson's army career had been taken down and “dei” added to the URL. Articles about the Native American code talkers also appear to have been removed from military websites. Robinson was court martialed and acquitted, then served as an athletics coach before being honorably discharged in November 1944.</p>

Despite confirming the settlement, a Google spokesperson said, “We continue to disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring and levelling all employees fairly.” Cantu had claimed that inspite of working exemplarily for seven years at Google, she remained at the same job, while white and Asian employees got promotions and extra pay.

In another post, he said, "This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong. Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks." President Trump has condemned the attacks, suggesting that they be classified as domestic terrorism. US Attorney-General Pamela Bondi has also strongly condemned the recent attacks on Tesla property, labelling them as "nothing short of domestic terrorism". "We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes," she said.</p>

One major activist group, Indivisible, has already called on Schumer to resign as leader and constituents are raising the issue at town halls. On Tuesday the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a sharp critique of Schumer's strategy: “I myself don't give away anything for nothing. Since taking office, Trump has terminated Democratic appointees to independent agencies across the federal government, prompting accusations that he is overstepping his bounds. Donald Trump spoke with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said they were “very much on track” towards a ceasefire agreement. That push includes reauthorizing the detention of entire families, something he allowed during his first administration, but which Joe Biden stopped.</p>

Last week, Schumer first said Democrats would not help Republicans stave off a government shutdown, then reversed and supported the GOP budget. Schumer told the Times he “knew there would be divisions” but insisted “we are all unified in going after Trump”.

Institutions that provided loans to help fund Musk's X takeover also received a boost after Musk gave a 25% stake in his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI, to them early last year. Revenues at the social media platform have fallen since Musk's takeover but it posted adjusted profits of $1.2bn last year.

Arguably, with summer close and the urgent need for Ukrainians to have heating reduced, Moscow ceasing energy infrastructure attacks is less of a concession. They have agreed to a pause in attacks that – largely from now on – will damage Moscow's bank balance. Indeed, the initial and amateur confusion over what was agreed has opened a chasm in any future peace deal wide enough for Putin to drive another full-scale invasion through. Did both sides not set staffers aside after the call to prepare an identical readout of what was agreed? But they have also managed to confirm, in short shrift, that Moscow looks for cracks of weakness and mercilessly drives a tank through them.</p>

Ukraine's energy facilities attacked hours after Putin agreed to halt strikes on such targets in a call with US president “Even last night, after Putin's conversation with Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,” Ukraine's president said at a news conference in Helsinki with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb. Ukraine also continued its own long-range drone assaults on Russia overnight, apparently hitting an oil depot in the southern region of Krasnodar. Ukraine had initially proposed a ceasefire on sea and in the air, but the US delegation at talks in Saudi Arabia last week pushed Kyiv to agree to a full 30-day ceasefire, which was eventually agreed after eight hours of talks. Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.</p>

Russian President Vladimir Putin, known for making world leaders wait, once again lived up to his reputation and delayed a phone call with US President Donald Trump. Putin was attending a conference with Russian business leaders in Moscow at the time and reportedly showed no urgency in leaving the event, keeping his American counterpart waiting for over an hour. That's his job,” while shrugging, eliciting laughter from the audience.Shokhin, a former deputy prime minister under Putin, responded, “Now, we need to see what Trump says about this.”Putin, still smiling, replied, “I didn't mention Trump. Instead, he continued with his engagement, ultimately leaving the venue at around 5 pm Russian time (7.30 pm IST), a full hour after the scheduled start of his telephonic conversation with Trump.The main focus of the discussion was expected to be the ongoing war in Ukraine, amid US-led negotiations for a ceasefire.Trump earlier expressed optimism about securing a 30-day truce, claiming there was a “very good chance” of convincing Putin to agree to the proposal, which had already received approval from Kyiv.What Donald Trump said about the call with Vladimir PutinThe call between the two leaders eventually lasted nearly two hours, according to Fox News. He said on March 18 that Moscow would pause strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days instead of committing to a full cessation of hostilities.But just an hour after the Kremlin's statement, a Russia-guided bomb struck the Ukrainian city of Slovyansk, knocking out power, according to Wall Street Journal chief foreign affairs correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov.</p>

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched around 40 drones at Ukraine overnight, hitting civilian infrastructure including a hospital. Russia has previously demanded Ukraine pull back its troops from four regions Moscow claims it annexed, renounce any prospect of joining NATO, and sharply demilitarise — proposals that are at odds with Kyiv's ambitions for peace. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that discussions between Moscow and Washington would continue, with fresh talks slated to begin in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.</p>

Hungarians have protested against a new, anti-LGBTQ+ bill banning Pride events in the country. Opposing legislators led a vivid protest in the legislature involving rainbow-colored smoke bombs. “It's quite terrifying to be honest, because we had the same in Russia. The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities. Hungary's government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.”</p>

"We've seen that attacks on civilian infrastructure have not eased at all in the first night after this supposedly ground-breaking, great phone call" between Putin and US President Donald Trump, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a TV interview. In the 90-minute call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin agreed to a scaled-back commitment to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, but refused a full ceasefire in its three-year war with Ukraine. The minister also described as "unacceptable" the Kremlin's insistence that a "key condition" for peace would be a total halt of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military. "This is very transparent," Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from "further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire".

Einav Zangauker, an Israeli mother whose son is one of 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, accused Netanyahu of favoring “cheap politics over our children, brothers and sisters in captivity” and led demonstrators near the Gaza border, saying she would help form a human chain to block an Israeli ground invasion. “At least on Gaza, you have nothing short of a Vulcan mind meld between Trump and Netanyahu.” Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

These measures align with Amazon's strategy to improve operational efficiency and prioritise profitability. The company has already discontinued certain initiatives, such as its ‘Try Before You Buy' clothing programme and a rapid brick-and-mortar delivery service, as it shifts focus to its core business areas.The layoffs were part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to streamline decision-making and improve efficiency. In a note, he said that in-office work makes it easier for employees to learn and collaborate. Reducing the number of managers would eliminate unnecessary layers, allowing Amazon to operate more efficiently and with fewer bureaucratic obstacles, he added.In a note published in October 2024, Morgan Stanley estimated that this restructuring could lead to the elimination of around 13,834 managerial roles by early 2025.Amazon's workforce expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, reportedly growing from 7.98 lakh employees in 2019 to over 16 lakh by the end of 2021. The company has since adjusted its staffing levels, cutting 27,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023, reported Financial Express.</p>

The move comes as Europe scrambles to strengthen its security amid concerns over U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump. BERLIN — German lawmakers passed a mammoth spending plan Tuesday that could allow for up to $1 trillion in defense and infrastructure investments over the next decade. “The circumstances are determined above all by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Europe,” Merz said. A survey of German voters published by Infratest Dimap this month suggested that public support for more defense spending is also high. At an air base near France's border with Germany on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his country would order more Rafale fighter jets and invest 1.4 billion euros (about $1.53 billion) in upgrading the base to host two squadrons equipped with nuclear missile technology, making it part of the country's deterrence by 2035.</p>

Billionaire Elon Musk has named three tech titans he believes are the smartest people he ever met. On the "Verdict with Ted Cruz" podcast, the Republican senator asked the Tesla CEO to choose the CEO he most admired or the smartest person he ever met.Musk praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and first CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page as the sharpest people he knew.The entrepreneur praised the Amazon CEO, saying, “Jeff Bezos has done a lot of difficult and significant things.”The compliment came despite their well-documented 20-year rivalry, which is mostly focused on their conflicting space aspirations at Musk's SpaceX and Bezos' Blue Origin.The dynamic between Bezos and Musk has evolved recently, with the Tesla CEO sharing several memes from the comedy movie “Step Brothers,” suggesting a reconciliation between the two tech titans.“Larry Ellison is very smart. I will say Larry Ellison is one of the smartest people,” Musk added. The SpaceX CEO shares a long-standing bond with Ellison, who committed $1 billion to Musk's acquisition of Twitter while serving on the Tesla board from 2018 to 2022.Often referred to as "very close friends," Ellison reportedly assisted Musk in obtaining expensive Nvidia GPUs to develop artificial intelligence.Musk then complimented Google co-founder Larry Page, adding he believed a person's achievements could be used to evaluate their IQ. Musk, despite losing billions of dollars, with 30 per cent of his fortune wiped out in the last ten weeks, remains at the top of Bloomberg's list.In January, Musk, one of the most influential people in the Trump administration, called the Amazon CEO a “copycat” and made fun of Blue Origin's lunar landing plan.</p>

Reiterating the claim that Joe Biden abandoned the astronauts, Trump said in an interview with Fox News, hailing Musk as a “patriot,” “When I got into office, I said ‘Elon, we gotta get them out of there…Elon is able to do that with his genius, yet there are people who hate it, and I really believe these are people who hate our country.” “Congratulations to the @SpaceX and @NASA teams for another safe astronaut return!” he posted on X. “Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!” NASA astronauts Williams and Wilmore splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule just before 6 pm EST Tuesday, March 18.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday accused Russia of "effectively rejecting" US-backed ceasefire proposals after fresh strikes targeted civilian infrastructure. Washington has been advocating for a full 30-day ceasefire as an initial step toward resolving the ongoing three-year war. However, Moscow maintained that a broader ceasefire would only be possible if the West stopped supporting Ukraine's military or intelligence. Following the Kremlin's statement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine with military aid. said Oleksandr, 35, who had returned to military training in Donetsk after recovering from combat injuries.</p>

But Israel dragged its feet, delaying substantive talks, as Netanyahu sought to keep his shaky governing coalition, which includes right-wing hawks keen on continuing the war, from falling apart. A little more than two weeks ago, however, Israel said it was blocking all food, aid and other supplies from entering the enclave. Feroze Sidhwa, an American surgeon working at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, said his hospital had been inundated with wounded civilians. Condemnations of Israel's attack poured in Tuesday from Arab countries, which warned that it risked reigniting a regional conflagration.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The presidents of Congo and neighboring Rwanda met Tuesday in Qatar for their first direct talks since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this year. Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed their commitment to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, but the joint statement offered no specifics on how that ceasefire would be implemented or monitored. The summit came as a previous attempt to bring Congo's government and M23 leaders together for ceasefire negotiations failed. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world's most significant humanitarian crises. The U.N. Human Rights Council last month launched a commission to investigate atrocities, including allegations of rape and killing akin to “summary executions” by both sides.</p>

Instead, what the US president got from Putin were questions, half-offers and limited concessions – and, above all, an extraordinary demand from the Russian leader to weaken Ukraine that would make a mockery of any peace agreement. It is not yet clear how far Trump pressed the full 30-day ceasefire proposal, negotiated a week earlier with Ukraine by his secretary of state, Marco Rubio. But I can only assume it was designed to ensure a Zelenskyy rejection, taking the pressure off Putin.” Over the past three years, Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukraine's power plants to the point where there is little energy generation left that is not nuclear, too risky for even Moscow's forces to attack. Nevertheless, the White House said both sides would begin “technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire”.</p>

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Tesla has been removed from participating in this week's Vancouver International Auto Show over safety concerns, the event's executive director said Tuesday. Nicholl said Tesla was provided “multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw.” The automaker's removal comes after so-called “Tesla Takedown” protests over the weekend, including in Ottawa and Vancouver, that denounced Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump, who has infuriated Canadians with talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state. So, I think they made the right decision,” he said. Last week, British Columbia Hydro banned Tesla products from its electric vehicle rebate program as part of the provincial government's move to give preference to Canadian goods and exclude U.S. ones from rebates if practical amid the ongoing Canada-U.S. trade war.</p>

To counteract physical degradation, astronauts use three exercise machines on the ISS, including a 2009-installed resistance device that simulates free weights using vacuum tubes and flywheel cables. “This happens to every single astronaut, even those who go into space just for a few days,” he said.

NASA's Crew-9 returned in SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and splashed down off the coast of Florida at 3:27 am (IST). In an interview with Fox News, Musk claimed that SpaceX offered former President Joe Biden's administration to bring back the two astronauts earlier but it was "rejected for political reasons." SpaceX could have brought the astronauts after a few months at most and we made that offer to Biden administration. Ms Williams was seen waving and flashing thumbs-up signs as she came out of the capsule.</p>

Puffy heads, chicken legs, taller space height and reduced density - as Crew-9 astronauts face all these health implications on their return to Earth after nine months in space, they will undergo a 45-day rehabilitation programme to prepare for gravity. A stay at the International Space Station can have various effects on the astronauts' bodies in terms of aerobic capacity, muscular strength, power, endurance, stamina, bone, balance, agility, coordination, orthostatic tolerances, proprioception, neurovestibular function and flexibility. Specific attention is given to each astronaut's overall condition, testing results, medical status, and assigned duties after their mission. After completing post-flight reconditioning, it is shown that astronauts have regained, and in most cases improved upon, their pre-flight baseline condition. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore spent nine months in space, after propulsion systems on the Boeing Starliner that rocketed them to the International Space Station (ISS) developed issues and returned without them.</p>

The Trump administration released 80,000 files related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination Tuesday evening, March 18. The files' release was ordered by President Donald Trump as part of a campaign promise to declassify all remaining records. A newly declassified memo from November 1963 reveals how a CIA officer expressed alarm over Oswald's activities, including the fact that he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City weeks before killing Kennedy. However, ballistic reports and witness testimonies in the newly-released files say that does not add up. There is one suppressed statement from a Dallas bystander who was forced to remain silent by government agents, The Guardian reported.</p>

“The world is changing,” Carney said in Iqaluit, where he made a domestic stop after visits to Paris and London. Canada made Arctic security a priority before Trump returned to office, amid concern about possible Russian aggression as melting ice caused by climate change increasingly opens the region for resource extraction. But Trump's repeated questioning of Canadian sovereignty has sparked renewed focus on national defence in Canada, which once viewed its security ties with Washington as iron-clad. Canada's defence minister, Bill Blair, this month announced plans for three new Arctic military hubs with airstrips and equipment depots. Carney said on Tuesday he would have a “comprehensive” discussion with Trump about trade “at the appropriate time”.</p>

In a Truth Social post, he wrote, “I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to ‘go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration. This was about Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who had been there since June 2024, with a SpaceX return already set for late March 2025. The astronauts will be taken to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for a few days of health assessments, as part of the standard procedure for astronaut returns.

That report and its findings were slated for publication in 2023 — months before then-President Joe Biden, who was still seeking re-election at the time, announced a pause on all new U.S. LNG export terminals in January 2024, citing the need to better consider environmental and economic impacts. The draft report found that across all modeled scenarios, an increase in U.S. LNG exports and natural gas production did not change global or U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, nor did it correlate with a strong uptick in energy prices for consumers, Trump administration officials said. "​​Secretary Granholm, and Biden White House told Americans that the increase in LNG exports would disproportionately increase prices for American consumers as well as from the environment," an official said. A September 2024 court filing from Government Accountability and Oversight (GAO) revealed that the Energy Department was conducting an LNG study in 2023, Comer's office told Fox News Digital.

"There are so many things we don't know," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday, and "uncertainty is remarkably high." Waller and his Fed colleagues on Wednesday kept their median estimate first made in December for two rate cuts in 2025, even as a much-studied "dot plot" showed a large number of policymakers favored fewer or no cuts. The biggest challenge for the Fed going forward may be how to balance both sides of their mandate — maximum employment and price stabilities — as uncertainties mount about both of those goals.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to take questions from journalists after the central bank held interest rates steady amid increasing economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's agenda. The Fed held interest rates at current levels for the second straight meeting after three consecutive rate cuts to end 2024. In recent months, many Fed officials have made clear they are increasingly concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025. Policymakers on Wednesday forecasted higher inflation this year than previously projected and saw slower economic growth this year. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance</p>

Apple (AAPL) is off by 14% year to date, Microsoft (MSFT) 9%, Amazon (AMZN) 12%, Google (GOOG) 14%, and Tesla (TSLA) a stunning 49%. Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang dropped a host of big numbers around artificial intelligence's potential.

Nvidia stock's reversal comes as Wall Street analysts walked away from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched GTC 2025 keynote Tuesday optimistic about the company's roadmap and AI demand, doubling down on their bullish outlooks on the chipmaker in notes to investors. Huang reiterated that he sees data center spending on compute hardware (i.e., Nvidia's total addressable market) reaching $1 trillion. And I am fairly certain we're going to reach that very soon,” he told a large crowd. “During the keynote session, Jensen Huang presented a compelling case on how innovations in AI models, such as DeepSeek, will drive higher compute complexity and necessitate increasing compute demand,” wrote JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur in a note early Wednesday. “There was little commentary comparing the use cases [of Nvidia's GPUs] vs. peers or ASICs [custom chips made by companies such as Broadcom seen as competition for Nvidia's GPUs],” Jefferies (JEF) analyst Blayne Curtis wrote late Tuesday, adding that Vera Rubin “will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.”</p>

The government has also announced it will pass legislation to deliver a so-called ‘right to try”, which Kendall argued would ensure people are able to “take the plunge and try work – without the fear this will put their benefits at risk”. Ministers added they would invest an additional £1bn a year by 2029-30 to help support people into work, including through one-to-one help. She added: “With a stagnant disability employment gap of 28 per cent, we need to do much better.” She added: “We know the government are listening on many areas that we have said are hugely important, and there is no more important time, I think, for our economy than when we look to the spring statement next week.”</p>

Up, the dip buyers hope, taking advantage of Wall Street's newfound pessimism with cash and courage. Bank of America equity strategists wrote on Tuesday that as the market entered correction territory last week, clients poured into US equities, targeting single stocks. “The damage to longer-term breadth, lack of institutional participation, and defensive rotational pressures leave us cautious on buying the dip right now,” wrote Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. The unraveling AI trade doesn't yet have a clear catalyst to rebound; growth concerns may soon become crystallized in objective data; the Fed's rate-cutting ability to protect growth will be hamstrung by pressure to counteract tariffs; and the tariff deadline next month is another economic time bomb.

I have something of a reputation as a party-pooper in the New Scientist office. At our weekly meeting to discuss the latest and greatest ideas in science, colleagues will eagerly describe some incredible new theory or spectacular find, then sit back to field questions. I can already hear the groans before I open my mouth to say: “Yes, but what is the actual evidence?”

I don't do this because I enjoy shooting down ideas (OK, maybe I do…

Feedback is New Scientist's popular sideways look at the latest science and technology news. Feedback was going to suggest this was Lego subtly arguing that, despite what the experts say, we should go ahead and construct a mirror organism in which key molecules have the opposite handedness to existing life – even if it might kill us all. The whole saga leads us to wonder if “corporate strategy” might be an oxymoron on a par with “military intelligence”. Authors Thomas Clements and Stephan Lautenschlager seek to understand one key moment from Return of the Jedi. To avoid being eaten, Luke picks up a long bone and lodges it vertically in the Rancor's mouth, locking its jaw open.</p>

As Venus approaches its inferior conjunction, astrophotographers have snapped some striking shots of the crescent planet looking like a giant rainbow in space. New photos have revealed the "love planet" Venus looking unrecognizable as it prepares to line up for a striking conjunction later this week. The striking rainbow effect is caused by particles in Earth's atmosphere refracting, or splitting apart, different wavelengths of light like a prism, according to Spaceweather.com. The same effect was also captured by Kevin R. Witman, who snapped a less-detailed image of Venus' rainbow crescent from Cochranville, Pennsylvania on March 9. More recently, on March 16, astronomer Raffaello Lena captured video footage of the rainbow effect from near Rome, Italy.</p>

In tests, researchers successfully transmitted data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) over 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) outdoors using two Taara chips. These traditional cables are typically buried deep underground, making them impractical for remote areas or challenging terrains, such as mountains and forests. Taara also sends data as optical signals; however, it avoids the need for underground cables and networks that require physical maintenance.

But it wasn't until 2004 that researchers started sifting out supernova remnants from ocean samples. This finding required an origin story even more unusual than the violent star deaths that birth supernovas. Now, Fields and his colleagues suspect that a separate kilonova event predated those two previously identified supernovas, erupting at least 10 million years ago.

Ja'Marr Chase reset the non-quarterback market with his new four-year, $161 million deal (with $112 million guaranteed), as the Bengals broke the bank to keep Joe Burrow happy this offseason by re-signing his two top targets in Chase and Tee Higgins. Chase has been one of the NFL's most productive and consistent receivers since joining the Bengals, as he and Burrow picked up right where they left off at LSU. On Wednesday, Chase and Higgins met with the media in Cincinnati to discuss their new contracts, and Chase couldn't help but note that while he has set down roots and come to love the city, he still isn't used to the (in his eyes) less than stellar food. I particularly love that Chase tries to position it as an area for improvement with the "we can work on that," like Cincinnati just needs to get in the kitchen and grind a little harder. With $112 million guaranteed, Chase could do his part and import a couple chefs from New Orleans to open a restaurant and help bring Cincy's food scene up to his standards.</p>

But even if Pickens' didn't post that picture of he and Brady, the Raiders make sense as a possible trade partner given their current receiver situation. Sutton, a seven-year veteran who caught 81 passes for 1,081 yards and eight touchdowns last season, is entering the final year of his current contract. Based on his talent and contract situation, it's more than possible that Denver may be willing to part with Sutton in exchange for Pickens, whose big-play potential could help Bo Nix take the next step following a highly successful rookie season. A proven wideout would also help open things up for Marvin Harrison Jr. following his good but not great rookie season. With Pickens, the Cardinals would have a pretty impressive list of skill players that also includes Harrison, quarterback Kyler Murray, tight end Trey McBride and former Steelers Pro Bowl running back James Conner.</p>

Minnesota still plans to add another veteran quarterback, Pelissero reported, but Rodgers isn't among the options "at this time." The Vikings may not be completely ruling out a later exploration of Rodgers, according to ESPN, especially if McCarthy "gets reinjured or [demonstrates] a need for more development time" ahead of training camp. Minnesota, meanwhile, only surfaced as a speculated landing spot once 2024 starter Sam Darnold signed elsewhere in free agency. For Rodgers, a Vikings team-up makes sense: Besides the ironic Brett Favre parallels, going from the Green Bay Packers to New York Jets to wearing purple, he would've found an enviable setup in Minnesota, where coach Kevin O'Connell and playmakers like Justin Jefferson helped Darnold reach career heights in 2024. The Giants and Steelers now register as Rodgers' other obvious options for 2025, barring a retirement at age 41.</p>

Their plus-22 goal differential is second only to the Tampa Bay Lightning, another streaking contender. Few front offices, if any, have been more aggressive than the Avalanche this year. That was followed by the deal that sent Mikko Rantanen to Carolina for Martin Necas, who has been a perfect fit up front. On the blue line, Cale Makar leads all defensemen in goals (25) and assists (53).

Bradbury started all 88 games he played for Minnesota after arriving as a first-round pick in 2019, and he's in line to replace David Andrews as the heart of the line protecting Drake Maye.

Tennessee Titans: They have other proven veterans in the lineup, including Tony Pollard and Calvin Ridley.</p>

Morris, a 13-year NBA veteran who has not played this season, continued on by bringing up the situation with former Sixers player James Harden who famously called out Morey in a very public fashion while touring around China to promote his new basketball shoes in 2023.

I like the fit for Jeanty largely because of who will be calling plays in Vegas. With young left guard Jackson Powers-Johnson and Kolton Miller on the left side and a right side of the line that's still growing, it's easy to see how Jeanty can fit into this formula for a team like Vegas. Chicago traded for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson, then added center Drew Dalman in free agency. If there's an explosive skill position player available, the Cowboys should be in on it. This is another commonly mocked spot for Jeanty, and it makes a lot of sense.</p>

Philadelphia allowed defensive tackle Milton Williams, pass rusher Josh Sweat, guard Mekhi Becton, cornerback Darius Slay, cornerback Isaiah Rodgers, and linebacker Oren Burks to depart in free agency and traded safety C.J. This will significantly increase an already growing pick total over the next two drafts. Having all these picks is a luxury for general manager Howie Roseman, who is in position to strike for a major acquisition this offseason. Philadelphia isn't going into the year with Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt as their starters on the edge, and Bryce Huff made an average annual salary of $17 million to be a healthy scratch in Super Bowl LIX. These are the Eagles' top three options ahead of Uche and Ojulari.</p>

The Florida Gators are top seed as the NCAA Tournament begins and while history is full of examples that prove earning one of those doesn't guarantee you anything... this whole thing feels like it is theirs to lose. Auburn comes in line right after Florida at +550 which really heightens, as many have noted, how strong the SEC was overall. Thankfully this week offered me the chance to sit down with Ian Eagle and Clark Kellogg to discuss the tournament at large, plus their partnership with Wendy's, and both gentlemen believe that this could be Florida's year as well. Ian touched on guard play and Florida has that in serious fashion at the moment.

This season, it seems like most of the true impact players changing teams in free agency were on defense. The key word to keep in mind there is interesting, and that can be on a schematic level or some other level, but it doesn't necessarily mean it has to include the most expensive or noteworthy players. Either way, giving Matthew Stafford two elite receivers is always fun, so let's do it again. The Chiefs going out and paying Moore -- who has been a backup throughout his entire four-year career -- to protect Patrick Mahomes' blind side is, technically, really interesting. Moore has given up 36 pressures on 446 pass-blocking snaps, according to Pro Football Focus, an 8.1% pressure rate.</p>

Gardner-Johnson departed via free agency or trade, as Philadelphia is left to pick up the pieces of its championship roster. The Eagles are also replacing Kellen Moore at offensive coordinator, but this team is still equipped to make another Super Bowl run. No team was gutted in free agency more than the 49ers, who lost several key pieces on their defense. The Cowboys were cautiously aggressive in free agency, improving at running back with Williams and Sanders after having just six touchdowns as a group last year. The Falcons are moving forward with Michael Penix at quarterback, possibly trying to find a suitor for Kirk Cousins after their $180 million blunder.</p>

The movement profile on Burnes' cutter has been a little inconsistent, which isn't what we wanted to see after he rediscovered it last September. Maybe we file this one under "Wishful Thinking" because no player in professional baseball is looking more snake-bitten than DeLauter these days. He has barely played as a professional – 96 games since 2022 – and had his spring derailed with early-March sports hernia surgery that will knock him out until May at the earliest.

The Steelers lost Donte Jackson in free agency and need to find another solid starter opposite Joey Porter Jr. After releasing defensive tackle Jonathan Allen on Friday, the Commanders would love to immediately add another impact player up front.

Sasaki got countryman Seiya Suzuki, the second batter he faced, to swing through a 99.3 mph fastball for his first MLB strikeout. He got himself in trouble with some walks," Cubs manager Craig Counsell said after the game. It's an outlier because the pitch averages a spin rate right around 500 rpm, which is exceptionally low. "The unique thing about his split-finger is it's very unpredictable," Roberts said prior to Wednesday's game (via Dodger Blue). Sasaki has  dealt with his share of injuries, limiting him to 33 combined starts  across the last two seasons.</p>

There is not a trace of disrespect or doubt about SGA's stunning season and rock-solid MVP résumé. Those are career highs in points and assists per game for a three-time MVP. Both SGA and Jokić should, were it not for the other, win this year's award. That sense was driven home in conversations with others across the NBA community about this year's MVP showdown. One thing, and maybe only one thing about this MVP race, is clear: The closing few weeks will be critical in a contest between two remarkable players having remarkable seasons in which every twist, turn, and eye-popping performance could end up making the difference.</p>

It's obviously not that simple; many other elements – some nothing even to do with football – come into play. But when it comes to England, the nuance of thought is abandoned and replaced by shouting 'why doesn't he just play ?' Former England star Chris Waddle reckons Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel should avoid calling up Arsenal defender Ben White for at least two years. Thomas Tuchel asked Morgan Gibbs-White if he was still upset having initially missed out on the German's first England squad. Thomas Tuchel has been slammed for including former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson in his first England squad over three alternatives.</p>

That worries the SEC, which is built on beating up its teams and leaving several title contenders with three losses. The Tigers do not play back-to-back road games, which is incredible, but trips to Clemson, Ole Miss, Alabama and Oklahoma are gigantic landmines. The defensive line is of particular concern, though Suntarine Perkins (10.5 sacks) returns as Walter Nolen and Princely Umanmielen chase their NFL dreams. Remember, he came into the game and led a touchdown drive in that blowout of Georgia last season. Texas draws a difficult schedule, too, starting with the season opener at defending national champion Ohio State (eke!).</p>

It's so shocking," Thurston told ABC News' Eva Pilgrim in an interview that aired Wednesday on "Good Morning America." Thurston received her diagnosis in February, just a few months after she became engaged to comedian Jeff Acuri. Thurston told Pilgrim that she hopes sharing her story encourages people to be proactive about their own breast health. "I think that's the biggest takeaway, is telling people like, 'Don't wait,' you know, 'Be proactive, get checked out,'" she said. Most women with average risk should start screening for breast cancer at age 40, and get screened every other year through age 74, according to guidance from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed group of experts whose conclusions guide medical decision making and determine some insurance policies.</p>

Bella says the diagnosis has been “freeing… It enables me to walk through the world with more grace towards myself about not being able to do the easy everyday tasks that everyone else seems to be able to do.”

Bella also revealed how the diagnosis came about, sharing, "a crew member with an autistic daughter assumed that Ramsey had [autism], setting [Bella] off on a journey that ended in a formal psychiatric assessment and diagnosis."

They added, “The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that's helped me to understand myself, but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I'm putting myself into a box. I feel trapped.”
