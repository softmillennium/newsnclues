A Stone Age circular monument in England is even older than Stonehenge , raising the possibility that Stonehenge's creators used it as inspiration, a new study finds. When researchers radiocarbon-dated artifacts from the large monument, known as Flagstones, they found that it dates to about 3200 B.C. The discovery "makes Flagstones the earliest large circular enclosure known in Britain," said study first author Susan Greaney , a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Exeter in the U.K. "It might be that Flagstones was copied at Stonehenge, or it might be that we need to go back to our dates of Stonehenge and think again," she told Live Science in an email. Excavations unearthed a 330-foot-wide (100 meters) circular ditch that was made with intersecting pits. The pits have at least four sets of human remains: a cremated adult and three children whose bodies were buried there.

By combining these dates with those of archaeological finds from the site, Greaney and her colleagues estimated that the pits were dug around 3650 B.C. but that the circular enclosure wasn't formed until 3200 B.C. At 5,200 years old, Flagstones is the oldest known large, circular enclosure of its kind in Britain. After its construction, circular monuments were built in numerous other locations. "It is part of a shift from predominantly rectangular or linear monuments (cursus monuments, long barrows) or irregular enclosures (causewayed enclosures) towards circular forms," Greaney said. The new study suggests that circular monuments like Flagstones "may have been influenced by practices in Ireland, where people were burying their cremated dead in circular passage tombs at this time," she said. After all, some of Stonehenge's artifacts are thought to be older than the site itself. "There are some 'curated' animal bones from near the entrances to the enclosure at Stonehenge, which do date from around 3200 BC," Greaney said. "It's been assumed that these deer bones and cattle skulls had been kept for some time before being deposited in the ditch. "With the new dates from Flagstones, it's now possible to look at these deposits, which were in slightly deeper parts of the ditch, and ask whether there was an earlier enclosure made up of intercutting pits which only later people joined together to form the more continuous ditch, which happened in c. [circa] 2900 BC," Greaney added. Stonehenge quiz: What do you know about the ancient monument?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The ceasefire in Gaza seems to be over. And although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to blame Hamas for the resumption of combat that killed more than 400 Palestinians on March 18, 2025 - "It's just the beginning," Netanyahu warned - the truth is that the seeds of renewed violence are in Israeli internal politics. Since the first phase of ceasefire came into force in January, experts in Israeli politics - including me - pointed out a probably insurmountable problem. Instead, its stated position is that Israel remains in control of the enclave and push as many Palestinians as possible out of it. As an expert in Israeli history and a teacher of peace studies, I believe that the extreme right view for Gaza Post-conflict shared by parts of Netanyahu's government is incompatible with the ceasefire plan. But increasingly, it seems to be in accordance with the opinions of some US government members - which, as a fact sponsor of the ceasefire, may have been the only entity that could have kept the Israeli government in its terms. It is true that Hamas is responsible for delays and manipulations during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. He also transformed the release of hostages into propaganda shows, plaguing both hostage families and much of Israeli society in the process. Since taking power in January 2023, Netanyahu's far -right government has made significant efforts to transform independent institutions, such as the Attorney General and the police, into government's complacent arms, seeking to put loyal to the government in charge of both. In 2023, a movement of continuous and massive protest braked Netanyahu's attempts to reformulate the country's judiciary. And then came the Hamas Massacre on October 7th. Many Israeli commentators hoped that the attack would force the government to reconsider their efforts to accomplish what some have described as a legal blow in a demonstration of national unity. But Netanyahu and his government had other plans. After an initial agreement with hostages in November 2023 failed to produce a broader advance, people gradually began to question whether Netanyahu's main interest was to extend the war in the belief that this could be the best way to save his political career and revive his attack on the judiciary. Having been indicted in November 2019 for breach of trust, fraud and charges of corruption, Netanyahu had the opportunity to confuse the logic of long -term legal processes: he could hardly be tried while defending a nation at war. The accusation is still in progress, but the resumption of fighting has once again meant that Netanyahu has reason to postpone his testimony. Meanwhile, the war also covers Netanyahu to neutralize some of its fiercest critics. This anti -netanyAhu purge in Israel has increased in recent months with Netanyahu and his allies seeking to replace Attorney General Gali Baharav-Himiara and dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the powerful security agency Shabak, or Shin Bet, who has been conducting confidential investigations into Netanyaahu's closest advisers. According to Israeli law, the government needs to approve its annual budget by the end of March or may be dissolved, which would cause new elections. Ultra -Orthodox parties, however, are demanding otherwise: to approve legislation that would formally exempt them from military service. Trump's recent statements suggest that he supports additional military pressure on Hamas in Gaza. Doing this would give the Palestinian militant group the best chance to remain in Gaza's control, while boasting of being responsible for release thousands of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons. And the Ancient Writing Movement is gaining strength again, as seen in widespread protests in Israeli cities against the resumption of combat in Gaza and attempting to dismiss security chief Ronen Bar. Israel is facing an unprecedented situation in which I would say, his own prime minister has become the greatest threat to the country's stability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15, 2025, and deported about 200 Venezuelan immigrants his administration alleged have ties to a Venezuelan gang. “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in a written statement on March 18. Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., posed a few questions to Cassandra Burke Robertson, a scholar of civil proceedings and legal ethics, to break down some of the dynamics of this complex, evolving case. Is it rare for a Supreme Court justice to weigh in on politicians’ activities or statements? He has also consistently recognized that presidents have broad authority to run the federal government. However, this isn’t the first time Roberts has spoken up to protect judicial independence. Why is Roberts’ statement of note, and what influence does he have in this situation? Since Roberts was confirmed as chief justice in 2005, he has often spoken publicly about why judges need to remain independent from political pressure. His words are a reminder about the importance of keeping courts free from political interference. First, Trump is using a rarely used wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act. This law allows for deportations during a time of war without the normal legal protections like court hearings. They worry that invoking the Alien Enemies Act inappropriately expands presidential power beyond constitutional limits and could be misused to target other immigrant groups. Second, Boasberg ordered a stop to these deportations on March 15. Under our legal system, the executive branch must obey valid court orders. There’s no evidence that Boasberg acted corruptly or improperly – he simply made a legal ruling the president disagreed with. The case touches on fundamental questions about the balance of power between presidents and courts, and what happens when an administration chooses not to follow a judge’s orders. This confrontation between branches represents one of the most direct challenges to judicial authority by a president in American history. What would it take for a judge to be impeached, and what is the precedent for doing so, based on disagreements about a case? Federal judges can only be impeached by Congress for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That generally means serious wrongdoing, not just making unpopular decisions. First, the House of Representatives votes to impeach, needing just a simple majority. The only two judicial impeachments during this century involved very serious misconduct – including a judge who lied about sexually abusing two female employees in 2009. Only judges who have serious misconduct have been impeached and removed from office – not those involved in cases of political disagreements about judicial decisions. What are the most important legal and ethical questions that this case raises? This doesn’t mean every court decision is always right. That’s why the legal system has appellate courts, as Roberts pointed out – so decisions people disagree with can be challenged through an appeal in proper channels. When a government chooses to ignore court orders instead of appealing them through the legal system, it creates a serious threat to this principle.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There are roughly 1,500 known species of sea spider, with some measuring up to 20 inches in leg span. Sea spiders, also known as pycnogonids, are distant cousins of the creepy-crawly arachnids we see scuttling about on land. These creatures can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) — nearly double those of the largest land spiders , whose leg spans top out at around 12 inches (30 cm). In this case, the pycnogonid was filmed at a depth of 6,903 feet (2,104 meters). Deep-sea gigantism is particularly prevalent toward the poles, where freezing temperatures facilitate slower metabolisms. Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives described sea spiders as both "abundant" and "abundantly large" in polar regions. The largest members of this group are usually found at depths between 7,200 and 13,100 feet (2,200 to 4,000 m), according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute . Instead of spinning webs or creating burrows as land spiders do, sea spiders use a specialized tube-like mouth structure, called a proboscis, to slurp up prey such as sea anemones, jellies and other invertebrates. This latest footage was taken by remotely operated vehicle pilots as part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute's South Sandwich Islands expedition, a mission to locate and describe new species in these frigid waters. According to the institute, scientists have discovered only 10% of ocean life.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The court order to pause the agency’s shuttering came days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 83% of its programs had been cut. USAID was created in 1961 as the lead agency for U.S. international development. Until recently, it funded health and humanitarian aid programs in more than 130 countries. Despite the administration’s claim of cost-cutting, USAID was a relatively small and economical operation. Its US$40 billion budget accounted for just 0.7% of annual federal spending. Congress also required regular reporting and evaluations on USAID, helping to ensure substantial oversight of how it spent its taxpayer dollars. USAID’s swift destruction has sent shock waves across the globe. Countries give foreign aid for both altruistic and self-interested reasons. Treating global diseases and addressing civil conflicts is a way for wealthy Western governments to limit threats that could destabilize their countries, as well as the rest of the world. It also burnishes their reputation and encourages cooperation with other governments. Other development experts contend that foreign aid programs, while imperfect, have still made meaningful progress in improving health, education and freedoms. “I have never heard of someone being told, as a result of accepting DFID funds, what to do, either explicitly or behind closed doors,” he told me. Development professionals decried Johnson’s merger, arguing it could not have happened at a worse time, with the pandemic heightening the need for global health funding. Five years later, it’s not clear that dismantling DFID has made British foreign aid more efficient or effective, as Johnson pledged. “We have seen evidence of where a more integrated approach has improved the organisation’s ability to respond to international crises and events, which has led to a better result,” reads one 2025 report by the U.K.’s National Audit Office. Yet, the auditors add, the British government has spent at least £24.7 million – US$32 million – to merge its aid and diplomacy offices, and it failed to track these costs. DFID produced regular case studies of the projects it funded, which included getting Syrian refugee children back in school, building roads that help Rwandan farmers move their products to market, and providing health care after Pakistan’s 2010 floods. Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the leftist Labour Party, initially promised to boost British foreign aid. But in early March 2025, he backtracked, announcing instead a further cut to foreign aid. By 2027, the U.K. government will spend just 0.3% of its budget on overseas aid. That’s roughly $11 billion less than before the merger in 2019. If this effort succeeds, it will have even more severe effects worldwide, at least in the immediate term. The PEPFAR program, which USAID helps administer, distributes antiretroviral drugs worldwide. Development professionals tend to see independent government agencies such as USAID and DFID as better able to prioritize the needs of the poor because their programming is run separately from partisan policies. DFID was a clear and easy target when Johnson began his pandemic-era budget-slashing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Most of the United States’ major climate regulations are underpinned by one important document: It’s called the endangerment finding, and it concludes that greenhouse gas emissions are a threat to human health and welfare. But revoking the endangerment finding isn’t a simple task. And doing so could have unintended consequences for the very industries Trump is trying to help. As a law professor, I have tracked federal climate regulations and the lawsuits and court rulings that have followed them over the past 25 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest assessment report, involving hundreds of scientists and thousands of studies from around the world, concluded that the scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is “unequivocal” and that greenhouse gases from human activities are causing it. During President Donald Trump’s first term, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt considered repealing the endangerment finding but ultimately decided against it. In fact, he relied on it in proposing the Affordable Clean Energy Rule to replace President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions for coal-fired power plants. Zeldin must then initiate rulemaking in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, provide the opportunity for public comment and respond to comments that are likely to be voluminous. This process could take several months if done properly. Even if Zeldin is able to revoke the finding, that does not automatically repeal all the rules that rely on it. Each of those rules must go through separate rulemaking processes that will also take months. However, a blanket policy abdicating any enforcement responsibility could be challenged in lawsuits as arbitrary and capricious. Further, the regulated industries would be taking a chance if they delayed complying with regulations only to find the endangerment finding and climate laws still in place. Zeldin previewed his arguments in a news release on March 12. His first argument is that the 2009 endangerment finding did not consider costs. States and cities have filed dozens of lawsuits against the major oil companies. The industry’s strongest argument has been that these cases are preempted by federal law. In AEP v. Connecticut in 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act “displaced” federal common law, barring state claims for remedies related to damages from climate change. However, if the endangerment finding is repealed, then there is arguably no basis for federal preemption, and these state lawsuits would have legal grounds. Prominent industry lawyers have warned the EPA about this and urged it to focus instead on changing individual regulations. To the extent that Zeldin is counting on the conservative Supreme Court to back him up, he may be disappointed. In 2024, the court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations when laws were ambiguous. That means Zeldin’s reinterpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference. Nor can he count on the court overturning its Massachusetts v. EPA ruling to free him to disregard science for policy reasons.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

New photos have revealed the "love planet" Venus looking unrecognizable as it prepares to line up for a striking conjunction later this week. Over the last few weeks and months, the planet has been waning as it gets closer to alignment, giving it an increasingly crescent-like appearance. Astrophotographer Douglas Kostyk set out to capture the disappearing planet on March 8 at the Marian and Max Farash Center for Observational Astronomy in Ionia, New York — when only around 7% of Venus was visible. But his photos also showed that the crescent looked like a cosmic rainbow. The striking rainbow effect is caused by particles in Earth's atmosphere refracting, or splitting apart, different wavelengths of light like a prism, according to Spaceweather.com . The same effect was also captured by Kevin R. Witman, who snapped a less-detailed image of Venus' rainbow crescent from Cochranville, Pennsylvania on March 9. More recently, on March 16, astronomer Raffaello Lena captured video footage of the rainbow effect from near Rome, Italy. In this instance, atmospheric turbulence caused the light coming from Venus to shimmer and become distorted, making it appear as if the rainbow was "on fire," Spaceweather.com reported .

Did you know that tuberculosis (TB) brought us the Adirondack chair? TB also brought about the cities of Pasadena, California, and Colorado Springs, Colorado, which were founded as places for TB patients to seek fresh air. And did you know that before penning "Sherlock Holmes," Sir Arthur Conan Doyle debunked a supposed cure for TB that had been overhyped in the press in the 19th century? In " Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection " (Crash Course Books, 2025), John Green recounts these unsung ways in which TB shaped history. He also highlights how public perception of the disease has shifted through time. TB was once seen as a romantic condition that rendered people with the illness "beautiful," "waiflike" and "sensitive," but the illness later became seen as a stigmatizing disease of poverty. Live Science spoke with him about his latest book, its featured subject, TB survivor Henry Reider, and the uncertain future of efforts to end TB worldwide. How was it to have that idea dispelled through writing the book? John Green: If you'd asked me in 2018, "What are the biggest infectious health problems facing the world," I would have said, "I don't know, malaria, HIV , typhoid, cholera." I would have been so far down the list before I said tuberculosis, even though it turns out tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease in the world and sickens over 10 million people every year. He said, "I know we're more afraid of cholera and plague, but actually tuberculosis is a much bigger deal." Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors I just had no idea that tuberculosis was a crisis until I visited a TB hospital in Sierra Leone in 2019. NL: Henry is a big focus of the book. For those who haven't read it yet, could you share a bit about him? He seemed to be about the same age as my son, who was 9 at the time, and he also shares a name with my son. He and I have become really good friends and through the process of reporting this — like, I'm not a good reporter. However, it is also true that like so many people whose lives are marginalized, his life is made much more fragile by the recent cuts to USAID, and his life is made much more challenging by the recent cuts to USAID. That's been a constant topic of conversation between him and me over the last few weeks. Related: 'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever Like a lot of people, he depends upon USAID-funded medication in order to survive, and that funding has been canceled.

He has what used to be called spes phthisica [meaning "consumptive spirit"], the "tubercular personality." Because at least in Northern Europe and the U.S., consumption was an inherited disease that was associated with being beautiful and having certain personality traits that were desirable. It was widely believed in the 18th and 19th centuries that only white people could get tuberculosis. NL: We've touched on this already, but could you expand on how USAID factors into TB efforts worldwide and what it means for that funding to be disrupted? [Beyond our own work], I'd like to highlight the work that has been done to reduce TB death by over 50% in the last 25 years. But it won't accomplish its biggest dreams, and that's entirely because of the decision to stop funding essentially all global health services. Related: 10 of the deadliest superbugs that scientists are worried about NL: And in tuberculosis, continuity of care is very important. JG: Continuity of care is essential for curing tuberculosis. If someone has even a couple of weeks without access to their medication, it's vastly more likely that their disease will become drug resistant, which is a personal catastrophe because it means that they are much more likely to die of tuberculosis. It's also a societal catastrophe because it means there's much more drug-resistant tuberculosis floating around, having the opportunity to evolve ever more drug resistance. We don't even know how many people's treatment is being interrupted right now because we have no way to count it. NL: In a moment when the situation feels so bleak, is there anything bringing you hope? JG: It's inevitable for me to feel like I live at the end of history because today is the most recent day I've ever experienced, you know, and so this feels like the culmination of everything that came before, but I don't live at the end of history. That's what gives me hope, and working with people I love. In this work, you get to work with people you care about and whose love and attention is focused in the same direction as yours, and there's a lot of comfort in that for me.

Researchers have detected four small exoplanets orbiting closely around Barnard's Star. The rocky alien worlds are close enough that future generations of humans may be able to visit them with futuristic rocket propulsion technology. However, it is unlikely that we will find any life there. Astronomers have long suspected that there was at least one exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star — a red dwarf with a mass around one-sixth that of the sun. In the past, researchers assumed that Barnard's Star was circled by a gas giant exoplanet similar to Jupiter, because the star frequently wobbles closer to and then farther from Earth. This suggests that something is gravitationally tugging on the star, similar to how the moon pulls on our planet and causes Earth's tides. However, proving the existence of such a planet has remained elusive. But in a new study, published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , researchers say they have discovered that this wobbling is not caused by the pull of one gas giant but instead by the combined force exerted by four smaller, rocky worlds, each around four times more massive than Mercury. "Barnard's Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it." "That probably means they are too hot to be habitable." But that doesn't mean this system will remain uninhabited forever. Although Barnard's Star is currently out of reach for humans using current rocket propulsion technology, future human generations might be able to travel to and colonize these newly discovered planets using new forms of rocket propulsion, such as nuclear fusion engines or light sails. However, in this case, researchers think we are looking at Barnard's Star from above, meaning its planets do not pass in between it and us. Researchers previously believed that Barnard's Star was circled by a gas giant similar to Jupiter. By combining these data with their own, the researchers could see this fourth planet for themselves. Using data from both MAROON-X and ESPRESSO also challenges the idea that the researchers are being misled by anomalies in either data set, making them more confident in their results. Red dwarfs are the most common star type in the universe, but most are too far from Earth for researchers to easily spot planets around them. However, the new results hint that small, rocky planets could be abundant around these miniature stars.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Oxytocin is a chemical messenger that has effects on the brain and throughout the body, where it functions as a hormone. Oxytocin, the "cuddle hormone" that's known for its involvement in bonding, may also play a role in putting early pregnancies on pause, a study of lab animals finds. New research in mice shows that the hormone can put embryos in the earliest stages of development into a kind of hibernation state. "The fact that oxytocin had an influence on this was a little bit of a surprise," study co-author Moses Chao , a neuroscientist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told Live Science. It's not clear how long diapause can last, Chao said, nor is much known about how embryos enter this state of suspended animation.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The researchers found that the resulting pregnancies lasted about a week longer in still-nursing female mice than they did in mice that were not nursing. The team then set about exploring how this pause might occur. In another group of newly pregnant mice, the team used a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to switch on specific neurons, to make the brains of the mouse moms release oxytocin. After five days of this treatment, they removed the mice's uteruses to assess embryonic development. Meanwhile, in a comparison group, pregnant mice who did not have their oxytocin stimulated did not show any signs of diapause. In another experiment, the team treated early mouse embryos with oxytocin in lab dishes, and that also induced cellular changes consistent with diapause. This multistep process involves copying down instructions from DNA into a new molecule, called RNA , that gets shipped to a cell's protein construction sites. Embryos without oxytocin receptors can still undergo diapause, Chao noted, so there are probably multiple signals that can trigger the pause. Eventually, a better understanding of these mechanisms might reveal insight into why early miscarriages happen in people and could possibly lead to new fertility treatments. The new findings could also be helpful for understanding cell survival more generally, Chao added. "Later on [in development], you don't want half your cells dying," Chao said, "so we're very interested in what keeps those cells going."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Salto the robot is acting a little squirrelly. It’s the first time scientists have been able to get a robot to land balanced on such a tiny target, says engineer Justin Yim, whose team reported the results March 19 in Science Robotics. They can scamper over telephone wires, vault between trees and even navigate Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses. A secret to squirrels’ parkour prowess is exceptional balance. Even if a jump carries them a bit beyond or short of their target, squirrels can maneuver their bodies into staying upright. One way is by adjusting how hard their legs push against a branch as they land, Yim and his collaborators reported February 27 in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Yim’s team tried to mimic those strategies in Salto, a spindly little hopping bot that was developed in 2016, and named after “saltatorial,” or jumping, movement. In test jumps in the lab, Salto successfully leapt from one PVC pipe to another 25 times out of 30, catching the tube and swinging over or under it most of the time. But in two trials, Salto leapt, landed and perched just perfectly, balancing upright on the pipe. “There’s lots of room for improvement,” Yim says. Salto may not be ready to join Cirque du Soleil yet, but he has ideas about how to improve the bot’s balance. One way would be enhancing its gripper, making it better for grasping the pipe upon landing, like a squirrel squeezing a branch with its toes. Yim envisions future bots that are even more agile than Salto and could one day help with construction, hopping onto pipes or girders while carrying cameras for inspection, for example, or working outside in a forest doing environmental monitoring.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The latest COPs have been marked by breaking expectations as to the result of negotiations, but it is undeniable that the event is still an important time for civil society to be heard from the impacts of climate emergency. Like international human rights spaces, most climate negotiation processes occur in the global North, in high -cost places, making it difficult to access much of civil society in southern countries. Thus, conducting COP in Belém represents a unique opportunity for groups such as the indigenous peoples of the Amazon to be heard. But how to ensure this when your voices have been neglected by the state government itself? By revoking Law 7,806, this law not only ended benefits from teachers of the State Education Network, but also impacted indigenous, riverside and quilombola communities of the State of Pará, as it extinguished the system of Modular Indigenous Education Organization (Somei), a system that guaranteed the high school in person. In the same subject, the teachers' report was that the state was not guaranteeing the proper infrastructure, not even feeding for students: it was insufficient and did not respect local food culture. With this, finally, after 23 days of occupation, on February 5, 2025, Governor Helder Barbalho partially complied with the claims by signing the commitment to revoke the law. In the end, an important victory was won for the indigenous movement, as it has not been seen for a long time, and that also benefited state teachers. The government's stance against indigenous peoples was not surprised. The history of the state of Pará is marked by processes that ignore indigenous peoples. Despite more than 30 public civil actions started by the Federal Public Prosecution Service, the project was conducted without any observance of ILO Convention 169. The ILO Convention 169, also known as a convention on indigenous and tribal peoples, states that prior, free and informed consultation is a right of indigenous peoples. The case makes us wonder if COP 30 will be a truly inclusive space, open to the participation of indigenous peoples in climate decision making. However, the victory of indigenous mobilization reminds us of the importance that the climate conference is first held in the Amazon, allowing those who will be some of the most affected by climate change, can press so that their voices are heard at the multilateral negotiation event that will decide our future.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/the-gaza-ceasefire-is-dead-israeli-domestic-politics-killed-it-252569'>The Gaza ceasefire is dead − Israeli domestic politics killed it</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 13:21:44 <p>
The ceasefire in Gaza appears to be over. Ever since the first phase of the ceasefire came into effect in January, Israeli politics experts – myself included – have flagged a likely insurmountable problem. Withdrawing from the Gaza Strip runs counter to the maximalist ideologies of key members of Netanyahu’s government, including some in his own party, Likud. Rather, their stated position is for Israel to remain in control of the enclave and to push as many Palestinians as possible out of it. It is why many in Netanyahu’s government cheered when President Donald Trump indicated that Palestinians should be cleared from Gaza to make way for a massive reconstruction project led by the United States. As an expert on Israeli history and a professor of peace studies, I believe the far-right vision for post-conflict Gaza shared by parts of Netanyahu’s government is incompatible with the ceasefire plan. It is true Hamas is responsible for delays and manipulations during the first phase of the ceasefire deal. It also turned hostage releases into propaganda spectacles, tormenting both the families of captives and much of Israeli society in the process. Since coming to power in January 2023, Netanyahu’s hard-right government has made significant efforts to turn independent institutions such as the attorney general’s office and the police into compliant arms of the government by seeking to place government loyalists in charge of both. Many Israeli commentators hoped that the attack would force the government to reconsider its efforts to carry out what some described as a legal coup, in a show of national unity. But Netanyahu and his government had other plans. After an initial hostage deal in November 2023 failed to yield a wider breakthrough, people gradually began to question whether Netanyahu’s primary interest was to prolong the war in the belief that doing so might be the best way to save his political career and revive his assault on the judiciary. Having been indicted in November 2019 on breach of trust, fraud and corruption charges, Netanyahu was presented with an opportunity to muddy the logic of the long-running legal proceedings: He could hardy stand trial while defending a nation at war. The prosecution is still ongoing, but the resumption of fighting has, again, meant that Netanyahu has reason to delay his testimony. Meanwhile, war also provides cover for Netanyahu to neuter some of his fiercest critics. This purging of anti-Netanyahu elements in Israel has ramped up in recent months, with Netanyahu and his allies seeking to replace Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and fire Ronen Bar, the head of the powerful security agency Shabak, or Shin Bet, which has been carrying out sensitive investigations into Netanyahu’s closest aides. Under Israeli law, the government must approve its annual budget by the end of March or face being dissolved, something that would trigger fresh elections. But Netanyahu is facing holdouts among ultra-Orthodox parties over the issue of army drafts. Ultra-Orthodox parties, however, are demanding the opposite: to pass legislation that would formally exempt them from military service. To secure the vote for the annual budget and stave off elections, Netanyahu needs support – and if it isn’t going to come from the ultra-Orthodox parties, then he needs to shore up far-right members of the coalition. Recent statements from Trump suggest that he supports putting extra military pressure on Hamas in Gaza. And the anti-government protest movement is gaining steam again as seen in widespread protests in Israeli cities against both the resumption of fighting in Gaza and the attempt to oust security chief Ronen Bar. But Netanyahu has seemingly bet that more war is his best chance of remaining in power and completing his plan to transform the country’s political system. Israel is facing an unprecedented situation in which, I would argue, its own prime minister has became the biggest threat to the country’s stability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One of those learners might stumble upon their own improvement and pass it along in turn. If this loop continues, you get a ratchet effect, in which small changes can accumulate over time to produce increasingly intricate behaviors and technologies. This process produces our uniquely complex cultures: Scientists call it cumulative cultural evolution. But extensive data has emerged suggesting that other animals, including bees, chimpanzees and crows, can also generate cultural complexity through social learning. Consequently, the debate over human uniqueness is shifting in a new direction. Whereas animal cultures affect just a few crucial behaviors, such as courtship and feeding, human cultures cover a massive and constantly expanding set of activities, from clothing to table manners to storytelling. This new view suggests that human culture is not uniquely cumulative. In the early 2000s, a research team led by psychologist Michael Tomasello tested 105 human children, 106 adult chimpanzees and 32 adult orangutans on a battery of cognitive assessments. Surprisingly, the human children performed better in only one capacity: social learning. Tomasello thus concluded that humans are not “generally smarter.” Rather, “we have a special kind of smarts.” Our advanced social abilities allow us to transmit information by accurately teaching and learning from each other. Humans’ apparent social learning abilities suggested a clear explanation for our unique cultural traits. But an inventive chimp – one who discovers a better way to smash nuts, for example – can’t successfully share their innovation. So our inventions persist and build upon each other, while theirs vanish into the jungle floor. Now, though, scientists have hard evidence showing that, just like us, animals can learn from each other and thus maintain their cultures for long periods of time. Groups of swamp sparrows appear to use the same song syllables for centuries. Meerkat troops settle on different wake-up times and maintain them for a decade or more. Of course, long-term social learning is not the same as cumulative culture. Yet scientists also now know that humpback whale songs can oscillate in complexity over many generations of learners, that homing pigeons create efficient flight paths by learning from each other and making small improvements, and that hooved mammals cumulatively alter their migration routes to exploit plant growth. Since cumulative complexity appears not to be the most important difference, several researchers are sketching out a new perspective: Human culture is uniquely open-ended. To get a sense of the first, try counting the number of things you’re engaged with, right now, that came to you through culture. Give me 10 minutes, and I could probably add 100 more items to that list. In fact, other than biological acts such as breathing, it is difficult for me to think of any aspect of what I’m doing right now that is not partially or completely cultural. Why should any organism spend time pursuing such a wide range of goals, particularly if most of them have nothing to do with survival? Humans, on the other hand, lip-synch, build space stations and, less grandiosely, have been known to do things such as spend six years trying to park in all 211 spots of a grocery store lot. Open-endedness, as a unique human quality, is not just about variety; it reflects the quantum leaps by which our cultures can evolve. Let’s say these chimps would benefit from using rocks that they can swing as hard and accurately as possible, but that they don’t immediately know what kind of rocks those would be. By trying different options and observing each other, they might accumulate knowledge of the best qualities in a nut-smashing rock. Crucially, discovering the power of leverage allows for more than just better nut-smashing. Through open-ended cultural evolution, human beings produce open-endedness in culture. But this new framework must shift the tides of a related debate: whether there is something obviously different about the way human minds work, other than social learning capacities. After all, every cultural trait emerges through interactions between minds – so how do our minds interact to produce such a degree of cultural breadth? Interestingly, this shifting debate over how cognition influences culture coincides with a spate of research bridging psychology and anthropology, which explores why certain behaviors – such as singing lullabies, curative bloodletting and storytelling – recur across human cultures. Human minds produce unparalleled diversity in their cultures; yet it is also true that those cultures tend to express variations on a strict set of themes, such as music and marriage and religion. Ironically, the source of our open-endedness may illuminate not only what makes us so diverse, but also what makes us so often the same.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/measles-cases-are-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-make-sure-youre-protected-252277'>Measles cases are on the rise − here’s how to make sure you’re protected</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:53:09 <p>
Meanwhile, a lack of clarity from health authorities is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated. In a Q&A with The Conversation U.S., Daniel Pastula, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action. Should adults get another shot of the measles vaccine? Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know: People born before 1957 are presumed to have lifelong immunity because measles was so contagious that almost everyone contracted it before age 15. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now. Most people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot, though there are exceptions. In 1989, a limited outbreak of measles occurred among vaccinated school children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year do not need any additional doses. There are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold. First, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years get one dose of the live vaccine at some point. Second, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally recommend getting a second dose if you have only had one. For most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts do not routinely recommend a second dose if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. Except in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine. States actually keep vaccine records specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. One example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles and two doses are 97% effective, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles. No, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has limited ability to infect and damage cells. Researchers classify measles virus strains based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes. They identified the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. In extremely rare cases, people can experience more significant reactions to the measles vaccine. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. Being vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also protects vulnerable people in the community, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Two unrelated boys, ages 7 and 9, were found to have IQs in the range of 60-70, which indicates a severe cognitive disability. During my medical review, the mothers revealed that their children were shaken violently as infants and that afterward behaved as if “the wind had been knocked out of them.” Both mothers reported shaking by a boyfriend or a father. No child was seen for medical care at the time. The link between shaking and later cognitive impairment was not lost on me. This scenario of shaken babies having neurological and developmental disabilities has played out over the past 30 years of my career as a child abuse pediatrician. A 2024 study on babies with shaken baby syndrome found that 20% to 25% of infants die, another 20% to 25% look normal on discharge from the hospital, and fully half are left with long-term disabilities. These include learning and behavioral problems that appear later in life. The dangers of shaking babies have been recognized for over 50 years. As primary caregivers, mothers are often most easily reached by the message, but the message of prevention can involve fathers, babysitters and any other caregivers. Since Caffey’s original description, there have been tremendous advancements in the research behind shaking babies and infant head trauma. What happens to the brain of an infant when they are shaken? Infants – the most common population to be shaken – are small and have undeveloped neck muscles. Sometimes children have other injuries after being thrown down or impacted against something. An infant or child must be diagnosed as having abusive head trauma by a team of pediatric specialists. Usually, a concerned parent or caregiver who may or may not know an infant has been injured becomes concerned that the child is not behaving normally. The child may have symptoms ranging from persistent vomiting to seizures or even seem unconscious. There are other medical conditions and even accidental injuries to a child that may resemble abusive head trauma. Experienced clinicians will evaluate a child carefully for these well-described conditions. Controversy about many of these conditions may exist in the courtroom, but in the medical setting it is often clear which conditions are present and when injuries are caused by trauma versus other medical conditions. All 50 states and territories of the U.S. require that a report is made to child protective services agencies, with law enforcement often being involved when someone suspects or knows that a baby has been shaken. Bruising, fractures and retinal hemorrhages may support a diagnosis of child abuse, specifically shaken baby syndrome. During an investigation, a rare accidental cause may be determined. The purpose is to make sure infants and children are not being harmed or that a medical condition is uncovered that can be treated. Other risk factors include isolation, poverty, domestic violence and substance use. During severe economic downturns, the rate of shaken baby incidents rises, since research shows that social stressors often contribute. Although anyone can injure a baby in a moment of frustration, most prevention research has focused specifically on helping parents understand why infants cry or become fussy. Studies have shown that focused education for new parents in maternity wards by nurses is effective. If you or someone you know is concerned that a child or infant is being harmed in any way, each state has a process for reporting these concerns to appropriate authorities.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Beyond these high-profile items, it also preserves lesser-known but no less vital records, such as national park master plans, polar exploration documents and the records of all U.S. veterans. While these crucial documents in U.S. history now have a home in the National Archives, the road to establishing this institution was paved with catastrophic losses and bureaucratic inertia. Creating the National Archives required decades of advocacy by historians, politicians and government officials. The National Archives was not simply an administrative convenience – it was a necessity born from repeated disasters that underscored the fragility of government records. And with President Donald Trump’s firing of the head archivist in February 2025, as well as the loss of several high-level archives staff members, the organization faces a new era of uncertainty. Documentary heritage – the recorded memory of a nation that preserves its cultural, historical and legal legacy – is essential for a country as it safeguards its identity, informs its governance and ensures that future generations can understand and learn from the past. I am a university archivist with two decades of experience in the library and archives field. I oversee the preservation and accessibility of historical records at Rochester Institute of Technology, advocate for inclusivity, and engage in national conversations on the evolving role of archives in the digital age. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, fires repeatedly ravaged federal records. Fires were very common in the 19th century due to a combination of highly flammable building materials, open frames used for lighting and heating, and the lack of modern fire safety measures such as sprinklers and fire-resistant construction. In 1810, Congress authorized better housing for government records, but the law was never fully executed. The Patent Office, home to invaluable documentation of American innovation, burned in 1877, having already been damaged by an 1836 fire. This loss had far-reaching consequences, particularly for genealogical and demographic research. “It is a matter of common report that during the civil war, great quantities of documents stored in the Capitol were thrown away to make quarters for soldiers,” Historian and founding member of the American Historical Association J. Franklin Jameson noted in a 1911 Washington Post article. Jameson spent decades lobbying Congress for a centralized repository. Momentum for a dedicated archives building gained traction in the late 19th century. In 1903, a bipartisan bill passed Congress giving the OK to purchase land in Washington, D.C., for a Hall of Records. But the legislation didn’t lead to any action. That same year, Congress authorized that any records not needed for daily business be transferred to the Library of Congress. This established a formal review process for government document disposal, but agencies still discarded records, often haphazardly, until stricter records management laws were enacted. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office two weeks later, was himself a meticulous record-keeper. Roosevelt kept all of his personal and presidential records and books in a fire-safe space he built on his Hyde Park, New York, property, which he donated to the government after he died. The first archivist, Robert D.W. Connor, took office that year with a mandate to organize, preserve and make accessible the nation’s records. Initially, the Archives lacked a formalized records management program. There were no clear guidelines on what to keep and what to discard, so agencies made their own decisions. These policies granted the National Archives authority to establish a structured approach to determining which records held historical value and should be preserved, while allowing for the responsible disposal of other documents. A 1950 law gave the National Archives more power to decide what should be kept and what could be discarded, creating a more organized and accountable system for preserving the nation’s history. Beyond mere storage, the National Archives plays a vital role in upholding democracy. It ensures transparency by preserving government accountability, preventing manipulation or loss of records that could distort historical truth. The National Archives also provides public access to documents that shape civic awareness and historical knowledge, from the Declaration of Independence to declassified government files. Its existence reminds the nation that history is not a matter of convenience, but a cornerstone of informed governance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This story is featured in my book, “Freedom Enterprise: Black Entrepreneurship and Racial Capitalism in Detroit,” which will be published April 8, 2025. Migrants were seeking true freedom, including full political and economic citizenship – things they had not been able to achieve in the Jim Crow South. As a historian of Black business, I wanted to know more about those who migrated to Detroit with the aim of working for themselves – as opposed to getting a job in Henry Ford’s auto factories. “In most parts of the South the Negroes are still unable to become landowners or successful business men,” Woodson wrote in 1918. “Conditions and customs have reserved these spheres for the whites.” Of course, African Americans did establish businesses in the South, sometimes becoming quite wealthy. The destruction of “Black Wall Street” in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a well-known story. But there were many other incidents of white supremacist terrorism targeting Black businesses owners. In fact, many Black entrepreneurs pointed out that the danger of racial violence was a deciding factor in their moving to Detroit. This included people such as Willis Eugene Smith, who established a funeral home, and Berry Gordy Sr., who operated a grocery store and contracting business in the city. In his 1979 memoir, “Movin’ Up: Pop Gordy Tells His Story,” Gordy told how he decided to leave Georgia for Detroit after local whites began pestering him about a large check he received as payment for goods he had sold. Gordy’s sister warned him: “You fool ’round here, they’re liable to beat us out of it, take all our money.” Many African American entrepreneurs who participated in the Great Migration questioned whether they could experience enduring upward mobility through business if they stayed in the South. Many of those Southern entrepreneurs decided to move north. Detroit’s African American population increased 611% between 1910 and 1920 to 40,838, making it home to one of the largest populations of African Americans in the country. While Southern migrants saw Detroit as a promised land, segregation in the North was alive and well. There were many negative aspects to racial segregation, but it also created entrepreneurial opportunities, as Black newcomers needed the services of Black-owned businesses such as barbershops and hair salons, hotels and restaurants. These businesses sustained the growing African American community and made it feasible for Southern migrants to settle permanently in the city. A 1933 advertisement for the Creole Hand Laundry, located at 542 Watson St., stated: “From New Orleans, La.” Migrant entrepreneurs tapped into newly created niche markets, catering to the tastes of Southern transplants. Home Milling’s managers had plans to expand the business in order to supply Black-owned bakeries in Detroit and satiate the tastes of newcomers. “Their cornmeal is made from specially selected white corn out of deference to the palate of Southern Negroes who do not relish meal made from yellow corn.” As a result, the success of this business community was cut short. This destruction was a harsh blow to Southern migrant entrepreneurs who had relocated to Detroit seeking economic independence, upward mobility and other markers of freedom.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Like many other news organizations, The Associated Press maintains a “live updates” page, which posts the latest from the Trump administration in a ticker tape-like live scroll, with multiple updates per hour, 12 hours a day. “How do you push back against a tidal wave?” political communication expert Dannagal Young wrote of this media phenomenon on Feb. 21. Deliberately overwhelming people with a flood of news content is a propaganda strategy used by authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin to distort reality and prevent people from clearly evaluating their government’s actions. It’s hard to believe that Reagan’s presidential communication only attracted one major news story per week, especially since he is often called “the Great Communicator.” But Trump is also simply generating a lot more news content than Reagan did. Trump averaged 22 per year in his first term, according to data collected by a nonpartisan group at the University of California Santa Barbara called the American Presidency Project. A news analysis conducted by National Journal White House reporter George Condon showed that Trump has already answered more than 1,000 questions from reporters since he returned to office, which is nearly five times more questions than he answered at this point in his first presidency. Trump has also made a lot of news by issuing almost 90 executive orders, which he has used both as a strategy for exercising executive power over issues like foreign aid and as a strategy for attracting media coverage. Trump issued 72 executive orders within his first 30 days in 2025. That’s more executive orders than any previous president has issued in their first month over the last 40 years, including himself. During Trump’s first term, according to The New York Times, “Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.” This strategy is evident in the Oval Office executive order signing events. These events are carefully staged political theater for media consumption in which Trump casts himself as the nation’s hero protecting it from foreign invasions, diversity programs or paper straws. Many of Trump’s executive orders are facing legal challenges, and some have been shot down by federal judges. Nonetheless, it is the spectacle of signing the orders that I, as a communications scholar, believe is designed to win the day – they are effective at generating news coverage and making Trump look powerful. “Trump, as we know from this first month, is the most news-making person to occupy the Oval Office I’ve ever seen,” said New York Times Executive Editor Joe Kahn on Feb. 27. Any politician’s communication strategy reveals, at least in part, how they think about governing, power and democracy. Some political leaders communicate in ways that encourage people to ask questions and use their reason and critical thinking skills to evaluate public policies. Other political leaders use communication in undemocratic ways to manipulate and coerce, preventing citizens from using their reason and critical thinking skills to evaluate policies. As a media and governing strategy, I think that creating an unrelenting tidal wave of content is designed to enable Trump to attract and keep the nation’s attention on himself and – in the process, drown out other voices. This method overwhelms the media and exhausts many Americans who cannot easily absorb so much information at once.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This complexity underscores the challenge to regulating teen social media use, but it also points to another avenue for protecting young people online: how social media platforms are designed. My recent work with colleagues in computer scientist Pamela Wisniewski’s Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab underscores a critical point: social media is neither inherently harmful nor entirely beneficial. In other words, social media’s impact is shaped by its affordances – how platforms are designed and what they enable users to do or constrain them from doing. As society moves toward practical solutions for online safety, it is important to use evidence-based research on how these features shape teens’ social media experiences and how they could be redesigned to be age appropriate for young people. My colleagues and I analyzed over 2,000 posts from teens ages 15-17 on an online peer-support platform. Teens openly discussed their experiences with popular social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok. Their voices highlight a potential path forward: focusing on safety by design – an approach that improves platform features to amplify benefits and mitigate harms. This approach respects young people’s agency while prioritizing their digital well-being. While social media’s worst outcomes such as cyberbullying or mental health crises are often in the spotlight, our research shows that teens’ experiences are far more nuanced. Teens commonly described negative experiences involving social drama, cyberbullying and privacy violations. Facebook triggered complaints about privacy violations, such as parents sharing private information without teens’ consent. At the same time, teens expressed that social media provides a space for support, inspiration and self-expression, particularly when offline spaces feel isolating. Teens used social media to cope with stress or seek out uplifting content. Snapchat, in particular, was the go-to platform for fostering close personal connections, while YouTube empowered teens to promote their creativity and identity by sharing videos. Many praised Instagram and Snapchat for providing inspiration, distraction or emotional relief during stressful times. Features such as algorithms, privacy controls and content-sharing mechanisms directly shape how teens experience social media. These findings further question the perception of social media as a purely negative force. Instead, teens’ experiences highlight its dual nature: a space for both risk and opportunity. Snapchat’s affordances, such as ephemeral messaging and visibility of “best friends,” encourage personal connections but can foster risky interactions. By understanding these platform-specific designs and features, it is possible to mitigate risks without losing the benefits. This safety by design approach moves beyond restricting access to focus on improving the platforms themselves. By thoughtfully redesigning social media features, tech companies can empower teens to use these tools safely and meaningfully. Policymakers can focus on holding social media companies responsible for their platforms’ impact, while simultaneously promoting the digital rights of teens to benefit from social media use. For example, they could require platform companies to conduct safety audits or disclose algorithmic risks. By addressing platform affordances and adopting safety by design, it is possible to create digital spaces that protect teens from harm while preserving the connection, creativity and support that social media enables.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In mountain ranges around the world, glaciers are melting as global temperatures rise. Europe’s Alps and Pyrenees lost 40% of their glacier volume from 2000 to 2023. These and other icy regions have provided freshwater for people living downstream for centuries – almost 2 billion people rely on glaciers today. But as glaciers melt faster, they also pose potentially lethal risks. Many of these expanding lakes are held in place by precarious ice dams or rock moraines deposited by the glacier over centuries. Most glacial lakes began forming over a century ago as a result of warming trends since the 1860s, but their abundance and rates of growth have risen rapidly since the 1960s. Many people living in the Himalayas, Andes, Alps, Rocky Mountains, Iceland and Alaska have experienced glacial lake outburst floods of one type or another. Juneau, Alaska, has been hit by several flash floods in recent years from a glacial lake dammed by ice on an arm of Mendenhall Glacier. Those floods, including in 2024, were driven by a melting glacier that slowly filled a basin below it until the basin’s ice dam broke. Avalanches, rockfalls and slope failures can also trigger glacial lake outburst floods. These are growing more common as frozen ground known as permafrost thaws, robbing mountain landscapes of the cryospheric glue that formerly held them together. These slides can create massive waves when they plummet into a lake. That dangerous mix can rush downstream at speeds of 20-60 mph (30-100 kph), destroying homes and anything else in its path. The casualties of such an event can be staggering. In 1941, a huge wave caused by a snow and ice avalanche that fell into Laguna Palcacocha, a glacial lake in the Peruvian Andes, overtopped the moraine dam that had contained the lake for decades. Laguna Palcacocha has grown to more than 14 times its size in 1941. Governments have responded to this widespread and growing threat by developing early warning systems and programs to identify potentially dangerous glacial lakes. Some governments have taken steps to lower water levels in the lakes or built flood diversion structures, such as walls of rock-filled wire cages, known as gabions, that divert floodwaters from villages, infrastructure or agricultural fields. Where the risks can’t be managed, communities have been encouraged to use zoning that prohibits building in flood-prone areas. As scientists expand their understanding of how the world’s icy regions interact with global warming, they are identifying a number of other phenomena that can lead to similarly disastrous events. Englacial conduit floods, for instance, originate inside of glaciers, commonly those on steep slopes. Meltwater can collect inside massive systems of ice caves, or conduits. This permanently frozen mass of rock, ice and soil has been a fixture at altitudes above 19,685 feet (6,000 meters) for millennia. In 2017, nearly a third of the solid rock face of Nepal’s 29,935-foot (6,374-meter) Saldim Peak collapsed and fell onto the Langmale glacier below. Heat generated by the friction of rock falling through air melted ice, creating a slurry of rock, debris and sediment that plummeted into Langmale glacial lake below, resulting in a massive flood. Flows of ice and debris from high altitudes and the sudden appearance of meltwater ponds on a glacier’s surface are two more examples. Not only have thousands of lives been lost, but billions of dollars in hydropower facilities and other structures have also been destroyed. A study published in 2024 counted more than 110,000 glacial lakes around the world and determined 10 million people’s lives and homes are at risk from glacial lake outburst floods.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/why-history-instruction-is-critical-for-combating-online-misinformation-248528'>Why history instruction is critical for combating online misinformation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:49:51 <p>
For years, some commentators have called for K-12 teachers to take on fake news, media literacy, or online misinformation by doubling down on critical thinking. This push for schools to do a better job preparing young people to differentiate between low- and high-quality information often focuses on social studies classes. As an education researcher and former high school history teacher, I know that there’s both good and bad news about combating misinformation in the classroom. When people demand that schools teach critical thinking, it’s not always clear what they mean. Cognitive scientists see critical thinking as a specific kind of reasoning that involves problem-solving and making sound judgments. Chess masters, for instance, do not start out with innate talent. In most cases, they gain expertise by hours of thoughtfully playing the game. This deliberate practice helps them recognize patterns and think in novel ways about chess. Because critical thinking develops in specific contexts, it does not necessarily transfer to other types of problem-solving. For example, chess advocates might hope the game improves players’ intelligence, and studies do suggest learning chess may help elementary students with the kind of pattern recognition they need for early math lessons. However, research has found that being a great chess player does not make people better at other kinds of complex critical thinking. Since context is key to critical thinking, learning to analyze information about current events likely requires knowledge about politics and history, as well as practice at scrutinizing sources. Social studies researchers often describe this kind of critical thinking as “historical thinking”: a way to evaluate evidence about the past and assess its reliability. My own research has shown that high school students can make relatively quick progress on some of the surface features of historical thinking, such as learning to check a text’s date and author. But the deep questioning involved in true historical thinking is much harder to learn. Social studies classrooms can also build what researchers call “civic online reasoning.” Fact-checking is complex work. It is not enough to tell young people that they should be wary online, or to trust sites that end in “.org” instead of “.com.” Rather than learning general principles about online media, civic online reasoning teaches students specific skills for evaluating information about politics and social issues. For people wading through political information and news, knowledge about history and civics is like a key in the ignition for their analytical skills. Political misinformation often weaponizes historical falsehoods, such as the debunked and recalled Christian nationalist book claiming that Thomas Jefferson did not believe in a separation of church and state, or claims that the nadir of African American life came during Reconstruction, not slavery. Those claims are extreme, but politicians and policymakers repeat them. For someone who knows basic facts about American history, those claims won’t sit right. Background knowledge will trigger their skepticism and kick critical thinking into gear. For this reason, the best approach to media literacy will come through teaching that fosters concrete skills alongside historical knowledge. Two-thirds of instructors say that they’ve limited classroom discussions about social and political topics.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Today, kids interested in pretty much any sport often have multiple clubs and leagues to choose from instead of playing on their high school’s varsity squads. Clubs have been especially good at attracting the most talented student-athletes due to their intense and competitive nature. While clubs may be best for the most talented athletes, I believe schools can’t be beat for the broader focus they can put on character development. My own unpublished research shows it’s also a way – along with emphasizing the fun and social aspects of athletics – to get more students who played sports as young kids to continue in high school. Before high school, kids played on teams organized by their schools, local parks and recreation programs or nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA. After that, the only option for most was high school sports. The first big step toward highly organized, privatized youth sports programs occurred during what has been referred to as “the Reagan revolution,” according to research I did for my dissertation. President Ronald Reagan’s funding cuts across the government pushed more expenses onto states and cities, which limited the ability of local parks and recreation departments to fully staff youth programs. This left many of them with only enough funds to maintain their facilities. At the same time, school districts began systematically reducing the number of physical education classes offered in lieu of an increased focus on subjects such as math and science. With the reduction of public offerings, the youth sports programming gap was filled by private clubs and leagues, which placed more emphasis on athleticism, competition and sometimes elite-style training. And it’s become big business for the adults who run these programs. While good numbers on these leagues are hard to come by, multiple data sources show the privatized youth sports market has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. A recent estimate put total spending on youth sports at over US$40 billion as of 2024, compared with the $10 billion estimate of the youth sports economy in 2010. But despite their growth, one sobering statistic for aspiring elite athletes remains true: Only about 7% of teenagers who play organized sports will advance to the collegiate level or beyond. You’ll notice winning games or for competition were not among them. To me, this was evidence that what student-athletes most wanted from their high school programs wasn’t so much sport skills development as personal development and growth. Overtraining and a lack of fun are cited as the main reasons why 70% of young athletes who compete on a team stop playing before they even reach high school. Here are five things school administrators can do to help turn things around and make their sports programs more attractive to students considering clubs, as well as those who are pondering giving up on sports altogether. Make sure programs emphasize fun, social growth and physical fitness, rather than just the competition. High school sports may not be for everybody, but I believe many more students would choose to participate if the focus were on building character and having fun with friends, not winning trophies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In tests, researchers successfully transmitted data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) over 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) outdoors using two Taara chips. "We believe this is the first time silicon photonics chips have transmitted such high-capacity data outdoors at this distance," Mahesh Krishnaswamy, the general manager of Taara, said in a statement . These traditional cables are typically buried deep underground, making them impractical for remote areas or challenging terrains, such as mountains and forests. Related: Scientists achieve record-breaking 402 Tbps data transmission speeds — 1.6 million times faster than home broadband These devices could then exchange data directly, providing high-speed, easily-scalable coverage wherever Taara nodes exist. "Using chips deployed in a global mesh network, we see opportunities to bring high-speed internet to underserved regions, rethink the way data centers are built and operated, enable faster, create safer communication for autonomous vehicles, and so much more." Fiber-optic cables contain tiny plastic or glass strands that transmit data as pulses of light. These are extremely effective at carrying high-speed data over long distances — far more so than older, copper-based cables, which carry data as slower electrical signals that are more prone to interference. Taara also sends data as optical signals; however, it avoids the need for underground cables and networks that require physical maintenance. The Taara chip is actually a newer, smaller version of an existing Google X invention called Taara Lightbridge, which is about the size of a traffic light.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When it comes to speech, parrots have the gift of gab. And the way the brains of small parrots known as budgerigars bestow this gift is remarkably similar to human speech, researchers report March 19 in Nature. So far, budgerigars are the only animals known to have language-producing centers akin to those in humans, says Michael Long, a neuroscientist at New York University Langone Health. Beyond their looks, these parrots are particularly social and chatty, making them interesting research subjects for language studies. Long and his Langone Health colleague Zetian Yang tracked the behavior of individual nerve cells in four of these birds’ brains as they produced their chirrups. The organization of these neurons’ activity, it turns out, is pretty simple, Long says. He compares this neural organization to a keyboard that can produce a range of sounds — consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A budgie “is able to generate arbitrary sounds in its universe by just playing this vocal keyboard,” Long says. These parallels could be “a very tidy example of convergent evolution, where you have humans that have developed this kind of neural mechanism for speech, and these parrots have developed a kind of similar mechanism,” Long says. Now that scientists know more about how budgie brains help the birds talk, another question dogs Long: What are these parrots talking about?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

ANAHEIM, Calif. — The wreckage of some of the universe's most violent explosions has crept closer than you might think; in fact, you may have taken a swim in it during your last dip in the ocean. By analyzing samples from the deep sea, researchers have found a unique variety of radioactive plutonium that appears to be debris from a rare breed of cosmic explosion called a kilonova, which likely detonated near Earth some 10 million years ago. "We live in a supernova graveyard," Brian Fields , an astronomer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a March 17 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society Global Physics Summit. "[Supernovas make] tiny specks of rocks that can literally rain upon the Earth. Fields has theorized about this cosmic rubble since the 1990s. But it wasn't until 2004 that researchers started sifting out supernova remnants from ocean samples. They found traces of a radioactive version of iron that doesn't occur naturally on Earth and can only be explained by a nearby supernova sometime in Earth's recent history. "This is direct observational evidence that supernovas are radioactivity factories," Fields said. The plot thickened in 2021, when researchers discovered an even rarer substance sprinkled in with those same samples: a radioactive isotope of plutonium. This finding required an origin story even more unusual than the violent star deaths that birth supernovas. The plutonium variant the researchers found is thought to come from kilonovas — eruptions that occur as two binary neutron stars spiral toward each other in a cataclysmic collision.

"Right now, our lunar soil is so precious because it's all we've got," Fields told Live Science. "The hope is, eventually, we'll be taking routine trips to the moon, so it's no big deal — sampling a kilogram won't sound like a lot to people." With more soil, Fields and his colleagues hope to verify that this kilonova indeed happened, as well as pinpoint when and where it occurred. With the next phase of the Artemis mission not set to launch until at least next year, Fields and his team are still a ways away from formally requesting access to this hot commodity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Researchers have unveiled the most detailed map of Antarctica's bedrock yet. The high-resolution map reveals what the frozen continent looks like beneath its miles-thick blanket of ice and snow, and will help researchers predict how Antarctica might evolve in a fast-warming climate. The same process will occur in Antarctica if a significant amount of the ice sheet melts, Pritchard said. "Some ridges will hold up the flowing ice; the hollows and smooth bits are where that ice could accelerate," he said. Bedmap3 builds on two previous studies that digitally stripped Antarctica of its ice. The new map incorporates all of the data used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2 — including measurements gathered by planes, satellites, ships and even dog-drawn sleds. In total, more than six decades' worth of data was compiled to construct Bedmap3, the researchers said in the statement.

"In general, it's become clear the Antarctic Ice Sheet is thicker than we originally realized and has a larger volume of ice that is grounded on a rock bed sitting below sea level," study co-author Peter Fretwell , a mapping specialist and geographic information officer at the BAS, said in the statement. Although thickness in itself is not a problem, the fact that much of the ice sits below sea level is concerning, because relatively warm seawater can flood into the ice sheet, Fretwell said. "This puts the ice at greater risk of melting," he added. "What Bedmap3 is showing us is that we have got a slightly more vulnerable Antarctica than we previously thought," Fretwell added.

A teen woke up from surgery and could speak only English, his second language. Prior to this incident, he spoke the language only during English class in school. According to a report doctors wrote about his case , the patient had no history of psychiatric symptoms and no relevant medical family history, apart from some instances of depression on his mother's side of the family. What happened next: The nurse who initially noticed the patient speaking English was not immediately worried by it, thinking the teen was experiencing emergence delirium — a state of confusion that can occur during recovery from anesthesia. He was able to answer questions, albeit in English spoken with a Dutch accent.

Some of the teen's friends came to visit him the day after his surgery, and suddenly, he was able to understand and speak Dutch again. Because the teen spontaneously started speaking in his native language again, doctors saw no need to run any neuropsychological tests, electroencephalograms (EEG) or other types of brain scans on him. What makes the case unique: FLS is rare, with only about nine cases described in medical literature. In most of these cases, the patient was a white male who switched from their native language to another one they had learned later in life; the patients weren't typically bilingual growing up. In total, they found eight reported cases of FLS that were similar to that of their patient, in which the person affected switched to a completely different language rather than speaking in a way that could be perceived as a foreign accent. This is what happens in a related condition — called foreign accent syndrome — in which people adopt a speech pattern that makes it sound like they're speaking with an accent. Exactly why FLS happens is unknown, although there have been other cases in which the syndrome emerges after anesthesia .</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But because he was still calibrating the instrument, “we ignored it for that time.” Then last October, a team using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a telescope in Chile reported evidence of one planet orbiting Barnard’s star, dubbed simply b, and hints of three others — designated c, d and e. With these hints in mind, Basant and colleagues reexamined their data, confirming three of the planets. “I am very happy to see that new MAROON-X data provide an independent confirmation of the planet b and candidates c and d,” says astrophysicist Jonay González Hernández of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain, who led the ESPRESSO team. All four planets are so close to Barnard’s star, which has about one-seventh the mass of the sun, that they orbit it in less than a week. That means they’re too hot to be habitable, Basant says. This technique was responsible for finding the first known exoplanet in 1995 and has since identified hundreds of planets. But all those planets were more massive than Earth. “Previous instruments were not that great at finding sub-Earth mass planets,” Basant says. And a glimpse of what these next generation instruments can do.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://undark.org/2025/03/19/global-satellite-infrastructure-norway/'>A Powerhouse of Global Satellite Infrastructure: Norway?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> undark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 00:00:00 <p>
SvalSat, for instance, boasts more antennas than any other commercial station on Earth. Stryker likens SvalSat to a giant’s putting green; the satellites appear like colossal golf balls resting atop a rocky, and often snowy, surface. “There’s really no substitute for regular in-person interactions,” said Stryker. U.S. science, weather forecasting, and defense sectors rely on the satellite infrastructure located in Norway. Polar ground stations like this one are the only spots where satellites in certain orbits can downlink their data and receive commands on every trip around Earth. SvalSat, because of a treaty governing relations on Svalbard, doesn’t work directly with military satellites. But other places in northern Norway do — and there, similar but smaller stations exist, chattering with spacecraft that do military communications or missile warning. But there’s just one problem: Norway is in the middle of some hot geopolitical dynamics. For one, it shares a small land border with Russia, and tensions between the two countries have markedly increased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, melting Arctic ice makes the polar region more accessible for resource extraction, in turn making it vulnerable to territorial disputes. Without ground stations like Svalbard’s, satellites are just “space junk,” said Rolf Skatteboe, CEO and president of Kongsberg Satellite Services, or KSAT, the company that runs SvalSat and is one of the world’s largest purveyors of satellite ground stations. And the relatively mild weather — by Arctic standards — made upkeep simpler than it would have been in other polar locations, like Greenland or Alaska, or even the Antarctic. (Ground stations now also exist in those locations, but Norway’s infrastructure remains significant.) As part of that, NASA was planning to launch Landsat 7, the seventh in a series of imaging satellites to help scientists track how land and sea look over time. Since its inception in 1972, the Landsat program has produced a rich archive of the planet’s aging surface, showing, for instance, how fisheries are faring, where wildfires chew a mountain, and when glaciers shrink. But to get any of that archive down from space and into computers, where scientists could make sense of it, NASA — which runs Landsat with USGS — needed ground stations. So, the Norwegian Space Agency suggested they invest in Svalbard. In 1999, Landsat 7 made it to space and flew over the Svalbard antenna. “They serviced our first pass,” said Brown, who is today’s Landsat ground network manager. With this initial collaboration, Svalbard was on its way to becoming “the world’s greatest, largest, biggest, nicest, coolest ground station,” as Skatteboe described it. Norway soon built its own antennas and sold ground capabilities as a service, allowing NASA to focus on exploring space. Without ground stations like Svalbard’s, satellites are just “space junk.” In 2002, the Norwegian Space Agency split KSAT off as a separate entity — a commercial company half-owned by the state corporation Space Norway and half-owned by the commercial Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace, completely dedicated to satellite ground stations. “There’s a tremendous amount of science data that we pull down through there, and that informs us of what’s going on in the Earth,” said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program. Norway’s sustained interest in ground stations wasn’t just about helping NASA: The country had its own desires. Those areas of interest include the waters around Norway, which the country wants to watch for pollution, oil spills, foreign ships, ice movement, and suspicious activity. For instance, officials track Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, which ships sanctioned goods internationally using ownership records that obscure its origins. For instance, a new NASA mission, to launch this March, will use radar to monitor dynamic, and often catastrophic, processes like earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, landslides, and ice-sheet collapse. NOAA, meanwhile, uses SvalSat to talk to three satellites that form the backbone of American weather forecasting — spacecraft that Tim Walsh, director of the Office of Low Earth Orbit Observations at NOAA, are among the agency’s “workhorses.” The satellites’ observations of atmospheric temperature, moisture, energy transfer, ozone, and more help predict fair and foul weather. The agency’s planned Near Earth Orbit Network, a set of next-generation weather satellites set to start launching in the next decade, will work similarly. NOAA employees in front of a SvalSat antenna that collects the direct readout data from NASA EOS satellites to produce NOAA’s Polar Wind products in the Arctic. But SvalSat can’t do the legwork for all satellites — specifically, ones operated by militaries. Working with defense organizations goes against the spirit of the Svalbard Treaty, an agreement signed in 1920 that gives Norway sovereignty over the archipelago but allows people from other national signatories to live and work as full residents without visas. The treaty also imposed environmental conservation guidelines and restrictions on warlike activity. Norway, he continued, interprets the treaty strictly, meaning that Svalbard stations don’t communicate with satellites directly engaged in military activity. But today, satellite imagery and data are so ubiquitous in defense operations that almost any Earth-observation data can be useful militarily — even if it’s not explicitly collected for that purpose. Norwegian journalist Bård Wormdal points out, for instance, that during the Iraq War, the U.S. military used satellite-borne information about sandstorm forecasts, downlinked on Svalbard, to inform their operations. The details about those blowing particles weren’t inherently military-oriented — it was simply public data about sand — but Wormdal, who worked for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation for more than three decades and wrote about satellite data’s role in international conflict in the book “The Satellite War,” sees it as a treaty violation for Norway nonetheless. Skatteboe doesn’t dispute the facts — yes, scientific and commercial data collected on Svalbard may play a role in military planning. “All the satellite-based information that comes to us is dual-use,” he said, meaning it could help someone in the civilian sector, and someone in a situation room. (Norway’s current regulation, as written, allows some room for interpretation: It prohibits using a ground station to send or download data from a satellite that is used “specifically for military purposes.” It also prohibits any downloaded data either solely or primarily be used for military purposes.) But Skatteboe does dispute the idea behind Wormdal’s legal interpretation. But they get it like anyone else would — through a free and open platform, or for cash. Still, Wormdal argues that military utility can make Svalbard a target for attack. Led by a black Toyota Land Cruiser, followed by trucks, tractors, and snowmobiles conducted by men in Army green, the parade also featured an Mi-8 helicopter — and this after a “navy parade” in the waters the previous year. Today, satellite imagery and data are so ubiquitous in defense operations that almost any Earth-observation data can be useful militarily — even if it’s not explicitly collected for that purpose. Russian officials have also questioned Norway’s sovereignty over the island. Restrictions on Svalbard haven’t stopped the U.S. Department of Defense from using Norway’s cosmic putting greens for explicitly military purposes: They’ve just chosen different spots. For instance, the U.S. Space Force’s Space Development Agency is building a satellite ground station on the island of Andøya, on an existing Norwegian military installation, to support a constellation of satellites that does missile tracking, weapons targeting, and navigation, among other things. Keeping tabs on activity in the Arctic — from any country — requires a strong space presence, according to senior national representative of Royal Norwegian Air Force Kjetil Bjørkum, who spoke to Undark in a personal capacity. That’s where satellites, and their ground stations, come in. According to Bjørkum, Norway should increase its already robust collaboration with the U.S. in that realm. Norway has invested heavily in its space assets, from satellites to the ground stations that make those satellites useful — a capacity, said Troy Bouffard, an assistant professor of Arctic security at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the U.S. is lucky to capitalize on: “All of that we benefit from.” “This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue for strategic competition.” “It took a while for it to become something of a national-security-level priority,” said Bouffard, who helped lobby for the inclusion of the Arctic for the first time in country’s official national security strategy document. But it is such a priority now: Some political analysts see Trump’s desire to buy (or invade) Greenland as a sign of a general interest in Arctic affairs — one that has rattled Norway and other NATO allies. There are signs that Svalbard is not immune to these geopolitical shifts. Cable breaks can be accidental — from, say, an anchor mistakenly dragging the seabed — or intentional, but they can affect the transfer of satellite data either way. The cable-cut resulted in delays of several hours for NOAA’s datasets, which can affect weather prediction. When there’s a problem at Svalbard, the USGS has high-latitude stations in South Dakota, Alaska, and Germany it can turn to for support; NASA uses antennas in Alaska and Sweden. But none of them can catch the satellite on every single one of its orbits, as the ones on Svalbard can, which can lead to data backups and possible weather-forecast issues like those NOAA experienced after the 2022 cable break. NOAA, meanwhile, can switch over to a station in Fairbanks. “We are trying to make sure that those backup stations are available whenever, and we have backups for the southern hemisphere too,” said Walsh, adding: “The geopolitical concerns there are always in the back of my mind.” Still, he noted that Norway has supported NOAA’s missions without interference, referring to its meteorological monitoring and prediction satellites. “But we, the U.S., will always look out for our back at Fairbanks.” In addition to cable breaks, power outages may also be of concern. And while U.S. science officials didn’t mention the possibility, defense analysts have suggested Russia might try to seize Svalbard, or imagined how such a military action might play out. “But really not that much, because access to data has always been important.” That’s true of the Landsat data, which remains as dependent on KSAT as it was when that first antenna arrived on the island. For that to work, they need frequent contact with satellite stations. In Fairbanks, which the agency currently uses as one of its ground stations, antennas can only communicate with satellites for 11 or 12 of their daily 14 orbits every day. And the world would be more of a mystery if satellites like Landsat couldn’t send their bounty back to Earth — something Brown got the chance to evangelize about when he was in Svalbard last year with Stryker. After all, Arctic regions experience shifts more dramatically and quickly than lower latitudes. The guide explained his own experience of this change and then turned a query toward Brown. Brown explained Landsat’s value: It provides a long-term record of Earth as it is and as it’s changing, allowing scientists, policymakers, and businesspeople to understand and respond to the very climate change the guide could see with his own eyes, as well as understand how phenomena like drought and wildfire affect the environment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
