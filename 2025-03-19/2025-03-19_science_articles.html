                <p>An illustration of the Flagstones enclosure shortly after its construction in the middle Neolithic period.

A Stone Age circular monument in England is even older than Stonehenge , raising the possibility that Stonehenge's creators used it as inspiration, a new study finds.

When researchers radiocarbon-dated artifacts from the large monument, known as Flagstones, they found that it dates to about 3200 B.C. — meaning it's about 200 years older than Stonehenge. Previously, archaeologists thought Flagstones was the same age as the earliest stages of Stonehenge, which was built and reconfigured over the centuries. The researchers published their findings March 6 in the journal Antiquity .

The discovery "makes Flagstones the earliest large circular enclosure known in Britain," said study first author Susan Greaney , a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Exeter in the U.K. "It might be that Flagstones was copied at Stonehenge, or it might be that we need to go back to our dates of Stonehenge and think again," she told Live Science in an email.

Flagstones, an ancient monument and burial site, was found in the 1980s during construction of the Dorchester bypass in Dorset, a county in southwest England. Excavations unearthed a 330-foot-wide (100 meters) circular ditch that was made with intersecting pits. The pits have at least four sets of human remains: a cremated adult and three children whose bodies were buried there. The partially cremated remains of three other adults are located elsewhere at the site, according to a statement from the University of Exeter.

Now, half of the monument is under the bypass, while the other half is under a historical home managed by the National Trust, a conservation organization. The site's artifacts are housed at the Dorset Museum.

Flagstones is about 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of Stonehenge. Its similarity to the early stages of Stonehenge, which also includes cremated burials and a similarly sized enclosure made of intersecting pits, led archaeologists to think the two were built at the same time, around 2900 B.C. But as part of her doctoral research, Greaney put together a more detailed timeline of a cluster of Neolithic monuments in the Dorchester area whose artifacts are kept at the Dorset Museum.

"With new techniques for obtaining precise radiocarbon dates, and advanced statistical methods, we can now obtain really precise estimates for when events like monument construction took place," Greaney said.

To more accurately date Flagstones, Greaney and her colleagues radiocarbon-dated human remains, red deer antlers and charcoal found at the site. By combining these dates with those of archaeological finds from the site, Greaney and her colleagues estimated that the pits were dug around 3650 B.C. but that the circular enclosure wasn't formed until 3200 B.C. and the burials were placed there soon after. A young adult male who was buried under a large sarsen stone at the center of the Flagstones' enclosure was placed there much later — around 1,000 years after the monument was first used.

A new type of monument

At 5,200 years old, Flagstones is the oldest known large, circular enclosure of its kind in Britain. After its construction, circular monuments were built in numerous other locations.

"It is part of a shift from predominantly rectangular or linear monuments (cursus monuments, long barrows) or irregular enclosures (causewayed enclosures) towards circular forms," Greaney said.

The new study suggests that circular monuments like Flagstones "may have been influenced by practices in Ireland, where people were burying their cremated dead in circular passage tombs at this time," she said.

Although the new dates suggest that Flagstones is older than Stonehenge, Greaney thinks that scientists should reassess and redate Stonehenge. After all, some of Stonehenge's artifacts are thought to be older than the site itself.

"There are some 'curated' animal bones from near the entrances to the enclosure at Stonehenge, which do date from around 3200 BC," Greaney said. "It's been assumed that these deer bones and cattle skulls had been kept for some time before being deposited in the ditch.

"With the new dates from Flagstones, it's now possible to look at these deposits, which were in slightly deeper parts of the ditch, and ask whether there was an earlier enclosure made up of intercutting pits which only later people joined together to form the more continuous ditch, which happened in c. [circa] 2900 BC," Greaney added.

                <p>The ceasefire in Gaza seems to be over.

And although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to blame Hamas for the resumption of combat that killed more than 400 Palestinians on March 18, 2025 - "It's just the beginning," Netanyahu warned - the truth is that the seeds of renewed violence are in Israeli internal politics.

Since the first phase of ceasefire came into force in January, experts in Israeli politics - including me - pointed out a probably insurmountable problem. The problem is that the execution of the second phase of the plan - which, if implemented, foresees the total removal of the Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages - is an obstacle to the extreme right elements in the Israeli government coalition on which Netanyahu depends on their political survival.

The removal of the Gaza range goes against the maximalist ideologies of the main members of the Netanyahu government, including some of their own party, Likud. Instead, its stated position is that Israel remains in control of the enclave and push as many Palestinians as possible out of it. This is why many in the Netanyahu government applauded when President Donald Trump indicated that the Palestinians should be removed from Gaza to pave the way for a massive reconstruction project led by the United States.

As an expert in Israeli history and a teacher of peace studies, I believe that the extreme right view for Gaza Post-conflict shared by parts of Netanyahu's government is incompatible with the ceasefire plan. But increasingly, it seems to be in accordance with the opinions of some US government members - which, as a fact sponsor of the ceasefire, may have been the only entity that could have kept the Israeli government in its terms.

Efforts to transform the judiciary

It is true that Hamas is responsible for delays and manipulations during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. He also transformed the release of hostages into propaganda shows, plaguing both hostage families and much of Israeli society in the process.

But, in my view, the resumption of war is first of all linked to internal Israeli currents that precede even the attack of 7 October 2023 that triggered the deadliest struggle between Israeli and Palestinians since the 1948 war. This can be attributed to Netanyahu's efforts to transform the political system into Israel and increase the power of the executive and legislative while weakening the legislative while weakening the legislative and legislative power Judiciary.

Since taking power in January 2023, Netanyahu's far -right government has made significant efforts to transform independent institutions, such as the Attorney General and the police, into government's complacent arms, seeking to put loyal to the government in charge of both.

Prolongation of war

In 2023, a movement of continuous and massive protest braked Netanyahu's attempts to reformulate the country's judiciary.

And then came the Hamas Massacre on October 7th.

Many Israeli commentators hoped that the attack would force the government to reconsider their efforts to accomplish what some have described as a legal blow in a demonstration of national unity.

But Netanyahu and his government had other plans.

After an initial agreement with hostages in November 2023 failed to produce a broader advance, people gradually began to question whether Netanyahu's main interest was to extend the war in the belief that this could be the best way to save his political career and revive his attack on the judiciary.

This view has solid bases. Having been indicted in November 2019 for breach of trust, fraud and charges of corruption, Netanyahu had the opportunity to confuse the logic of long -term legal processes: he could hardly be tried while defending a nation at war. The accusation is still in progress, but the resumption of fighting has once again meant that Netanyahu has reason to postpone his testimony.

Meanwhile, the war also covers Netanyahu to neutralize some of its fiercest critics. In the months after the October 7 attack, Netanyahu systematically removed antagonistic members from political and security leadership, accusing them of being responsible for attacking Hamas or the mismanagement of the conflict.

This anti -netanyAhu purge in Israel has increased in recent months with Netanyahu and his allies seeking to replace Attorney General Gali Baharav-Himiara and dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the powerful security agency Shabak, or Shin Bet, who has been conducting confidential investigations into Netanyaahu's closest advisers.

Reinforcing the coalition

The apparent collapse of the ceasefire now also coincides with the growing pressure on Netanyahu by the political right in his ruling coalition.

According to Israeli law, the government needs to approve its annual budget by the end of March or may be dissolved, which would cause new elections.

But Netanyahu is facing resistance among the ultraortodox parties regarding the army's issue. Since the beginning of the war, there has been enormous pressure from the Israeli public in general to end the exemption from recruitment to ultra -Orthodox men, who, unlike other Israeli, did not need to serve in the army. Ultra -Orthodox parties, however, are demanding otherwise: to approve legislation that would formally exempt them from military service.

To guarantee the vote for the annual budget and avoid elections, Netanyahu needs support, and if he does not come from the ultra -portodox parties, then he needs to support the far right members of the coalition.

As a result of the resumption of war, Otzma Yehudit - the far -right party that left the Netanyahu government in January to protest the ceasefire agreement - returned to the coalition. This gives Netanyahu crucial budget votes. But in fact, this indicates that the coalition has no intention of implementing the second phase of the ceasefire plan, the withdrawal of Gaza. In fact, this ended the ceasefire.

Israel's internal policy is not the only one to blame for the resumption of combat. There is also the change of posture of the US government.

The transition from Joe Biden's presidency to Donald Trump was a decisive reason for the time of the ceasefire agreement in January 2025.

But it seems that the government is reluctant to force Netanyahu to continue in the second phase. Trump's recent statements suggest that he supports additional military pressure on Hamas in Gaza. And in blaming Hamas by the resumption of war, Trump is tacitly endorsing the position of the Israeli government.

Hamas, in fact, has the greatest interest in implementing the agreement. Doing this would give the Palestinian militant group the best chance to remain in Gaza's control, while boasting of being responsible for release thousands of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.

Protests are gaining strength

Most Israelis are in favor of the end of the war, the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement and Netanyahu's resignation.

And the Ancient Writing Movement is gaining strength again, as seen in widespread protests in Israeli cities against the resumption of combat in Gaza and attempting to dismiss security chief Ronen Bar.

Considering that the people and the government of Israel seem to be walking in opposite directions, the resumption of bombing in Gaza can only exacerbate the internal crisis that preceded the war and which has diminished and diminished since then.

But Netanyahu seems to have bet that more war is his best chance to remain in power and complete his plan to transform the country's political system. Israel is facing an unprecedented situation in which I would say, his own prime minister has become the greatest threat to the country's stability.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15, 2025, and deported about 200 Venezuelan immigrants his administration alleged have ties to a Venezuelan gang. U.S. District Court Judge James Bloasberg verbally issued an order that same day telling the government that the planes carrying the deportees must return to the United States.

The U.S. government, though, allowed the flights to continue and for the Venezuelans to be detained at a facility in El Salvador infamous for its mistreatment of prisoners.

The subsequent legal back-and-forth, which is still going on, intensified so quickly and dramatically that many legal scholars say the U.S. is past the point of a constitutional crisis, as the Trump administration appears to be defying a federal court order, for which Boasberg may hold the government in contempt. Trump has also called for Bloasberg to be impeached. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts then issued a rare public statement that day rejecting Trump’s statement.

“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in a written statement on March 18.

Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., posed a few questions to Cassandra Burke Robertson, a scholar of civil proceedings and legal ethics, to break down some of the dynamics of this complex, evolving case.

Is it rare for a Supreme Court justice to weigh in on politicians’ activities or statements?

It’s uncommon for a Supreme Court justice to publicly contradict a president. Roberts has typically shown great respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. He has also consistently recognized that presidents have broad authority to run the federal government.

However, this isn’t the first time Roberts has spoken up to protect judicial independence. During Trump’s first term in 2018, the president criticized rulings as coming from “Obama judges.” Roberts responded publicly, and said, “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”

Why is Roberts’ statement of note, and what influence does he have in this situation?

Roberts leads the U.S. Supreme Court. He also oversees all federal courts across the country.

Roberts takes this leadership role very seriously. He has been willing to speak up when he believes something threatens judicial operations and independence.

Since Roberts was confirmed as chief justice in 2005, he has often spoken publicly about why judges need to remain independent from political pressure. He has pointed out four main threats to judges’ independence: “violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.”

When Roberts makes a public statement, it carries weight because he speaks as the top judicial officer in the country. His words are a reminder about the importance of keeping courts free from political interference.

What is most important for people to understand about the Alien Enemies Act case that Judge Boasberg is currently considering?

First, Trump is using a rarely used wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act. This law allows for deportations during a time of war without the normal legal protections like court hearings. Some legal experts argue that Trump doesn’t have the authority to use this law since the U.S. isn’t officially at war with Venezuela or with the gang the administration has cited, Tren de Aragua. They worry that invoking the Alien Enemies Act inappropriately expands presidential power beyond constitutional limits and could be misused to target other immigrant groups.

Second, Boasberg ordered a stop to these deportations on March 15. But the Trump administration went ahead with the deportations anyway. It later claimed it did not violate the judge’s order because the planes were over international waters. Under our legal system, the executive branch must obey valid court orders. This case raises concerns about whether the president is respecting the authority of the courts.

Third, Trump has publicly called for Boasberg to be impeached, saying the judge overstepped his authority by ruling against the president’s actions. There’s no evidence that Boasberg acted corruptly or improperly – he simply made a legal ruling the president disagreed with.

The case touches on fundamental questions about the balance of power between presidents and courts, and what happens when an administration chooses not to follow a judge’s orders. This confrontation between branches represents one of the most direct challenges to judicial authority by a president in American history.

What would it take for a judge to be impeached, and what is the precedent for doing so, based on disagreements about a case?

Federal judges can only be impeached by Congress for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That generally means serious wrongdoing, not just making unpopular decisions.

The impeachment process for judges works just like it does for presidents.

First, the House of Representatives votes to impeach, needing just a simple majority. Then, the Senate holds a trial where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove the judge.

Only 15 federal judges have ever been impeached in the U.S., and of those, only eight were convicted by the Senate.

The only two judicial impeachments during this century involved very serious misconduct – including a judge who lied about sexually abusing two female employees in 2009.

Only judges who have serious misconduct have been impeached and removed from office – not those involved in cases of political disagreements about judicial decisions.

What are the most important legal and ethical questions that this case raises?

This case raises important questions about the rule of law in the U.S. A key American belief is that no one, not even the president, is above the law. As Thomas Paine famously wrote in 1776, “In America, the law is king.”

This doesn’t mean every court decision is always right. That’s why the legal system has appellate courts, as Roberts pointed out – so decisions people disagree with can be challenged through an appeal in proper channels. My scholarly research on the right to appeal explores how this process serves as a crucial safeguard in the country’s legal system.

Twenty years ago, Roberts also stressed how important the rule of law is, saying it “protects the rights and liberties of all Americans.”

When a government chooses to ignore court orders instead of appealing them through the legal system, it creates a serious threat to this principle. The current situation raises concerns about whether the federal government will continue to respect the boundaries established by the Constitution in the country’s legal system.</p></b>

                <p>There are roughly 1,500 known species of sea spider, with some measuring up to 20 inches in leg span.

Scientists have captured stunning video of a dinner-plate-size sea spider crawling on the seafloor off the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of volcanic islands near Antarctica in one of the most remote areas of the world.

Sea spiders, also known as pycnogonids, are distant cousins of the creepy-crawly arachnids we see scuttling about on land. These creatures can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) — nearly double those of the largest land spiders , whose leg spans top out at around 12 inches (30 cm).

According to the Schmidt Ocean Institute, which shared the footage, the spider's massive size is a result of deep-sea gigantism , the tendency for deep-sea creatures to grow significantly larger than their shallow-water relatives. In this case, the pycnogonid was filmed at a depth of 6,903 feet (2,104 meters).

"Immense pressure and frigid temperatures, while insurmountable obstacles to land-lovers like humans, allow some animals to have very slow metabolisms and the ability to reach gargantuan proportions," Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives wrote in a Facebook post .

Larger animals can also move faster and farther to find food or to locate a mate, which is important when both are scarce.

Deep-sea gigantism is particularly prevalent toward the poles, where freezing temperatures facilitate slower metabolisms. Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives described sea spiders as both "abundant" and "abundantly large" in polar regions.

There are roughly 1,500 species of sea spider known to science and likely many more yet to be discovered, according to the post. Sea spiders inhabit oceans around the world and range just a few millimeters to the size of a serving platter. The species of spider in the video from the Schmidt Ocean Institute has not been specified.

The largest members of this group are usually found at depths between 7,200 and 13,100 feet (2,200 to 4,000 m), according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute .

Instead of spinning webs or creating burrows as land spiders do, sea spiders use a specialized tube-like mouth structure, called a proboscis, to slurp up prey such as sea anemones, jellies and other invertebrates.

This latest footage was taken by remotely operated vehicle pilots as part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute's South Sandwich Islands expedition, a mission to locate and describe new species in these frigid waters. According to the institute, scientists have discovered only 10% of ocean life.</p></b>

                <p>The Trump administration’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development is unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled on March 18, 2025. The court order to pause the agency’s shuttering came days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 83% of its programs had been cut.

USAID was created in 1961 as the lead agency for U.S. international development. Until recently, it funded health and humanitarian aid programs in more than 130 countries. Despite the administration’s claim of cost-cutting, USAID was a relatively small and economical operation. Its US$40 billion budget accounted for just 0.7% of annual federal spending. Congress also required regular reporting and evaluations on USAID, helping to ensure substantial oversight of how it spent its taxpayer dollars.

USAID’s swift destruction has sent shock waves across the globe. But as a scholar of the global humanitarian aid sector and donor agencies, I know this assault on foreign aid is not unprecedented.

In June 2020, Boris Johnson, then the prime minister of the United Kingdom, used similar claims of budget-tightening to effectively close the Department for International Development, Britain’s equivalent of USAID.

A COVID merger

Both the U.S. and British foreign aid programs have long prompted heated debates over the proper relationship between development, diplomacy and national security. The U.S. and Britain have long been among the top five providers of development assistance worldwide, and both USAID and DFID have played leading roles in the development community.

Countries give foreign aid for both altruistic and self-interested reasons. Treating global diseases and addressing civil conflicts is a way for wealthy Western governments to limit threats that could destabilize their countries, as well as the rest of the world. It also burnishes their reputation and encourages cooperation with other governments.

Scholars from across the political spectrum and around the world have questioned the general efficacy of foreign assistance, arguing that these programs are designed to serve the interests of donors, not the needs or recipients. Other development experts contend that foreign aid programs, while imperfect, have still made meaningful progress in improving health, education and freedoms.

Britain’s DFID was created in 1997 as an independent, Cabinet-level department deliberately independent of partisan politics. It quickly developed a reputation as a model donor, even among skeptics of international aid.

For example, a staffer at the international medical charity Doctors without Borders told me in a 2006 interview that he had scoffed at the idea of a politics-free aid agency.

Yet, he said, he had found DFID “relatively easier to work with” than other donors.

“I have never heard of someone being told, as a result of accepting DFID funds, what to do, either explicitly or behind closed doors,” he told me.

But its good reputation could not protect DFID. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson announced that DFID would merge with the Foreign Office, Britain’s equivalent of the State Department, to create a new government agency. By uniting aid and diplomacy, Johnson said, the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office would get “maximum value for the British taxpayer,” and he cited the economic impact of COVID to justify his decision.

Foreign aid dropped sharply after the merger, from 0.7% of Britain’s gross national income to 0.5% – a cut of about US$6 billion.

Development professionals decried Johnson’s merger, arguing it could not have happened at a worse time, with the pandemic heightening the need for global health funding. And coming shortly after Brexit, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, DFID’s demise further called into question Britain’s commitment to global cooperation.

Less money, less impact

Five years later, it’s not clear that dismantling DFID has made British foreign aid more efficient or effective, as Johnson pledged.

“We have seen evidence of where a more integrated approach has improved the organisation’s ability to respond to international crises and events, which has led to a better result,” reads one 2025 report by the U.K.’s National Audit Office.

Yet, the auditors add, the British government has spent at least £24.7 million – US$32 million – to merge its aid and diplomacy offices, and it failed to track these costs. Nor did the leaders of the merger set out a clear vision for its new purpose.

Britain’s slimmer new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has also relinquished the U.K.’s past leadership in research and expertise, largely due to pay reductions and restrictions on hiring non-British nationals.

From the outset, DFID had invested substantially in building expertise in global development, particularly in conflict-ridden states. In 2001, for example, it spent almost 5% of its budget – an unusually high amount – on research and policy analysis to design and assess its programs.

DFID produced regular case studies of the projects it funded, which included getting Syrian refugee children back in school, building roads that help Rwandan farmers move their products to market, and providing health care after Pakistan’s 2010 floods.

Given the “development expertise that was lost with the merger,” the U.K. government can no longer conduct “the kind of rigorous, long-term focus necessary to make a real impact,” said the Center for Global Development in a recent report.

A 2022 study suggests that DFID’s dismantling was a fundamentally political move, “divorced from substantive analysis of policy or inter-institution relationships.”

Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the leftist Labour Party, initially promised to boost British foreign aid. But in early March 2025, he backtracked, announcing instead a further cut to foreign aid.

By 2027, the U.K. government will spend just 0.3% of its budget on overseas aid. That’s roughly $11 billion less than before the merger in 2019.

‘Clear and easy target’

USAID’s budget was much larger than DFID’s, and the administration apparently wants not to streamline U.S. foreign aid but halt it almost entirely. If this effort succeeds, it will have even more severe effects worldwide, at least in the immediate term.

The global health programs administered by USAIDm which combat diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have received bipartisan and global praise. The PEPFAR program, which USAID helps administer, distributes antiretroviral drugs worldwide. It alone has saved 25 million lives over the past two decades, including the lives of 5.5 million babies born healthy to mothers with HIV.

Development professionals tend to see independent government agencies such as USAID and DFID as better able to prioritize the needs of the poor because their programming is run separately from partisan policies.

Yet standalone agencies are also more visible – and so more vulnerable to political targeting.

DFID was a clear and easy target when Johnson began his pandemic-era budget-slashing. USAID is now suffering a similar fate.</p></b>

                <p>Most of the United States’ major climate regulations are underpinned by one important document: It’s called the endangerment finding, and it concludes that greenhouse gas emissions are a threat to human health and welfare.

The Trump administration is vowing to eliminate it.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin referred to the 2009 endangerment finding as the “holy grail of the climate religion” when he announced on March 12, 2025, that he would reconsider the finding and all U.S. climate regulations and actions that rely on it. That would include rules to control planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane from power plants, vehicles and oil and gas operations.

But revoking the endangerment finding isn’t a simple task. And doing so could have unintended consequences for the very industries Trump is trying to help.

As a law professor, I have tracked federal climate regulations and the lawsuits and court rulings that have followed them over the past 25 years. To understand the challenges, let’s look at the endangerment finding’s origins and Zeldin’s options.

Origin and limits of the endangerment finding

In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that six greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA has a duty under the same law to determine whether they pose a danger to public health or welfare.

The court also ruled that once the EPA made an endangerment finding, the agency would have a mandatory duty under the Clean Air Act to regulate all sources that contribute to the danger.

The Court emphasized that the endangerment finding was a scientific determination and rejected a laundry list of policy arguments made by the George W. Bush administration for why the government preferred to use nonregulatory approaches to reduce emissions. The court said the only question was whether sufficient scientific evidence exists to determine whether greenhouse gases are harmful.

The endangerment finding was the EPA’s response.

The finding was challenged and upheld in 2012 by the U.S. District Circuit for the District of Columbia. In that case, Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA, the court found that the “body of scientific evidence marshaled by the EPA in support of the endangerment finding is substantial.” The Supreme Court declined to review the decision. The endangerment finding was updated and confirmed by the EPA in 2015 and 2016.

Challenging the endangerment finding

The scientific basis for the endangerment finding is stronger today than it was in 2009.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest assessment report, involving hundreds of scientists and thousands of studies from around the world, concluded that the scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is “unequivocal” and that greenhouse gases from human activities are causing it.

According to the National Climate Assessment released in 2023, the effects of human-caused climate change are already “far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States.”

During President Donald Trump’s first term, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt considered repealing the endangerment finding but ultimately decided against it. In fact, he relied on it in proposing the Affordable Clean Energy Rule to replace President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions for coal-fired power plants.

What happens if the EPA revokes the endangerment finding?

For the Trump administration to now revoke that finding, Zeldin must first recruit new members of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board to replace those dismissed by the Trump administration. Congress created the board in 1978 to provide independent, unbiased scientific advice to the EPA administrator, and it has consistently supported the 2009 endangerment finding.

Zeldin must then initiate rulemaking in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, provide the opportunity for public comment and respond to comments that are likely to be voluminous. This process could take several months if done properly.

If Zeldin then decides to revoke the endangerment finding, lawsuits will immediately challenge the move.

Even if Zeldin is able to revoke the finding, that does not automatically repeal all the rules that rely on it. Each of those rules must go through separate rulemaking processes that will also take months.

Zeldin could simply refuse to enforce the rules on the books while he reconsiders the endangerment finding.

However, a blanket policy abdicating any enforcement responsibility could be challenged in lawsuits as arbitrary and capricious. Further, the regulated industries would be taking a chance if they delayed complying with regulations only to find the endangerment finding and climate laws still in place.

Zeldin’s cost argument

Zeldin previewed his arguments in a news release on March 12.

His first argument is that the 2009 endangerment finding did not consider costs. However, that argument was rejected by the D.C. Circuit Court in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA. Cost becomes relevant once the EPA considers new regulations – after the endangerment finding.

Moreover, in a unanimous 2001 decision, the Supreme Court in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations held that the EPA cannot consider cost in setting air quality standards.

A repeal could backfire

Repealing the endangerment finding could also backfire on the fossil fuel industry.

States and cities have filed dozens of lawsuits against the major oil companies. The industry’s strongest argument has been that these cases are preempted by federal law. In AEP v. Connecticut in 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act “displaced” federal common law, barring state claims for remedies related to damages from climate change.

However, if the endangerment finding is repealed, then there is arguably no basis for federal preemption, and these state lawsuits would have legal grounds. Prominent industry lawyers have warned the EPA about this and urged it to focus instead on changing individual regulations. The industry is concerned enough that it may try to get Congress to grant it immunity from climate lawsuits.

To the extent that Zeldin is counting on the conservative Supreme Court to back him up, he may be disappointed.

In 2024, the court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations when laws were ambiguous. That means Zeldin’s reinterpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference. Nor can he count on the court overturning its Massachusetts v. EPA ruling to free him to disregard science for policy reasons.</p></b>

                <p>This photo, captured on March 8, shows the light of a waning Venus being refracted into a fiery rainbow by Earth's atmosphere.

New photos have revealed the "love planet" Venus looking unrecognizable as it prepares to line up for a striking conjunction later this week. The hellish world has transformed into a slim crescent, which can look like a giant fiery rainbow under the right conditions.

On March 23, Venus will reach its inferior conjunction , or the point at which it lies directly between Earth and the sun. On this day, the sun's glare will make it almost impossible to see the planet. But even if we could see it, it would be covered in shadow, similar to a new moon. Over the last few weeks and months, the planet has been waning as it gets closer to alignment, giving it an increasingly crescent-like appearance.

Astrophotographer Douglas Kostyk set out to capture the disappearing planet on March 8 at the Marian and Max Farash Center for Observational Astronomy in Ionia, New York — when only around 7% of Venus was visible. But his photos also showed that the crescent looked like a cosmic rainbow.

The striking rainbow effect is caused by particles in Earth's atmosphere refracting, or splitting apart, different wavelengths of light like a prism, according to Spaceweather.com . "When Venus is near the horizon, refraction separates the red crescent from the blue," Spaceweather.com representatives wrote. "The crescent is so thin, the splitting of colors is obvious."

The same effect was also captured by Kevin R. Witman, who snapped a less-detailed image of Venus' rainbow crescent from Cochranville, Pennsylvania on March 9. In this image, the rainbow's colors are inverted compared to Kostyk's photo because the planet was in a different part of the sky relative to the observer.

More recently, on March 16, astronomer Raffaello Lena captured video footage of the rainbow effect from near Rome, Italy. In this instance, atmospheric turbulence caused the light coming from Venus to shimmer and become distorted, making it appear as if the rainbow was "on fire," Spaceweather.com reported .

Parading planet

Venus has become unusually bright in recent weeks as it gets closer to Earth, which has made it a prime target for astronomy enthusiasts since early February onwards . During this time, the hellish world also starred in a rare planetary parade , when all of the solar system's worlds appeared in the night sky at one point or another.

Venus was one of the most clearly visible planets throughout the parade, often appearing close to the moon and occasionally right alongside other planets like Mercury . It was also one of the most easily identifiable bodies when all seven planets were photographed in a line in late February.

Bright Venus is easily spotted with the naked eye, but to make out its crescent-like appearance you’ll need a strong pair of stargazing binoculars or a good backyard telescope .

The planetary parade is now over. However, several planets will remain easier to spot than usual in the coming weeks and months. After the upcoming inferior conjunction, Venus will begin its waxing phase and transition from a slim crescent to its more usual filled-in appearance. As this happens, the rainbow effect should still be visible for a few weeks if the conditions are right.

Venus reaches an inferior conjunction approximately every 18 months. The next time this happens will be on Oct. 24, 2026.</p></b>

                <p>NASA has released the first ever high-definition photographs of a sunset on the moon to mark the completion of the Blue Ghost lunar lander's maiden mission to our rocky satellite.

The image shows a ghostly glow above the cratered lunar horizon.

"These are the first high-definition images taken of the sun going down and then going into darkness at the horizon," Joel Kearns , deputy associate administrator for exploration at NASA, said in a news briefing on Tuesday (March 18).

The lunar lander, built and operated in collaboration with commercial space exploration company Firefly Aerospace, touched down on the moon on March 2 . Its mission lasted for 14 days — the equivalent of one lunar day — until its shutdown on Sunday (March 16). Like most lunar landers, Blue Ghost was not built to withstand lunar night — the frigid, roughly two-week-long period when most of the moon's visible surface is in shadow, with temperatures dropping as low as minus 148 degrees Fahrenheit .

As well as capturing stunning photos, the lander collected extensive data on how space weather and other cosmic forces may impact our planet. "Teams are eagerly analyzing their data, and we are extremely excited for the expected scientific findings that will be gained from this mission," Kearns said in a statement on Tuesday (March 18).

The Blue Ghost lunar lander launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Jan. 15 as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative. The lander delivered 10 scientific and technological instruments to the Mare Crisium basin on the near side of the moon , which NASA said is the largest payload a CLPS delivery mission has ever carried.

These instruments include the deepest robotic planetary subsurface thermal probe ever made, according to NASA, an x-ray imager to study the interactions between solar winds and Earth's magnetic field, and a subsurface probe based on electric and magnetic fields capable of taking measurements at depths of up to 700 miles (110 kilometers).

"The science and technology we send to the Moon now helps prepare the way for future NASA exploration and long-term human presence to inspire the world for generations to come," Nicky Fox , an associate administrator at NASA, said in a statement .</p></b>

                <p>Did you know that tuberculosis (TB) brought us the Adirondack chair? TB patients used to recline, completely immobile, upon that now-iconic piece of furniture on the orders of their doctors. TB also brought about the cities of Pasadena, California, and Colorado Springs, Colorado, which were founded as places for TB patients to seek fresh air. And did you know that before penning "Sherlock Holmes," Sir Arthur Conan Doyle debunked a supposed cure for TB that had been overhyped in the press in the 19th century?

In " Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection " (Crash Course Books, 2025), John Green recounts these unsung ways in which TB shaped history. He also highlights how public perception of the disease has shifted through time. TB was once seen as a romantic condition that rendered people with the illness "beautiful," "waiflike" and "sensitive," but the illness later became seen as a stigmatizing disease of poverty.

And while we now have a cure for TB, "the disease is where the cure is not," Green notes, paraphrasing a Ugandan doctor who said the same about HIV/AIDS treatments. Annually, there are more than 10 million cases of TB and 1 million TB deaths worldwide , and most of these cases and fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries.

Green is one-half of the vlogbrothers on YouTube, co-creator of the educational series Crash Course , and author of the bestselling books "The Fault in Our Stars" (Penguin Books, 2012) and "The Anthropocene Reviewed" (E. P. Dutton, 2021), among others. Live Science spoke with him about his latest book, its featured subject, TB survivor Henry Reider, and the uncertain future of efforts to end TB worldwide.

Nicoletta Lanese: In the book, you say that you initially thought of TB as a disease of the past — of "19th-century poets." How was it to have that idea dispelled through writing the book?

John Green: If you'd asked me in 2018, "What are the biggest infectious health problems facing the world," I would have said, "I don't know, malaria, HIV , typhoid, cholera." I would have been so far down the list before I said tuberculosis, even though it turns out tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease in the world and sickens over 10 million people every year.

To some extent, that's been a throughline throughout history — when Robert Koch was declaring that he'd discovered that TB was infectious, he almost seemed defensive. He said, "I know we're more afraid of cholera and plague, but actually tuberculosis is a much bigger deal."

I just had no idea that tuberculosis was a crisis until I visited a TB hospital in Sierra Leone in 2019. … [There] I met a young boy named Henry Reider , and that kind of changed the course of my life.

John Green. (Image credit: Marina Waters)

NL: Henry is a big focus of the book. For those who haven't read it yet, could you share a bit about him?

JG: Henry and I met at that hospital in Sierra Leone, and when we arrived, he just grabbed me by the T-shirt and started walking me around the hospital. He seemed to be about the same age as my son, who was 9 at the time, and he also shares a name with my son. They [now] call each other "the namesakes."

He walked me all around the hospital, showed me the lab, showed me the wards where patients were staying. I was really astonished by how many people were sick and how sick they were. And we finally made our way back to where the doctors were, and they sort of shooed Henry away and I said, "Whose kid is that?" And they said, "He's a patient, and he's one of the patients we're most concerned about."

It turns out, he wasn't 9. He was 17 — just he'd been stunted by malnutrition and by TB.

He and I have become really good friends and through the process of reporting this — like, I'm not a good reporter. I don't know how to have a distance between the reporter and the subject, as I try to acknowledge in the book. He inspired the book in many ways because I think if I hadn't met Henry that day, I probably wouldn't have become obsessed with tuberculosis.

NL: And how is Henry doing now?

JG: He's very excited about the book. He's a junior at the University of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone's best university, and he's studying human resources and management and doing really, really well.

However, it is also true that like so many people whose lives are marginalized, his life is made much more fragile by the recent cuts to USAID, and his life is made much more challenging by the recent cuts to USAID. That's been a constant topic of conversation between him and me over the last few weeks.

[Although Henry has now been cured of TB], Henry also has other health problems, and he has some long-term consequences from having lived with such serious tuberculosis. Like a lot of people, he depends upon USAID-funded medication in order to survive, and that funding has been canceled.

He and I had a conversation recently where I said, "Look, you know, we'll make sure that you and your mom have access to the medication that you need." And he said, "Thank you, but what about everyone else?"

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS - YouTube Watch On

NL: From your description of him, that seems like a question he would ask.

JG: Yeah, he's an extraordinarily empathetic person. He's a poet. He has what used to be called spes phthisica [meaning "consumptive spirit"], the "tubercular personality." We used to think that people who had this tuberculous personality tended to be sensitive and alive to the suffering in the world and generous and beautiful and lots of other romantic ideals.

NL: In the book, you explore how the perception of TB has changed through time, starting with that romantic, idealized vision of the disease. Could you sum up what you learned?

JG: It's almost like they're two different diseases. It's almost like the disease of consumption [a past name for TB] is different from the disease of tuberculosis. Because at least in Northern Europe and the U.S., consumption was an inherited disease that was associated with being beautiful and having certain personality traits that were desirable. Tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty, a disease of filth, a disease of infection. They're very different diseases in the way they're imagined, even though they have the same cause and the same course.

You see this all over the history of tuberculosis, but I think you especially see it in the way the disease was racialized. It was widely believed in the 18th and 19th centuries that only white people could get tuberculosis. And then in the 20th and 21st centuries, it was believed white people were insulated from tuberculosis in some ways and that it's a disease primarily of people of color.

The way that I think about it sometimes is that Charles Dickens wrote that tuberculosis was the "disease that wealth never warded off," and, of course, now it's a disease that wealth entirely wards off.

NL: We've touched on this already, but could you expand on how USAID factors into TB efforts worldwide and what it means for that funding to be disrupted?

JG: We did have ongoing projects I would have liked to highlight. I would have liked to highlight our work in the Philippines with USAID to bring TB down to zero in specific communities to offer a blueprint for how we eliminate TB from the planet. [Beyond our own work], I'd like to highlight the work that has been done to reduce TB death by over 50% in the last 25 years. I'd like to highlight the efforts that are being made by the U.S. government and others to radically reduce the burden of tuberculosis in the most impoverished countries in the world. But we've just abandoned all of those.

The project that we've been working on in the Philippines with Partners In Health and USAID and the Philippine government will continue in some way, thanks to the generosity of the Philippine government. But it won't accomplish its biggest dreams, and that's entirely because of the decision to stop funding essentially all global health services.

I'm confused as to how all of this is happening, but I'm just also heartbroken. I'm hearing every day from people who are having to make horrible decisions about how to ration care.

NL: And in tuberculosis, continuity of care is very important.

JG: Continuity of care is essential for curing tuberculosis. If someone has even a couple of weeks without access to their medication, it's vastly more likely that their disease will become drug resistant, which is a personal catastrophe because it means that they are much more likely to die of tuberculosis. It's also a societal catastrophe because it means there's much more drug-resistant tuberculosis floating around, having the opportunity to evolve ever more drug resistance.

I think it's important to understand that we've never done anything like this before; we've never suddenly interrupted the treatment of thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds hundreds of thousands. We don't even know how many people's treatment is being interrupted right now because we have no way to count it. … What we're doing to the future of tuberculosis is unconscionable to me.

NL: In a moment when the situation feels so bleak, is there anything bringing you hope?

JG: It's inevitable for me to feel like I live at the end of history because today is the most recent day I've ever experienced, you know, and so this feels like the culmination of everything that came before, but I don't live at the end of history. I live in the middle of history, and this is not the end of the story; this is the middle of the story, and we have to fight for a better end.

That's what gives me hope, and working with people I love. In this work, you get to work with people you care about and whose love and attention is focused in the same direction as yours, and there's a lot of comfort in that for me.

                <p>Researchers have detected four small exoplanets orbiting closely around Barnard's Star. This illustration shows what the planetary system may look like from one of the rocky worlds.

A quartet of Earth-like worlds, each about 20% to 30% the size of our planet, circle one of our closest stellar neighbors, a new study reveals. The rocky alien worlds are close enough that future generations of humans may be able to visit them with futuristic rocket propulsion technology. However, it is unlikely that we will find any life there.

Astronomers have long suspected that there was at least one exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star — a red dwarf with a mass around one-sixth that of the sun. At 5.97 light-years from Earth, it is the fourth-closest star to our solar system, after the three interconnected stars of the Alpha Centauri system. ( Five potential planets have also been detected around the stars of Alpha Centauri, though not all of them have been confirmed yet.)

In the past, researchers assumed that Barnard's Star was circled by a gas giant exoplanet similar to Jupiter, because the star frequently wobbles closer to and then farther from Earth. This suggests that something is gravitationally tugging on the star, similar to how the moon pulls on our planet and causes Earth's tides. However, proving the existence of such a planet has remained elusive.

But in a new study, published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , researchers say they have discovered that this wobbling is not caused by the pull of one gas giant but instead by the combined force exerted by four smaller, rocky worlds, each around four times more massive than Mercury.

"It's a really exciting find," study lead author Ritvik Basant , a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago, said in a statement . "Barnard's Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it."

The newly detected worlds, which have not been officially named yet, are "so close to their home star that they zip around the entire star in a matter of days," the researchers wrote. "That probably means they are too hot to be habitable."

The new findings also likely rule out the possibility that any other exoplanets circle within the habitable zone of Barnard's Star, they added.

But that doesn't mean this system will remain uninhabited forever. Although Barnard's Star is currently out of reach for humans using current rocket propulsion technology, future human generations might be able to travel to and colonize these newly discovered planets using new forms of rocket propulsion, such as nuclear fusion engines or light sails.

Finding hidden planets

Most exoplanets are discovered when they pass in front of their home star and block out some of the light shining toward Earth. However, in this case, researchers think we are looking at Barnard's Star from above, meaning its planets do not pass in between it and us. As a result, scientists often refer to our stellar neighbor as "great white whale" of planet hunting, researchers wrote.

To get around this problem, the study team turned to MAROON-X, an instrument attached to the Gemini North telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. Over 112 nights during a three-year period, the telescope detected subtle shifts in the movement of Barnard's Star in order to "tease apart the number and masses of the planets that must be circling the star to have this effect," the researchers wrote.

Initially, MAROON-X identified only three planets. However, in another study , published in October 2024, researchers identified another planet using a similar device, dubbed ESPRESSO, at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. By combining these data with their own, the researchers could see this fourth planet for themselves.

Using data from both MAROON-X and ESPRESSO also challenges the idea that the researchers are being misled by anomalies in either data set, making them more confident in their results.

Red dwarfs are the most common star type in the universe, but most are too far from Earth for researchers to easily spot planets around them. However, the new results hint that small, rocky planets could be abundant around these miniature stars.

But for the study team, the most exciting thing about the new research was finding worlds that are so close to Earth.</p></b>

                <p>Oxytocin is a chemical messenger that has effects on the brain and throughout the body, where it functions as a hormone.

Oxytocin, the "cuddle hormone" that's known for its involvement in bonding, may also play a role in putting early pregnancies on pause, a study of lab animals finds.

New research in mice shows that the hormone can put embryos in the earliest stages of development into a kind of hibernation state. Once triggered, this process, called "diapause," might allow a mouse mother to delay a pregnancy at a time when resources are scarce — such as while she is still nursing a previous litter of newborn mouse pups.

"The fact that oxytocin had an influence on this was a little bit of a surprise," study co-author Moses Chao , a neuroscientist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told Live Science.

Diapause, in general, is a bit of a mystery. The phenomenon naturally occurs in marsupials, such as kangaroos and possums, and in at least 130 species of mammals, including mice and bats.

It might even occur in humans — it's a difficult phenomenon to track in most human pregnancies, but a few scattered reports from in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics suggest that, in rare cases, embryos transferred into the uterus might hang out for weeks before actually implanting in the organ. In one case reported in 1996 , it took five weeks after embryo transfer for the pregnancy to begin.

It's not clear how long diapause can last, Chao said, nor is much known about how embryos enter this state of suspended animation.

Study first author Jessica Minder , a graduate student at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, was interested in oxytocin's role in diapause because the hormone is also known to be involved in embryonic development and nursing in mammals, including humans.

Minder and colleagues began the work by introducing male mice into the enclosures of female mice that had just given birth, allowing the rodents to mate while the females were still nursing their first litters. The researchers found that the resulting pregnancies lasted about a week longer in still-nursing female mice than they did in mice that were not nursing.

They think this likely reflects a pre-implantation "pause." As mouse pregnancies typically last only 19 to 21 days, the pause reflects a significant delay in the process.

The team then set about exploring how this pause might occur.

In another group of newly pregnant mice, the team used a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to switch on specific neurons, to make the brains of the mouse moms release oxytocin. The researchers timed this stimulation to mimic the pulses of oxytocin seen during nursing.

After five days of this treatment, they removed the mice's uteruses to assess embryonic development. Five of the six mouse mothers had embryos that underwent diapause, as evidenced by a lack of development.

Meanwhile, in a comparison group, pregnant mice who did not have their oxytocin stimulated did not show any signs of diapause.

In another experiment, the team treated early mouse embryos with oxytocin in lab dishes, and that also induced cellular changes consistent with diapause.

Together, the evidence suggested that oxytocin caused embryonic cells to slow their translation of genes into proteins, the researchers reported March 5 in the journal Science Advances . This multistep process involves copying down instructions from DNA into a new molecule, called RNA , that gets shipped to a cell's protein construction sites.

Embryos without oxytocin receptors can still undergo diapause, Chao noted, so there are probably multiple signals that can trigger the pause. However, oxytocin seems to be important for the embryos to survive this arrest.

When the researchers turned off oxytocin receptors in the mouse embryos, they found that only 11% survived diapause, compared with 42% of the embryos with working oxytocin receptors.

This research is an early exploration of the metabolism of early embryos, Chao said. Eventually, a better understanding of these mechanisms might reveal insight into why early miscarriages happen in people and could possibly lead to new fertility treatments.

More work will be needed to understand the biochemical steps that lead from oxytocin stimulation to diapause, Chao said.

The new findings could also be helpful for understanding cell survival more generally, Chao added. For example, half of the nerve cells in the early embryo die as the developing nervous system is refined before birth. However, many of the nerve cells that develop in the womb ultimately last a lifetime.

"Later on [in development], you don't want half your cells dying," Chao said, "so we're very interested in what keeps those cells going."</p></b>

                <p>Salto the robot is acting a little squirrelly.

The jumping bot can take a flying leap and land on a narrow pipe ­­­— just like a squirrel soaring from branch to branch. It’s the first time scientists have been able to get a robot to land balanced on such a tiny target, says engineer Justin Yim, whose team reported the results March 19 in Science Robotics.

“We’ve been inspired by squirrels,” says Yim, who worked on the project at the University of California, Berkeley and is now at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Squirrels are one of nature’s acrobats. They can scamper over telephone wires, vault between trees and even navigate Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses. A secret to squirrels’ parkour prowess is exceptional balance. Even if a jump carries them a bit beyond or short of their target, squirrels can maneuver their bodies into staying upright. One way is by adjusting how hard their legs push against a branch as they land, Yim and his collaborators reported February 27 in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

Think of playing hopscotch, he says. If you land on a square and feel like you’re going to fall forward, you might stand up tall, pushing hard against the ground to prevent yourself from toppling over. And if you land too far back, you might crouch down, so you don’t tip backward.

Salto the robot has a gripper foot (shown closed in this image) that lets it catch onto a pipe when landing a jump. Justin K. Yim and Eric K. Wang

Yim’s team tried to mimic those strategies in Salto, a spindly little hopping bot that was developed in 2016, and named after “saltatorial,” or jumping, movement. In 2020, the researchers figured out how to make Salto stick the landing on flat surfaces. For the new work, the team made two big changes. They added a clawlike gripper to Salto’s foot so it could catch a pipe during landings. And they gave Salto the ability to stand or crouch to improve its balance.

In test jumps in the lab, Salto successfully leapt from one PVC pipe to another 25 times out of 30, catching the tube and swinging over or under it most of the time. But in two trials, Salto leapt, landed and perched just perfectly, balancing upright on the pipe.

“There’s lots of room for improvement,” Yim says. Salto may not be ready to join Cirque du Soleil yet, but he has ideas about how to improve the bot’s balance. One way would be enhancing its gripper, making it better for grasping the pipe upon landing, like a squirrel squeezing a branch with its toes.

Yim envisions future bots that are even more agile than Salto and could one day help with construction, hopping onto pipes or girders while carrying cameras for inspection, for example, or working outside in a forest doing environmental monitoring. But Salto will need many more tweaks to catch up to its bushy-tailed brothers, Yim says. “The robot is definitely not able to do what a squirrel can do just yet.”</p></b>

                <p>In the year when the United Nations Conference on Climate Change happens for the first time in the Amazon, it is important to remember the importance of this choice. The latest COPs have been marked by breaking expectations as to the result of negotiations, but it is undeniable that the event is still an important time for civil society to be heard from the impacts of climate emergency.

Like international human rights spaces, most climate negotiation processes occur in the global North, in high -cost places, making it difficult to access much of civil society in southern countries.

With the examples of ECO 92 and Rio+20, Brazil has a history of large participation of civil society in international events on climate and environment. Thus, conducting COP in Belém represents a unique opportunity for groups such as the indigenous peoples of the Amazon to be heard.

But how to ensure this when your voices have been neglected by the state government itself?

Indigenous occupation

For almost a month, since January 14, 2025, indigenous people from various peoples occupied the headquarters of the Department of Education of Pará after the publication of a state law, Law 10,820 of 2024, which amended the system of laws applicable to state public education.

By revoking Law 7,806, this law not only ended benefits from teachers of the State Education Network, but also impacted indigenous, riverside and quilombola communities of the State of Pará, as it extinguished the system of Modular Indigenous Education Organization (Somei), a system that guaranteed the high school in person.

During the period of mobilizations, the Government of Pará argued that the Somei would be maintained, making room for negotiation regarding some terms of the law. However, Amazonia Vox found that the amount intended for the Somei for the 2025 exercise would be 85% lower than that designated in 2024. In the same subject, the teachers' report was that the state was not guaranteeing the proper infrastructure, not even feeding for students: it was insufficient and did not respect local food culture.

The indigenous people denounced the absence of the guarantee of the right of prior, free and informed consultation, as established by Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). When the government announced the attempt to build a working group for the state indigenous school education policy without the participation of several of the affected peoples, the discontent of those who occupied Seduc became even greater.

With this, finally, after 23 days of occupation, on February 5, 2025, Governor Helder Barbalho partially complied with the claims by signing the commitment to revoke the law. The occupation continued until the revocation of the law, which took place on February 12. In the end, an important victory was won for the indigenous movement, as it has not been seen for a long time, and that also benefited state teachers.

Lack of historical dialogue

The government's stance against indigenous peoples was not surprised. It was not the first time there was no listening and dialogue. The history of the state of Pará is marked by processes that ignore indigenous peoples. The construction of the Belo Monte plant is one of the greatest examples. Despite more than 30 public civil actions started by the Federal Public Prosecution Service, the project was conducted without any observance of ILO Convention 169.

The ILO Convention 169, also known as a convention on indigenous and tribal peoples, states that prior, free and informed consultation is a right of indigenous peoples. In addition, it determines the need for recognition and protection of the values ​​and practices of indigenous peoples, as well as recognizes the right of these peoples to earth and natural resources, to define the priorities of the community.

Reinforced right

In addition to the convention, by the end of 2024, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) launched the fundamental principles of human rights for private conservation organizations and financiers. The document reinforces the priorities contained in Convention 169, recognizing the importance of indigenous and African descent peoples for the protection and conservation of nature.

The action of the Government of Pará in relation to indigenous education was and is worrying, demonstrating the disrespect for the international normative of human rights protection. The case makes us wonder if COP 30 will be a truly inclusive space, open to the participation of indigenous peoples in climate decision making.

However, the victory of indigenous mobilization reminds us of the importance that the climate conference is first held in the Amazon, allowing those who will be some of the most affected by climate change, can press so that their voices are heard at the multilateral negotiation event that will decide our future.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>The ceasefire in Gaza appears to be over.

And while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to blame Hamas for the resumption of fighting that killed more than 400 Palestinians on March 18, 2025 – “only the beginning,” Netanyahu warned – the truth is the seeds of the renewed violence are to be found in Israeli domestic politics.

Ever since the first phase of the ceasefire came into effect in January, Israeli politics experts – myself included – have flagged a likely insurmountable problem. And that is the execution of the plan’s second phase – which, if implemented, would see full withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages – is a nonstarter for far-right elements in the Israeli ruling coalition that Netanyahu relies on for his political survival.

Withdrawing from the Gaza Strip runs counter to the maximalist ideologies of key members of Netanyahu’s government, including some in his own party, Likud. Rather, their stated position is for Israel to remain in control of the enclave and to push as many Palestinians as possible out of it. It is why many in Netanyahu’s government cheered when President Donald Trump indicated that Palestinians should be cleared from Gaza to make way for a massive reconstruction project led by the United States.

As an expert on Israeli history and a professor of peace studies, I believe the far-right vision for post-conflict Gaza shared by parts of Netanyahu’s government is incompatible with the ceasefire plan. But increasingly, it appears to chime with the views of some in the U.S. administration – which, as de facto sponsor of the ceasefire, may have been the only entity that could have held the Israeli government to its terms.

Efforts to transform judiciary

It is true Hamas is responsible for delays and manipulations during the first phase of the ceasefire deal. It also turned hostage releases into propaganda spectacles, tormenting both the families of captives and much of Israeli society in the process.

But in my view, the resumption of war is first and foremost tied to domestic Israeli currents that predate even the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the deadliest fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the 1948 war. It can be traced back to Netanyahu’s efforts to transform the political system in Israel and increase the power of the executive and legislative branches while weakening the judiciary.

Since coming to power in January 2023, Netanyahu’s hard-right government has made significant efforts to turn independent institutions such as the attorney general’s office and the police into compliant arms of the government by seeking to place government loyalists in charge of both.

Prolonging the war

In 2023, a sustained and massive protest movement slowed Netanyahu’s attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary.

And then came the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7.

Many Israeli commentators hoped that the attack would force the government to reconsider its efforts to carry out what some described as a legal coup, in a show of national unity.

But Netanyahu and his government had other plans.

After an initial hostage deal in November 2023 failed to yield a wider breakthrough, people gradually began to question whether Netanyahu’s primary interest was to prolong the war in the belief that doing so might be the best way to save his political career and revive his assault on the judiciary.

Such a view has solid foundations. Having been indicted in November 2019 on breach of trust, fraud and corruption charges, Netanyahu was presented with an opportunity to muddy the logic of the long-running legal proceedings: He could hardy stand trial while defending a nation at war. The prosecution is still ongoing, but the resumption of fighting has, again, meant that Netanyahu has reason to delay his testimony.

Meanwhile, war also provides cover for Netanyahu to neuter some of his fiercest critics. In the months after the Oct. 7 attack, Netanyahu systematically removed from office antagonistic members of the security and political leadership, accusing them of being responsible either for the Hamas attack or for the mismanagement of the conflict.

This purging of anti-Netanyahu elements in Israel has ramped up in recent months, with Netanyahu and his allies seeking to replace Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and fire Ronen Bar, the head of the powerful security agency Shabak, or Shin Bet, which has been carrying out sensitive investigations into Netanyahu’s closest aides.

Shoring up the coalition

The apparent breakdown of the ceasefire now also coincides with growing pressure on Netanyahu from the political right in his ruling coalition.

Under Israeli law, the government must approve its annual budget by the end of March or face being dissolved, something that would trigger fresh elections.

But Netanyahu is facing holdouts among ultra-Orthodox parties over the issue of army drafts. Since the start of the war, there has been tremendous pressure from the wider Israeli public to end the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, who unlike other Israelis did not have to serve in the military. Ultra-Orthodox parties, however, are demanding the opposite: to pass legislation that would formally exempt them from military service.

To secure the vote for the annual budget and stave off elections, Netanyahu needs support – and if it isn’t going to come from the ultra-Orthodox parties, then he needs to shore up far-right members of the coalition.

As a result of the resumption of war, Otzma Yehudit – the far-right party that left Netanyahu’s government in January to protest the ceasefire agreement – has returned to the fold. This gives Netanyahu crucial budget votes. But in effect, it signals that the coalition has no intention of implementing the second phase of the ceasefire plan, withdrawing from Gaza. In effect, it has killed the ceasefire.

The domestic politics of Israel alone is not to blame for the resumption of fighting. There is, too, the changing stance of the U.S. administration.

The transition of presidency from Joe Biden to Donald Trump was a decisive reason for the timing of the ceasefire agreement in January 2025.

But it appears that the administration is reluctant to force Netanyahu to continue to the second phase. Recent statements from Trump suggest that he supports putting extra military pressure on Hamas in Gaza. And by blaming Hamas for the resumption of the war, Trump is tacitly endorsing the position of the Israeli government.

Hamas, in fact, has the most interest in implementing the agreement. Doing so would give the Palestinian militant group the best chance it has of remaining in control of Gaza, while also boasting that it had been responsible for the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.

Protests gaining momentum

The majority of Israelis are in favor of ending the war, completing the ceasefire agreement and having Netanyahu resign.

And the anti-government protest movement is gaining steam again as seen in widespread protests in Israeli cities against both the resumption of fighting in Gaza and the attempt to oust security chief Ronen Bar.

Given that the people and the government of Israel appear to be pulling in opposite directions, the resumption of bombing in Gaza can only exacerbate the internal crisis that preceded the war and has ebbed and flowed ever since.

But Netanyahu has seemingly bet that more war is his best chance of remaining in power and completing his plan to transform the country’s political system. Israel is facing an unprecedented situation in which, I would argue, its own prime minister has became the biggest threat to the country’s stability.</p></b>

                <p>Of the 8.7 million species on Earth, why are human beings the only one that paints self-portraits, walks on the Moon and worships gods?

For decades, many scholars have argued that the difference stems from our ability to learn from each other. Through techniques such as teaching and imitation, we can create and transmit complicated information over many generations.

So if a human finds, for instance, a better but more complex way to make a knife, they can pass along the new instructions. One of those learners might stumble upon their own improvement and pass it along in turn.

If this loop continues, you get a ratchet effect, in which small changes can accumulate over time to produce increasingly intricate behaviors and technologies. This process produces our uniquely complex cultures: Scientists call it cumulative cultural evolution.

But extensive data has emerged suggesting that other animals, including bees, chimpanzees and crows, can also generate cultural complexity through social learning. Consequently, the debate over human uniqueness is shifting in a new direction.

As an anthropologist, I study a different feature of human culture that researchers are beginning to think about: the diversity of our traditions. Whereas animal cultures affect just a few crucial behaviors, such as courtship and feeding, human cultures cover a massive and constantly expanding set of activities, from clothing to table manners to storytelling.

This new view suggests that human culture is not uniquely cumulative. It is uniquely open-ended.

What is cumulative culture?

In the early 2000s, a research team led by psychologist Michael Tomasello tested 105 human children, 106 adult chimpanzees and 32 adult orangutans on a battery of cognitive assessments. Their goal was to see whether humans held any innate cognitive advantage over their primate cousins.

Surprisingly, the human children performed better in only one capacity: social learning. Tomasello thus concluded that humans are not “generally smarter.” Rather, “we have a special kind of smarts.” Our advanced social abilities allow us to transmit information by accurately teaching and learning from each other.

Humans’ apparent social learning abilities suggested a clear explanation for our unique cultural traits. Knowledgeable humans – say, someone who discovers a better way to make a spear – can successfully transfer that skill to their peers. But an inventive chimp – one who discovers a better way to smash nuts, for example – can’t successfully share their innovation. Nobody listens to Chimp Einstein. So our inventions persist and build upon each other, while theirs vanish into the jungle floor.

Or so the theory went.

Now, though, scientists have hard evidence showing that, just like us, animals can learn from each other and thus maintain their cultures for long periods of time. Groups of swamp sparrows appear to use the same song syllables for centuries. Meerkat troops settle on different wake-up times and maintain them for a decade or more.

Of course, long-term social learning is not the same as cumulative culture. Yet scientists also now know that humpback whale songs can oscillate in complexity over many generations of learners, that homing pigeons create efficient flight paths by learning from each other and making small improvements, and that hooved mammals cumulatively alter their migration routes to exploit plant growth.

Once again, the animals have shot down our claim to uniqueness, as they have innumerable times throughout scientific history. You might wonder, at this point, if we should just settle the uniqueness question by answering: “We’re not.”

If not cumulative culture, what makes us unique?

But it remains the case that humans and their cultures are quite different from animals and their equivalents. Most scholars agree about that, even if they disagree about the reasons why. Since cumulative complexity appears not to be the most important difference, several researchers are sketching out a new perspective: Human culture is uniquely open-ended.

Currently, anthropologists are discussing open-endedness in two related ways. To get a sense of the first, try counting the number of things you’re engaged with, right now, that came to you through culture. For example, I picked my clothes today based on fashion trends I did not develop; I am writing in a language I did not invent; I tied my shoes using a method my father taught me; there are paintings and postcards and photographs on my walls.

Give me 10 minutes, and I could probably add 100 more items to that list. In fact, other than biological acts such as breathing, it is difficult for me to think of any aspect of what I’m doing right now that is not partially or completely cultural. This breadth is incredibly strange. Why should any organism spend time pursuing such a wide range of goals, particularly if most of them have nothing to do with survival?

Other animals are much more judicious. Their cultural variation and complexity pertains almost entirely to matters of subsistence and reproduction, such as acquiring food and mating. Humans, on the other hand, lip-synch, build space stations and, less grandiosely, have been known to do things such as spend six years trying to park in all 211 spots of a grocery store lot. Our cultural diversity is unparalleled.

Open-endedness, as a unique human quality, is not just about variety; it reflects the quantum leaps by which our cultures can evolve. To illustrate this peculiarity, consider a hypothetical example regarding the rocks that chimpanzees use to smash nuts.

Let’s say these chimps would benefit from using rocks that they can swing as hard and accurately as possible, but that they don’t immediately know what kind of rocks those would be. By trying different options and observing each other, they might accumulate knowledge of the best qualities in a nut-smashing rock. Eventually, though, they’d hit a limit in the power and precision available by swinging a rock with your fist.

How could they get past this upper limit? Well, they could tie a stick to their favorite rock; the extra leverage would help them smash the nuts even harder. As far as we know, though, chimpanzees aren’t capable of realizing the benefits of harnessing this additional quality. But we are – people invented hammers.

Crucially, discovering the power of leverage allows for more than just better nut-smashing. It opens up innovations in other domains. If adding handles to wielded objects allows for better nut-smashing, then why not better throwing, or cutting, or painting? The space of cultural possibilities, suddenly, has expanded.

Through open-ended cultural evolution, human beings produce open-endedness in culture. In this respect, our species is unparalleled.

What’s next?

Researchers have not yet answered most of the major questions about open-endedness: how to quantify it, how we create it, whether it has any true limitations.

But this new framework must shift the tides of a related debate: whether there is something obviously different about the way human minds work, other than social learning capacities. After all, every cultural trait emerges through interactions between minds – so how do our minds interact to produce such a degree of cultural breadth?

No one knows yet. Interestingly, this shifting debate over how cognition influences culture coincides with a spate of research bridging psychology and anthropology, which explores why certain behaviors – such as singing lullabies, curative bloodletting and storytelling – recur across human cultures.

Human minds produce unparalleled diversity in their cultures; yet it is also true that those cultures tend to express variations on a strict set of themes, such as music and marriage and religion. Ironically, the source of our open-endedness may illuminate not only what makes us so diverse, but also what makes us so often the same.</p></b>

                <p>The measles outbreak that started in Texas in late January continues to grow. As of March 18, 2025, confirmed cases in the outbreak, which now spans Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, reached 321, surpassing the number of confirmed cases recorded for all of the U.S. in 2024. The vast majority of cases are in people who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, a lack of clarity from health authorities is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated.

In a Q&A with The Conversation U.S., Daniel Pastula, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action.

Should adults get another shot of the measles vaccine?

The measles vaccine, which first became available in the U.S. in 1963, contains a live but significantly weakened strain of the measles virus. This modified strain is too weak to cause measles, but it is similar enough to the wild type measles virus to train the immune system to recognize it. Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know:

People born before 1957 are presumed to have lifelong immunity because measles was so contagious that almost everyone contracted it before age 15. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now.

Most people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot, though there are exceptions.

In 1989, a limited outbreak of measles occurred among vaccinated school children. In response, the recommendations changed from one dose of the live measles vaccine to two doses for children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year do not need any additional doses.

Exceptions to these guidelines

There are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold.

First, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years get one dose of the live vaccine at some point.

Second, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally recommend getting a second dose if you have only had one.

For most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts do not routinely recommend a second dose if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. If you have questions or concerns about your situation, make sure to ask your health care provider.

Except in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine.

Can you find out whether you’ve been vaccinated?

You might be able to! It’s worth checking. States actually keep vaccine records specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Your high school or college may still have your records, and so might your pediatrician’s office.

Should you get your antibody levels checked?

For most people, probably not.

A titer test checks the level of antibodies in your blood, and some people are asking their doctor to check their titers to determine whether they are still immune to measles. The problem is, the level of antibodies in your blood does not necessarily reflect your level of immunity. That’s because antibodies are just one part of your immune system’s infection-fighting force. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned.

Other crucial elements of your immune response include B cells, T cells and other immune cells, but a titer test does not show their capabilities. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. This is why antibody and titer tests should be used only in specific cases, in consultation with your doctor.

One example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. You would use a test to see whether you have measles antibodies. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative.

Is natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity?

Natural immunity – that is, the immunity you get after having measles – is effective. However, the downside is that natural infection with a wild virus is very risky. Before 1963, measles caused close to 50,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths each year in the United States, usually in children. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases.

The point of vaccines is to create immunity without the risks of severe infection. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. The immunity from a vaccine is effectively the same immunity you get from having measles itself – but vastly safer than encountering the wild virus unprotected. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles and two doses are 97% effective, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles.

Can the vaccine cause measles?

No, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has limited ability to infect and damage cells.

Some have claimed without evidence that the current outbreak in Texas was caused by the measles vaccine.

As part of the outbreak investigation, however, CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services analyzed the genome of the virus causing the current outbreak and identified it as a wild measles virus. Researchers classify measles virus strains based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes. They identified the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A.

What are the risks of the vaccine?

That is a very reasonable question. Because the measles vaccine is a live, weakened virus strain, it can cause a mild, measles-like syndrome. For example, some people might have a slight fever, a rash, or some slight joint pain. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. But the vaccine cannot cause measles itself, as it does not contain the wild measles virus.

In extremely rare cases, people can experience more significant reactions to the measles vaccine. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. According to all available evidence, however, comparing the potential benefits against potential risks reveals that the risks of a signficant reaction to the vaccine are much lower than the risks of severe outcomes from measles itself.

Being vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also protects vulnerable people in the community, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.</p></b>

                <p>In the early 1990s when I was a young pediatrician, I was responsible for evaluating children with developmental and learning problems. Two unrelated boys, ages 7 and 9, were found to have IQs in the range of 60-70, which indicates a severe cognitive disability.

During my medical review, the mothers revealed that their children were shaken violently as infants and that afterward behaved as if “the wind had been knocked out of them.” Both mothers reported shaking by a boyfriend or a father. No child was seen for medical care at the time.

At the same period of my career I was working with a renowned pediatrician who was studying shaken baby syndrome. The link between shaking and later cognitive impairment was not lost on me.

This scenario of shaken babies having neurological and developmental disabilities has played out over the past 30 years of my career as a child abuse pediatrician.

The high rates of death and disability

Shaken baby syndrome is a condition that can injure babies and young children, and in some cases lead to death.

A 2024 study on babies with shaken baby syndrome found that 20% to 25% of infants die, another 20% to 25% look normal on discharge from the hospital, and fully half are left with long-term disabilities. These include learning and behavioral problems that appear later in life.

The dangers of shaking babies have been recognized for over 50 years.

In the early 1970s, John Caffey, a pediatric radiologist, coined the term “Whiplash Shaken Infant Syndrome.” Caffey linked permanent brain damage and bleeding in the backs of the retina to violent shaking of infants. Caffey suggested a multipronged approach to prevention of this severe form of abuse that included educating and supporting young families, especially mothers. As primary caregivers, mothers are often most easily reached by the message, but the message of prevention can involve fathers, babysitters and any other caregivers.

Since Caffey’s original description, there have been tremendous advancements in the research behind shaking babies and infant head trauma. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that medical providers use the term “abusive head trauma” to include many actions other than shaking that can injure the brains of infants and children. The use of shaken baby syndrome is still recommended for public education and prevention, and health care providers and other experts also recommend the use of the term because it’s commonly recognized by the lay public and understood by parents.

How the brain is affected

What happens to the brain of an infant when they are shaken?

Infants – the most common population to be shaken – are small and have undeveloped neck muscles.

In these incidents, the infant is typically grabbed around the chest and shaken back and forth several times. Small blood vessels around the brain break and bleed, causing blood to flow around the brain. This condition is called a subdural hematoma. In some cases, similar forces occur in the back of the eye, and hemorrhages in the retina can occur.

In the most severe forms of shaking, the tissue of the brain itself is injured, and the child may experience unconsciousness or even stop breathing. Neck injuries occur when shaking causes injuries to ligaments and muscles that support the neck. Sometimes children have other injuries after being thrown down or impacted against something. Skull fractures or fractures of other bones, bruising and other injuries are often found.

A complex diagnosis

An infant or child must be diagnosed as having abusive head trauma by a team of pediatric specialists. Usually, a concerned parent or caregiver who may or may not know an infant has been injured becomes concerned that the child is not behaving normally. The child may have symptoms ranging from persistent vomiting to seizures or even seem unconscious.

The medical team begins addressing the child’s condition through blood testing and X-rays. Often a CT scan is performed in order to determine if there is a brain injury or some other abnormality. Bleeding around the brain is an indicator of trauma. However, other conditions can also cause this type of bleeding, including bleeding disorders, vitamin deficiency or genetic problems.

Carefully assessing a child for all of these possibilities may lead to discovery of other areas of trauma, such as broken bones and bruises. A child abuse physician is often called in to assist with the evaluation when trauma becomes a leading diagnosis. That trauma could be accidental, or it could be a sign that someone has abused or hurt an infant.

There are other medical conditions and even accidental injuries to a child that may resemble abusive head trauma. Experienced clinicians will evaluate a child carefully for these well-described conditions. Controversy about many of these conditions may exist in the courtroom, but in the medical setting it is often clear which conditions are present and when injuries are caused by trauma versus other medical conditions.

All 50 states and territories of the U.S. require that a report is made to child protective services agencies, with law enforcement often being involved when someone suspects or knows that a baby has been shaken.

Investigators and doctors work together along with parents and caregivers to try to determine what led to the infant or child’s condition. Bruising, fractures and retinal hemorrhages may support a diagnosis of child abuse, specifically shaken baby syndrome.

During an investigation, a rare accidental cause may be determined. The purpose is to make sure infants and children are not being harmed or that a medical condition is uncovered that can be treated.

As a pediatrician working in a children’s hospital and trauma center, it will never get easier for me to see infants and children with abusive injuries as well as other head traumas. The U.S. has come a long way in ensuring the safety of children through the use of car seats and many safety devices.

Education can help

Crying in infancy is a common trigger in cases where shaking occurs. Other risk factors include isolation, poverty, domestic violence and substance use. During severe economic downturns, the rate of shaken baby incidents rises, since research shows that social stressors often contribute.

Although anyone can injure a baby in a moment of frustration, most prevention research has focused specifically on helping parents understand why infants cry or become fussy. Recognizing your infant’s needs and addressing those needs is an important piece of learning how to parent. Studies have shown that focused education for new parents in maternity wards by nurses is effective.

If you or someone you know is concerned that a child or infant is being harmed in any way, each state has a process for reporting these concerns to appropriate authorities. Reporting can help prevent further harm to an infant and provide assistance to families.

The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer some helpful resources.</p></b>

                <p>Some of the United States’ most important historical documents, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Emancipation Proclamation, are housed in the U.S. National Archives. Beyond these high-profile items, it also preserves lesser-known but no less vital records, such as national park master plans, polar exploration documents and the records of all U.S. veterans. Together, these materials stand as a testament to the country’s commitment to preserving its history.

While these crucial documents in U.S. history now have a home in the National Archives, the road to establishing this institution was paved with catastrophic losses and bureaucratic inertia.

Creating the National Archives required decades of advocacy by historians, politicians and government officials. The National Archives was not simply an administrative convenience – it was a necessity born from repeated disasters that underscored the fragility of government records. And with President Donald Trump’s firing of the head archivist in February 2025, as well as the loss of several high-level archives staff members, the organization faces a new era of uncertainty.

Documentary heritage – the recorded memory of a nation that preserves its cultural, historical and legal legacy – is essential for a country as it safeguards its identity, informs its governance and ensures that future generations can understand and learn from the past.

I am a university archivist with two decades of experience in the library and archives field. I oversee the preservation and accessibility of historical records at Rochester Institute of Technology, advocate for inclusivity, and engage in national conversations on the evolving role of archives in the digital age.

Understanding the precarious nature of historical records, it’s clear to me that maintaining, staffing and funding the National Archives is a necessary safeguard against the destruction of the nation’s documentary heritage.

Destroyed by fire

The idea of preserving the government’s records dates back to the country’s founding. Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution and then secretary of Congress under the Articles of Confederation, recognized the need for proper storage of the Congress’ records.

But the young nation lacked the money and infrastructure to act. Many of the Continental Congress’ records were kept by Thomson himself for years, and while some were later transferred to the Department of State, others were lost.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, fires repeatedly ravaged federal records. Fires were very common in the 19th century due to a combination of highly flammable building materials, open frames used for lighting and heating, and the lack of modern fire safety measures such as sprinklers and fire-resistant construction.

In 1800, a blaze destroyed the War Department’s archives, a loss that severely hampered government operations. In 1810, Congress authorized better housing for government records, but the law was never fully executed. Instead, different parts of the government, from the Department of State to the Department of Treasury, continued maintaining their own records.

The Treasury Department suffered fires in 1801 and again in 1833, further erasing crucial financial records. The Patent Office, home to invaluable documentation of American innovation, burned in 1877, having already been damaged by an 1836 fire.

One of the most devastating losses occurred in 1921 when a fire at the Department of Commerce destroyed nearly all records from the 1890 federal census. This loss had far-reaching consequences, particularly for genealogical and demographic research.

Fires weren’t the only threat to the government’s records.

“It is a matter of common report that during the civil war, great quantities of documents stored in the Capitol were thrown away to make quarters for soldiers,” Historian and founding member of the American Historical Association J. Franklin Jameson noted in a 1911 Washington Post article.

“At a later date,” he added, “the archives of the House of Representatives were systematically looted for papers having a market value because of their autographs.”

Jameson spent decades lobbying Congress for a centralized repository. His persistence, coupled with the advocacy of key officials, laid the groundwork for future action.

These repeated disasters illuminated a glaring issue: The federal government lacked a centralized, protected repository to safeguard its records.

Finding a home

Momentum for a dedicated archives building gained traction in the late 19th century. In 1903, a bipartisan bill passed Congress giving the OK to purchase land in Washington, D.C., for a Hall of Records.

But the legislation didn’t lead to any action. Government records remained scattered, vulnerable and neglected. That same year, Congress authorized that any records not needed for daily business be transferred to the Library of Congress.

In 1912, President William H. Taft issued executive order 1499, aptly named Disposal of Useless Papers, requiring agencies to consult the librarian of Congress before disposing of documents.

This established a formal review process for government document disposal, but agencies still discarded records, often haphazardly, until stricter records management laws were enacted.

In 1926, Congress passed the Public Buildings Act, authorizing construction of an archives facility in Washington, D.C. Departing president Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone of the new building on Feb. 20, 1933. He then deposited facsimiles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, an American flag and daily newspapers from that day underneath the cornerstone.

Growth and standardization

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office two weeks later, was himself a meticulous record-keeper. He understood the importance of historical preservation. Roosevelt kept all of his personal and presidential records and books in a fire-safe space he built on his Hyde Park, New York, property, which he donated to the government after he died. This building and the materials inside became part of the National Archives as the first U.S. presidential library.

The National Archives, an independent agency, was officially established under Roosevelt in the 1934 National Archives Act. The head archivist was to be appointed by the president. The first archivist, Robert D.W. Connor, took office that year with a mandate to organize, preserve and make accessible the nation’s records.

Initially, the National Archives was simply a building – an impressive neoclassical structure in Washington, D.C., that opened in 1935. The very first records deposited there came from three World War I-era regulatory agencies – the U.S. Food Administration, the Sugar Equalization Board and the U.S. Grain Corporation.

Initially, the Archives lacked a formalized records management program. There were no clear guidelines on what to keep and what to discard, so agencies made their own decisions. This led to inconsistent preservation.

The creation of the first federal records administration program in 1941, together with the 1943 Records Disposal Act, codified things. These policies granted the National Archives authority to establish a structured approach to determining which records held historical value and should be preserved, while allowing for the responsible disposal of other documents.

A 1950 law gave the National Archives more power to decide what should be kept and what could be discarded, creating a more organized and accountable system for preserving the nation’s history.

As the volume of records increased and their formats changed, the archives adapted. By 2014, amendments to the Federal Records Act explicitly included electronic records, recognizing the shift toward digital documentation.

Ensuring accountability

Beyond mere storage, the National Archives plays a vital role in upholding democracy.

It ensures transparency by preserving government accountability, preventing manipulation or loss of records that could distort historical truth. The National Archives also provides public access to documents that shape civic awareness and historical knowledge, from the Declaration of Independence to declassified government files.

In an era of digital misinformation and contested narratives, the National Archives stands as a guardian of primary sources. Its existence reminds the nation that history is not a matter of convenience, but a cornerstone of informed governance.</p></b>

                <p>Black businesses were essential to facilitating the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South between the 1910s and 1960s. Yet, the traditional narrative of the migration as a movement of laborers seeking high-wage jobs obscures the history of African Americans who moved north or west seeking entrepreneurial opportunities.

This story is featured in my book, “Freedom Enterprise: Black Entrepreneurship and Racial Capitalism in Detroit,” which will be published April 8, 2025.

Between 1910 and 1970, more than 6 million African Americans left the South for destinations such as Detroit, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. This mass exodus had, and continues to have, enormous political, cultural and social implications for our nation. Migrants were seeking true freedom, including full political and economic citizenship – things they had not been able to achieve in the Jim Crow South.

As a historian of Black business, I wanted to know more about those who migrated to Detroit with the aim of working for themselves – as opposed to getting a job in Henry Ford’s auto factories.

The experiences and trajectories of these migrant entrepreneurs can tell us much about the possibilities for Black social and economic advancement through business in the United States.

Leaving the South

Pioneering African American historian Carter G. Woodson, father of Black History Month, pointed to the lack of business opportunities in describing the causes of the mass migration that began in the mid-1910s.

“In most parts of the South the Negroes are still unable to become landowners or successful business men,” Woodson wrote in 1918. “Conditions and customs have reserved these spheres for the whites.”

Of course, African Americans did establish businesses in the South, sometimes becoming quite wealthy. But there was always the threat of lynchings and other forms of racial violence for those who defied the racial caste system of Jim Crow. The destruction of “Black Wall Street” in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a well-known story. But there were many other incidents of white supremacist terrorism targeting Black businesses owners.

In fact, many Black entrepreneurs pointed out that the danger of racial violence was a deciding factor in their moving to Detroit. This included people such as Willis Eugene Smith, who established a funeral home, and Berry Gordy Sr., who operated a grocery store and contracting business in the city. In his 1979 memoir, “Movin’ Up: Pop Gordy Tells His Story,” Gordy told how he decided to leave Georgia for Detroit after local whites began pestering him about a large check he received as payment for goods he had sold. Gordy’s sister warned him: “You fool ’round here, they’re liable to beat us out of it, take all our money.”

Many African American entrepreneurs who participated in the Great Migration questioned whether they could experience enduring upward mobility through business if they stayed in the South.

As early as 1917, the director of the Detroit Urban League, Forrester B. Washington, reported “receiving many letters from [southern] Negro business men asking information regarding the real situation here.”

Migrant entrepreneurs’ services essential

Many of those Southern entrepreneurs decided to move north. Detroit’s African American population increased 611% between 1910 and 1920 to 40,838, making it home to one of the largest populations of African Americans in the country.

While Southern migrants saw Detroit as a promised land, segregation in the North was alive and well. There were many negative aspects to racial segregation, but it also created entrepreneurial opportunities, as Black newcomers needed the services of Black-owned businesses such as barbershops and hair salons, hotels and restaurants. These businesses sustained the growing African American community and made it feasible for Southern migrants to settle permanently in the city. By 1926, 85% of Detroit’s Black population were migrants, according to “The Negro in Detroit,” a report produced by the Detroit Bureau of Governmental Research.

Some businesses made their Southern roots explicit in their advertising. A 1933 advertisement for the Creole Hand Laundry, located at 542 Watson St., stated: “From New Orleans, La.”

Migrant entrepreneurs tapped into newly created niche markets, catering to the tastes of Southern transplants. For example, the Home Milling Company was established in Detroit around 1922 and processed hominy grits, cornmeal and whole wheat flour in a plant at Catherine and Russell streets. Home Milling’s managers had plans to expand the business in order to supply Black-owned bakeries in Detroit and satiate the tastes of newcomers.

“There is quite a large demand of the products on the part of Southern residents in the City and the concern is doing a fair volume of business,” stated the 1926 “The Negro in Detroit” report. “Their cornmeal is made from specially selected white corn out of deference to the palate of Southern Negroes who do not relish meal made from yellow corn.”

Supreme Linen and Laundry was another company that provided essential goods and services to Detroit’s growing number of Black-owned restaurants and hotels. Established by native Mississippians Fred and Callie Allen in 1929, the company supplied uniforms, tablecloths and napkins to businesses across the city and housed a commercial laundry.

A mecca for Black-owned business

By the 1940s, Detroit had earned the reputation of having more Black-owned businesses than any other city in the United States. This thriving business community comprised mainly Southern migrants.

Black business women, particularly those affiliated with the Detroit Housewives’ League, were instrumental in facilitating the growth of the Black-owned business community in the 1930s and 1940s. The league was established with the goal of boosting Black business in the city and grew to have over 10,000 members. The organization promoted Black businesses by hosting annual exhibitions, producing and distributing informational publications, and sponsoring educational programs for entrepreneurs and consumers.

Building a successful Black business community in Detroit in the first half of the 20th century was certainly not without obstacles. These included retail and residential segregation, lending discrimination and violence, among others. Yet, migrant entrepreneurs facilitated the migration to the city and transformed the landscape of Detroit.

In 1925, the city’s Black population was 85,000. That blossomed to 300,000 by 1950.

Detroit’s historic Black business community was concentrated in adjoining neighborhoods called Black Bottom and Paradise Valley.

Later, this area was targeted by urban planning initiatives, including freeway construction and urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, the success of this business community was cut short. State-sponsored redevelopment wiped out much of the wealth Black entrepreneurs hoped to pass down to their children, contributing to the racial wealth gap.

This destruction was a harsh blow to Southern migrant entrepreneurs who had relocated to Detroit seeking economic independence, upward mobility and other markers of freedom.

                <p>Like many other news organizations, The Associated Press maintains a “live updates” page, which posts the latest from the Trump administration in a ticker tape-like live scroll, with multiple updates per hour, 12 hours a day.

President Donald Trump has kept the ticker busy.

“Trump is moving with light speed and brute force to break the existing order and reshape America at home and abroad,” an Associated Press reporter wrote on Feb. 22, 2025.

Many Americans find the amount and pace of news exhausting, confusing and overwhelming.

“How do you push back against a tidal wave?” political communication expert Dannagal Young wrote of this media phenomenon on Feb. 21. “You can’t.”

I study the relationship between communication and democracy. I teach university classes on propaganda, presidential communication and the dark arts of communication, and I’m the author of an award-winning 2020 book on Trump’s communication strategies.

Deliberately overwhelming people with a flood of news content is a propaganda strategy used by authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin to distort reality and prevent people from clearly evaluating their government’s actions.

Trump communicates more than ‘The Great Communicator’

When Ronald Reagan’s first term as president began in 1981, several prominent political scientists noted in an analysis that a “week scarcely goes by without at least one major news story devoted to coverage of a radio or TV speech, an address to Congress, a speech to a convention, a press conference, a news release, or some other presidential utterance.”

It’s hard to believe that Reagan’s presidential communication only attracted one major news story per week, especially since he is often called “the Great Communicator.”

The 1980s had a slower, pre-digital news environment than that of the current day, to be sure. But Trump is also simply generating a lot more news content than Reagan did.

Today, Trump’s frequent press conferences, news releases, social media posts and other appearances and offhand remarks generate a constant flow of new stories and social media posts each day. The proliferation of cellphones and social media allows many people to follow the news throughout the day. People, in return, expect the president and other politicians to talk to the public constantly and often berate them when they fail to meet that expectation and go silent.

In fact, Trump is generating a lot more media content in his second term than he did in his first.

Trump’s intensified communication strategy

Reagan averaged about 5.8 news conferences per year. Trump averaged 22 per year in his first term, according to data collected by a nonpartisan group at the University of California Santa Barbara called the American Presidency Project. Former President Joe Biden averaged 9.25 per year.

Trump has already had 18 press gaggles or press conferences since taking office in January 2025.

A news analysis conducted by National Journal White House reporter George Condon showed that Trump has already answered more than 1,000 questions from reporters since he returned to office, which is nearly five times more questions than he answered at this point in his first presidency.

Trump has also made a lot of news by issuing almost 90 executive orders, which he has used both as a strategy for exercising executive power over issues like foreign aid and as a strategy for attracting media coverage.

Reagan issued 50 executive orders in his first year in office in 1981. Trump issued 72 executive orders within his first 30 days in 2025. That’s more executive orders than any previous president has issued in their first month over the last 40 years, including himself. He only issued 33 at this point in his first term in 2017.

Trump’s media strategy in his second term appears to intensify the approach he used in his first term. During Trump’s first term, according to The New York Times, “Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.”

As former Trump aide and current host of the show “War Room” Steve Bannon said in 2018, “The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.”

In 2025, in order to win the day’s news coverage, Trump is flooding the media with an unrelenting tidal wave of news content to dominate and vanquish the zone.

This strategy is evident in the Oval Office executive order signing events. Trump literally makes news by signing a large piece of paper in front of cameras and reporters. These events are carefully staged political theater for media consumption in which Trump casts himself as the nation’s hero protecting it from foreign invasions, diversity programs or paper straws.

Many of Trump’s executive orders are facing legal challenges, and some have been shot down by federal judges. Nonetheless, it is the spectacle of signing the orders that I, as a communications scholar, believe is designed to win the day – they are effective at generating news coverage and making Trump look powerful.

“Trump, as we know from this first month, is the most news-making person to occupy the Oval Office I’ve ever seen,” said New York Times Executive Editor Joe Kahn on Feb. 27.

A strategy of control

Media scholar Marshall McLuhan famously argued in 1964 that “The medium is the message.” Likewise, with Trump, the communication strategy is the message.

Communication is a tool. It can be used to promote democracy or to erode it. Any politician’s communication strategy reveals, at least in part, how they think about governing, power and democracy. Some political leaders communicate in ways that encourage people to ask questions and use their reason and critical thinking skills to evaluate public policies.

Other political leaders use communication in undemocratic ways to manipulate and coerce, preventing citizens from using their reason and critical thinking skills to evaluate policies.

What does Trump’s tidal wave of news content say about how he thinks about governing, power and democracy?

As a media and governing strategy, I think that creating an unrelenting tidal wave of content is designed to enable Trump to attract and keep the nation’s attention on himself and – in the process, drown out other voices.

This method overwhelms the media and exhausts many Americans who cannot easily absorb so much information at once.

And the tidal wave strategy prevents the public from scrutinizing the president’s actions – because no one can push back against a tidal wave.</p></b>

                <p>Social media is a complex environment that presents both opportunities and threats for adolescents, with self-expression and emotional support on the one hand and body-shaming, cyberbullying and addictive behaviors on the other. This complexity underscores the challenge to regulating teen social media use, but it also points to another avenue for protecting young people online: how social media platforms are designed.

The growing debate around teen social media use has intensified, with recent bipartisan policy efforts in the U.S., such as the Kids Online Safety Act, seeking to protect young people from digital harms. These efforts reflect legitimate concerns. However, broad restrictions on social media could also limit benefits for teens, throwing the baby out with the bath water.

I am a researcher who studies online safety and digital well-being. My recent work with colleagues in computer scientist Pamela Wisniewski’s Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab underscores a critical point: social media is neither inherently harmful nor entirely beneficial. It is a tool shaped by its design, how teens use it, and the context of their experiences.

In other words, social media’s impact is shaped by its affordances – how platforms are designed and what they enable users to do or constrain them from doing. Some features foster connection while others amplify harms.

As society moves toward practical solutions for online safety, it is important to use evidence-based research on how these features shape teens’ social media experiences and how they could be redesigned to be age appropriate for young people. It’s also important to incorporate teens’ perspectives to pinpoint what policies and design choices should be made to protect young people using social media.

My colleagues and I analyzed over 2,000 posts from teens ages 15-17 on an online peer-support platform. Teens openly discussed their experiences with popular social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok. Their voices highlight a potential path forward: focusing on safety by design – an approach that improves platform features to amplify benefits and mitigate harms. This approach respects young people’s agency while prioritizing their digital well-being.

What teens say about social media

While social media’s worst outcomes such as cyberbullying or mental health crises are often in the spotlight, our research shows that teens’ experiences are far more nuanced. Instead, platforms enable diverse outcomes depending on their features and design.

Teens commonly described negative experiences involving social drama, cyberbullying and privacy violations. For example, Instagram was a focal point for body-shaming and self-esteem issues, driven by its emphasis on curated visual content. Facebook triggered complaints about privacy violations, such as parents sharing private information without teens’ consent. Snapchat, meanwhile, exposed teens to risky interactions due to its ephemeral messaging, which fosters intimate but potentially unsafe connections.

At the same time, teens expressed that social media provides a space for support, inspiration and self-expression, particularly when offline spaces feel isolating. Teens used social media to cope with stress or seek out uplifting content.

Platforms such as Snapchat and WhatsApp were key spaces for seeking connection, enabling teens to build relationships and find emotional support. Snapchat, in particular, was the go-to platform for fostering close personal connections, while YouTube empowered teens to promote their creativity and identity by sharing videos.

Many praised Instagram and Snapchat for providing inspiration, distraction or emotional relief during stressful times. Teens also used social media to seek information, turning to YouTube and Twitter to learn new things, verify information or troubleshoot technical problems.

These findings underscore a critical insight: Platform design matters. Features such as algorithms, privacy controls and content-sharing mechanisms directly shape how teens experience social media. These findings further question the perception of social media as a purely negative force. Instead, teens’ experiences highlight its dual nature: a space for both risk and opportunity.

Key to safer social media

The concept of affordances – design and features – helps explain why teens’ experiences differ across platforms and provides a path toward safer design. For example, Instagram’s affordances such as image sharing and algorithmic content promotion amplify social comparison, leading to body-shaming and self-esteem issues. Snapchat’s affordances, such as ephemeral messaging and visibility of “best friends,” encourage personal connections but can foster risky interactions. Meanwhile, YouTube’s affordances, such as easy content creation and discovery, promote self-expression but can contribute to time-management struggles due to its endless scroll design.

By understanding these platform-specific designs and features, it is possible to mitigate risks without losing the benefits. For example, Facebook could allow for appropriate levels of parental oversight of teen accounts while preserving privacy. Instagram could reduce algorithmic promotion of harmful content. And Snapchat could improve safety features.

This safety by design approach moves beyond restricting access to focus on improving the platforms themselves. By thoughtfully redesigning social media features, tech companies can empower teens to use these tools safely and meaningfully. Policymakers can focus on holding social media companies responsible for their platforms’ impact, while simultaneously promoting the digital rights of teens to benefit from social media use.

Call for safety by design

It’s important for policymakers to recognize that social media’s risks and rewards coexist. Instead of viewing social media as a monolith, however, policymakers can target the features of social media platforms most likely to cause harm. For example, they could require platform companies to conduct safety audits or disclose algorithmic risks. These steps could encourage safer design without limiting access.

By addressing platform affordances and adopting safety by design, it is possible to create digital spaces that protect teens from harm while preserving the connection, creativity and support that social media enables. The tools to build a future where teens can thrive are already available; they just need to be designed better.

                <p>In mountain ranges around the world, glaciers are melting as global temperatures rise. Europe’s Alps and Pyrenees lost 40% of their glacier volume from 2000 to 2023. These and other icy regions have provided freshwater for people living downstream for centuries – almost 2 billion people rely on glaciers today. But as glaciers melt faster, they also pose potentially lethal risks.

Water from the melting ice often drains into depressions once occupied by the glacier, creating large lakes. Many of these expanding lakes are held in place by precarious ice dams or rock moraines deposited by the glacier over centuries.

Too much water behind these dams or a landslide into the lake can break the dam, sending huge volumes of water and debris sweeping down the mountain valleys, wiping out everything in the way.

These risks and the loss of freshwater supplies are some of the reasons the United Nations declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation and March 21 the first World Day for Glaciers. As an Earth scientist and a mountain geographer, we study the impact that ice loss can have on the stability of the surrounding mountain slopes and glacial lakes. We see several reasons for increasing concern.

Erupting ice dams and landslides

Most glacial lakes began forming over a century ago as a result of warming trends since the 1860s, but their abundance and rates of growth have risen rapidly since the 1960s.

Many people living in the Himalayas, Andes, Alps, Rocky Mountains, Iceland and Alaska have experienced glacial lake outburst floods of one type or another.

A glacial lake outburst flood in the Himalayas in October 2023 damaged more than 30 bridges and destroyed a 200-foot-high (60-meter) hydropower plant. Residents had little warning. By the time the disaster was over, more than 50 people had died.

Juneau, Alaska, has been hit by several flash floods in recent years from a glacial lake dammed by ice on an arm of Mendenhall Glacier. Those floods, including in 2024, were driven by a melting glacier that slowly filled a basin below it until the basin’s ice dam broke.

Avalanches, rockfalls and slope failures can also trigger glacial lake outburst floods. These are growing more common as frozen ground known as permafrost thaws, robbing mountain landscapes of the cryospheric glue that formerly held them together. These slides can create massive waves when they plummet into a lake. The waves can then rupture the ice dam or moraine, unleashing a flood of water, sediment and debris.

That dangerous mix can rush downstream at speeds of 20-60 mph (30-100 kph), destroying homes and anything else in its path.

The casualties of such an event can be staggering. In 1941, a huge wave caused by a snow and ice avalanche that fell into Laguna Palcacocha, a glacial lake in the Peruvian Andes, overtopped the moraine dam that had contained the lake for decades. The resulting flood destroyed one-third of the downstream city of Huaraz and killed between 1,800 and 5,000 people.

In the years since, the danger there has only increased. Laguna Palcacocha has grown to more than 14 times its size in 1941. At the same time, the population of Huaraz has risen to over 120,000 inhabitants. A glacial lake outburst flood today could threaten the lives of an estimated 35,000 people living in the water’s path.

Governments have responded to this widespread and growing threat by developing early warning systems and programs to identify potentially dangerous glacial lakes. Some governments have taken steps to lower water levels in the lakes or built flood diversion structures, such as walls of rock-filled wire cages, known as gabions, that divert floodwaters from villages, infrastructure or agricultural fields.

Where the risks can’t be managed, communities have been encouraged to use zoning that prohibits building in flood-prone areas. Public education has helped build awareness of the flood risk, but the disasters continue.

Flooding from inside and thawing permafrost

The dramatic nature of glacial lake outburst floods captures headlines, but those aren’t the only risks. As scientists expand their understanding of how the world’s icy regions interact with global warming, they are identifying a number of other phenomena that can lead to similarly disastrous events.

Englacial conduit floods, for instance, originate inside of glaciers, commonly those on steep slopes. Meltwater can collect inside massive systems of ice caves, or conduits. A sudden surge of water from one cave to another, perhaps triggered by the rapid drainage of a surface pond, can set off a chain reaction that bursts out of the ice as a full-fledged flood.

Thawing mountain permafrost can also trigger floods. This permanently frozen mass of rock, ice and soil has been a fixture at altitudes above 19,685 feet (6,000 meters) for millennia.

Freezing helps keep mountains together. But as permafrost thaws, even solid rock becomes less stable and is more prone to breaking, while ice and debris are more likely to become detached and turn into destructive and dangerous debris flows. Thawing permafrost has been increasingly implicated in glacial lake outburst floods because of these new sources of potential triggers.

In 2017, nearly a third of the solid rock face of Nepal’s 29,935-foot (6,374-meter) Saldim Peak collapsed and fell onto the Langmale glacier below. Heat generated by the friction of rock falling through air melted ice, creating a slurry of rock, debris and sediment that plummeted into Langmale glacial lake below, resulting in a massive flood.

These and other forms of glacier-related floods and hazards are being exacerbated by climate change.

Flows of ice and debris from high altitudes and the sudden appearance of meltwater ponds on a glacier’s surface are two more examples. Earthquakes can also trigger glacial lake outburst floods. Not only have thousands of lives been lost, but billions of dollars in hydropower facilities and other structures have also been destroyed.

A reminder of what’s at risk

The International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation and World Day for Glaciers are reminders of the risks and also of who is in harm’s way.

The global population depends on the cryosphere – the 10% of the Earth’s land surface that’s covered in ice. But as more glacial lakes form and expand, floods and other risks are rising. A study published in 2024 counted more than 110,000 glacial lakes around the world and determined 10 million people’s lives and homes are at risk from glacial lake outburst floods.

The U.N. is encouraging more research into these regions. It also declared 2025 to 2034 the “decade of action in cryospheric sciences.” Scientists on several continents will be working to understand the risks and find ways to help communities respond to and mitigate the dangers.</p></b>

                <p>Can you tell fact from fiction online? In a digital world, few questions are more important or more challenging.

For years, some commentators have called for K-12 teachers to take on fake news, media literacy, or online misinformation by doubling down on critical thinking. This push for schools to do a better job preparing young people to differentiate between low- and high-quality information often focuses on social studies classes.

As an education researcher and former high school history teacher, I know that there’s both good and bad news about combating misinformation in the classroom. History class can cultivate critical thinking – but only if teachers and schools understand what critical thinking really means.

Not just a ‘skill’

First, the bad news.

When people demand that schools teach critical thinking, it’s not always clear what they mean. Some might consider critical thinking a trait or capacity that teachers can encourage, like creativity or grit. They could believe that critical thinking is a mindset: a habit of being curious, skeptical and reflective. Or they might be referring to specific skills – for instance, that students should learn a set of steps to take to assess information online.

Unfortunately, cognitive science research has shown that critical thinking is not an abstract quality or practice that can be developed on its own. Cognitive scientists see critical thinking as a specific kind of reasoning that involves problem-solving and making sound judgments. It can be learned, but it relies on specific content knowledge and does not necessarily transfer between fields.

Early studies on chess players and physicists in the 1970s and ’80s helped show how the kind of flexible and reflective cognition often called critical thinking is really a product of expertise. Chess masters, for instance, do not start out with innate talent. In most cases, they gain expertise by hours of thoughtfully playing the game. This deliberate practice helps them recognize patterns and think in novel ways about chess. Chess masters’ critical thinking is a product of learning, not a precursor.

Because critical thinking develops in specific contexts, it does not necessarily transfer to other types of problem-solving. For example, chess advocates might hope the game improves players’ intelligence, and studies do suggest learning chess may help elementary students with the kind of pattern recognition they need for early math lessons. However, research has found that being a great chess player does not make people better at other kinds of complex critical thinking.

Historical thinking

Since context is key to critical thinking, learning to analyze information about current events likely requires knowledge about politics and history, as well as practice at scrutinizing sources. Fortunately, that is what social studies classes are for.

Social studies researchers often describe this kind of critical thinking as “historical thinking”: a way to evaluate evidence about the past and assess its reliability. My own research has shown that high school students can make relatively quick progress on some of the surface features of historical thinking, such as learning to check a text’s date and author. But the deep questioning involved in true historical thinking is much harder to learn.

Social studies classrooms can also build what researchers call “civic online reasoning.” Fact-checking is complex work. It is not enough to tell young people that they should be wary online, or to trust sites that end in “.org” instead of “.com.” Rather than learning general principles about online media, civic online reasoning teaches students specific skills for evaluating information about politics and social issues.

Still, learning to think like a historian does not necessarily prepare someone to be a skeptical news consumer. Indeed, a recent study found that professional historians performed worse than professional fact-checkers at identifying online misinformation. The misinformation tasks the historians struggled with focused on issues such as bullying or the minimum wage – areas where they possessed little expertise.

Powerful knowledge

That’s where background knowledge comes in – and the good news is that social studies can build it. All literacy relies on what readers already know. For people wading through political information and news, knowledge about history and civics is like a key in the ignition for their analytical skills.

Readers without much historical knowledge may miss clues that something isn’t right – signs that they need to scrutinize the source more closely. Political misinformation often weaponizes historical falsehoods, such as the debunked and recalled Christian nationalist book claiming that Thomas Jefferson did not believe in a separation of church and state, or claims that the nadir of African American life came during Reconstruction, not slavery. Those claims are extreme, but politicians and policymakers repeat them.

For someone who knows basic facts about American history, those claims won’t sit right. Background knowledge will trigger their skepticism and kick critical thinking into gear.

Past, present, future

For this reason, the best approach to media literacy will come through teaching that fosters concrete skills alongside historical knowledge. In short, the new knowledge crisis points to the importance of the traditional social studies classroom.

But it’s a tenuous moment for history education. The Bush- and Obama-era emphasis on math and English testing resulted in decreased instructional time in history classes, particularly in elementary and middle schools. In one 2005 study, 27% of schools reported reducing social studies time in favor of subjects on state exams.

Now, history teachers are feeling heat from politically motivated culture wars over education that target teaching about racism and LGBTQ+ issues and that ban books from libraries and classrooms. Two-thirds of instructors say that they’ve limited classroom discussions about social and political topics.

Attempts to limit students’ knowledge about the past imperil their chances of being able to think critically about new information. These attacks are not just assaults on the history of the country; they are attempts to control its future.</p></b>

                <p>Not long ago, high school students who wanted to play football, basketball or another sport had few options other than trying out for their school team. And it was to high school gymnasiums and fields that recruiters flocked to find talent for colleges and even the pros.

That’s changed in recent decades as private clubs have emerged and soared in popularity across the country. Today, kids interested in pretty much any sport often have multiple clubs and leagues to choose from instead of playing on their high school’s varsity squads. Clubs have been especially good at attracting the most talented student-athletes due to their intense and competitive nature.

As a result, parents are increasingly debating something that would have been unthinkable a couple of generations ago: Where should our kids play sports?

As a former K-12 director of athletics – and as a current parent of three youth athletes from elementary to the collegiate level – I know it can be a tough choice. I’ve seen firsthand the pros and cons of playing sports both in high school and clubs.

While clubs may be best for the most talented athletes, I believe schools can’t be beat for the broader focus they can put on character development. Since the vast majority of student-athletes won’t play in organized leagues beyond high school, that’s where I believe the schools’ focus should be.

My own unpublished research shows it’s also a way – along with emphasizing the fun and social aspects of athletics – to get more students who played sports as young kids to continue in high school.

The rise of the private youth sports industry

Although I am an unapologetic advocate for school-based athletics, I recognize the benefits that come along with participation in club or private-league programs.

But prior to the 1980s, private clubs weren’t common. Before high school, kids played on teams organized by their schools, local parks and recreation programs or nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA. After that, the only option for most was high school sports.

The first big step toward highly organized, privatized youth sports programs occurred during what has been referred to as “the Reagan revolution,” according to research I did for my dissertation. President Ronald Reagan’s funding cuts across the government pushed more expenses onto states and cities, which limited the ability of local parks and recreation departments to fully staff youth programs. This left many of them with only enough funds to maintain their facilities.

At the same time, school districts began systematically reducing the number of physical education classes offered in lieu of an increased focus on subjects such as math and science. Those two factors took away the most affordable options for athletic participation for many families.

With the reduction of public offerings, the youth sports programming gap was filled by private clubs and leagues, which placed more emphasis on athleticism, competition and sometimes elite-style training. And it’s become big business for the adults who run these programs.

While good numbers on these leagues are hard to come by, multiple data sources show the privatized youth sports market has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. A recent estimate put total spending on youth sports at over US$40 billion as of 2024, compared with the $10 billion estimate of the youth sports economy in 2010.

But despite their growth, one sobering statistic for aspiring elite athletes remains true: Only about 7% of teenagers who play organized sports will advance to the collegiate level or beyond.

Knowing that 93% of high school athletes will end their competitive careers at graduation, I believe it’s important that school administrators place a premium on running athletic programs that focus on building skills they’ll need as adults instead of just winning games.

Why most students play

My own research backs this up.

In my previous role as a director of athletics for public schools in Grand Forks, North Dakota, I routinely surveyed our athletes at the end of their seasons about various aspects of their experience on the team. Among those questions, I asked athletes to tell me the three most important reasons they chose to play that sport for that season and whether they were planning to play on the team again next year.

Unsurprisingly to me, the top three reasons were consistently to have fun, spend time with friends and stay physically active, in that order. You’ll notice winning games or for competition were not among them.

On the flip side, when asked why students chose to drop out the following year, the top reason was their relationship with the coach, while a close second was that they were not having fun. To me, this was evidence that what student-athletes most wanted from their high school programs wasn’t so much sport skills development as personal development and growth.

Other studies back this up. Overtraining and a lack of fun are cited as the main reasons why 70% of young athletes who compete on a team stop playing before they even reach high school.

Focus on the fun – not the competition

Here are five things school administrators can do to help turn things around and make their sports programs more attractive to students considering clubs, as well as those who are pondering giving up on sports altogether.

Develop an athletic program that teaches character traits and life skills that are usable for 100% of participants, not just the 7% who go on to play in college. Make sure programs emphasize fun, social growth and physical fitness, rather than just the competition. Encourage coaches to spend individual time throughout the season with each student-athlete to discuss the athlete’s goals, role and progress. Survey student-athletes about their experience at the end of each season and tweak the program accordingly. Include student-athlete assessments about how much they enjoy playing for the coach as a part of the coach’s postseason evaluation.

High school sports may not be for everybody, but I believe many more students would choose to participate if the focus were on building character and having fun with friends, not winning trophies.</p></b>

                <p>The Taara chip is about the size of a fingernail, according to X.

Google X has revealed the Taara chip, the latest development in its quest to harness the power of light for inexpensive, cable-free, high-speed internet.

This "fingernail-sized" chip uses software-controlled light emitters to steer data-encoded light beams between two points. In tests, researchers successfully transmitted data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) over 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) outdoors using two Taara chips.

"We believe this is the first time silicon photonics chips have transmitted such high-capacity data outdoors at this distance," Mahesh Krishnaswamy, the general manager of Taara, said in a statement .

The researchers at X, which is Google's research and development arm, hope Taara can deliver fiber-like internet speeds to regions that are difficult to access with traditional fiber-optic cables. These traditional cables are typically buried deep underground, making them impractical for remote areas or challenging terrains, such as mountains and forests. This, however, isn't a problem for Taara.

Similarly, because the light frequencies Taara uses don't overlap with radio frequency bands like 5G, Taara doesn't have to contend with other signals taking up bandwidth.

He added that the goal was to make high-speed connectivity cheaper and easier to deploy by reducing the size and cost of the infrastructure, specifically by creating a mesh network of multiple Taara devices connected together.

These devices could then exchange data directly, providing high-speed, easily-scalable coverage wherever Taara nodes exist.

"Using chips deployed in a global mesh network, we see opportunities to bring high-speed internet to underserved regions, rethink the way data centers are built and operated, enable faster, create safer communication for autonomous vehicles, and so much more."

Data beamed at light speed

Fiber-optic cables contain tiny plastic or glass strands that transmit data as pulses of light. These are extremely effective at carrying high-speed data over long distances — far more so than older, copper-based cables, which carry data as slower electrical signals that are more prone to interference.

Taara also sends data as optical signals; however, it avoids the need for underground cables and networks that require physical maintenance. This means it can be installed "in hours instead of the days, months, or even years it can take to lay fiber," Krishnaswamy said.

The Taara chip is actually a newer, smaller version of an existing Google X invention called Taara Lightbridge, which is about the size of a traffic light.

Lightbridge featured a physical housing and mechanisms consisting of "mirrors, sensors, precision optics, and smart software" to align light beams to where they need to be. When two beams lock onto each other, they create a secure link capable of transmitting data up to speeds of 20 Gbps up to distances of 12.4 miles (20 km).

Krishnaswamy said the Taara chip will be available in 2026 in X's next product — which the company has not disclosed. In the meantime, Google's research arm has invited researchers and tinkerers to get in touch to explore potential applications.</p></b>

                <p>When it comes to speech, parrots have the gift of gab. And the way the brains of small parrots known as budgerigars bestow this gift is remarkably similar to human speech, researchers report March 19 in Nature.

So far, budgerigars are the only animals known to have language-producing centers akin to those in humans, says Michael Long, a neuroscientist at New York University Langone Health. This “is really the first nonhuman animal in which that has been shown.” Understanding how speech gets created in budgies’ brains could help clarify what goes wrong in certain communication disorders in people.

Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) are tropical-colored, smart cutie pies. Beyond their looks, these parrots are particularly social and chatty, making them interesting research subjects for language studies.

Long and his Langone Health colleague Zetian Yang tracked the behavior of individual nerve cells in four of these birds’ brains as they produced their chirrups. The activity of these cells, nestled in a part of the brain called the anterior arcopallium, is tied to the sounds the birds make, the duo found.

The organization of these neurons’ activity, it turns out, is pretty simple, Long says. He compares this neural organization to a keyboard that can produce a range of sounds — consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A budgie “is able to generate arbitrary sounds in its universe by just playing this vocal keyboard,” Long says. Overall, this flexible system has a humanlike organization.

The similarities between human and parrot brains may reflect two species solving a problem in a similar way, neurally speaking. These parallels could be “a very tidy example of convergent evolution, where you have humans that have developed this kind of neural mechanism for speech, and these parrots have developed a kind of similar mechanism,” Long says.

Now that scientists know more about how budgie brains help the birds talk, another question dogs Long: What are these parrots talking about?

“We are trying now to translate budgie,” he says, using advanced machine learning to determine what each warble and chirp means. Perhaps their language itself — not just the way their brain creates it — is similar to that of people. With these kinds of experiments, Long says, “maybe we can start to reexamine the notions of human exceptionalism.”</p></b>

                <p>ANAHEIM, Calif. — The wreckage of some of the universe's most violent explosions has crept closer than you might think; in fact, you may have taken a swim in it during your last dip in the ocean.

By analyzing samples from the deep sea, researchers have found a unique variety of radioactive plutonium that appears to be debris from a rare breed of cosmic explosion called a kilonova, which likely detonated near Earth some 10 million years ago. But proving this explosion's existence will require more evidence, and the researchers think they know where to find it: on the surface of the moon .

"We live in a supernova graveyard," Brian Fields , an astronomer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a March 17 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society Global Physics Summit. "[Supernovas make] tiny specks of rocks that can literally rain upon the Earth. They'll accumulate in the depths of the ocean, and they'll also hang onto the moon."

Fields has theorized about this cosmic rubble since the 1990s. But it wasn't until 2004 that researchers started sifting out supernova remnants from ocean samples. They found traces of a radioactive version of iron that doesn't occur naturally on Earth and can only be explained by a nearby supernova sometime in Earth's recent history.

In the following years, about a dozen more samples from both the ocean and the moon painted a more detailed picture of this explosive history. Fields and his colleagues' refined theories pointed to two separate supernova events that occurred 3 million and 8 million years ago. "This is direct observational evidence that supernovas are radioactivity factories," Fields said.

A cosmic cocktail

The plot thickened in 2021, when researchers discovered an even rarer substance sprinkled in with those same samples: a radioactive isotope of plutonium. This finding required an origin story even more unusual than the violent star deaths that birth supernovas.

The plutonium variant the researchers found is thought to come from kilonovas — eruptions that occur as two binary neutron stars spiral toward each other in a cataclysmic collision. Kilonovas are also factories for some of our planet's rarest elements, like gold and platinum, and astronomers have long tried to unravel the mechanics of this class of explosion.

Now, Fields and his colleagues suspect that a separate kilonova event predated those two previously identified supernovas, erupting at least 10 million years ago. These different explosions formed a sort of radioactive cocktail, embedding a hybrid iron and plutonium signature in the samples.

"We had a kilonova that made plutonium — like it loves to do — and blasted it all over the place," Fields said. "Then, with the stirring of material by a supernova, it got all mixed up, and some of that fell to Earth."

But Fields and his team still want to run more tests to bolster their theory. With renewed efforts like the Artemis missions to return humans to the moon , the researchers are optimistic that the lunar samples they hope to analyze won't be in such short supply.

"Right now, our lunar soil is so precious because it's all we've got," Fields told Live Science. "The hope is, eventually, we'll be taking routine trips to the moon, so it's no big deal — sampling a kilogram won't sound like a lot to people."

With more soil, Fields and his colleagues hope to verify that this kilonova indeed happened, as well as pinpoint when and where it occurred. Because of its simpler geology, the moon should provide a clearer snapshot of exactly how the cosmic debris landed there.

"On Earth, things sink to the bottom of the ocean, and you have to worry about currents and the atmosphere," Fields told Live Science. "But the moon is awesome because when stuff lands, it just lands."

With the next phase of the Artemis mission not set to launch until at least next year, Fields and his team are still a ways away from formally requesting access to this hot commodity. But in the meantime, they're convincing the scientific community that the research is a worthwhile investment.

"We're writing papers to prove to the Artemis community that this is something to seriously think about," Fields said. "The samples are coming back anyway. We just want to piggyback off of it."

                <p>Researchers have unveiled the most detailed map of Antarctica's bedrock yet.

Scientists have unveiled the most detailed map yet of the landscape hidden beneath Antarctica's ice.

The high-resolution map reveals what the frozen continent looks like beneath its miles-thick blanket of ice and snow, and will help researchers predict how Antarctica might evolve in a fast-warming climate.

"Imagine pouring syrup over a rock cake [or a chocolate chip cookie, if that's more familiar to you] — all the lumps, all the bumps, will determine where the syrup goes and how fast," Hamish Pritchard , a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the lead author of a new study outlining the research, said in a statement .

The same process will occur in Antarctica if a significant amount of the ice sheet melts, Pritchard said. "Some ridges will hold up the flowing ice; the hollows and smooth bits are where that ice could accelerate," he said.

Bedmap3 builds on two previous studies that digitally stripped Antarctica of its ice. The new map incorporates all of the data used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2 — including measurements gathered by planes, satellites, ships and even dog-drawn sleds. But the team also sourced an extra 52 million data points to refine these previous results, according to the study, published March 10 in the journal Scientific Data .

In total, more than six decades' worth of data was compiled to construct Bedmap3, the researchers said in the statement. "This is the fundamental information that underpins the computer models we use to investigate how the ice will flow across the continent as temperatures rise," Pritchard said.

The new map is color coded to show the height of Antarctica's bedrock above sea level, highlighting the continent's tallest mountains and deepest valleys. The topography is revealed in the finest detail yet, providing new insight into understudied areas, including around the South Pole, according to the statement.

The researchers used radar, seismic and gravity measurements to map the bedrock and estimate the thickness of the ice sheet above it. Against their expectations, they found that the place with the thickest ice in Antarctica is an unnamed canyon in Wilkes Land, a district in the east of the continent.

Previous surveys placed Antarctica's thickest ice in the Astrolabe Basin in Adélie Land. The difference in ice thickness between the two areas is small: The Astrolabe Basin has a thickness of around 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers) , while Wilkes Land is almost 3 miles (4.8 km) thick, according to the study.

The new research also reveals, in unprecedented detail, the shape of the ice sheet and ice shelves that float around the fringes of the continent.

"In general, it's become clear the Antarctic Ice Sheet is thicker than we originally realized and has a larger volume of ice that is grounded on a rock bed sitting below sea level," study co-author Peter Fretwell , a mapping specialist and geographic information officer at the BAS, said in the statement.

Although thickness in itself is not a problem, the fact that much of the ice sits below sea level is concerning, because relatively warm seawater can flood into the ice sheet, Fretwell said. "This puts the ice at greater risk of melting," he added.

"What Bedmap3 is showing us is that we have got a slightly more vulnerable Antarctica than we previously thought," Fretwell added.

                <p>A teen woke up from surgery and could speak only English, his second language.

The patient: A 17-year-old boy in the Netherlands

The symptoms: The teenager was admitted to a hospital in the Netherlands for knee surgery after getting injured while playing soccer. The surgery was successful, but when the patient woke up from the anesthesia , he spoke exclusively in English and insisted "repeatedly" that he was in the U.S. Prior to this incident, he spoke the language only during English class in school.

He did not recognize his parents and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. According to a report doctors wrote about his case , the patient had no history of psychiatric symptoms and no relevant medical family history, apart from some instances of depression on his mother's side of the family.

What happened next: The nurse who initially noticed the patient speaking English was not immediately worried by it, thinking the teen was experiencing emergence delirium — a state of confusion that can occur during recovery from anesthesia. However, when medical staff still could not get the patient to speak a single word of Dutch a few hours later, they called for a psychiatric consultation.

Related: Can you forget your native language?

The psychiatric team found the patient relaxed and attentive. He was able to answer questions, albeit in English spoken with a Dutch accent. Later on, he started to give short answers in Dutch but found it difficult to do so.

The diagnosis: The 17-year-old was diagnosed with foreign language syndrome (FLS), which happens when patients suddenly and involuntarily switch to using a second language instead of their native language for a period of time.

The treatment: A neurologist found no abnormalities during a full neurological examination of the patient. Then, 18 hours after his surgery, the teen was able to understand Dutch but still couldn't speak it. Some of the teen's friends came to visit him the day after his surgery, and suddenly, he was able to understand and speak Dutch again.

Because the teen spontaneously started speaking in his native language again, doctors saw no need to run any neuropsychological tests, electroencephalograms (EEG) or other types of brain scans on him. He was discharged three days post-surgery.

What makes the case unique: FLS is rare, with only about nine cases described in medical literature. In most of these cases, the patient was a white male who switched from their native language to another one they had learned later in life; the patients weren't typically bilingual growing up. The race of the patients in two cases was not documented.

The authors of the case report said FLS is rarely seen in children, and they suspected that they were the first to formally document a case of FLS in an adolescent. In total, they found eight reported cases of FLS that were similar to that of their patient, in which the person affected switched to a completely different language rather than speaking in a way that could be perceived as a foreign accent.

This is what happens in a related condition — called foreign accent syndrome — in which people adopt a speech pattern that makes it sound like they're speaking with an accent. The rare condition has often, but not always, been seen in the context of brain injuries.

Exactly why FLS happens is unknown, although there have been other cases in which the syndrome emerges after anesthesia . The case report authors noted that an anesthetic's effects on cognition, as well as the clearance of anesthetic drugs from the central nervous system, can lead to emergence delirium. For that reason, they're not sure if FLS can be classified as a distinct condition or merely a variation of emergence delirium.</p></b>

                <p>The nearest single star to the sun, Barnard’s star, has a brood of planets all its own. The red dwarf star, about six light-years from Earth, hosts four close-in planets each about two to three times the mass of Mars, astronomers report in the March 20 Astrophysical Journal Letters.

“Barnard’s star has a long history of claimed detections, but none of them could be confirmed for a long time,” says astronomer Ritvik Basant of the University of Chicago. “It’s pretty exciting to know what’s orbiting the nearest stars.”

From 2021 to 2023, Basant and his colleagues observed Barnard’s star 112 times using the MAROON-X spectrograph on the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. “I was starting to see these signals in the dataset,” Basant says. But because he was still calibrating the instrument, “we ignored it for that time.”

Then last October, a team using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a telescope in Chile reported evidence of one planet orbiting Barnard’s star, dubbed simply b, and hints of three others — designated c, d and e. With these hints in mind, Basant and colleagues reexamined their data, confirming three of the planets.



“I am very happy to see that new MAROON-X data provide an independent confirmation of the planet b and candidates c and d,” says astrophysicist Jonay González Hernández of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain, who led the ESPRESSO team. “Together with the ESPRESSO data, the analysis makes the detection significantly more robust.”



Combining the MAROON-X and ESPRESSO data also confirmed the existence of planet e.

All four planets are so close to Barnard’s star, which has about one-seventh the mass of the sun, that they orbit it in less than a week. That means they’re too hot to be habitable, Basant says. In fact, the new observations probably rule out the presence of any habitable-zone planets.

Both studies employed the radial velocity method, which detects changes in the light from Barnard’s star caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planets. This technique was responsible for finding the first known exoplanet in 1995 and has since identified hundreds of planets.

But all those planets were more massive than Earth. Thanks to larger telescopes and improved control over temperature and pressure variations in the instruments, the MAROON-X and ESPRESSO teams successfully detected much smaller planets. The four planets range from at least 0.19 to 0.34 times the mass of Earth, Basant and his colleagues found.

“Previous instruments were not that great at finding sub-Earth mass planets,” Basant says. “This is a big technological break. And a glimpse of what these next generation instruments can do.”</p></b>

Nor did he normally encounter the austere landscape now surrounding him — fjords, ice, lunar-like rock piles, snow-studded mountains bearing down on the sea.

Stryker, the chief of outreach and collaboration for the United States Geological Survey’s national land imaging program, had flown to one of the globe’s northernmost settlements to see the ground station where where data from USGS satellites lands on Earth: a herd of more than 150 antennas together called SvalSat.

Norway may not be the first country that comes to mind when thinking of the space industry. But it has quietly supported satellites almost since satellites were invented and has become a ground-station powerhouse. SvalSat, for instance, boasts more antennas than any other commercial station on Earth.

Atop the Platåberget plateau, the antennas are regularly spaced and ensconced in radomes — spherical coverings that protect them from the inhospitable environment that attacks their technology just as forthrightly as a polar bear might. Stryker likens SvalSat to a giant’s putting green; the satellites appear like colossal golf balls resting atop a rocky, and often snowy, surface.

Stryker and his colleague Ryan Brown were on the island to attend an international gathering focused on ground station operations at SvalSat. SvalSat’s users span the globe and represent myriad time zones, languages, and national agencies; gathering to talk about the nitty-gritty of satellite operations helps smooth the station’s operations. “There’s really no substitute for regular in-person interactions,” said Stryker.

Polar ground stations like this one are the only spots where satellites in certain orbits can downlink their data and receive commands on every trip around Earth. U.S. science, weather forecasting, and defense sectors all — through the happenstance of geography and history — rely on satellite infrastructure located in Norway. That includes agencies like NASA, the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, and the USGS, which download climatic, geological, atmospheric, and other information to Svalbard so they can monitor and predict the state of Earth and beyond. SvalSat, because of a treaty governing relations on Svalbard, doesn’t work directly with military satellites. But other places in northern Norway do — and there, similar but smaller stations exist, chattering with spacecraft that do military communications or missile warning.

But there’s just one problem: Norway is in the middle of some hot geopolitical dynamics. For one, it shares a small land border with Russia, and tensions between the two countries have markedly increased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Surveillance and espionage are also on the rise. Meanwhile, melting Arctic ice makes the polar region more accessible for resource extraction, in turn making it vulnerable to territorial disputes.

Norwegian and NATO officials are worried about conflict. And the satellite sector is mindful about how those icy relations might affect some of the world’s most important data.

Work like that of the USGS, which involves peering down at Earth to get the big picture on its conditions, requires international effort. “It’s not limited to national boundaries,” Stryker said. “It’s really a global activity.”

Without ground stations like Svalbard’s, satellites are just “space junk,” said Rolf Skatteboe, CEO and president of Kongsberg Satellite Services, or KSAT, the company that runs SvalSat and is one of the world’s largest purveyors of satellite ground stations. Such stations allow operators to send commands to satellites, fix problems with their operations, and download data for further analysis.

Ground-station work in Norway began in the early 1960s, less than a decade after the world’s first satellite launched. Soon, there were initial stations on Svalbard and in Tromsø, a Norwegian city south of Svalbard, across the Norwegian and Barents Seas.

The far-northern locations were ideal for connecting with satellites that orbit from pole to pole. Ground stations there could communicate with the satellites every time they neared the North Pole to complete a planetary lap. And the relatively mild weather — by Arctic standards — made upkeep simpler than it would have been in other polar locations, like Greenland or Alaska, or even the Antarctic. (Ground stations now also exist in those locations, but Norway’s infrastructure remains significant.)

Those features, and Norway’s ground-floor expertise in ground stations, led to a big deal with NASA in the 1990s: The space agency was working on a program called “Mission to Planet Earth,” to use satellites to learn more about the world. As part of that, NASA was planning to launch Landsat 7, the seventh in a series of imaging satellites to help scientists track how land and sea look over time. Since its inception in 1972, the Landsat program has produced a rich archive of the planet’s aging surface, showing, for instance, how fisheries are faring, where wildfires chew a mountain, and when glaciers shrink.

But to get any of that archive down from space and into computers, where scientists could make sense of it, NASA — which runs Landsat with USGS — needed ground stations. And for its Earth-observation ambitions, the agency knew it needed more coverage than its own Alaska-based station could provide. So, the Norwegian Space Agency suggested they invest in Svalbard. And around 1996, NASA shipped an antenna, equipment, and a trailer-office to the Arctic archipelago.

Norwegian Space Agency employees shortly transferred from Tromsø to Svalbard, working out of NASA’s trailer to prepare the ground station. It wasn’t entirely snowproof, and it had A/C — but no heater. “They felt they were polar explorers for a while,” said Skatteboe.

In 1999, Landsat 7 made it to space and flew over the Svalbard antenna. “They serviced our first pass,” said Brown, who is today’s Landsat ground network manager.

With this initial collaboration, Svalbard was on its way to becoming “the world’s greatest, largest, biggest, nicest, coolest ground station,” as Skatteboe described it. Norway soon built its own antennas and sold ground capabilities as a service, allowing NASA to focus on exploring space.

Without ground stations like Svalbard’s, satellites are just “space junk.”

While data initially had to be shipped out on physical tape, the island was linked to mainland Norway via an undersea data cable in the early 2000s — fiber that, along with a second cable, now transfers satellite info to the continent and provides internet to the island chain. In 2002, the Norwegian Space Agency split KSAT off as a separate entity — a commercial company half-owned by the state corporation Space Norway and half-owned by the commercial Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace, completely dedicated to satellite ground stations.

Antennas on Svalbard have been servicing Landsat passes since those early days, downlinking data from those and other NASA missions for a quarter-century. “There’s a tremendous amount of science data that we pull down through there, and that informs us of what’s going on in the Earth,” said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program.

Norway’s sustained interest in ground stations wasn’t just about helping NASA: The country had its own desires. It was fortuitous that NASA, which Skatteboe called a “partner in crime,” wanted infrastructure that would also benefit Norway. “It’s needed to monitor — not necessarily control, but to monitor — Norwegian areas of interest,” he said.

Those areas of interest include the waters around Norway, which the country wants to watch for pollution, oil spills, foreign ships, ice movement, and suspicious activity. For instance, officials track Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, which ships sanctioned goods internationally using ownership records that obscure its origins. These officials are concerned, in part, that the ships may damage undersea infrastructure — like the data cables crisscrossing the ocean floor; last December, Finnish authorities accused the fleet of severing a cable in the Baltic Sea.

“These days,” said Skatteboe, “it isn’t a secret that the geopolitical situation asks for a close monitoring of the waters.”

In recent years, SvalSat has continued to grow, and its antennas speak a standard language to ease communications with more satellites. The giants now have more than 150 golf balls to putt, and the U.S. — alongside numerous government entities like the European Space Agency, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, and private companies like communications giant Iridium — depends on them for scientific research and weather forecasting.

For instance, a new NASA mission, to launch this March, will use radar to monitor dynamic, and often catastrophic, processes like earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, landslides, and ice-sheet collapse. Another maps how phytoplankton are strewn across the ocean and aerosols puffed throughout the atmosphere. Both will communicate with SvalSat and other ground stations.

NOAA, meanwhile, uses SvalSat to talk to three satellites that form the backbone of American weather forecasting — spacecraft that Tim Walsh, director of the Office of Low Earth Orbit Observations at NOAA, are among the agency’s “workhorses.” The satellites’ observations of atmospheric temperature, moisture, energy transfer, ozone, and more help predict fair and foul weather. Approximately every hour and a half, each satellite passes over Svalbard, and “all that data goes immediately to NOAA,” said Walsh.

The agency’s planned Near Earth Orbit Network, a set of next-generation weather satellites set to start launching in the next decade, will work similarly. NOAA satellites supply data to the National Weather Service, the Department of Defense, and private companies. Layoffs and cuts from the new presidential administration have hit NASA, the USGS, and NOAA in recent weeks, with the full effects to present and future satellite missions still unclear.

But SvalSat can’t do the legwork for all satellites — specifically, ones operated by militaries. Working with defense organizations goes against the spirit of the Svalbard Treaty, an agreement signed in 1920 that gives Norway sovereignty over the archipelago but allows people from other national signatories to live and work as full residents without visas. The treaty also imposed environmental conservation guidelines and restrictions on warlike activity. “You’re not supposed to have military fortifications or create the bases on the island,” said Skatteboe.

Norway, he continued, interprets the treaty strictly, meaning that Svalbard stations don’t communicate with satellites directly engaged in military activity.

But today, satellite imagery and data are so ubiquitous in defense operations that almost any Earth-observation data can be useful militarily — even if it’s not explicitly collected for that purpose. Norwegian journalist Bård Wormdal points out, for instance, that during the Iraq War, the U.S. military used satellite-borne information about sandstorm forecasts, downlinked on Svalbard, to inform their operations. The details about those blowing particles weren’t inherently military-oriented — it was simply public data about sand — but Wormdal, who worked for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation for more than three decades and wrote about satellite data’s role in international conflict in the book “The Satellite War,” sees it as a treaty violation for Norway nonetheless. Russian officials have lodged similar accusations.

Skatteboe doesn’t dispute the facts — yes, scientific and commercial data collected on Svalbard may play a role in military planning. “All the satellite-based information that comes to us is dual-use,” he said, meaning it could help someone in the civilian sector, and someone in a situation room. (Norway’s current regulation, as written, allows some room for interpretation: It prohibits using a ground station to send or download data from a satellite that is used “specifically for military purposes.” It also prohibits any downloaded data either solely or primarily be used for military purposes.)

But Skatteboe does dispute the idea behind Wormdal’s legal interpretation. “If the military will have it, they get it,” he said. But they get it like anyone else would — through a free and open platform, or for cash.

Still, Wormdal argues that military utility can make Svalbard a target for attack. And indeed, an article in The RUSI Journal called Svalbard NATO’s “Achilles’ Heel.” Meanwhile, think tanks like the Center for Strategic and International Studies have examined how conflict with Russia might play out on the archipelago.

Svalbard is home to hundreds of Russian citizens, alongside people from Thailand, Sweden, the Philippines, and Ukraine, among others; 61 percent of the approximately 3,000 people on the island are Norwegian. In 2023, some Russian residents held a military-style parade in two Svalbard settlements. Led by a black Toyota Land Cruiser, followed by trucks, tractors, and snowmobiles conducted by men in Army green, the parade also featured an Mi-8 helicopter — and this after a “navy parade” in the waters the previous year.

Today, satellite imagery and data are so ubiquitous in defense operations that almost any Earth-observation data can be useful militarily — even if it’s not explicitly collected for that purpose.

In 2023, a group led by a prominent Russian bishop also erected a more-than-20-foot-tall Orthodox cross, accessorized with a ribbon indicating support for the war in Ukraine, on a Svalbard hillside near the Soviet ghost town of Pyramiden. The display, to commemorate the Russians who discovered Svalbard, violated a local environmental and cultural protection act which prohibits activities that may damage either the natural environment or the cultural heritage of designated areas on the island.

Russian officials have also questioned Norway’s sovereignty over the island. In May 2024, the Norwegian government presented a report that committed the country to strengthening national control and building up a Norwegian presence on the archipelago.

“If there is one issue of Norwegian foreign policy that is difficult,” said Wormdal, “then it is the Svalbard question.”

Restrictions on Svalbard haven’t stopped the U.S. Department of Defense from using Norway’s cosmic putting greens for explicitly military purposes: They’ve just chosen different spots.

For instance, the U.S. Space Force’s Space Development Agency is building a satellite ground station on the island of Andøya, on an existing Norwegian military installation, to support a constellation of satellites that does missile tracking, weapons targeting, and navigation, among other things. The U.S. also worked with Norway on the recently launched Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission, which included an instrument the Space Force will use to ping military personnel in the High North.

The broadband satellites themselves will be commanded from northern Norway, by Space Norway, the state-owned company that co-owns KSAT, as well as the cables connecting Svalbard to the mainland.

Satellite monitoring of the waters around the country is important for civilian purposes, like search and rescue, and also for NATO and Norway’s own military. “Norway is in a strategical, important position globally,” said Randi Ellingsen, head of communication and public relations for Space Norway. “We have a particular neighbor that we all know about.”

She is referring, here, to Russia, and Norway’s desire to be aware of what’s going on near the borders.

“Everybody in Norway knows about that neighbor,” she said. “It’s not something far away. It’s very close to us.”

Keeping tabs on activity in the Arctic — from any country — requires a strong space presence, according to senior national representative of Royal Norwegian Air Force Kjetil Bjørkum, who spoke to Undark in a personal capacity. Both the U.S. and Norway have an interest in keeping an eye on the Arctic — preferably without stationing lonely soldiers on a glacier. “It’s not a really human-friendly environment,” he said. “It’s cold; it’s dark; the weather is horrible.”

That’s where satellites, and their ground stations, come in. According to Bjørkum, Norway should increase its already robust collaboration with the U.S. in that realm. Norway has invested heavily in its space assets, from satellites to the ground stations that make those satellites useful — a capacity, said Troy Bouffard, an assistant professor of Arctic security at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the U.S. is lucky to capitalize on: “All of that we benefit from.”

“If there is one issue of Norwegian foreign policy that is difficult, then it is the Svalbard question.”

That benefit has materialized as the U.S. has shown growing interest in the Arctic in recent years. “Major geopolitical changes are driving the need for this new strategic approach to the Arctic, including Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the accession of Finland and Sweden to the NATO alliance, increasing collaboration between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia, and the accelerating impacts of climate change,” reads the country’s 2024 Arctic Strategy. “This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue for strategic competition.”

“It took a while for it to become something of a national-security-level priority,” said Bouffard, who helped lobby for the inclusion of the Arctic for the first time in country’s official national security strategy document.

But it is such a priority now: Some political analysts see Trump’s desire to buy (or invade) Greenland as a sign of a general interest in Arctic affairs — one that has rattled Norway and other NATO allies.

There are signs that Svalbard is not immune to these geopolitical shifts. In January 2022, one of the two cables linking Svalbard to the mainland was cut. The break lasted 11 days and the island ran on just one communications line. There is no official cause of the break, and U.S. and European investigations suggest it was accidental, but public and press suspicion turned to Russia; a Russian trawler passed over the cable’s path 20 times in the days preceding the event. (The boat owner denied sabotage.) Cable breaks can be accidental — from, say, an anchor mistakenly dragging the seabed — or intentional, but they can affect the transfer of satellite data either way.

“We have to be pretty highly responsive to stuff like that,” said NOAA’s Walsh, of the Svalbard snap. The cable-cut resulted in delays of several hours for NOAA’s datasets, which can affect weather prediction.

Cable problems are almost certain to crop up again in the future — for reasons ranging from iceberg movement to malfeasance. Stryker said that, in the environmental and political environment of Svalbard, a broken cable is certainly a concern.

Though, he noted, “There are generally workarounds.”

When there’s a problem at Svalbard, the USGS has high-latitude stations in South Dakota, Alaska, and Germany it can turn to for support; NASA uses antennas in Alaska and Sweden. But none of them can catch the satellite on every single one of its orbits, as the ones on Svalbard can, which can lead to data backups and possible weather-forecast issues like those NOAA experienced after the 2022 cable break. NOAA, meanwhile, can switch over to a station in Fairbanks.

“We are trying to make sure that those backup stations are available whenever, and we have backups for the southern hemisphere too,” said Walsh, adding: “The geopolitical concerns there are always in the back of my mind.”

Still, he noted that Norway has supported NOAA’s missions without interference, referring to its meteorological monitoring and prediction satellites. “But we, the U.S., will always look out for our back at Fairbanks.”

In addition to cable breaks, power outages may also be of concern. And while U.S. science officials didn’t mention the possibility, defense analysts have suggested Russia might try to seize Svalbard, or imagined how such a military action might play out. But it remains a what-if scenario.

“The geopolitical concerns there are always in the back of my mind.”

Skatteboe acknowledged the heightened tensions in the High North but said KSAT has always focused on avoiding data disruptions. These days, the company is more attuned to potential disruptions: “The focus is higher than it was,” Skatteboe said. “But really not that much, because access to data has always been important.”

That’s true of the Landsat data, which remains as dependent on KSAT as it was when that first antenna arrived on the island. Today, NASA and USGS are planning the new-generation Landsat Next, which will collect around 14 times more data than the mission does today. For that to work, they need frequent contact with satellite stations. “We just can’t do this on our own, really, given our geography,” Stryker said. In Fairbanks, which the agency currently uses as one of its ground stations, antennas can only communicate with satellites for 11 or 12 of their daily 14 orbits every day.

And the world would be more of a mystery if satellites like Landsat couldn’t send their bounty back to Earth — something Brown got the chance to evangelize about when he was in Svalbard last year with Stryker.

While there, he took a boat tour around the island and started chatting with the guide during a lull in the narration. Brown asked the man what climate changes he’d seen on the home front. After all, Arctic regions experience shifts more dramatically and quickly than lower latitudes.

Temperatures are rising around six times faster on Svalbard than the world average; the ice is disappearing; the seas have seen nearly fully liquid days; permafrost thaw is causing higher probability of landslides and avalanches.

The guide explained his own experience of this change and then turned a query toward Brown.

Why was all this satellite stuff so important? he asked.

Brown explained Landsat’s value: It provides a long-term record of Earth as it is and as it’s changing, allowing scientists, policymakers, and businesspeople to understand and respond to the very climate change the guide could see with his own eyes, as well as understand how phenomena like drought and wildfire affect the environment.

Thirty minutes later, when the guide was back at the microphone, he told the rest of the guests exactly what Brown had said, explaining his island’s importance to the rest of the world. And then, together, the group watched as blue whales breached in the cold — yet warming — waters.</p></b>
