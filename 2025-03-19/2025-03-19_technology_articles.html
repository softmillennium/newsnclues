The moves come as President Donald Trump threatens tariffs in response to what he calls Europe’s “overseas extortion” of American firms. The Commission found that Google’s Search and Google Play services breach the DMA by favoring Alphabet’s own products over competitors—a practice known as self-preferencing. It also ruled that Google Play restricts app developers from directing consumers to alternative payment platforms. Google has pushed back against the findings, arguing that the required changes will make it harder for users to find relevant results and reduce traffic to European businesses. This is, quite simply, misguided,” said Oliver Bethell, Google’s EMEA director for competition. The EU has also sent guidance to Apple, instructing it to ensure that its iOS operating system allows interoperability, meaning third-party developers should be able to integrate more easily with Apple’s services. “These moves wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” an Apple spokesperson said. Trump argues that European regulations unfairly target US tech giants through digital services taxes and antitrust fines. Last month, the administration issued a directive warning of potential trade measures if Europe continues tightening its grip on major US tech firms. In response, the EU has prepared an “anti-coercion” mechanism that would allow it to retaliate if the US imposes trade restrictions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/sorry-to-say-the-google-pixel-9a-is-actually-delayed-2000578272'>Sorry to Say the Google Pixel 9a is Actually Delayed</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 20:30:08 <p>
Earlier today, I told you about Google’s Pixel 9a, a mid-range smartphone release that’s supposed to compete with Apple’s iPhone 16e while offering a cost-efficient entry in the Pixel lineup. But by the time I poured my coffee, it was reported that Google was delaying shipment of the Pixel 9a to April. You can only sign up to be notified when the phone becomes available. Google hasn’t revealed the official launch date yet, though it did issue a statement. The Easter bunny will not be dropping off a pearly Iris or Peony-colored phone in anyone’s basket this holiday—at least, it doesn’t seem like it. The delay—and the fact that it was not revealed when the Pixel 9a was officially announced as existing—is not a good look for Google, which has been in some hardware hell lately. The Pixel 4a battery firmware update that happened recently reminded us all that there was a time when smartphone batteries could explode. And then there was that legacy Chromecast issue that messed up some antiquated living rooms set up for streaming. Is this what happens when you combine hardware and software teams and hope everyone aligns on the same thing? It’s good to know Google is pulling back the reins instead of putting out hardware with “a component quality issue.” But it’s a bummer for those of us impatient for the drama of the “Pixel 9a versus iPhone 16e” comparison pieces that will be coming out.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Or, you can head to Best Buy where it starts at $749 ($250 off), an all-time low. The Pixel 9 Pro starts with the same-size 6.3-inch screen as the Pixel 9 but has a sharper and brighter screen, a nicer polished metal frame, and more RAM, which helps allow things to feel smooth and may even futureproof you a little bit with memory-hungry Gemini AI. “What about the new Pixel 9A Google just announced?” Yeah, that’s appealing, but it isn’t for sale yet because Google says it’s fixing a hardware issue that recently cropped up. We haven’t had a chance to review it yet, but my quick take is the extra $300 is worth it for the better screen, camera, and extra RAM. Amazon’s eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi system is 27% off, down to $399.99. Or, conversely, if you’re like me and live in a really old house with plaster walls that make it hard for signals to travel through. This is the exact system I use and it seems to work well.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/632830/microsoft-kathleen-hogan-strategy-chief-notepad'>Microsoft has a new strategy chief to navigate its AI era</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 20:15:00 <p>
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is moving the company’s HR chief, Kathleen Hogan, into a new role focused on corporate strategy. Now, Hogan has to steer strategy through the rapid changes of Microsoft’s AI era. Microsoft hasn’t had someone in charge of corporate strategy for quite some time, so this is an interesting change. I don’t think we’re going to see anything similar from Hogan, though. “[Hogan] is recognized externally as a consequential HR leader transforming culture and the world of work,” says Nadella in his memo. Hogan already had her work cut out for her managing Microsoft’s various cultural changes over the past 10 years, alongside the company’s priority changes and many rounds of layoffs. Amy Coleman has been overseeing HR operations for multiple parts of Microsoft over the past four years, and she’s now being promoted to chief people officer. Coleman will also join Microsoft’s senior leadership team and report directly to Nadella. Microsoft isn’t sharing anything more about Hogan’s new role today, but as the software giant gets bigger and faces more complicated choices, I’m certain Hogan’s experience will be key to making sure people are in the right roles as the company gets ready to celebrate its 50th anniversary and looks ahead to its next 50 years. During a press briefing ahead of Microsoft’s announcement, the company demonstrated some prototype ways this Copilot for Gaming could operate, like helping you select an Overwatch 2 hero that assists your team or guiding you through crafting in Minecraft. I’m not entirely sure what Microsoft will actually have ready in the Xbox mobile app in April, but I suspect it’s probably a lot more limited than being able to coach you during a game. Microsoft is going to be iterating based on feedback, but I think it’s going to be a while before we see Copilot meaningfully show up on Xbox as an AI gaming coach that guides you through games and helps you avoid making mistakes. Microsoft is also at the Game Developers Conference this week talking about its AI efforts for Xbox and gaming in general. There are a bunch of interesting sessions, and it feels like Microsoft is getting a lot more comfortable talking about how it’s going to use AI across Xbox following its reveal of the Muse model that can generate gameplay. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a steady flow of AI-related Xbox announcements in the months ahead. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

Similarly, returning benefit recipients who want to update their direct deposit information will either have to pass the online ID verification process or visit a government office. “SSA will permit individuals who do not or cannot use the agency’s online ‘My Social Security’ services to start their claim for benefits on the telephone. It’s unclear how well the government’s ID verification software works, though it’s worth noting that a Federal Communications Commission report published last year found that between 14 and 24 million Americans still lack access to broadband. A similar report from the AARP found that an estimated 42 percent of older adults (some 22 million people) lack reliable access to the internet. Many elderly Americans may not be “digital natives” and, even if they have internet access, may be bad at navigating websites and digital platforms. A Pew Research survey from 2021 showed that about a quarter of the U.S. population that is 65 or older (i.e., the people most likely to be on social security) report “never going online.” In other words, as the Associated Press has reported, the SSA’s policy shift is likely to force “millions of [social security] recipients and applicants” to visit government offices to get their retirement benefits. That’s really bad news because, as it happens, DOGE has also been targeting SSA field offices across the country for lease termination and closure. Those offices are spread across a variety of states, including many MAGA-heavy places like Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, and North Dakota. Problematically, DOGE has also been working to downsize the SSA’s staff. The memo notes that the policy changes will create “increased field office traffic,” “longer call wait times,” and “delayed processing” among other negative outcomes. “The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesn’t grow with the economy,” Fink said while speaking with Semafor. “If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, they’re going to feel more attached to our economy,” Fink said, implying that Americans’ retirement funds should be tied up with the stock market.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The European Commission is not backing down from efforts to rein in Big Tech. In a series of press releases today, the European Union's executive arm has announced actions against both Apple and Google. Regulators have announced that Apple will be required to open up support for non-Apple accessories on the iPhone, but it may be too late for Google to make changes. Since returning to power, Donald Trump has railed against European regulations that target US tech firms. This landmark piece of EU legislation aims to make the digital economy more fair. Upon coming into force last year, the act labeled certain large tech companies, including Apple and Google, as "gatekeepers" that are subject to additional scrutiny. As for Google, the European Commission has paid special attention to search, Android, and Chrome, all of which dominate their respective markets. The EU has now decreed that Apple is not doing enough to support interoperability on its platform. As a result, it will be required to make several notable changes. We've asked Apple for comment on this development but have not heard back as of publication time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The European Union has ordered Apple open up key elements of its operating system to enable better interoperability with third-party devices. Under the decree of the same Digital Markets Act that forced Apple to end App Store exclusivity, the bloc has ordered Apple to open up nine iOS connectivity features for better integration with smartwatches, headphones or televisions made by other companies. The OnePlus 13R is going cheap The OnePlus 13R, with its gorgeous 6.78-inch OLED display and outstanding two-day battery life, is now more affordable than ever. Just yesterday, the founder of Pebble railed against the poor state of affairs for third-party manufacturers trying to make effective devices to work well with iPhones. The European Commission wants Apple to stop gatekeeping those features. The EU also wants Apple to allow third-party manufacturers to benefit from casting and data transfer technologies like AirPlay and AirDrop, meaning rivals could build there own versions of the service for Apple devices. In a news release today, the Commission states: “As a result [of the interoperability changes], connected devices of all brands will work better on iPhones. Device manufacturers will have new opportunities to bring innovative products to the market, improving the user experience for consumers based in Europe. The measures ensure that this innovation takes place in full respect of users’ privacy and security as well as the integrity of Apple’s operating systems.” We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users”.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/dnd-sigil-vtt-canceled-hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-2000578128'>Report: Hasbro Is Scrapping Dungeons & Dragons's Ambitious Virtual Tabletop</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 20:00:49 <p>
Hasbro’s Sigil 3D virtual tabletop tool—which recently launched in a messy, unfinished state as an early public playtest—is reportedly being shuttered after years of development and being folded into, in some capacity, existing D&D Beyond virtual tabletop system, Maps.

Rascal News reports that, in an internal message sent to Wizards of the Coast employees, the studio confirmed that Sigil will “transition to a DDB feature,” and attempt to release currently developed extra content for users at no additional cost, while “most of the Sigil team will be separated from the company this week.”

“After several months of alpha testing, we’ve concluded that our aspirations for Sigil as a larger, standalone game with a distinct monetization path will not be realized,” the purported message reads in part. “Although we haven’t fully realized our vision for Sigil to scale, the team should be proud of their achievements.” io9 has reached out to Wizards of the Coast to confirm the veracity of both the message and the layoffs, but had yet to hear a response by time of publication. A LinkedIn post shared last night by Sigil design lead and WOTC game rules specialist Andy Collins already detailed the layoffs, saying that roughly 30 people, including himself—roughly 90% of the current development team, according to Collins—were impacted.

Wizards of the Coast first publicly unveiled Project Sigil in the summer of 2024, teasing a gamified VTT system developed in Unreal Engine 5 to allow players and Dungeon Masters to develop customizable, fully 3D maps and environments to share and play in, as well as a host of features and access to high quality D&D character models (notably including Baldur’s Gate 3‘s Astarion and Karlach, attempting to leverage the viral success of Larian’s 2023 smash-hit CRPG). But since its splashy reveal Wizards struggled to publicly demo Sigil, climaxing in last month’s launch of a publicly accessible playtest to subscribers of D&D Beyond‘s Master Tier that was met with criticism that beneath its splashy visuals, the system was rife with bugs and user accessibility issues, and extremely limited compared to the grand vision Wizards had teased for the platform.

Further reporting by Rascal alleges that development on Sigil was rocked by a lack of clear vision, and divisions between Hasbro upper management—who had hoped to treat Sigil less as a virtual tabletop platform, and more of a standalone video game that could’ve potentially utilized other IP from across the toymaker—and its developers, as well as an internal rift between Sigil’s developers and the D&D Beyond team as they developed the Maps VTT system, with the latter purportedly denying the former access to internal Beyond data.

Now, with a skeleton crew of remaining staff, the Sigil team will reportedly work with the D&D Beyond team to integrate what little of Sigil’s vision remains into its already existent form. We’ll bring you more on Wizards’ plans for Sigil as and when we hear them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Elon Musk and President Trump are fighting a court order to turn over information about DOGE, the US Department of Government Efficiency. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled last week that New Mexico and 13 other states suing Musk and the federal government can serve their written discovery requests on Musk, the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service, and US DOGE Temporary Organization. The states' lawsuit alleges violations of the US Constitution's appointments clause and conduct in excess of statutory authority. "Plaintiffs' requests, as amended by the court, are reasonable and narrowly tailored to their request for injunctive relief," and "expedited discovery is reasonable and necessary to evaluate Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief," Chutkan, a judge at US District Court for the District of Columbia, wrote in a memorandum opinion. Plaintiffs said they aren't seeking information from Trump himself and did not ask for depositions of either Trump or Musk. But in a challenge to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, government attorneys said the discovery is "intrusive" and contrary to "separation-of-powers principles and the 'high respect' that courts must afford the President in the conduct of his constitutional duties." Filing: Musk’s advice to Trump should be secret There is also a petition to quash the District Court order filed yesterday by Musk, Trump, and DOGE. The district court's broadly phrased and premature discovery order raises grievous separation-of-powers concerns. Discovery should be a last resort and not conducted "at the very outset of the case, before any motion for a preliminary injunction and before resolving the government's motion to dismiss, which could obviate the need for discovery altogether or substantially narrow it," the petition said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Millions of iPhone users use Apple Watches, and they’re fine with it. However, the EU could force Apple to make third-party smartwatches work better on iPhones. While Apple Watches are some of the best smartwatches you can buy, there’s a whole exciting world of other smartwatches just waiting to grace your wrist. Third-party watches can work on iPhones, but they don’t have access to all of the features that an Apple Watch has, which is pretty frustrating. However, the EU could force Apple to make third-party smartwatches work better with iPhones It should come as no surprise that the EU is pursuing this action. It’s on a mission to dismantle the prison that Apple users are trapped in. Under its DMA (Digital Markets Act), the EU brought forth two decisions on Tuesday. The next one will make Apple more transparent with developers in regard to interoperability. This will include providing third-party developers with documentation clearly outlining which features are not available to them. If Apple complies with these, then we should see more interoperability between iPhones and third-party smartwatches, which will be a good thing. “With these decision[s], we are simply implementing the law, and providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” says Europe’s executive vice president for clean, just, and competitive transition Teresa Ribera, “This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Netflix just announced Spirit Crossing during a press event at GDC 2025. It was developed by Spry Fox, one of Netflix’s in-house game studios, and will launch sometime later this year. Spirit Crossing is described in the press release as a “cozy MMO.” Its launch trailer certainly gives off typical “cozy” game vibes with cute creatures, pastel colors, and chill music that wouldn’t be out of place in a Lo-fi Girl stream. The game will feature customizable housing and neighborhoods for players, open-world exploration, and lots of crafting. Spry Fox is known for several cozy-style games including Cozy Grove and its Netflix-exclusive sequel Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit. Netflix acquired the studio in 2022 as a part of its gaming initiative. While the streaming platform has proven it’s serious about its games offering by continuing to bring third-party titles to the service in addition to its own first-party games, it is not immune to the same forces wrecking the games industry at large.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/news/632613/andor-tony-gilroy-ai-star-wars-training-copyright'>Andor creator refuses to publish scripts thanks to AI</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 19:19:25 <p>
Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy told Collider he has killed plans to publish the critically acclaimed show’s scripts, despite having the 1,500-page collection ready to go, due to fear that the material would become training fodder for artificial intelligence systems. At an Emmy event in 2023, Gilroy announced plans to launch a free website featuring all of Andor’s scripts and concept art, journalist Jeff Goldsmith reported. AI is the reason we’re not,” Gilroy told Collider. Gilroy’s decision highlights growing concerns about artists’ work being used without permission to develop AI tools that could replace them — and a distaste for the technology in general. At the same time, major studios haven’t shied away from AI partnerships. Last September, Lionsgate partnered with AI startup Runway to develop a machine learning model using content from its movie and TV catalog. A few weeks after that deal was announced, Reuters reported that Disney formed a new internal team to coordinate the company’s AI and mixed reality efforts. Among their key demands were protections against AI-written scripts replacing human writers and safeguards preventing the creation of digital replicas of actors without their consent. Both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA successfully ratified contracts including several key AI-related protections — but both contracts expire over roughly the next year, and it’s likely they will have to renegotiate these terms. With union support, California Governor Gavin Newsom enacted two pieces of legislation last September that are designed to shield performers from unauthorized AI-generated digital replicas. The New York Times is suing OpenAI for copyright infringement, while a separate copyright lawsuit against the same company has been filed by a coalition of writers including Game of Thrones author George R.R. AI companies have typically argued that this training is legal fair use, but the debate remains unsettled as cases progress. For now, as Gilroy puts it: why help the fucking robots more than you can?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“The Vancouver Auto Show’s primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff,” Nicholl said, according to Canada’s Global News. There have also been peaceful protests organized under the name Tesla Takedown. Trump has dramatically upended the world’s geopolitical alliances, threatening traditional allies like Canada with invasion and cozying up to authoritarian regimes like Vladimir Putin in Russia. The attacks against Tesla dealerships have prompted Musk to complain that people are going after him for no reason, a particularly odd claim as cuts to programs like USAID are expected to literally kill millions of people around the world in just the first year, according to estimates from the New York Times. Musk was instrumental in illegally destroying USAID but the billionaire oligarch appeared on Fox News on Tuesday and claimed people wanted to kill him despite the fact that he’s “never done anything awful.” “I’ve only done productive things,” Musk claimed on the show with Sean Hannity. “So I think we just have a deranged, there’s some kind of mental illness thing going on here because this doesn’t make any sense.” Attorney General Pam Bondi has called the attacks against Tesla domestic terrorism and says they will be prosecuted as such. “The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences. We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.” Fox News has also kicked into high gear in defending Musk and Tesla from a number of different angles, including by invoking the number of people employed by Tesla.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/snow-white-2025-review-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot-2000578100'>Snow White Charms as a Modern Spin on the Animated Classic</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 19:05:43 <p>
And most importantly, there’s no denying Rachel Zegler carries the film with the best vocal performance of any live-action Disney Princess. There had been nothing like it before, and that in and of itself is probably the hardest thing for the live-action adaptation to overcome. What is this film doing besides being just another of Disney’s live-action releases? Back in 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs‘ story had to be efficient and simply appeal to the masses of that era. So the expectation that this live-action version will exactly mirror what came before is unrealistic. A modern, live-action film has the space to play with the original’s straightforward take on Snow White, giving it much needed updates cleverly penned by Erin Cressida Wilson. Zegler imbues Snow authentically with an innocence and naive kindness that evolves into a different form of strength for young girls to look up to, a welcome change from the animated Snow’s role as a reactive character who lets the saving happen to her. This is a love story, with a manic pixie dream boy from from the wrong side of the kingdom, and Snow White’s coming of age journey. He also made the Amazing Spider-Man films, in which Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy made a superhero feel more human through his very real connection to the woman he loved and lost. Witnessing that heartfelt first love between Snow and Jonathan makes them so easy to root for, and helps make this latest Disney live-action feel more like a sweeping musical romance. So while “I’m Wishing,” “One Song,” and “Someday My Prince Will Come” have been omitted here, the film still conveys that timeless feeling of romance that propelled old Hollywood movies toward their happy endings. It’s giving Fred and Ginger in the forest with musical numbers like “Princess Problems,” and again Princess Bride, with Burnap distractingly looking like a young Cary Elwes. Zegler is undeniable bringing in relatable chemistry through her stunning singing; Burnap meets her at her level, especially in my new favorite Disney duet “A Hand Meets a Hand.” In these moments, Snow White‘s combination of actors, music, dance numbers, and director is a winning one. Just casting a beautiful woman isn’t enough, Gadot’s Evil Queen doesn’t serve diva in the way the legendary villain role needed. Gadot struggles to create a compelling performance, and her musical numbers make you wish someone with a stronger signing experience had been cast instead. In the Queen’s new villain song for the film, “All Is Fair,” Gadot struggles, sounding almost as if her her voice has been put through post-processing that’s a few steps beyond simple autotune. They couldn’t even hide it as the scene is filled with too many cut-aways for what should have been a big showstopper. With Snow White at least we get new songs that create a new storybook romance for a generation who can learn wishes can come true if you rise to meet them, and they can come with a prince too. Overall Snow White is an enchanting musical with an empowering message to stand with your people against a vain and evil tyrant. And it mostly accomplishes that save for the misuse of digital enhancements, which fans still won’t like. Disney’s rocky history with its live-action remakes hits a decently charming note in Snow White, but perhaps likely not one that will fill the trend’s detractors with confidence ahead of even more coming along the way, like Lilo & Stitch and Tangled. One thing’s for sure, at least: Zegler has earned her place as this generation’s Snow White, and the franchise is all the better for it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There’s nothing Hollywood loves more than a big comeback—and Coyote vs. Acme may be getting its second chance. But now, a happy ending appears to be in sight, as a new report in Deadline says Ketchup Entertainment is negotiating for the movie’s rights. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Ketchup is the same company that rescued The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie from WB’s discard pile; like Coyote vs. Acme, the sci-fi comedy starring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig was originally intended for a streaming release. Deadline notes that Ketchup has a similar theatrical plan for Coyote vs. Acme, should the deal come together, and gives some background on what’s at stake here. “Despite test-screening well, the project became a high-profile casualty of WB cost-cutting two years ago and it has been sitting on the shelf for more than a year,” the trade writes. (Pop culture fans will recall the Batgirl movie was probably the most high-profile title amid that purge.) Additionally: “The studio reportedly screened the movie to a string of buyers in early 2024 with a price tag of around $70M, which is how much the film is said to have cost. Studio sources claim to us that they didn’t get any offers at the time.” Deadline writes that Ketchup is “negotiating an all-rights acquisition in the $50M range,” adding “the pact isn’t finalized and there’s still a chance it doesn’t make but it’s heading in the right direction. Though the Looney Tunes have long been intertwined with Warner Bros.—the earliest shorts were released in the 1930s—it’s lately seemed the studio, particularly under the tenure of CEO David Zaslav, is increasingly eager to move on from its lengthy cartoon history. What do you think about this upturn for Coyote vs. Acme?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Plex is a bit hard to explain these days. Even if you don't know its roots as an outgrowth of a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project, Plex is not your typical "streaming" service, given how most people use it. Starting April 29, the cost of a Plex Pass rises from $5 to $7 monthly, from $40 to $70 annually, and a lifetime pass now costs $250, previously $120. In a blog post, Plex cites rising costs and its commitment to an independent service that supports "personal media." "This price increase will ensure that we can keep investing dedicated resources in developing new features, while supporting and growing your favorites." The post cites a roadmap that contains an integration with Common Sense Media, a new "bespoke server management app" for managing server users, and "an open and documented API for server integrations," including custom metadata agents. And then, after that note, Plex hits the big change: Streaming "personal media"—i.e., video files, not audio, photos, or offerings from Plex's ad-supported movies and TV—from outside your own network will no longer be a free Plex feature, starting April 29. "Fully free" might be the better way to put it, because if a server owner has a Plex Pass subscription, their users can still access their server for free. But if you've been hosting your own Plex server to maintain access to your stuff while you're away or relying on the kindness of non-Pass-having friends with servers, either you or your server-owning friends will need a Plex Pass subscription by the end of April. That doesn't include Plex Pass features like offline downloads, skipping a show intro or credits, or the like, but it does keep you connected to your "personal media" vendors.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There are few things scarier to the conservative mind than mass transportation in a major metropolitan city. To that end, Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy, is demanding New York City officials provide a list of actions that they will take to reduce crime on the city’s subway system or risk losing out on federal funds. In a letter delivered Tuesday to New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority head Janno Lieber, Duffy asked for a list of “actions and plans to reduce crime on its system,” including addressing assaults, fare evasions, and “subway surfing”—the act of riding outside of a moving rail car. There have been several high-profile and particularly brutal crimes on New York’s subway in recent years, including a woman getting set on fire, the killing of a homeless man, and a series of incidents in which people have been pushed in front of trains. There were 1.2 billion rides on New York City’s subways in 2024, and 2,211 crimes reported. Seeing dilapidated and neglected infrastructure adds to a sense of unease. Notably, New York Governor Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 additional members of law enforcement in the subway last year as part of her own five-step plan to increase safety on the subway. All of that to say, you know what won’t make the subway safer? The Trump administration is already making funding this initiative harder than it needs to be by challenging the MTA’s congestion pricing program in Manhattan, which had generated about $50 million in just its first month of operation and was expected to help open up about $15 billion in available funding for the city once fully implemented. Sure seems like they might be more interested in winning a political battle than actually improving safety.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. The European Commission is instructing Apple to make iOS work better with third-party devices like smartwatches and headphones. The first decision will give app developers and device manufacturers more access to key iPhone features so that it’ll be easier for third-party gadgets to pair, transfer data, or display notifications. The second will require Apple to be more transparent in general around interoperability, giving developers access to technical documentation about how to make their services work with iPhones and iPads, and making sure there’s a “more predictable timeline” for how interoperability requests are reviewed. The decisions are separate from the non-compliance proceedings Europe opened against Apple — unlike those kinds of cases, specification proceedings like this one help determine how companies should meet their obligations under the DMA, rather than punishing them for violations. The EU had submitted draft recommendations to Apple in December after launching its proceedings a couple months earlier. Tuesday’s decisions “mark the first time the Commission outlines concrete measures for a gatekeeper to comply with the Digital Markets Act,” Europe’s executive vice president for clean, just, and competitive transition Teresa Ribera says in a statement. Apple can still fight the decisions, subject to judicial review. “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg says in a statement. “Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple’s ecosystem.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Microsoft, along with BlackRock and UAE-based MGX, have announced they are partnering with his artificial intelligence startup xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no fan of Musk, recently describing him as insecure in an interview, and must be screaming inside. xAI has received criticism for using gas turbines to feed its significant power demands, and receiving significant concessions from the city of Memphis even though data centers usually do not employ many people, and AI threatens to eliminate jobs. Most companies in the space hope to build out nuclear energy to power their demands, which could be a positive for the green energy transition, but building out nuclear takes many years. In the meantime, President Trump has advocated for building out coal power plants next to data centers. Every company in the artificial intelligence space is racing to build out computing infrastructure they believe will be necessary to stand out in an incredibly competitive field. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. OpenAI early this year announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank, one of the earlier signs that it was distancing itself from Microsoft. The big tech company has been building out its own in-house models that could be faster and less expensive to run than ChatGPT, and Microsoft likely does not want to be reliant on an independent company for its AI models if the technology is going to be as revolutionary as many in the industry believe. It is better to control your own destiny than rely on a wild and frenetic company like OpenAI, which has seen a slew of scandals and ongoing drama, including the brief ouster of Altman. He co-founded the startup, after all, but left following disputes surrounding its direction, only to see the company launch ChatGPT and kickstart a new AI generation. Now he is teaming up with OpenAI’s largest backer on his own rival startup. Musk’s close relationship with the Trump administration has aided him significantly. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that X is now privately valued at $44 billion, the exact same price he paid for what was then called Twitter back in 2022. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular AI chatbot in use today with a reported 400 million weekly users and name recognition that none of its competitors enjoy. xAI is banking on its access to real-time posts from X to differentiate Grok as a powerful chatbot, even though the social network is littered with misinformation. Last year, Musk gave shares in xAI to investors in his Twitter takeover, as well as preferential access to xAI’s funding rounds, effectively ensuring they would make their money back. While it remains a major question how impactful AI chatbots will really become in the world, it is understood that should they be as successful as hoped, having access to significant compute will help the few survive. Anyone can run a model like DeepSeek, but “agents” that control computers and do work for users will be resource-intensive, and users will go to competitors if their usage is rate-limited by another.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s now or never for the rebels of Gilead, a narrative urgency that’s long been used to propel The Handmaid’s Tale, but now feels like a promise as the show enters its sixth and final season. Today’s new trailer for the Margaret Atwood adaptation offers further hope that Elisabeth Moss’ June will at last see the oppressive regime that’s made life hell for so many—including herself; frankly, it’s a miracle she’s survived this long—topple once and for all.

Her key allies, including Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and Moira (Samira Wiley), are back to help her fight; the trailer also hints at a fascinating storyline for the ever-complicated Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), as well as another powerful turn from Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia.

Here’s the official synopsis: “In the final season of The Handmaid’s Tale, June’s unyielding spirit and determination pull her back into the fight to take down Gilead. Luke and Moira join the resistance. Serena tries to reform Gilead while Commander Lawrence and Aunt Lydia reckon with what they have wrought, and Nick faces challenging tests of character. This final chapter of June’s journey highlights the importance of hope, courage, solidarity, and resilience in the pursuit of justice and freedom.”

The rest of the cast includes Bradley Whitford, Max Minghella, Madeline Brewer, Amanda Brugel, Sam Jaeger, Ever Carradine, and Josh Charles. You can catch the first three season six episodes April 8 on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+, with a weekly rollout until the series finale May 27. A sequel series, The Testaments, is actively in the works at Hulu, though a release date has not yet been set.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Last year, GameStop shut down Game Informer, laying off all its staff and putting an end to one of the last remaining video game magazines still published in the United States. But now, cryptic posts on social media hint that the publication may make a return. On Bluesky, the Game Informer account, which had not posted since July of last year, returned to life with a short video featuring the publication’s farewell message. At the bottom of the screen, code appears with the words “Continue” as though it were an arcade game asking if you wanted to put in more quarters to keep playing. The screen then flashes to black with a date, March 25th, suggesting a launch or announcement next week. Additionally, former staff members posted videos of a “continue” screen with a copy of Game Informer in the background, with the animation moving the cursor onto “yes.” Taken together, the teasers suggest Game Informer is coming back with its former staff returning to lead the publication. The Verge has reached out to GameStop and former staff at Game Informer to confirm the news. In an email, Shea said that he can’t comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues. With the continued shrinking of digital media putting thousands of journalists out of work, especially in video games, it’s incredibly rare that something good happens. While we don’t quite know what form this announcement will take on March 25th, I think we can tentatively say, Game Informer’s getting the band back together.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

And that reboot, of course, was after Lionsgate actually made a decent reboot for the big screen, but that too fizzled. What changed here, or how this version will be different from others, is unclear. They probably have earned lots of trust as a result. The Power Rangers have been popular for decades and across multiple mediums. That’s why there have been multiple different TV iterations and movies throughout the years before Hasbro bought the franchise in 2018. Since then, multiple movies and TV show iterations have been floated, but nothing has quite solidified yet. So there’s every chance this version fails too. The streamer can be brutal to some of its shows (see The Acolyte and Willow) but it also feels like the place to be for genre programming aimed at a certain age. And Power Rangers is right in that wheelhouse. What are your thoughts on this latest iteration of Power Rangers?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 19th, JR Central announced that it will introduce semi-private "advanced class seats" on the Tokaido Shinkansen from 2027.

The seats have a locked door between the aisle and the seats, and have a large backshell type seating that enhances a sense of privacy. It also has a reclining function and leg rest, providing a dedicated Wi-Fi environment and luggage space.

In the image, it looks like it's for single people, but it can also be turned over one side of the car vertically and face it, making it suitable for riding in pairs.

The plan is to introduce semi-private seats to some of the N700S vehicles in car No. 10, with the previous reserved green seats being reduced to 48, and six seats being a semi-private room type.

Additionally, another "private room type seating" that has already been announced will begin service in autumn 2026, earlier than the semi-private room type announced this time. These seats will provide a high-quality ride experience that is better than green cars.

President Trump fired both Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission yesterday, advancing his administration's claim that the president can fire FTC commissioners despite a US law and a 1935 Supreme Court ruling stating that the president cannot do so without good cause. Trump fired Democrats Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, both of whom said the firings are illegal. I'll see the president in court," Bedoya wrote. The FTC was created "to fight fraudsters and monopolists," but Trump "wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies," Bedoya said. A statement from Slaughter said, "The President illegally fired me from my position as a Federal Trade Commissioner, violating the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent." Slaughter said Trump "fears the accountability that opposition voices would provide if the president orders Chairman [Andrew] Ferguson to treat the most powerful corporations and their executives—like those that flanked the President at his inauguration—with kid gloves." US law says any FTC commissioner "may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." The Supreme Court held in a 1935 case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that "Congress intended to restrict the power of removal to one or more of those causes." “You have been removed from the FTC” It would be an important test case for Trump's larger quest to take control of agencies that were set up to make decisions independently of the White House.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cultofmac.com/news/iphone-accessories-eu-interoperability'>EU lays out its demands for iPhone interoperability</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 17:15:43 <p>
Apple says the new rules will undercut user privacy and slow innovation, and vows to make its case to the EU. It remains to be seen whether the changes will take effect only in Europe or globally. The DMA already forced Apple to allow alternative app stores and sideloading of apps for iPhone users in Europe. However, some developers complain that Apple’s compliance with EU mandates leaves something to be desired. Orders issued Tuesday include changes to nine iOS connectivity features. “The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing),” according to a statement from the European Commission. In addition, the European Commission created new rules for the system Apple created to allow app developers to ask for additional interoperability access. Device manufacturers will have new opportunities to bring innovative products to the market, improving the user experience for consumers based in Europe. The measures ensure that this innovation takes place in full respect of users’ privacy and security as well as the integrity of Apple’s operating systems.” Apple, unsurprisingly, is much less upbeat about the EC directive. Their comment echoed a white paper released in December claiming that Meta and others are already abusing changes required by the DMA. “We are now seeing concrete examples of how a new approach to interoperability in the EU would put users at risk, requiring them to open their devices — and their most sensitive data — to companies with a track record of violating their privacy,” said the iPhone-maker. Apple also said it thinks companies should benefit from their own hard work, not that of others. And it raises a larger issue: the European Commission classifies iOS as a “gatekeeper” because Apple’s decisions affect millions of iPhones used in Europe. But Apple thinks the European Commission has now taken on the role of gatekeeper, deciding what Apple is and isn’t allowed to do with its tech. And it feels it’s being singled out, with other companies not being hit with similar interoperability requirements to open their technology to all.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But the authors underline all these players have not published data on their annual energy consumption. In total, only 52 companies have published complete data. This growth is largely carried by the needs in terms of computing power, in particular in the context of training and the development of artificial intelligence models, or language models. Trends vary largely according to the typology of actors. Unsurprisingly, cloud suppliers and telecom operators are the most greedy, with an average increased increase of 14.4% of their electricity consumption. The argument of energy consumption has now become central to digital companies, assigned as much by the increase in their needs as by increases in energy prices. It is this card notably that the French government has chosen to play at the Summit for AI that took place in January, with some success.

Curiously, the AI experience on this phone may not match what you've seen from the company's high-end smartphones. Google has confirmed to Ars that the phone's lower memory prevented it from implementing the full suite of Pixel AI features. Google's approach to AI has changed substantially since the Pixel 8a launched, with some of the Pixel 9's hallmark features relying on local AI processing through the smartphone-optimized Gemini Nano. The Pixel 9a has it, but it's smaller than the Gemini Nano model on other Pixel 9s. The Pixel 9a has less RAM than the flagship Pixels, which standardized on 12GB largely to provide Gemini Nano with reserved memory without impeding performance. However, the Pixel 9a still just has 8GB of memory, which is a problem for local AI processing. This is the first Google phone to ship with a new super-small AI model. It saves on resources but can't support some of the best Pixel AI features. This is a familiar problem for Google, which initially disappointed Pixel 8 owners last year when it said Gemini Nano wouldn't come to that phone. Google reversed course several weeks later and released Gemini Nano as a developer preview despite the phone only having 8GB of RAM.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pixar films tend to go through a lot of changes during production but it’s rare we get to see those changes as publicly as we have with Elio. Originally announced as a spring 2024 release, Elio shifted release dates multiple times and it’ll now hit theaters June 20. A third trailer was just released and, compared to the others, it feels like a completely new and different movie. When we first heard about Elio way back in 2022, it was supposed to be about a boy who gets taken into space and mistaken as the sole representative of Earth. Instead, it focuses on that same boy, Elio (Yonas Kibreab) making his first real friend, an alien named Glordon (Remy Edgerly), a character that was barely seen in previous trailers. A character-driven story of friendship set in space. You can already imagine all the hijinks and problems this is going to create for both characters. Plus, there’s the bigger threat and we can assume Elio is still going to save Earth somehow. The Glordon character isn’t in it at all and his father Grigon (Brad Garrett), who is clearly the bad guy in the new trailer, is referred to as an “Ambassador,” not “Lord.” It sure seems like he was previously either a good guy or served a different purpose. Now, to be fair, that’s a very early teaser trailer. The movie could still be about something else. We don’t know if Glordon is in it. However, in Elio’s case, we actually got another trailer too. This is also a teaser trailer but it’s from months later and it very clearly shows something new taking shape. In retrospect, it’s basically a bridge between the two. There’s the one single shot of him with Glordon, so that’s at least in there, but potentially not the focus. And Grigon now has a more ominous look about him. Presumably earlier versions of Elio weren’t working as well as the studio wanted and Pixar made changes to improve it. That usually happens behind the scenes though so it’s fun to see a hint of it in the marketing. Elio features the voices of Yonas Kibreab, Remy Edgerly, Zoe Saldaña, Brad Garrett, Jameela Jamil, and Shirley Henderson.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hasbro will produce the series, which will reinvent the franchise for a whole new generation of fans while delighting those who already know and love the world of Power Rangers. It featured five teenagers who gain the ability to “morph” into superheroes known as the Power Rangers, complete with their own mech fighters. A film version of the series that starred most of the original cast was released in 1995, with a second one in 1997 (this one featured only a few original cast members). Lionsgate and Saban Film attempted to reboot the original “Power Rangers” franchise in 2017 as a gritty, YA adaptation. Hasbro then acquired Power Rangers in 2018 in a deal designed to capitalize on the franchise’s full potential across all of the company’s divisions. The development of “Power Rangers” is part of Hasbro Entertainment’s ongoing strategy to elevate storytelling and produce series based on Hasbro’s most iconic brands alongside the industry’s best talent, studios and distribution platforms. Beyond “Power Rangers,” Hasbro Entertainment’s active projects include a re-imagining of “Clue” across film and television with Sony’s TriStar Pictures and Sony Pictures Television; a live-action “Dungeons & Dragons” series “Forgotten Realms,” currently in development at Netflix with Academy Award nominee Shawn Levy executive producing; showrunner Terry Matalas’ animated “Magic: The Gathering” series, currently in production at Netflix; a major, live-action film and television universe adapted from “Magic: The Gathering,” produced alongside Legendary Entertainment; and game shows based on “Trivial Pursuit” and “Scrabble,” which both premiered on The CW this past fall. It just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third. Other credits include the critically acclaimed series “The Old Man,” starring Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow for FX. Both series are produced by 20th Television/The Walt Disney Company, where Steinberg and Shotz have housed their production company, Quaker Moving Pictures, since 2019.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Manifesto of Ventotene was conceived and written in the winter of 1941 by Altiero Spinelli, a former communist militant expelled by the party for his criticisms of Stalinism, and Ernesto Rossi, economist and militant of the liberal socialist movement "Justice and freedom", both anti -fascist intellectuals sent to the political confinement on the island of Ventotene, a small island of the Tyrrhenian Se open sky. In this environment of intellectual resistance, Spinelli and Rossi, with the significant contribution of the socialist Jew Eugenio Colorni, developed their vision of a radically transformed post-war Europe. This work of clandestine diffusion represented the first concrete step towards the creation of a European federalist movement that would take place in August 1943. Spinelli and Rossi's interest in the European dimension, and not only Italian, was born from their belief that the nationalism and absolute sovereignty of the States were the profound causes of totalitarianisms and world wars. For them, fighting fascism in Italy was not enough: it was necessary to rethink the entire European system that had generated similar political monsters. While the previous projects of European unity, such as the Pan-Europe of Kalergi of 1922, imagined a union led by Tecnocrati, Spinelli and Rossi dreamed of the United States of Europe a true federation with a parliament and a democratic government with real powers in key sectors such as economy and foreign policy, while national states would have maintained large autonomies in all other ambites. This balance between central and local powers, guaranteed by a federal constitution, should have prevented both the European fragmentation that had led to the wars and the creation of a centralized superstated. An exaggeration, seen with today's eyes, but that must be historicized. Corriere della Sera stresses that after all this vision is very similar to that of the Italian Constitution, which allowed operations such as the nationalization of electricity in the sixties. As the courier still notes, "to recall himself at the Ventotene Manifesto does not mean swearing loyalty on each syllable", so much so that Spinelli himself in his memories recognized limits and naivety. In short, discussing a fundamental text only to tickle the instincts of their audience and in a delicate moment it is a somewhat too casual operation - and avoidable - for the head of a government and a party that (in recent years) is said to Europeist.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://deadline.com/2025/03/coyote-vs-acme-movie-deal-sale-warner-bros-ketchup-1236329381/'>Warner Bros Negotiating Big Sale Of Shelved ‘Coyote Vs. Acme’ Movie: The Dish</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 16:48:27 <p>
EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros‘ shelved movie Coyote vs. Acme finally might have found a new home with the studio deep in sale negotiations, we can reveal. The pact isn’t finalized and there’s still a chance it doesn’t make, but it’s heading in the right direction. The deal would mark a significant and record outlay for Ketchup, whose previous releases have included Michael Keaton starrer Goodrich, comic book reboot Hellboy: The Crooked Man, Ben Affleck thriller Hypnotic, and Michel Franco’s Jessica Chastain drama Memory. Directed by David Green and written by May December scribe Samy Burch, as well as DC Studios co-boss James Gunn and Jeremy Slater, Coyote vs. Acme is based on the Looney Tunes characters and the New Yorker humor article “Coyote v. Acme” by Ian Frazier. Will Forte, John Cena and Lana Condor star in the movie, which follows Wile E. Coyote, who, after Acme products fail him one too many times in his dogged pursuit of the Roadrunner, decides to hire a billboard lawyer to sue the Acme Corporation. The case pits Wile E. and his lawyer (Forte) against the latter’s intimidating former boss (Cena), but a growing friendship between man and cartoon stokes their determination to win. Despite test-screening well, the project became a high-profile casualty of WB cost-cutting two years ago and it has been sitting on the shelf for more than a year. Studio sources claim to us that they didn’t get any offers at the time. It’s not entirely clear at this stage what WB’s tax write-down was on Coyote vs Acme, or whether there was one in the end. As part of a February 2024 earnings filing, Warner BRos Discovery said it wrote off $115M in content due to abandoning films in the third quarter of 2023; there was speculation Coyote was included in that fire sale. David Zaslav’s Warner Bros previously pulled the plug on high-profile pics such as Batgirl and the animated Scoob Holiday Haunt! In this instance, Ketchup has enacted a rescue operation. Ketchup released the film theatrically this past weekend, taking in $3.1M off a strong screen count of 2,827. Both The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie and Coyote vs Acme were intended for HBO Max, having been greenlit in December 2020 as a streaming release by the prior studio leadership. Los Angeles-based Brit Gareth West launched Ketchup more than a decade ago to release movies, but not a great deal has been reported about his background or how the company is financed. Last fall, Ketchup partnered with Zero Gravity Management and Ozark producer Mark Williams on a TV division.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One aims to be super intelligence, the other not. "Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity," company CEO Sam Altman wrote on his blog. "In a sense, AGI is just one tool that is an extension of the foothold of innovation that humanity has built up so far," he said. However, Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest strategic partner, takes a slightly different stance. During a panel called "Building Trustworthy AI: Evolving Safety Practices for GenAI" held at SXSW the other day, Sarah Bird, CPO of Microsoft's Responsible AI division, spoke about the relationship between the two companies. "At first glance, it seems like there's tension between the two companies, but that's not what happened in reality," Bird said. Rather, Bird believes that OpenAI's big goals create "bold ideas" and is a driving force behind pursuing new capabilities that have never existed before. The reason Microsoft is not pursuing AGI is because they want to provide AI "working with people" rather than completely replacing humans. We have a lot of people at our company, which is really great. Rather, I hope it will be a technology that will help people improve human abilities by doing things that humans are not good at or don't want to do instead," says Bird.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Trump administration might be looking to give HIV a hand. The federal government is reportedly eyeing drastic cuts to its funding for HIV prevention efforts at home. And the money spent on preventing HIV certainly seems to have gone a long way. These successes and the arrival of highly effective medications that can manage chronic HIV infection or even prevent cases if taken proactively have made it possible to envision a future where HIV is no longer a major public health threat. During his first term, Trump announced an initiative to end HIV locally by 2030. It was a plan, to his credit, that some outside experts lauded and saw as achievable with enough dedicated resources. But even at the time, there were reasons to be skeptical. In his second term, Trump appears to have abandoned any pretense for caring much about HIV at all. In early January, Trump issued an executive order to immediately pause most funding to USAID, the U.S. foreign aid agency that manages many programs, including the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program, or PEPFAR. Trump has since planned to cut nearly all jobs at USAID, though the status of this decision is currently still in legal limbo. According to the World Health Organization, eight countries are at risk of running out of HIV medications within the next few months due to USAID cuts. It’s not certain yet whether PEPFAR itself will be fully on the chopping block (even some of Trump’s conservative allies have pushed back against the idea). But Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE have already orchestrated sweeping layoffs at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (some employees have since been invited back). Should these funding cuts go through, it will unravel years, if not decades, of the world’s collective efforts to stop a once universally fatal disease.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

By utilizing an AI model based on LTM, the time required to change these settings can be reduced from days to minutes, while maintaining the same accuracy as manual or partially automated workflows. LTM is a technology that implements the concept of "HumanAI" that SoftBank's Advanced Technology Research Institute. Using the supercomputer "NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD", we learn a wide range of data sets, including the vast network data owned by SoftBank, as well as the design, management and operation know-how that we have cultivated over the years. It is said to be able to highly infer the design, management and operation of mobile networks. As the first of its fine-tuned AI models using LTM, SoftBank has developed a model specialized for optimizing base station settings that enhances mobile network operation. This model infers the settings of base stations intentionally excluded from the training data set and compares them with the actual settings optimized by an internal expert, and it turns out that similar settings were generated with a high accuracy of over 90%. Like the first installment, by fine tuning for each use case based on LTM, it is possible to easily develop dedicated AI models that can be used in a variety of situations in mobile network operation. It will also serve as the foundation that supports the efforts of "AI for RAN" to use AI to improve the performance of RAN (Radio Access Networks), and in the future, it will be applied to a variety of applications, including formulating network design guidelines and developing network optimization AI agents. In the future, we aim to continue research and development and introduce it to our company.

The saga of director Carl Erik Rinsch and Netflix deal has been going on for years. The streamer has been trying to claw its money back from the guy for a long time and Rinsch has spent a lot of the last five years in and out of court hearings related to his divorce and arbitration rooms related to curdled Netflix deal. “Carl Rinsch allegedly stole more than $11 million from a prominent streaming platform to finance lavish purchases and personal investments instead of completing a promised television series,” FBI Assistant Director Leslie Backschies said in a press release about the case. Rinsch was five years out from the failure of 47 Ronin, but streamers were tossing money at every half-baked idea on the planet, desperate to fill their services with content. “Those clones were banished to a walled area in a Brazilian city, where they began developing advanced technology and came into conflict with humans and each other. The horseman who sits upon a pale horse is Death. The plan was to make a 13-episode show that would run about two and a half hours and air as episodes that ran 4 to 10 minutes long. He punched holes in the wall and would vanish. Yet, somehow, he convinced Netflix to give him another $11 million. The forensic tracking on those millions is well documented. According to the charging documents, Rinsch moved the funds out of his production company and into personal bank accounts before consolidating them into a trust. Then he made bad investments and lost half of it. It paid off and he pocketed a cool $27 million. “Thank you and god bless crypto,” he said in an online chat with a crypto-exchange rep as he pulled the money out of Doge and into his bank account. Then, according to the FBI, Rinsch went on a spending spree. At the time, he claimed Netflix owed him $14 million. The streaming wars are over and we’ll never see White Horse. It sucks that the hard work of the cast and crew will go up in smoke, but Rinsch’s antics are probably more entertaining than a sci-fi epic made from 10-minute-long episodes about super-intelligent clones.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/what-to-watch-if-you-like-severance-streaming-2000577595'>8 TV Shows and Movies to Watch After You Finish Severance</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 16:15:38 <p>
To help your tempers recalibrate when Severance wraps up, here are eight TV shows and movies that might help fill the yawning void it will leave behind. You don’t even have to exit the Apple TV+ app for Dark Matter. Like Severance, it explores themes of how wildly divergent personalities can evolve from a single person—and involves weird tech that seems like a pretty cool invention until the horrible consequences start making themselves known. Joel Edgerton is less endearing of a hero than Severance‘s Adam Scott, but you’ll still want to root for him to reunite with his beloved, played by Jennifer Connelly. Do you long for more workplace weirdness after all those Lumon elevator rides? Devs, created, written, and directed by Alex Garland (who’s best-known for his big-screen credits: Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, the upcoming 28 Years Later) takes place at a mysterious tech company with sci-fi leanings (much like Severance) and involves a murder mystery (also much like Severance). It also has the Severance-like quality of boasting a killer cast, including Nick Offerman, Sonoya Mizuno, Cailee Spaeny, Alison Pill, and others. Quite obviously, Black Mirror and Severance have some thematic echoes, chief among them that tech can be scary—especially if its inventor or wielder has cult-like aspirations and/or fancies themselves to be a god. You can also stream the previous six Black Mirror seasons in case you want to experience something bleaker than our current reality in the meantime. But really, the four seasons we did get remain some of sci-fi television’s finest hours, exploring a world where robots are so lifelike their AI slips into the realm of the fully sentient—with the added bonus of imaginative settings (a Wild West playground for rich people, a futuristic city where humans have fallen under robot control) and an incredible cast, including Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, and Thandiwe Newton. The only thing we can fault Westworld for isn’t the doing of the show itself; HBO yanked it from streaming a few years back, so you’ll have to fork out extra dollars to rent or buy it on streaming (Prime Video has it), or purchase the complete series on Blu-ray, DVD, or 4K UHD. Jessie Buckley, Jeremy Allen White, Luke Wilson, and Riz Ahmed star in this offbeat sci-fi romance—made for Apple TV+—set in a world where technology has supposedly cracked the formula of true love. When Buckley’s character takes a job there, she soon begins to question her own relationship, as well as whether or not the Love Institute is actually helping or hurting people. It’s a gripping sci-fi thriller that proves you don’t need a big budget or even more than one set, really, to tell an entertainingly original story, and it’s also perfect viewing for anyone who found themselves second-guessing Severance‘s Helena/Helly R. twist. Coherence is widely available on streaming, including Peacock and Prime Video. Bliss also offers a thoughtful exploration of what it means to appreciate what you have in life—while also learning to accept the grimier stuff you’d rather just delete with the ease of a keystroke. This sci-fi series that ran on what was then HBO Max in 2021-2022 starred Cristin Milioti (The Penguin, Black Mirror) as a woman whose attempts to escape her dysfunctional marriage to an eccentric tech billionaire (Billy Magnussem) are complicated by the fact that she has a chip designed to spy on every aspect of her life, including her emotions, implanted in her brain. Made for Love was delightfully original and would absolutely fit in with a Severance-adjacent streaming binge, except it’s no longer available on Max— and is in fact not streaming legally anywhere.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 19th, NEC announced that it had implemented a demonstration of a road vehicle coordination system to support autonomous driving. The road conditions are analyzed from roadside camera footage and transmitted to self-driving vehicles, improving the safety and smoothness of automated driving operations. Images of camera footage and installation equipment Images of camera footage and installation equipment This demonstration experiment was conducted based on a public recruitment by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Road Bureau, "Automatic driving demonstration experiment aimed at technical verification of road and vehicle coordination systems and driving space." The road vehicle coordination system analyzes footage from a 4K camera installed on the roadside and sends information such as pedestrians, bicycles and other traffic participants, as well as the position and speed of vehicles, to the on-board systems of self-driving vehicles and tablet devices. The accuracy of detection of information obtained from these roadside sensors, low latency, and usefulness in driving self-driving vehicles has been confirmed. Due to the declining birthrate and aging population and the concentration of population in urban areas, it is necessary to maintain and secure local public transport, but the introduction of autonomous driving mobile services can sometimes be difficult to grasp the situation using on-board sensors alone, such as at urban intersections, which are complex road environments where ordinary vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles are mixed. In this demonstration experiment, we technically verified the road vehicle coordination system, including "recognition of oncoming vehicles approaching from afar when turning right at a traffic light intersection" and "recognition of other traffic participants around non-signal crossings with poor visibility." In this demonstration, information on road vehicle coordination systems was directly provided to systems of self-driving vehicles in some areas. In the future, further development and collaboration with related companies will be carried out to actually apply information from road and vehicle coordination systems to autonomous driving operations to achieve safe and smooth autonomous driving.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

NASA captured another, albeit less-cinematic view of the lunar sunset using one of its payloads delivered aboard Blue Ghost. Firefly’s lunar lander touched down on the lunar surface on Sunday, March 2, packed with 10 NASA instruments designed to probe the lunar surface and gather data to support future human missions to the Moon. The mission is part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative to send payloads to the Moon on a regular basis using commercial spacecraft. Blue Ghost completed 14 days of surface operations, deploying its various payloads and transmitting more than 119 gigabytes of data back to Earth. Firefly has shared some incredible footage captured by its lander throughout the duration of its mission. Blue Ghost also captured a total solar eclipse from the Moon on March 14, while Earth simultaneously experienced a total lunar eclipse. With its “Ghost Riders to the Sky” mission, Firefly became the second company to land on the Moon and the first to do it with its lander ending up in an upright position (Intuitive Machines landed on the Moon in February 2024, but its Odysseus lander tipped over on its side).

The doubt will remain once again as regards Kanye West, who has just released his new album, Bully. But as usual he had to do things in his own way: the new album, which comes four years after the previous Donda and who follows the collaborative project Vultures with Ty Dolla Sign by just one year, is not found on the classic streaming platforms. West, or Ye that you want, has spread it through its profile on X/Twitter: the usual racs and the disconnected messages then punctually deleted, the rapper has in fact inserted a series of links in his posts that refer to a video hosting site; Through appropriately communicated password, you can access the vision of some films, created in collaboration with the visionary artist Hype Williams, former director of many video clips of several great names of rap and already usual collaborator of West. A few hours later he released three links that refer respectively to three versions of the same film, or a "screening version," a "Post Hype Version" and a "Post Post Hype Version". In the videos you can see Saint West, the son had from Kim Kardashian in 2015, who faces some masked wrestlers on a ring with a club. The publication of the album in this decidedly unorthodox way took place in the midst of a series of other rather delusional tweets (later deleted), in which West took it with Jay Z, Beyoncé and their children, but also against the record companies ("French and Jewish record companies deal with artists as prostitutes", wrote and then removed at a certain point). The idea behind Bully had already been announced during a concert in China in September 2024 and seems to have been inspired by a fact that really happened to the same son Saint, who called bully after knowing that he had kicked a schoolmate because he was "weak". Despite the heterodoxy of the distribution method, many on social networks are appreciating the musical content of Bully, which contains several soul samples (among the most recognizable that of You Can't Hurry Love of the Supremes) and also for the first time a rap in Spanish by Kanye West himself. It is difficult to say how much this album and the related visuals will remain available, given the notorious tendency of the rapper to erase everything he writes. Certainly it is yet another gimmick that makes us talk about him, who once again heads the thousand facets of social attention.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Deep Research is available as part of the ChatGPT Pro plan, which costs $200 per month. It takes a query, such as “Write me a report on the Massachusetts health insurance industry,” or “Tell me about WIRED’s coverage of the Department of Government Efficiency,” and then comes up with a plan, searching for relevant websites, combing through their content, and deciding what links to click and what information deserves further investigation. After exploring for sometimes tens of minutes, it synthesizes its findings into a detailed report, which may include citations, data, and charts.

The Deep Research model itself goes through an artificial kind of reasoning before devising a plan and moving forward with each step. The model provides details of this reasoning behind its research in a side window. “Sometimes it’s like ‘I need to backtrack, this doesn't seem that promising,’” says Josh Tobin, another OpenAI researcher involved in building Deep Research.

Half-Life 2 isn't hard to run by any means, being released in late 2004 and needing no more a 256MB of RAM, a 1.2 GHz processor, and a DirectX 7 compatible graphics card from 20 years back -- at least that's what the launch requirements mandated. YouTuber Budget-Builds Official did just that by putting Pine Technology's 3D Phantom XP 2800 through its paces and highlighting the many compromises you need to make to achieve a stable experience. In an attempt to (graphically) resuscitate the now 20-year-old classic that's Half-Life 2 for modern systems, Orbifold Studios are in full steam developing Half-Life 2 RTX, with all the bells of whistles of ray-tracing, enhanced textures, realistic lightning, and more. Showcasing the prowess of Nvidia's RTX Remix technology, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is available free of cost for existing Half-Life 2 owners on Steam. In 2005, Pine Technology (now the parent company of XFX) launched the 3D Phantom 2800 XP, which was essentially a cut-down SiS 305, a 2000 offering from Silicon Integrated Systems. The add-in card is functionally no more than a display adapter, with 8MB of SDR (Synchronous DRAM), DirectX 6 support, a measly 3W rating, and fabbed on an ancient 250nm process node.

A computer scientist who tried to register an artwork that credited an artificial intelligence system as the sole author lost his appeal on Tuesday. A three-judge panel for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously agreed with the Copyright Office that Stephen Thaler's AI software cannot be granted authorship. Copyright law "requires all work to be authored in the first instance by a human being," Judge Patricia Millett wrote in her opinion. "Because many of the Copyright Act's provisions make sense only if an author is a human being, the best reading of the Copyright Act is that human authorship is required for registration," Millett wrote. Thaler had tried to argue that copyright laws were woefully outdated, and laws should change to copyright works made by a generative AI software that he created called the "Creativity Machine." He further claimed that "judicial opinions 'from the Gilded Age' could not settle the question of whether computer-generated works are copyrightable today." Nowhere in the Copyright Act is "author" defined, Thaler argued, potentially leaving room for today's courts to interpret the statute as permitting wholly AI-generated works to be copyrighted. If the court did not take his side, Thaler fretted that artists wouldn't be incentivized to use AI to produce creative works, defeating the purpose of copyright laws, he argued. "Nothing in the Copyright Act requires human creation," Thaler argued in court last January, Reuters reported. "What the Act's language indicates is that when an entity—a natural person, a corporation, a machine—generates a creative work, that entity is the author."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Family members of people who died in Tesla crashes are urging the US Department of Transportation not to scrap a Biden-era rule requiring companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles. They also say they are worried that Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s influence in the Trump administration may lead the department to weaken oversight of his company. In a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, seven families say they are “deeply concerned” that the federal government would water down oversight of driver assist technology like Tesla’s Autopilot. Before the inauguration, Reuters reported that Trump’s transition team was discussing eliminating a standing general order issued under Biden requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems. “Just as your family has experienced the life-shattering consequences of a preventable motor vehicle collision, we’ve had our own devastating experiences, all of which were caused by Tesla’s autonomous driving technology being released onto the roadways without the necessary safeguards,” they write. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 1,800 crashes to the federal government. The recall wasn’t a physical recall, but rather an over-the-air software update meant to address issues around driver inattention and Tesla’s warning systems, which NHTSA said has contributed to hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths. NHTSA later launched a probe into whether Tesla’s software fix was sufficient to address the defect. The families urge Duffy to keep the rule in place and ensure “active investigations into Tesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving continue free from improper influence.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. Google’s brand new midrange phone, the Pixel 9A, won’t be shipping until sometime in April. That’s not strange in and of itself, but it turns out you can’t even preorder one from the Google Store yet. The latter situation is fairly unusual, as Google normally starts taking orders for new hardware right after announcing it. There’s a reason for this limited product “launch”: Google originally intended to get the Pixel 9A out the door in March, but it’s been held back for some last-minute quality checks. We’ve asked Google if it can specify which component is at issue here. The Pixel lineup has a decent track record when it comes to hardware reliability, but there have been exceptions. In January, Google issued an urgent firmware update for the long-discontinued Pixel 4A to address battery overheating concerns. Last year, Google extended warranty coverage for display defects on the Pixel 8, and prior to that, the Pixel 4A 5G suffered from touchscreen troubles after a software update in 2021. The company’s early Tensor chips were also known to run uncomfortably warm at times.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"One thing is that we develop this in-house now, so instead of relying on suppliers with long deadlines and long process and sending requirements back and forth, we develop the software," said Erik Coelingh, VP of product at Zenseact, an ADAS developer owned by Volvo. "If there's something, we solve it in a day," Coelingh said. As Bakkenes said, we're all testing with the new software every single day. So the innovation speed is fundamentally different than before, and the way we try to use this is to really build safety and go toward lower accident rates in a pace that we've never seen before." Among the advantages of moving to SDVs is that it's much easier to simulate them since the entire software stack can be run virtually. But how does such a safety-conscious company like Volvo know it can trust the output of those end-to-end algorithms? "Gaussian splatting is a technology where we can take one point, one traffic scenario, and explode it into thousands or tens of thousands of scenarios from this real-world data," Coelingh said. Autonomous vehicle developers have been simulating in environments like Unreal Engine for some time now. But here we're probing lidar data, camera data, radar data, and we reconstruct the scene with the neural net, and then do the manipulation and use closed-loop simulation," Coelingh said.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/nvidia-gretel-acquisition-synthetic-training-data/'>Nvidia Bets Big on Synthetic Data</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 15:27:27 <p>
Nvidia has acquired synthetic data firm Gretel for nine figures, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal. The acquisition comes as Nvidia has been rolling out synthetic data generation tools, so that developers can train their own AI models and fine-tune them for specific apps. Gretel was founded in 2019 by Alex Watson, John Myers, and Ali Golshan, who also serves as CEO. The startup offers a synthetic data platform and a suite of APIs to developers who want to build generative AI models, but don’t have access to enough training data or have privacy concerns around using real people’s data. Gretel doesn’t build and license its own frontier AI models, but fine-tunes existing open source models to add differential privacy and safety features, then packages those together to sell them. Proponents say this makes the data generation required to build AI models more scalable, less labor intensive, and more accessible to smaller or less-resourced AI developers. Privacy-protection is another key selling point of synthetic data, making it an appealing option for health care providers, banks, and government agencies. Last June, Nvidia began rolling out a family of open AI models that generate synthetic training data for developers to use in building or fine-tuning LLMs. Called Nemotron-4 340B, these mini-models can be used by developers to drum up synthetic data for their own LLMs across “health care, finance, manufacturing, retail, and every other industry.” During his keynote presentation at Nvidia’s annual developer conference this Tuesday, Nvidia cofounder and chief executive Jensen Huang spoke about the challenges the industry faces in rapidly scaling AI in a cost-effective way. “There are three problems that we focus on,” he said. And then three, what are the scaling laws?” Huang went on to describe how the company is now using synthetic data generation in its robotics platforms.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The European Space Agency (ESA) has just published a rich set of data that includes a preview of the deep fields. In the next few years Euclid will return to observe these three regions dozens of times, capturing many other distant galaxies. "Euclid proves once again to be an 'discovery engine'. Recall that Euclid was launched in July 2023 and started his routine scientific observations on February 14, 2024.

Lionsgate has released a new trailer for the John Wick spin-off movie with too many SEO-centric words stuffed in its title, From the World of John Wick: Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas. Long-ass name aside, the new trailer kicks all kinds of ass. Set to the dark movie trailer rendition of Charli XCX’s Brat bop, “Von Dutch,” the trailer opens on a Slavic mythological monologue about a kikimora spirit that enacts vengeance on people with darkness in their hearts, while serving as the protector of the innocent. It doesn’t take a college degree to surmise that the monologue intercutting with the previous Ballerina trailer’s footage of De Arma’s Eve tearing shit up in a nightclub would hint very clearly at her being said kikimora. Our guess is her shooting a woman in the crotch denotes that the unfortunate soul had darkness in their heart that needed to be dealt with expeditiously. As we’ve seen in the past trailer, Eve is on a warpath to find the people who killed her father. After blowing people up with grenades behind a door, lighting people on fire with a flamethrower, and shooting fools from the open door of her t-bonned car, the only thing left standing in Eve’s way is a showdown with John Wick. Sure, we know they’re gonna fight, and it’s probably gonna look fantastic, but maybe don’t show them being hunky dory in our first look and defuse all the tension from their quarrel? To the trailer’s credit, knowing the film takes place in the middle of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4 leaves room to wonder whether Eve survives her revenge tour. Guess we’ll have to wait and find out what becomes of Eve when Ballerina releases on June 6.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Sometimes, it's the simpler ideas that require quite a bit of work to make them run flawlessly. Today we've got an example of just that in the form of a Raspberry Pi project put together by maker and developer NeverCode. Using our favorite microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico, NeverCode has created a DIY smart clock that has tons of cool features you can replicate at home. Build the Ultimate DIY Smart Clock with Raspberry Pi Pico W - GrokClok Tutorial! This smart clock has a handful of add-ons, including two LCD displays and a keypad you can use for user input. Because it uses a Pico W, you get the added benefit of integrating network connectivity. To adjust settings on the clock, NeverCode developed a menu for navigation. NeverCode was kind enough to make the project open source, which means you can easily follow along with the instructions and recreate it for yourself at home.

AMD recently announced that its first run of 200,000 RX 9070-series GPUs has nearly sold out. According to BenchLife.info [machine translated], AMD made this claim during its Advancing AI summit recently held in Beijing, China, where it also talked about the recent release of its Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips. And while Team Red has had months to stockpile graphics cards at retailers, the unprecedented demand for the RX 9070 XT meant that supply was quickly cleared out by frustrated gamers. Even legitimate retailers have reportedly been selling base models at a 22% markup, with some attributing this to tariffs. AMD hasn’t released any data to back up its 200K GPU claim, so we can't verify how accurate its sales claim is. After all, we can see this with the better availability of RX 9070 GPUs versus Nvidia’s 50-series. Team Green has already admitted to a GPU shortage with its RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs. Rumors have swirled that Nvidia supply should improve in the coming months, while an AMD AIB claims that GPU supply for AMD will stabilize by April. While news like this may give us hope for an affordable latest-gen GPU that’s readily available, the way Nvidia has been treating gaming GPUs makes us inclined to not believe anything until we see stocks arrive. As for AMD, it now has the chance to claw back some market share from Nvidia if it can take advantage of the situation and deliver 9070-series stocks before Team Green ramps up deliveries and fills the market with 50-series GPUs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the US astronauts stranded for nine months on the International Space Station, finally made it home on Tuesday, March 18. They returned to Earth with the two members of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission—NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Roscosmos—aboard SpaceX's Dragon Freedom spacecraft. Teams aboard SpaceX recovery craft boarded Dragon Freedom and assisted the crew. Sunita Lyn “Suni” Williams, 59, and Barry Eugene “Butch” Wilmore, 62, lifted off on June 5, 2024, on a mission to test Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft designed to transport crew to and from the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit. The astronauts had not planned to spend more than two weeks in space, but technical issues with Starliner thwarted that plan. As it approached the space station, some of Starliner’s thrusters stopped working. While Williams and Wilmore’s extended stay in space was unplanned, they had trained for potentially having to stay on the ISS for a number of months. In order for the astronauts to return home, NASA decided to send only two astronauts instead of four on the subsequent SpaceX mission. While the stranded astronauts were prepared for these inconveniences, their condition became a political issue between the administrations of US presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to “We are thrilled to have Suni, Butch, Nick, and Aleksandr home after their monthslong mission conducting vital science, technology demonstrations, and maintenance aboard the International Space Station,” said NASA acting dministrator Janet Petro in a statement. “Per President Trump’s direction, NASA and SpaceX worked diligently to pull the schedule a month earlier.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230616/'>Why is RCS introduced even though there is a "+Message"? --We asked President Takahashi about KDDI's intentions (Ishikawa Atsushi)</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 14:46:00 <p>
ついにiPhoneとAndroid間を無料で電話番号だけで動画や写真を送れるようになる。

といっても「すでにLINEがあるじゃん」とお思いの人も多いだろう。確かにLINEアプリを使えば、相手がiPhoneだろうがAndroidだろうが、無料で動画や写真を送り合える。ただ、相手のLINE IDをあらかじめ知っておく必要がある。

また、NTTドコモ、KDDI、ソフトバンクが提供する「＋メッセージ」や、楽天モバイルの「Rakuten Link」といったメッセージアプリもある。とはいえ、これらもあらかじめ相手がアプリをインストールしていないと利用できないという制約がある。

●電話番号だけで写真を送受信できる「RCS」とは

今回新しく始まる、iPhoneとAndroid間を無料、かつ電話番号だけで動画や写真を送受信できるサービスは「RCS」というものだ。

RCSはもともと世界のキャリアが導入を進めていたが、グーグルが普及に積極的に関与するようになった。さらにグーグルや欧州からの圧力によって、アップルがようやくRCSに対応したのだった。

これまでiPhoneには「iMessage」アプリがあり、iPhone同士であれば写真や動画を無料で送り合えていた。しかし、iPhoneからAndroidに送る場合は「テキストのみ」というさみしい状況であった。

今回、iPhoneがRCSに対応したことで、AndroidとiPhone間であっても高精細な写真や動画を送り合えるようになる。iPhone側は新たにアプリを入れる必要は無い。

ただ、RCSの利用には国内キャリアの対応が必要だ。

そんな中、RCSに積極的な姿勢を見せているのがKDDIだ。

KDDIは2024年5月、RCSをベースとした「Google メッセージ」アプリをAndroidスマートフォンに標準搭載していくと発表。

さらに、3月からはiPhoneユーザーに対してRCSのオプション提供を試験的に始めている。実際、日本国内でiPhoneにおけるRCSは正式サービスにはなっていないが、開発者向けに提供されている次期バージョン「iOS 18.4」で、auやUQモバイルのiPhoneユーザーはRCSを使えるようになっている。

iOS 18.4の正式リリース以降、Androidユーザーは「Google メッセージ」アプリから、iPhoneユーザーは「iMessage」アプリから、電話番号で高精細な画像や動画を無料で送り合えるようになる。

●KDDIは＋メッセージに見切りをつけた？

では、なぜKDDIはこれまで他のキャリアと共に「＋メッセージ」を訴求していたにも関わらず、RCSに乗り換えるようなことをするのか。

そもそも、＋メッセージは「LINE対抗」という意味合いが強かったサービスといえた。かつて、ケータイが全盛だった頃は「iモードメール」や「EZwebメール」といったようにキャリアが提供するメールサービスが圧倒的なシェアを誇っていた。

しかし、スマートフォンの時代になると、ユーザー間のメッセージのやりとりはLINEが掌握してしまった。ユーザーとの接点を逃したキャリアとしては面白くないわけで、3社が手を取り合って＋メッセージを始めたというわけだ。

しかし、2011年にLINEがサービスを開始したのに対して、＋メッセージは2018年と7年も遅れでの開始だった。2024年4月現在で4000万人のユーザーがいるとされる＋メッセージだが、時すでに遅く、必ずしもアクティブに利用されているとは思えないのが現状だ。

では、KDDIは＋メッセージは失敗だと捉え、早々に「見切り」をつけてしまったのか。

KDDIで代表取締役社長を務める高橋誠氏はRCSに注力する理由として「＋メッセージでもいいが、インフラが高い。RCSなら安くなる。それが一番の目的。iPhoneがRCSに対応したのも大きい」と語る。

キャリアとしては、＋メッセージを送受信するためのインフラを整備する必要がある。しかも国内キャリア専用の設備になるため、設備投資はどうしても高くなる。

また、＋メッセージは企業がユーザーに対して、ダイレクトにメッセージを送れるマーケティングツールとしても利用できるが、費用がかかる割にユーザーが少なく効果が薄いという弱点もある。

RCSになれば、iPhoneユーザーにもリーチでき、費用対効果が高まると期待される。単にユーザー間のメッセージツールだけでなく、企業向けのマーケティングツールとして販売するにはRCSのほうが期待できるというわけだ。

●RCSと「Gemini」「スターリンク」を組み合わせる構想も

KDDIではこのRCSに、グーグルのAIサービス「Gemini」、さらには衛星通信の「スターリンク」を組み合わせてサービスを提供しようとしている。

「今後、衛星とスマホの直接通信できるようになる。衛星経由での高速データ通信は今のところできないが『Gemini経由での処理』は可能になりそう。例えば電波が届かない山の中などで『この近くに泊まりたい。どうしたらいい？』とGeminiに問い合わせると答えが衛星経由で返ってくる。そこにちょっとした写真が添えられていたりする」（高橋社長）

KDDIではRCSをベースに様々なサービスを載せていく考えのようだ。

もともと、高橋社長は1999年にEZwebを作った張本人だ。RCSに様々な企業がサービスを提供し、ユーザーは企業とメッセージを通じてサービスを享受できるようになりそうだ。

「このあたりは、モバイルインターネットに取り組んできたときの血が騒ぐ。APIを公開して、いろんなプレイヤーを連れてきて、利用できるサービスを広げていく。そのほうが断然面白い」（高橋社長）。

●他キャリアはどうする

ちなみに、他社がRCSに対応するかといえば、ソフトバンクはやはり傘下にLINEヤフーを持っているだけに、そのあたりのサービスはLINEが引き続き担っていくのだろう。楽天モバイルはRakuten Linkを持ち、＋メッセージにも近寄らなかったことを考えると、あくまで独自の路線を貫きそうだ。

そんななか、NTTドコモがRCSに対して、どんな判断をするかが注目と言えそうだ。

LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday outlined the steps that Apple must take to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to work better with competing technologies. It’s the first time the EU has moved to compel a technology company to comply with the bloc’s digital Digital Markets Act — a wide-ranging set of regulations designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies from cornering markets. After the DMA took effect a year ago, the EU’s executive Commission moved swiftly to open a raft of investigations into Big Tech companies. Brussels also opened two “ specification proceedings ” in September to spell out what Apple needs to do under the DMA, which aims to make digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable” by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services. In its legally binding decision, the commission detailed measures that the iPhone maker has to take involving nine connectivity features for its iOS operating system. The measures will give device and app makers better access to iPhone features that work with devices. The commission also laid out a second set of measures to make the process for software developers requesting access to iPhone features more transparent and effective. With its decision, Brussels is “providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera said in a press release. “For too long, Apple has operated a walled garden around its products and prevented interoperability,” Director General Agustin Reyna said. The Commission also said Wednesday that Google wasn’t doing enough to comply with DMA. Despite making changes, including removing flight listings, Google was still giving preference to its own services in search results, it said. Google is also failing to let app developers steer users to cheaper options outside its Google Play Store app marketplace, the commission said in preliminary findings. Vice-President JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation, in a rebuke aimed at the EU’s sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act. However, both companies have been under pressure in the U.S. too. Apple is facing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing it of engineering an illegal smartphone monopoly. Meanwhile, federal antitrust regulators are seeking to break up Google after a federal judge ruled Google’s ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

At GTC 2025, former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger reiterated his oft-repeated claim that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 'got lucky' with the AI revolution but explained his rationale more in-depth. As GPUs have taken center stage in AI innovation, Nvidia is now one of the world's most valuable companies, while Intel is struggling. Fifteen to twenty years ago, Intel CPUs were the dominant force in computing as they handled all major workloads. During this time, Intel missed its AI and HPC opportunities with Larrabee, a project that attempted to build a GPU using the x86 CPU ISA. This affected performance and increased the complexity of software development. "I had a project that was well known in the industry called Larrabee and which was trying to bridge the programmability of the CPU with a throughput oriented architecture [of a GPU], and I think had Intel stay on that path, you know, the future could have been different," said Gelsinger during a webcast. "I give Jensen a lot of credit [as] he just stayed true to that throughput computing or accelerated [vision]." Unlike GPUs from AMD and Nvidia, which use proprietary instruction set architectures (ISAs), Intel's Larrabee used the x86 ISA with Larrabee-specific extensions. After the Xeon Phi 'Knights Mill' failed to meet expectations, Intel dropped the Xeon Phi project in favor of data center GPUs for HPC and specialized ASICs for AI between 2018 and 2019. To a large extent, Larrabee and its successors in the Xeon Phi line failed because they were based on a CPU ISA that did not scale well for graphics, AI, or HPC. Larrabee's failure was set in motion in the mid-2000s when CPUs were still dominant, and Intel's technical leads thought that x86 was a way to go. Fast forward to today, and Intel's attempts at adopting a more conventional GPU design for AI have largely failed, with the company recently canceling its Falcon Shores GPUs for data centers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Under this environment, we were able to successfully learn the large-scale language model (LLM) "tsuzumi" using "NVIDIA NeMo." By increasing the distribution of DCs, it is expected that optimal GPU resources can be arranged in a way that reuses excess GPU servers. Additionally, by utilizing DCs in each region and dispersing computing across multiple locations, power costs will be reduced and sustainable operation will be achieved. According to NTT Com, by utilizing bases A and bases B as well as bases C, you will be able to select multiple operational patterns that suit the customer's needs, depending on the amount of electricity supply and price of the land. Furthermore, from a network perspective, the system allows you to realize the possibility of scheduling such as distributed learning and inference according to the user's characteristics, such as workloads with lower latency between close-range locations, and workloads with power efficiency in mind between long-range locations. Specifically, NVIDIA accelerated servers were distributed to DCs at three locations, Kawasaki, Mitaka, and Akihabara, approximately 25-50km apart, and the DCs were connected via IOWN APN with a 100Gbps line. NVIDIA NeMo has linked three GPU servers to implement distributed learning for Tsuzumi's lightweight model, the 7B.

Powering spacecraft with solar energy may not seem like a challenge, given how intense the Sun’s light can feel on Earth. Even in the inner solar system, spacecraft such as lunar or Mars rovers need alternative power sources. As an astrophysicist and professor of physics, I teach a senior-level aerospace engineering course on the space environment. One of the key lessons I emphasize to my students is just how unforgiving space can be. In this extreme environment where spacecraft must withstand intense solar flares, radiation and temperature swings from hundreds of degrees below zero to hundreds of degrees above zero, engineers have developed innovative solutions to power some of the most remote and isolated space missions. So how do engineers power missions in the outer reaches of our solar system and beyond? But unlike the AAA batteries in your TV remote, RTGs can provide power for decades while hundreds of millions to billions of miles from Earth. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators do not rely on chemical reactions like the batteries in your phone. Instead, they rely on the radioactive decay of elements to produce heat and eventually electricity. Most RTGs are built using plutonium-238 as their source of energy, which is not usable for nuclear power plants since it does not sustain fission reactions. Instead, plutonium-238 is an unstable element that will undergo radioactive decay. Radioactive decay, or nuclear decay, happens when an unstable atomic nucleus spontaneously and randomly emits particles and energy to reach a more stable configuration. The radioactive decay of plutonium-238 releases enough energy that it can glow red from its own heat, and it is this powerful heat that is the energy source to power an RTG. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators can turn heat into electricity using a principle called the Seebeck effect, discovered by German scientist Thomas Seebeck in 1821. As an added benefit, the heat from some types of RTGs can help keep electronics and the other components of a deep-space mission warm and working well. Devices that use this principle are called thermoelectric couples, or thermocouples. The plutonium material is surrounded by a protective layer of foil insulation to which a large array of thermocouples is attached. The whole assembly is inside a protective aluminum casing. This strong temperature difference allows an RTG to turn the heat from radioactive decay into electricity. But don’t get too excited about buying an RTG for your house. With the current technology, they can produce only a few hundred watts of power. For deep-space missions, however, those couple hundred watts are more than enough. The real benefit of RTGs is their ability to provide predictable, consistent power. Additionally, they have an excellent safety record, and they’re designed to survive their normal use and also be safe in the event of an accident. NASA launched the twin spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 in 1977 to take a tour of the outer solar system and then journey beyond it. It has been almost 50 years since the launch of the Voyager probes, and both are still active science missions, collecting and sending data back to Earth. Even at these extreme distances, their RTGs are still providing them consistent power. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/salty-threats-for-drinking-water-rising-seas-and-land-based-pollution/'>Saltwater contamination in freshwater systems is on the rise</a></h2><b>Source:</b> arstechnica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 14:10:48 <p>
Global sea levels rose faster than expected last year, largely due to warming ocean temperatures, a new NASA analysis found. As seawater creeps further into coastlines, salt threatens to pollute the freshwater reserves that people depend on. But this brine isn’t just coming from the ocean: New research shows freshwater ecosystems are facing widespread dual threats of salt contamination from the sea and land, made worse by climate change. But our salty habits, coupled with rising seas, pose major threats to human health, infrastructure, agriculture, and wildlife. Now, scientists are trying to help water managers better understand the salt risks that crucial water supplies face from land to sea as global temperatures warm. Even so, 2024’s rate of sea level rise was unusual, according to NASA. “Every year is a little bit different, but what’s clear is that the ocean continues to rise, and the rate of rise is getting faster and faster,” Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in a statement. This may seem tiny, but bear in mind that even small increases in sea levels can have major consequences for coastal communities, including worsening storm surges during hurricanes. Around two-thirds of 2024’s rise can be attributed to ocean warming, because seawater expands as it heats. Last year’s El Niño weather event may have also been to blame for warming up the water by impacting how heat travels vertically through the ocean, NASA scientists said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Coltテクノロジーサービスは3月19日、ビジネス状況や2025年の事業戦略に関するメディア向けの説明会を開催した。日本と世界各所を接続するネットワーク需要が拡大しており、通信品質のさらなる向上や包括的なサービスの拡充などに注力するとした。



Colt Technology Services アジア太平洋地域担当プレジデントの水谷安孝氏 Colt Technology Services アジア太平洋地域担当プレジデントの水谷安孝氏

まず事業戦略を説明した英Colt Technology Services アジア太平洋（APAC）担当プレジデントの水谷安孝氏は、最近の顧客動向について、欧米企業による日本やAPACへのネットワーク接続と、日本企業の海外各地へのネットワーク接続の双方で需要が拡大していると指摘した。

同社は、2023年11月に米通信事業者のLumen Technologiesから欧州・中東・アフリカ（EMEA）の事業とネットワーク資産、また、大西洋横断海底光ファイバーケーブルを買収し、EMEA、APAC、米州間の各都市部におけるネットワークとサービスを大きく拡充した。

「例えば、欧州のハイブランド小売の顧客は、日本やアジアの拠点のネットワークを当社に依頼し、インターネットやSD-WANの接続を提供している。また、日本の小売や航空系の顧客が欧州との接続で選択された。従来は事業拠点のある現地の通信事業者からネットワークを調達することが多かったが、われわれが包括的にネットワークを提供できることで、当社の存在感が高まりつつあると感じている」（水谷氏）

このため同社は、日本を中心とするAPACへの投資を強化する方針であるという。

同社の顧客は、クラウドプロバイダーやデータセンター、ネットワーク関連サービス、ITベンダーなど情報通信業界側の各種事業者と、それら事業者のサービスなどを利用する一般の企業や組織の2つに大別されるとのこと。水谷氏によれば、情報通信業界側の顧客からは、きめ細やかなネットワーク運用管理機能や高い品質、コスト効果などを強く求められる。他方で、一般の企業や組織の顧客は、通信品質とセキュリティなどのサービス、容易な導入、運用管理などを一体的かつ安価に提供することを求める需要が強い。同氏は、同社では双方の異なる需要への対応に注力していると述べた。



事業戦略の骨子 事業戦略の骨子

2025年の事業戦略では、引き続き旧LumenのビジネスとColtのビジネスとの統合を推進すると同時に、容易かつ自動化されたネットワークおよびサービスの提供強化、顧客へのさらなる価値提供を通じたビジネスの成長、「Lumen＋Colt」の“ワンチーム”活動を推進していくとした。

国内では富士通との連携で西日本地域のサービス提供エリア拡大を推進中であるほか、システムインテグレーターを中心としたパートナーエコシステムの拡大、国内通信事業者との相互接続拡大などに取り組んでいるという。



Colt Technology Services インフラストラクチャー／接続性ソリューション担当バイスプレジデントのPeter Coppens氏 Colt Technology Services インフラストラクチャー／接続性ソリューション担当バイスプレジデントのPeter Coppens氏

また、技術面の戦略をインフラストラクチャー／接続性ソリューション担当バイスプレジデントのPeter Coppens氏が説明。ネットワークビジネスは、地政学的リスクやAI需要、温室効果ガスの排出削減、法規制強化などの課題に直面しているとし、Coppens氏は、同社が各種課題へ率先して対応していると強調した。

AI需要では、大手のクラウド事業各社が日本での巨額なインフラ投資を開始したことで、日本のデータセンターへの接続を検討する欧米企業が増加中だという。ここではLumen関連の買収効果により、同社が欧州最大の光ファイバー網の提供や、日本および欧州で最大となる275以上のクラウドデータセンターへの接続拠点を実現し、とりわけ欧州と日本・APACのネットワークでトップクラスの接続性を達成していると説明した。

顧客向けサービスでは、ネットワークのリソースや機能をオンデマンドで確保したり、利用実態に応じたコストにしたりといったクラウドモデルが浸透しつつあるとのこと。同社は、ネットワーク・アズ・ア・サービス（NaaS）として、こうしたニーズに対応しつつ、ネットワーク運用の標準化や高度な自動化、顧客のセルフサービス、動的な通信帯域の変更など実現しているとした。

これにより同社では、ネットワーク契約の見積もりやサービス提供の開始、変更などの顧客の各種要望に数秒～5分以内で対応しているという。ただ、オフィスなどへ通信設備を引き込む物理的な工事だけは調整などの必要もあって最長で1カ月ほどを要するという。

今後のサービス施策では、顧客がColtのネットワークやサービス利用時の二酸化炭素排出量を確認できる仕組みを強化するほか、Starlinkとの協業で提供する低軌道衛星通信のエリア拡大、オーストラリア・シドニー都市圏の自社回線網の拡張、APACにおける低遅延ネットワークの拡充などに取り組むとした。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Google has taken the wraps off the Pixel 9a today, a phone that has leaked about a thousand times in recent weeks, as is the Pixel tradition. Still, there are some things to know about this phone you can't glean from leaked renders or a YouTube unboxing. This phone maintains the same $499 price tag as last year's A-series phone, but it has a larger battery, a new camera, and a simpler design that ditches the camera bar of other recent Pixel phones. Google says it's made of 81 percent recycled material, and the aluminum is 100 percent recycled. Apparently, these percentages are a record for the Pixel series, if that's something that matters to you. Google's new phone has a 6.3-inch OLED display with slightly wider bezels than the flagship Pixels. As a result, it's a few millimeters larger in height and width compared to last year's model. Google maintained the same 8.9 mm thickness, though. The display is once again covered with generations-old Gorilla Glass 3, but the phone has gotten a small upgrade from IP67 to IP68, making it slightly more resistant to water infiltration when submerged. The display supports a 120Hz refresh rate with a peak brightness of 2,700 nits, which is a reasonable increase over the 2,000 nits of peak brightness for last year's phone.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Battery life has historically been a weak point on Google's Pixel A-series phones, so Google has stuffed a 5,100-mAh cell into the Pixel 9a. That should mean excellent performance, especially compared to what you'll find on other sub-$500 Android phones, not to mention 7 years of software support. The software stitches two images so that both parties are in the same photo despite not standing next to each other at that precise moment. The Pixel 9a can also create a short astrophotography timelapse, and there's even Macro Focus, which enables a macro mode via the main camera to take crisp photos of objects up close, like insects or plants. Naturally, Google is touting all of its Gemini AI features in this phone, one of which is a new addition announced at Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago and rolling out soon—live video in Gemini Live conversations. This lets you ask Gemini anything about the subject you’re looking at through the phone’s camera, powered by the company’s Astra technology (though this feature is limited to people on Google’s Gemini Advanced subscription). This was a self-imposed restriction Google had before but now it’s gone, though it has kept certain guardrails on what you can generate. Nothing's devices lack some capabilities—like no wireless charging and not as powerful performance—but they also have some perks, like the 3X optical telephoto camera. Samsung also recently announced a midrange phone, the Galaxy A56 for $500, though it's not arriving until later this year. We'll update this story when Google shares a precise preorder and release date for the Pixel 9a.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

is a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Google just announced the Pixel 9A, surprising nobody because it’s been leaked to all heck. The camera bump is gone, it has a bigger screen, a Tensor G4 processor, and better water resistance, and it still starts at $499. It’s all looking like a pretty good deal, especially considering what Apple is charging for its new entry-level phone. The comparisons to the iPhone 16E are all too easy to make, especially since Apple’s “budget” iPhone just launched a couple of weeks ago. The two phones share plenty of specs, including IP68 water resistance, but the $599 16E lacks an ultrawide camera, and its screen only offers a 60Hz refresh rate. The 9A opts for a 48-megapixel rear camera with a 1/2-inch-type sensor that’s slightly smaller than the Pixel 8A’s 1/1.73-inch-type chip. Bigger is generally better when it comes to image sensors, so I’ll be interested to see if that impacts image quality. Elsewhere, the 9A has beefed up its durability rating: it’s now IP68 rather than IP67, which means it can withstand immersion in deeper water. The battery is a little bigger, up to 5,100mAh versus 4,492mAh, with Qi wireless charging and up to 23W wired charging. There’s every form of Gemini and Google AI you can imagine, including Gemini Live right out of the box. And you didn’t think Google would let an opportunity to remind us that it has actually shipped an AI assistant pass by, did you?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A Reddit user posted two images of a melted triple 8-pin to 16-pin adapter that powered their Gigabyte RTX 5080 Gaming OC. We also found another similar case involving an older PSU, too. The images shared by Reddit user u/Appropriate-Hold-821 depict a melted triple 8-pin to 16-pin adapter and, luckily, no damage to the graphics card itself. While Nvidia doesn't mandate an ATX 3.0/3.1 compliant PSU for the RTX 50 series, it is highly recommended. We found another case on r/pcmasterrace, this time with the Gigabyte RTX 4080 Aero OC; even the RTX 40 series is prone to such failures. What may have been pushed under the rug as 'user error' last generation, is seemingly starting to affect everyone from average customers to seasoned enthusiasts. Nvidia's reference design for RTX 50 cards does not enable per-pin current measurements and renders the card unable to balance load across each connection. You'd need to dish out $2,800 (MSRP) for a ROG Astral variant to get per-pin current data, and even that variant is incapable of load balancing. Andreas Schilling and Der8auer noted temperatures north of 150 degrees Celsius on the power connectors of their units, with Der8auer's readings showing 22A being drawn across a single pin; the standard rates each pin at a maximum of just 9.5A. The power delivery aspect of these GPUs would benefit from a significant redesign, but we're left wondering when or if Nvidia will address these concerns.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rakuten Mobile is warning people of "reissuing eSIMs that you don't remember" through their official X account, Rakuten Mobile Customer Support.

According to the company, "There have been cases where a third party that has obtained a customer's Rakuten ID and password through an unauthorized website (phishing sites) etc. will reissue the SIM you are using as an eSIM and use mobile communication services unauthorizedly."

This is a fraud called SIM swap or SIM swapping. In other words, the phone number (SIM card) is taken over by a malicious person, and the perpetrator can also avoid SMS authentication such as internet banking. (In addition, Google has announced that SMS authentication is a security vulnerable)

Rakuten Mobile has announced that "to prevent damage, we would like customers to be careful about it," and that "We would like you to set a different password for each service you use, rather than reusing the same password." Additionally, they are calling for regular checks of the app's login history.

The files represent thousands of ancient pages of government documents, some now indecipherable due to age, that historians and conspiracists have wanted to view for decades. The files aren’t organized, summarized, or labeled in a way that makes sense. And, according to one lawyer going through them, they include the sensitive personal information of living people. The pages come thanks to an executive order Trump signed after his inauguration. He’d previously declassified JFK-related documents during his first term in 2017 and said he’d declassify the rest after giving U.S. security services time to go through them. Some of what’s being uploaded to the National Archives website yesterday and today isn’t new, just different versions of old documents with redactions removed or altered. If you want to read hard copies of what’s being uploaded you can do that, right now, by taking a trip to the National Archives at College Park in Maryland. Or you can wait for them to finish uploading what they’ve got. As of this writing, the Archives has uploaded about 60,000 pages spread across more than 2,000 PDF files. If he’s not lying or wrong, that means there are 20,000 more pages yet to appear across an unknown number of PDFs. Going through these files will take a lot of time, probably years. But real discoveries will take time and people with deep knowledge of the event to process. Despite six decades of intense madness and conspiracy theorizing, the best evidence tells us that a former Marine and Communist-curious weirdo named Lee Harvey Oswald aimed a rifle out the window of the Book Depository in Dallas and blew up Kenney’s head. There will be no “silver bullet” memo in the files that refutes this, no master CIA plan written in Allan Dulles’s handwriting that lays out a conspiracy to hire the mafia to kill JFK, no transcribed recording of a Trilateral Commission meeting where they plot against Kennedy, and no details about a second shooter on the Grassy Knoll. On November 22, 1963, a President died in Dallas and ripped open a psychic wound in the heart of America that will never heal.

is a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. Suno wasn’t supposed to be an important part of Amazon’s Alexa Plus presentation. Like many generative AI companies, it is also being sued by all and sundry for ingesting copyrighted material. But they have managed to generate some suspiciously similar-sounding AI generated materials, mimicking (among others) “Johnny B. Goode,” “Great Balls of Fire,” and Jason Derulo’s habit of singing his own name. Suno essentially admits these songs were regurgitated from copyrighted source material, but it says such use was legal. “It is no secret that the tens of millions of recordings that Suno’s model was trained on presumably included recordings whose rights are owned by the Plaintiffs in this case,” it says in its own legal filing. Whether AI training data constitutes fair use is a common but unsettled legal argument, and the plaintiffs contend Suno still amounts to “pervasive illegal copying” of artists’ works. Suno is meant to be hyper-personalized music, letting anyone generate a song. One of the current core features in Alexa’s Echo speakers is taking verbal requests for (non-AI-generated) music. Amazon declined to provide an on-the-record comment about the Suno demonstration. In 2023, the Supreme Court found that Andy Warhol had infringed on photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s copyright when he screenprinted one of her pictures of Prince; a deciding factor was that outlets like Vanity Fair had licensed Warhol’s work instead of Goldsmith’s, offering her no credit or payment. This hasn’t been tested with AI music, but the RIAA is making similar arguments, and Amazon’s integration seems to provide a concrete example. Every minute spent listening to Suno’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is one spent not listening to Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You” through Spotify or Amazon Music Unlimited — and Carey et al. get stiffed to boot. “If it hasn’t been licensed correctly from rights holders, then that’s problematic for all music,” he says. Suno, like a lot of other AI companies, offers subscriptions that allow users to generate songs, which are not very good. I’ve seen little about how Suno plans to make a sustainable business, but I do know this: if the company is found to have infringed on copyright, the damages for the songs it’s already used will be sky-high, on top of any other licensing fees Suno will have to pay. I’m not convinced Suno understands why people care about music or what the point is. In a Rolling Stone interview, its cofounder Mikey Shulman complains that musicians are outnumbered by their audience — it’s “so lopsided.” I emailed Shulman to see if he wanted to chat for this article. One of the benefits of learning an instrument is that it deepens your appreciation; suddenly you can hear a song’s time signature or notice the difference in feel between keys. The AI songs that have broken through to public consciousness have been ones like “BBL Drizzy” and “10 Drunk Cigarettes,” which are not purely AI generated. An Alexa speaker is not a tool for editing or playing with generative music. There’s another way in which Suno can undercut real musicians, besides just stealing listening time. The music industry already has a problem with soundalikes and AI-based fraud; Suno’s slop makes it even easier to generate fraudulent tracks. Amazon Music has its own deals with record labels, including the ones suing Suno. In a December 2024 press release, Universal Music Group touts an “expanded global relationship” with Amazon that means the “advancement of artist-centric principles.” It goes on to say that “UMG and Amazon will also work collaboratively to address, among other things, unlawful AI-generated content, as well as protecting against fraud and misattribution.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-unveils-dgx-station-workstation-pcs-gb300-blackwell-ultra-inside'>Nvidia unveils DGX Station workstation PCs with GB300 Blackwell Ultra inside</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tomshardware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 13:14:16 <p>
Nvidia on Tuesday introduced its DGX Station workstation platform that packs its upcoming GB300 Desktop Superchip that combines a Grace CPU with a Blackwell GPU for AI. The machine is aimed at software developers, researchers, and data scientists and will be available later this year from various workstation OEMs. Nvidia's DGX station workstation platform carries the GB300 Desktop Superchip (the first mention of a desktop-grade 'Superchip' that we see) that comprises a Grace CPU that connects using NVLink C2C interface with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra GPU (which comes in an SXM form-factor) featuring the latest-generation Tensor Cores with enhanced FP4 precision. The machine is set to feature 784 GB of unified memory between the CPU's LPDDR5X and GPU's HBM3E, which will be handy for AI workloads. By launching its DGX Station based on the GB300 Desktop Superchip platform as well as the DGX Spark powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia sets the stage for its Arm-based desktop workstation platforms that will be aimed at broader market segments beyond data scientists, researchers, and software developers. For now, it is reasonable to assume that the company calls 'Desktop Superchip' a combination of Grace CPU and Blackwell Ultra GPU components in configurations optimized for desktop PCs. For connectivity, DGX Station is equipped with Nvidia's ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, a networking component that supports speeds of up to 800 Gb/s to link multiple DGX Stations for collaborative AI projects. The high-speed networking also ensures smooth scaling for users working with extensive AI models or distributed computing tasks. Nvidia didn't disclose the recommended pricing of its DGX Station, which will be sold by Asus, Boxx, Dell, HP, Lambda, Lenovo, and Supermicro. Keeping in mind that each compute GPU in an SXM form factor costs tens of thousands of dollars, the DGX Station will likely cost a five-digit sum.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The ViewSonic XG2736-2K delivers solid value in the 27-inch QHD genre with pro-grade video processing, a sharp and colorful image, and solid accuracy. I’m talking about input lag and its recent downturn, as in there’s less of it, and that’s a very good thing. I’ve found OLEDs to be extremely quick, even record-setting. It’s a 27-inch QHD IPS display with 240 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, HDR10 and wide gamut color. It’s one of the fastest monitors you can buy for $320. Swipe to scroll horizontally Panel Type / Backlight IPS / W-LED, edge array Screen Size / Aspect Ratio 27 inches / 16:9 Max Resolution and Refresh Rate 2560x1440 @ 240 Hz Row 3 - Cell 0 FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible Native Color Depth and Gamut 10-bit (8-bit+FRC) / DCI-P3 Response Time (MPRT) 0.5ms Brightness (mfr) 300 nits Contrast (mfr) 1,000:1 Speakers 2x 2w Video Inputs 1x DisplayPort 1.2 Row 10 - Cell 0 2x HDMI 2.1 Row 11 - Cell 0 1x USB-C Audio 3.5mm headphone output USB None Power Consumption 19w, brightness @ 200 nits Panel Dimensions WxHxD w/base 24.2 x 17.4-22.5 x 9.6 inches (615 x 442-572 x 244mm) Panel Thickness 2.4 inches (61mm) Bezel Width Top/sides: 0.3 inch (8mm) Row 18 - Cell 0 Bottom: 0.8 inch (20mm) Weight 19.4 pounds (6.3kg) Warranty 3 years It’s also well balanced for mid-level gaming systems with QHD 2560x1440 resolution. You can run it at 240fps without resorting to a $1,500 video card and enjoy its super low input lag. You’ll see just how low on the next page. An IPS panel delivers good contrast and well-saturated color that fills almost 94% of DCI-P3. That’s on par with like-priced competition in the speedy QHD genre. I found decent accuracy in my initial tests, and it calibrates to a very high standard. Only a slight red undersaturation keeps it from hitting 100%. There are plenty of picture adjustments and modes for tweakers to enjoy. Unfortunately, there is no zone or field backlight dimming to increase contrast. However, in my tests, I found accurate color and decent punch for HDR gaming. The 240 Hz refresh rate is achieved without overclock and my sample remained stable during hours-long gaming sessions. Video processing includes Adaptive-Sync for Nvidia and AMD platforms along with a precise overdrive that removes almost all motion blur without ghosting artifacts. There are HDMI and DisplayPort inputs and a USB-C which can carry video signals or be used to power devices up to 65 watts. The XG2736-2K offers solid build quality, decent imaging and top-shelf gaming performance for $320. It looks hard to beat for that money, but let’s see what the tests reveal. The XG2736-2K is well protected in a clamshell carton by blocks of crumbly foam. The panel snaps in place, or you can use a 75mm VESA mount with included fasteners for an arm or wall mount bracket. You get a small external power supply along with USB-C, HDMI and DisplayPort cables. The stand has a more symmetrical cable hole shaped like Star Trek’s crew badge. A cast metal base keeps the package stable with plenty of depth and soft rubber feet that prevent sliding. Movements belie the monitor’s low price with precise and firm smoothness. You’ll see a fine texture on either side with widely spaced holes for the internal speakers. The LED lighting makes up a double-X pattern and can be set to any primary color or left to cycle through all available hues. The input panel is adorned with two HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.2 and a USB-C. The latter can carry video or up to 65 watts of power. The OSD also has a 3.5mm jack for headphones or powered speakers with volume and mute controls. To summon it, press the joystick and click down. After the input select and audio screens, you are presented with seven picture modes. Three of them are game type specific and the fourth, which I recommend, is called Custom where you can set your own video processing options. If you desire a grayscale calibration, it can be performed in the Color Adjust menu. There are five fixed color temps plus a user mode with single-point RGB sliders. The XG2736-2K is a DCI-P3 display with no true sRGB option. The gamma presets number three and are spaced very widely. The others are much too light or dark to be useful. The only other options you’ll need to address are FreeSync Premium and RampageX. You can choose a single color that breathes, or cycle through all colors on the Auto setting. This allows full control of picture and video processing options. You can enjoy the monitor by just setting brightness to taste. Either way, just one color gamut covers around 94% of DCI-P3. I grant you that the picture won’t impress like an OLED. I would gladly forgo Quantum Dots to have a monitor this fast. You’ll see on the next page just how quick it is. I saw no hesitation during the fastest run and gun or circle strafe maneuvers. The overdrive is very precise so once dialed into your average frame rate, you won’t see any artifacts. If you can maintain 240fps as I did, the middle option works best. It covers around 94% of DCI-P3 so it will be oversaturated for work that requires an sRGB or Rec.709 reference like photography or video post-production. Text based tasks were fatigue free thanks to the 109ppi pixel density. I could not see the dot structure at a two-foot viewing distance. Gameplay is addictive thanks to smooth and precise video processing with super low input lag. It definitely punches above its weight class in the price/performance ratio arena.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

NTTコミュニケーションズ（NTT Com）は2019年から、新規事業創出を目的としたオープンイノベーションプログラム「ExTorch（エクストーチ）」を展開している。5年強に及ぶ活動の中、社内とスタートアップのマッチングから事業化まで一定の成果を挙げつつ、毎年新たなチャレンジを実施。大企業における効果的なスタートアップ共創の在り方を模索し続けている。

2月13日には活動の一環として、「Meet Startups 2025 ～Connecting Innovation, Shaping the Future～」を開催した。同社が見出した世界の注目スタートアップ10社やNTT系のコーポレートベンチャーキャピタル（CVC）などを東京・大手町の本社に招き、社員とのネットワーキングを促すイベントだ。イベントの内容と最新の活動状況について、ExTorchのメンバーに聞いた。



Meet Startups 2025に携わったExTorchのメンバー（左から、NTT Com イノベーションセンター プロデュース部門 担当部長 小室智昭氏、同 担当課長 齊藤基樹氏、同 野坂佳世氏） Meet Startups 2025に携わったExTorchのメンバー（左から、NTT Com イノベーションセンター プロデュース部門 担当部長 小室智昭氏、同 担当課長 齊藤基樹氏、同 野坂佳世氏）

イベント型から通年型へのプログラム移行でマッチング増

オープンイノベーションプログラムであるExTorchは、課題を抱えるNTT Com社内の事業部に対して注目のスタートアップを紹介し、共創によって新たな事業やビジネスにつなげることを目的としている。

共創の成果は、同社の主力事業であるネットワークやクラウド、セキュリティといったICTサービス向けのテクノロジーや、スマートヘルスケア、スマートモビリティ、スマートシティといった次世代型ソリューションに実装したのち、NTTグループ内での展開を含めた新規ビジネスへ進化する。

実績例としては、韓国企業3iとの共創で実現したファシリティマネジメントサービス「Beamo（ビーモ）」の事業化（エヌ・ティ・ティ・ビズリンクにてサービス提供中）や、福祉機器を開発するマリスcreative designとの視覚障がい者向けAIデバイスの開発などがある。

活動当初は「イベント型」プログラムを採用していたExTorchは、第二期となる2022年の途中から「通年型」に移行。外部に公募をかけてマッチング・事業を採択し、事務局のメンバーが伴走した成果をイベントで発表、事業化を検討するというスキームから、社内の要望を受けてその都度マッチングを行う形へと移行している。

その背景には、「イベントが目的化してしまう」ことと、「本来の活動趣旨が社内外に伝わりにくい」という2つの課題があったという。ExTorch事務局のリーダーを務めるNTT Com イノベーションセンター プロデュース部門 担当課長 齊藤基樹氏は、「イベント型だと、共創を一斉に開始してからゴールに至るまでの約2年ほどの伴走期間が必要となるため、新たな募集が出来ない期間が発生する。社内でアイデアが出ても、イベントスケジュールから外れているため、アイデアをExTorchとして吸い上げることができなかった。 通年型にシフトしたことで、事業部の課題をヒアリングしてそこに合ったスタートアップをマッチングさせる活動の件数が増えた。実際に紹介したものも形になってきた段階」と話す。

「イベントから育て上げる形だと、実は成功するものも少ない。その結果社内からも、ExTorchはイベント名、もしくはイベントを企画している組織と誤認されることがあった。通年型に移行したことにより、今はしっかりと事業部の課題に伴走できるようになり、事業部が目指している方向性・課題と、スタートアップをうまくマッチングし、新しいビジネスにつなげるという本来の活動を展開できている」（齊藤氏）

次年度の活動計画立案時に事業部から相談も

ExTorch活動を浸透させるため、2500人以上が参加するスタートアップ専用のコミュニティに対して積極的な発信を行っている。また、オウンドメディアとしてExTorchのページを開設して記事を掲載する活動も開始した。NTT Com イノベーションセンター プロデュース部門 野坂佳世氏はそれらの活動の結果として、「今まではExTorch側から事業に関連しそうなスタートアップの情報を提供する“リサーチャー”的な役割が多かった中で、事業部側からの問い合わせが増え、“窓口”として機能するようになった」と、変化の様子を語る。

「最近では、事業部からスタートアップの情報が欲しいというリクエストもありつつ、次年度の各事業部の方針や活動計画の立案の時期に、『一緒にポートフォリオの話をしたい』とか、『イノベーションセンターとして来年取り組もうとしている、注目している領域を教えて欲しい』といった声が掛かるようになった。事業部自身の参考になるような情報提供という部分でも、少しずつ頼られ始めていると実感している」（野坂氏）

そのほか2024年度からの新たな取り組みとして、同社の技術戦略部門との連携も挙げられる。2024年度から技術戦略部門に所属して戦略を策定していた齊藤氏がExTorchのリーダーに就任し、よりNTT Comの全社戦略と密に連携した活動へ昇華した。次年度からは、NTTドコモグループの新規事業創出プログラム「docomo STARTUP」との連携を深め、より大きな化学反応が生まれることを目指していくという。

10年続いたシリコンバレーのスタートアップ紹介イベントを拡張

そしてもう1つの新たなチャレンジが、2月13日に開催したMeet Startups 2025だ。

Meet Startups 2025は、シリコンバレーのインキュベーション施設に常駐するNTT Com イノベーションセンター プロデュース部門 担当部長 小室智昭氏が注目スタートアップを招待してマッチング機会を提供していた「Meet Silicon Valley」を前身としたイベント。

Meet Silicon Valleyは社内の勉強会という形で始まり、NTT Comの顧客も招待するなど、徐々に枠組みを拡大させつつ、約10回ほど実施したという。

2025年からExTorchが受け継ぐ形で、若手メンバーの意見を中心に全体的にリニューアル。ExTorchの本質である社内とスタートアップの連携を打ち出すべく、前年まで外部の顧客が多かったという聴講者構成を約半数が社員という形に変更している。

具体的には、参加するスタートアップをシリコンバレーに限らず、日本や韓国、イスラエルなどの各国から招へい。コンテンツはグループCVCによるパネルディスカッションや、ExTorchを通じて共創が進んだ事例紹介などを取り入れ、より多方面からのアプローチで共創を促す枠組みとした。

“目利き”が語る大企業とスタートアップ共創の醍醐味

小室氏はMeet Startups 2025において、シリコンバレーのトレンドを紹介するスピーカーとして登場した。これまで日本でも利用者が多いCloud Content Managementのパイオニアなど、多くのスタートアップを発掘して自社サービスにつなげてきた実績を持つ同氏は、シリコンバレーのスタートアップの特徴として、ビジネス化することに貪欲なことを挙げる。

「日本のスタートアップは自分でやることが好きで、技術者目線で物事を考える。一方、米国のスタートアップは、技術者と経営とセールスというトライアングルをうまく回しながらビジネスを拡大しようとしている」と話す。

また、スタートアップが世界に分散する傾向にあるなかで、シリコンバレーに常駐するメリットとして「さまざまな領域のスタートアップがいることと、投資家が同地に残ったままなので最終的に多くのスタートアップが戻ってくること」（小室氏）を挙げた。

小室氏は今回のMeet Startupsでも、複数のスタートアップを招いている。そこから本来の目的である共創がうまくいくための秘訣について同氏は、「外部から『こういうビジネスチャンスもある』ということを教えると共創につながることが多い。今回のイベントはまさにそういう機会で、膝を突き合わせて考えても解決策は出てこない。それぞれに多様なバックグラウンドや知見があるので、1つのリソースからたくさんのアイデアが出てくるはず。イベントを通じて聴いている人が新しいオポチュニティを見つけて、シナジーが生まれてほしい。日本の企業は先にミッシングピースを探し、それを埋められるスタートアップを探そうとするが、それだと失敗することが多い。そうではなく、一緒にビジネスをすることでうまくはまる形に持っていけるかもしれないし、自分たちが考えていないものができるかもしれない。それが大企業とスタートアップの共創の醍醐味だ」（小室氏）

続いて登壇した小室氏は、2024年末から2025年初頭にかけて米国で開催されたイベントのレポートという形で、米国のテックトレンドを駆け足で紹介した。

まずAWSの「re:Invent2024」に関しては、「CEOのキーノートでの発表内容の変遷を見ると、2022年のトップはコンピューター関連の話が多かったが、2023年にAIが上がってきて、2024年はAIを便利に使える機能がたくさん出て、AIを実ビジネスに役立てるというアナウンスが多かった」と総括した。

次に、全米小売業協会（NRF）が主催するリテール系のイベント「NRF2025」に言及。「AIとインダストリー」「スマートカート」「IoT×ID×サステナビリティ」の領域でそれぞれ注目のスタートアップのテクノロジーを紹介した。

最後に、CES 2025のレポートを発表。今年の参加者数・出展社は微増であり、2023年から2025年の出展傾向は、23年が「スマートホーム」、24年が「AI」、25年は「デジタルヘルス」がそれぞれトップだったという。AIについては、スマートリングのCircular、節水を支援するデバイスを開発するHydrific、設計図向けのAIのCADDi、オンプレミス型ディープフェイクのCyberetteの4社を紹介した。

また、「個人的に面白かったもの」として、アクセシビリティ（障害物検知）の技術を紹介。Haptics（触覚伝達）技術により誰にも当たらずに歩ける.Lumenの両目をヘッドマウント型デバイス、TDKのセンサーが搭載されたスピーカーを使ってナビゲートもしてくれるWeWalkのスマート白杖、Tech Hub Yokohama”のオープニングセレモニーにも登場したGlidanceの移動支援装置を紹介した。



トレンドレポートセッションの小室氏 トレンドレポートセッションの小室氏

「コーポレートCVCにどう声を掛ければよいか問題」に解答

パネルディスカッションには、NTTドコモ・ベンチャーズ Director 貝沼篤氏と、NTTファイナンス グループファイナンス部 投資戦略部門 大西貴久氏が登場した。

NTTドコモ・ベンチャーズは、ドコモグループだけでなくNTTグループ全体をカバーするCVCで、NTTグループと協業可能性のあるスタートアップに出資している。NTTドコモ・ベンチャーズでは、ドコモグループ向けのファンドとドコモグループ以外のNTTグループを対象としたファンドの２つのファンドを運用しており、それぞれのファンドごとに注力テーマを持っている。

ドコモ向けのファンドでは、金融・決済、あんしん・安全、エネルギーといったといったtoC向けのビジネス領域のほか、マーケテイングソリューション、エンタメといった分野にも注力している。そのほかにも、NTTコム、コムウェアを対象とした法人ソリューション領域や、長期的な目線で見た時の飛び地の事業領域などもテーマとして掲げている。

もう一方のファンドも幅広いテーマを掲げているが、NTTが有する研究所の活動領域も対象としていることから、技術的な量子やエネルギー、宇宙といった、ディープテックよりテーマが多いのが特徴的。このようなスタートアップは成長に時間がかかるため、出資後、長い時間をかけて事業連携を模索していく場合もある。

NTTファイナンスは、 NTTグループの金融事業を手掛ける会社。VC事業は1997年から開始しており、元々は純投資で財務的リターンを得る方針としていたが、「昨今の機運の高まりを受け、グループのオープンイノベーション推進に注力するようになった」（大西氏）という。投資エリアは、ICT、エレクトロニクス、AI/IoTが多く、事業会社と連携がしやすいミドルからレイターステージのスタートアップに投資をしているとのこと。

最初のテーマは、「事業会社はどんな時にCVCに相談をすればいいのか。どう話しかければいいのか」。貝沼氏は、「組みたいスタートアップまで具体的に定まってなくていいが、困っているポイントや課題の特定までは固めておいてほしい。そうすれば、こんなスタートアップがあると紹介できる。現状分析と仮説は粗くてもよいので持っていてくれると話が建設的に進む」と回答。大西氏は、「グループの事業会社をファイナンス面で支援する会社という役割があるため、事業化やビジネス化は少し先というものでもサポートできる。長いスパンで相談してもらえるとありがたい」と回答した。

続いて、投資・共創事例について。NTTドコモ・ベンチャーズはNTTと陸上養殖のジョイントベンチャーを立ち上げたリージョナルフィッシュ、NTT東日本が強力な営業力を発揮している企業向けクラウドストレージのファイルフォース、研究所がAI共同研究をするために投資をしたSakana AIとの事例を紹介。「代理店販売や共同開発、共同研究、スタートアップのサービスの裏側にNTTの技術を採用またはその逆など、さまざまな協業のパターンがある」（貝沼氏）とした。

NTTファイナンスは、その後の共創事例セッションにも登壇したマリスcreative designをはじめ、イスラエルの生成AI企業D-Identification、量子コンピューターのソフトを開発している豪州のQ-CTRLを挙げた。マリスcreative designはExTorchの紹介で出資をしていて、「社内でも評価されていて、その後のビジネス連携でも他のスタートアップとつながっている好事例」（大西氏）と紹介した。

スタートアップ10社のピッチと展示、ネットワーキングも実施

セッション後には10社のスタートアップピッチが行われ、終了後会場に登壇者・参加者が残ってスタートアップの展示とネットワーキングが行われた。ちなみに前年度のイベントでは、スタートアップが10社参加したうち、2件が共創によるPoCに進んだという。今回のExTorchプロデュースによる新生Meet Startupsの試みはこれからどのような化学反応を起こしていくのか、興味深いところだ。

The billionaire was said to be trying out the restaurant’s limited-time special, ‘Nvidia Breakfast Bytes,’ which honors Huang, who once worked at the chain as a dishwasher, busboy, and waiter. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang stopped by the @DennysDiner mobile #GTC25 diner for breakfast🍳 trying out the special 'NVIDIA Breakast Bytes' menu item. Huge thanks to Denny's for celebrating the GTC keynote with us and honoring Jensen's history with the company 💚 pic.twitter.com/BnxkJ4vEGBMarch 18, 2025 Huang also unexpectedly appeared at the Live at Nvidia GTC with Acquired broadcast when the hosts were interviewing Jon Peddie about his memories with Jensen before Nvidia became the giant it is today. During that unplanned and somewhat chaotic scene, Jensen walked up the set and asked, “Did somebody order Denny’s?” He then started serving Nvidia Breakfast Bytes to everyone at the table while talking about his time at the diner. One day, I got a job at Denny’s when I was 15 years old, and there’s all of American food — all you can eat. So, my favorite was sausages and pancake, and you just roll it up like a corn dog, you know what I’m talking about? This isn’t the first time that Jensen visited a regular restaurant and dined with some of his high-profile buddies. Just last January, he pulled some of the biggest industry leaders in Taiwan into his favorite place, with the local media calling it the ‘trillion-dollar banquet.’ He’s also been spotted several times going around food markets at night just before major events like Computex, making him quite popular among the common people and giving rise to the ‘Jensanity’ phenomenon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/policy/632098/trump-phone-laptop-security-doge-usaid'>DOGE stranded USAID workers with laptops full of sensitive data</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:33:55 <p>
President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn approach to the US government has thrown federal agencies into disarray, as thousands of civil servants have been dismissed from their jobs without rhyme or reason. In direct contradiction of federal guidelines, former employees have been forced to assume responsibility for preventing data leaks that could put local partners or the employees themselves in harm’s way, left with devices that have been all but abandoned by their higher-ups. USAID employees abruptly dismissed by the Trump administration while working outside of the US are still stuck with government-issued computers and phones with no way to safely return them yet, The Verge has learned, and those devices can give them access to work accounts including email. USAID has led humanitarian missions around the world since it was created in 1961, providing HIV treatment and responding to natural disasters, for example. Around two-thirds of USAID’s 10,000 employees are posted overseas, and recently terminated workers were told they’d get shipping labels to return equipment. But some have been waiting more than a week since their last day at work to receive the slip. That delay makes each individual responsible for keeping devices secure to protect sensitive information. On top of that, some employees still have their diplomatic passports, which grant certain privileges and are supposed to be collected and canceled or destroyed when an employee’s assignment ends. If I lose my diplomatic passport, it’s an issue. That person still has their work laptop, phone, diplomatic passport, and a personal identification verification (PIV) card that allows employees to log into USAID computers. They say that many of their former colleagues are in the same situation. They also have to worry about scammers taking advantage of the chaos roiling US federal agencies. In the confusion over which programs have ended or survived DOGE cuts, partner organizations are reportedly wary of phishing emails falsely claiming that a canceled program will resume and requesting bank account details to begin payments. “Unfortunately, these folks have been put [in an] unprecedented situation where they may or may not have access to the security support of the government, but yet they’re still responsible for maintaining the security of these devices wherever they’re going. So it’s really like a catch-22,” says Megan Stifel, chief strategy officer at the Institute for Security and Technology and executive director of the Ransomware Task Force. For USAID employees on administrative leave, access to government systems is inconsistent, making compliance with any incoming agency instructions difficult, says Randy Chester, vice president for USAID at the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a union that represents American diplomats. Chester says he checks his government email twice a day so he can relay information to AFSA members who are being left in the dark by USAID under DOGE. The DOGE staff and Trump administration sometimes fail to send notices to employees’ personal emails, meaning that they don’t get updates because they can’t access their work accounts. Some staff on administrative leave, who are locked out of internal systems, worry they won’t even be able to retrieve their digital personnel files, especially after a top official ordered remaining staff to shred and burn physical USAID documents, including personnel files. The ruling also bars DOGE from moving forward with any other unilateral actions against USAID, including layoffs. Doing so mitigates the risks associated with any employee losing their device or having it stolen. It just appears that the Trump administration has yet to take these steps. “I would not be having sensitive conversations around any of that equipment … I would put it in a microwave, the oven, get a faraday bag,” Stifel says, just in case their former employer has the capability to listen in by remotely accessing microphones on those devices. Martin, on the other hand, says this is theoretically possible but practically unlikely, since the agency would need to have planned sophisticated intrusion operations in advance. Returned equipment is typically reallocated to future staff and partner organizations or sent to a secure disposal facility, following requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations. When an agency determines that it no longer needs certain equipment, it might work with the General Services Administration (GSA) to wipe computers and transfer them to other federal agencies. If no federal agencies take the equipment, it can be donated to state and local entities. E-waste has to be carefully managed because it often contains hazardous materials like lead or mercury that might leach out of landfills. Chester says all of the roughly 10,000 USAID workers have a Dell laptop, 60 to 70 percent have an iPad, and about 50 percent have an iPhone issued by the government, amounting to millions of dollars in tech that’s being “flush[ed] down the toilet” while it’s unrecovered — not including equipment at partner organizations. “Assets still in-country without active U.S. control are at risk of looting, terrorism, or being seized by other parties, making it crucial to address their status and management promptly,” says a memorandum it issued on March 11th. Soon after, USAID sent an email, which was obtained by The Verge, that tells staff to instruct partner organizations to submit inventory and disposal plans for program assets within 10 calendar days. Yet even after the email, some former employees haven’t received their shipping labels. People working for USAID in the US have been able to return their equipment in person — but one former staffer told The Verge that even that process raised concerns. When they returned to the office to deposit their laptop, phone, and related equipment, they were surprised to see a person they didn’t recognize at a folding table, collecting laptops and placing them in giant rolling garbage bins. Another former USAID worker recounts turning in their equipment and being told by a worker in the Ronald Reagan building that everything was being “destroyed.” Reach out securely with tips to Justine Calma via Signal at bqe210.91.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In the fall of 2020, a 77-year-old man in Florida realized he had gotten one of the worst gifts imaginable—one that kept on giving. According to a case report published in this month's issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the man showed up at a Gainesville hospital with chest pain that just wouldn't go away. His medical history included Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. For the latter, he had an automated implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) placed—and it was not his first. The man had a notable history of having gone through multiple defibrillators and revisions, including getting a new generator in 2018. Some possible reasons for such a history could include heavy use of the device and infections. When they tried to isolate whatever bacteria, fungi, or other pathogen was causing the problem, they couldn't find anything. He was subsequently treated for a "culture-negative" infection. But, after treatments with over half a dozen antibiotics for mostly two- to four-week spans over the two years, the discomfort in the left side of his chest would always return. Imaging, meanwhile, showed signs of infection around his implant.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

SOCAMMs — which will first be used with servers based on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Superchip systems — are designed to bring together high capacity, high performance, small footprint, and low power consumption. Micron's initial SOCAMM modules will offer a capacity of 128GB and will rely on the company's LPDDR5X memory devices produced on its 1β (1-beta, 5th Generation 10nm-class) DRAM process technology. Micron does not disclose data transfer rates supported by its initial SOCAMM sticks but says that their memory is rated for up to 9.6 GT/s. Meanwhile, SK hynix's SOCAMM demonstrated at GTC 2025 is rated for up to 7.5 GT/s. Memory consumes a sizeable part of server power consumption. Micron's SOCAMM changes this by offering a standard modular solution that can house four 16-die LPDDR5X memory stacks, potentially offering a rather whopping capacity. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether Micron's SOCAMMs will ever be an industry standard supported by JEDEC or will remain a proprietary solution developed by Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and Nvidia for servers running Grace and Vera CPUs. Micron's SOCAMM sticks are already in mass production, so expect systems based on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Superchip to use this memory. Modular memory simplifies server production and maintenance, which will positively affect the prices of these devices.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/synchrons-brain-computer-interface-now-has-nvidias-ai/'>Synchron’s Brain-Computer Interface Now Has Nvidia’s AI</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:00:00 <p>
Synchron is aiming to build a BCI system able to seamlessly perform a wide range of tasks in the home environment. As part of its collaboration with Nvidia, the two companies are developing what Oxley has dubbed “cognitive AI,” the combination of large amounts of brain data with advanced computing to create more intuitive BCI systems. “What we saw Rodney do is a start, but there are so many more interactions that you can actually begin bringing here,” says David Niewolny, senior director of health care and medtech at Nvidia. Currently, BCIs are trained with data from a single person. An electrode array collects neural activity from the brain while the person is doing that task and researchers “label” that brain data. In other words, they indicate what the subject was doing at each time point that the brain signal was being measured. “Because this AI has been trained on the brains of many people, it has essentially learned how to learn, how to think, and then you have this brainlike AI system that you can use for a variety of tasks.” Some training will still be needed for each new BCI user. Users learn how to operate a BCI with prompts such as “squeeze your fist” or “press down like a brake pedal.” A paralyzed person may not be able to make that motion, but the neurons in their brain’s motor cortex still fire up when they attempt to do so. Oxley says Synchron will use Cosmos, Nvidia’s new family of AI models, to generate photorealistic simulations of the user’s body, allowing them to watch an avatar of their own movement and mentally rehearse it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

最近、コンデジ市場に復活の兆しがある。中古市場が活況だったり、キヤノンなども新モデルを出したりしている。数年前まで「オワコン」と言われていたことを考えると、なかなか面白い動きだ。

そんな中、パナソニックが新たに投入した「Lumix ZS-99」（日本ではLUMIX TZ-99として販売）は、2030万画素の1/2.3型センサーを採用し、30倍の光学ズームを備えた小型カメラだ。「トラベルズーム」というカテゴリーで売り出していて、各種オートモードだけでなく、マニュアル撮影の設定も一通り揃っている。

パナソニック LUMIX DC-TZ99（Amazonで価格をチェック）



本機は、スマホでは撮りにくいシーンを撮影できる一方で、逆にスマホなら簡単にこなせる部分で苦戦する場合もある。センサーが1/2.3型と小さいため、暗所では強力な計算処理を持つスマホほどノイズ低減が効かず、画質が落ち込みがちだ。しかし、ズーム域は圧倒的に広く、35mm換算で24mmの広角から720mmの超望遠まで対応する。スマホでは届かない画角で撮影できるのは、こうしたカメラの大きな利点だ。画質については…その話は後で触れる。

●スペック

本機は1/2.3型センサーを搭載している。センサーサイズは大きいほど多くの光を取り込めるため、暗い場所で有利だったり、ボケ味のある写真を撮りやすくなる。

実際、ZS99と同等サイズの機種でより大きなセンサーを搭載したモデル、たとえば1型センサーを積んだ「Sony ZV-1 II」や、さらに大きいAPS-Cセンサーを持つ「リコー GR IIIx」もあるが、大きなセンサーを積むほどレンズも大型化しやすく、ズーム域が限られることが多い。もし1型センサーで30倍ズームを実現しようとしたら、ポケットには入らないサイズとなる。

このカメラの光学30倍ズームは、35mm換算で広角24mmから超望遠720mmまでカバーする。スマートフォンのメインカメラに近い広角から、まず届かない超望遠までを1台でまかなえるわけだ。

例えば室内で大人数の集合写真を撮ったあと、外に出て道路向かいの木に止まっている鳥をぐっと近寄って撮ることも可能だ。しかもポケットサイズのカメラでこれを実現できるのが、ZS99の最大の特徴だ。

5軸の光学式手ブレ補正が搭載されており、そこそこ役に立つ。ただ、センサーが小さくレンズも明るくはないため、少し暗い場所だとシャッタースピードが遅くなりがちだ。そうなると手ブレや被写体ブレが起こりやすい。これは小型で安価なカメラ全般に言えることで、ZS99だけが特別に悪いわけではないが、留意しておいたほうがいい。

「Panasonic Image」アプリを使えば、画像の転送やリモート撮影ができる。ズームや撮影設定もアプリから操作可能だ。さらにコラージュ作成機能も用意している。カメラ用アプリとして特に珍しい機能はないが、少なくとも問題なく動いてくれる。

最後に、今回レビューで使ったのは黒色のモデルだが、シルバートップのレトロなカラーリングも用意されている。こちらはなかなかおしゃれな見た目だと思う。

●実際に使ってみた

本機は、昔の超小型デジタルカメラよりはやや大きめだ。ただ、ポケットに入るといえば入るし、手にも収まりやすい。

サイズ感は、手元の「Pixel 9 Pro」と比べると長さがだいたい6割程度で、幅はほぼ同じ、高さ（厚み）はレンズを格納した状態でもおよそ3倍ほどある。ポケットに入れたまま忘れるほどの小ささではない。ズームを最大にするとレンズはさらに3倍近く伸びる。前面にはゴム製のグリップ、背面には凸型のサムレストがあるので持ちやすさは悪くないが、落下防止にリストストラップかネックストラップはあったほうが安心だ。

ダイヤルやボタン、レバー類はどれも6万円台のカメラとしては十分な操作感で、触っていて楽しい。

電源ボタンを押すと、小さなアクションが立て続けに起こる。レンズカバーが開き、レンズが前にせり出し、最後に背面ディスプレイが点灯するので、起動が少し遅いように感じるかもしれない。ただ、Pixelの電源ボタンを2回押してカメラを起動するのと同時に試してみたら、どちらもほぼ同じ2秒くらいで立ち上がった。電源を切るときはレンズが完全に格納されるまでしまえないので、もう少し長く感じる。

黄金時代のコンパクトデジタルカメラらしく、オートモードが秀逸だ。iAやiA+モードにしておけば露出などの設定はすべて自動で、後者は色味まで調整してくれる。撮影者は構図とズームだけ意識すればいい。

背面の3インチ液晶はチルト式で、本体から手前に90度ほど引き出せるほか、ぐるっと反対向きにして自撮りも可能だ。サイズや価格を考えれば、ビューファインダー（EVF）非搭載は当然かもしれないが、人によっては必要だと思うかもしれない。

オートフォーカスは十分に高速で、狙った被写体をおおむね正確につかんでくれる。AFモードは6種類あり、顔・瞳認識や追尾機能もある。多くの人は一度設定すればそのまま使い続けるだろう。

もちろん、設定を細かくいじることもできる。絞り優先やシャッター優先、プログラムモード、完全マニュアルモードまで揃っている。モード切り替え用のダイヤルはカチッとした手応えがあって気持ちいい。

オート任せではなく、少し踏み込んで撮影したいユーザー向けに「夜景」「ポートレート」「料理」など計24種類の「シーン」も用意している 。

さらに一歩進んだ24種類のフィルター（ファンタジー、トイ効果、レトロなど）もあり、独特な色味を付けてアートな写真に仕上げられる。自分はあまり使わないが、このクラスのカメラなら定番の機能だろう。ちなみにRAW撮影にも対応しているが、この価格帯のカメラでRAWを使う人はあまり多くないかもしれない。

画質は全体的に「悪くないが、飛び抜けて良いわけでもない」という印象だ。数週間使ってみて、驚くほどの写真はあまり撮れなかったが、安定して「そこそこ悪くない」写真が撮れる。価格とサイズを考えると十分合格点で、特に致命的にダメな部分は見当たらない。

ズームすればするほど画質はやや甘くなるが、色味とディテールは無難にまとまっている。暗いシーンだとシャッタースピードが思ったより遅くなることがあり、手ブレや被写体ブレが気になることはある。内蔵フラッシュを使えば近距離の暗所は撮れるが、発光時の少しレトロな「2000年代感」は、今のSNSならむしろ好まれるかもしれない。

動画の画質も写真と同様「悪くないが特筆するほど良くはない」という印象だ。

ディテールは十分で、光学式の手ブレ補正もそこそこ機能してくれる。望遠端では三脚があったほうが安心だが、慎重に構えれば手持ちでも使える映像を撮れる。何よりズームの存在が大きく、録画中でもスムーズにズームができるので、仕上がった映像もまずまず見られるレベルだ。

まさにポケットに収まるズームカメラ

昨今、コンパクトデジタルカメラに対する疑問として多いのが「スマホよりきれいに撮れるのか」という点だ。最近のハイエンドやミドルレンジのスマートフォンを考えると、この疑問がコンデジ市場を縮小させた主な要因の一つだろう。

率直に言えば「スマホより画質が良いカメラが欲しい」なら、この本機はその答えにはならない。小型センサーを使い、スマホほど高度な画像処理もないため、特に暗い場所では厳しい。正直なところ、1000ドル（約15万円）のカメラであっても高性能スマホの総合的な画質に勝るのは難しいと思う。

ただ、「画質」だけにこだわる観点は、このカメラを求める層のニーズとは少しズレているかもしれない。

スマホでは撮れない画角を本機はカバーできるし、スマホをいじらず集中して撮りたいなら、それも可能だ。暗い場所でもフラッシュを使えば十分SNS映えする写真が撮れる。旅行でも日常でも「ちゃんとしたカメラ」を使いたい人にとって、本機は魅力的なズームを備えた一台だ。

遠くの野生動物や被写体に容易に迫れる一方で、広角側は24mmとそこそこ広い。ここまでの対応力をスマホで再現するのは難しいだろう。

また、写真の基礎を学びたい人にとっても、シャッタースピードや絞り、ISOなどを一通り操作できるので、初歩的な勉強にはちょうどいい。高級機ほど大きく絞りや露出を変えられるわけではないが、基本を覚えるには十分だ。

要するに、本機は「それ相応に良いカメラ」だが、過度な期待をするとやや肩透かしを食うかもしれない。

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/controllare-il-suono-direzione-udito-selettivo-nuove-tecnologie/'>We managed to check the sound so that it can reach a single ear in the crowd</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 11:06:19 <p>
To succeed in this undertaking was a team of researchers from the Penn State College of Engineering which has developed a method capable of controlling the sound so that it can only be audible from a specific position. We briefly remember that sound is a vibration that, just like a wave, travels in the air. The frequency of vibrations is what determines its height: low frequencies correspond to deep sounds, while the highs correspond to acute sounds. Furthermore, sound is subject to a phenomenon called diffraction, in which the waves tend to spread in space during their journey. Ultrasound, sound waves with frequencies higher than those we can hear can penetrate through many materials and interact with objects in unique ways. "They can carry the sound in space in silence, becoming audible only when you want it." In particular, to create a audible enclave, the researchers used two bundles of ultrasounds at different frequencies which, intersecting themselves in the space generate a new sound wave at a audible frequency only in that precise area. "The key phenomenon at stake is what is called the generation of frequency of difference", add the authors, explaining that when two ultrasonic beams of slightly different frequencies, for example 40 kHz and 39.5 kHz, overlap creating a new sound wave, in this case 0.5 kHz, which is well audible by people. "This means that it is possible to transmit the sound to a person or a specific place without disturbing other people during propagation," the experts comment. For now, the researchers have managed to propagate the sound at a distance of about one meter from the target and reach a volume of about 60 decibels, equal to that of a conversation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It was launch day for the Chicago developer’s debut solo game, a surreal Metroidvania called Animal Well, and he couldn’t stop reading reviews online and watching people play the game. He just didn’t realize how big of one it would be quite yet. Most successful video games are made by teams of people that vary in size from a half dozen to somewhere in the hundreds. Basso had made Animal Well entirely on his own, start to finish. The awards are being handed out this week at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Basso is also a featured speaker. While describing some of his more homebrew methods of development, one developer in the audience whispered “this guy is the GOAT.” After his talk, a circle of fans surrounded Basso to offer praise and ask questions. It just took some time to get there. Basso wasn’t a new developer when he started Animal Well. He’d worked at large companies before, including a stint at NetherRealm working on mobile versions of Mortal Kombat. He was working at a medical startup that created mobile games for doctors—”as weird and niche as you might expect”—and tinkered with his own projects at night.

The Russian president Vladimir Putin, during a long phone call with Donald Trump, would have agreed to stop for a month the bombing of Ukraine's energy infrastructures, including electrical power plants, subsctations, transmission lines and distribution systems that from the beginning of the conflict are repeatedly affected by the Russian forces, causing widespread blackouts and electrical supply problems in different regions of the country. A particularly delicate point concerns the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, currently under Russian control but located in Ukrainian territory, which Trump has mentioned several times in the previous days as a crucial element in the negotiations. Another result emerged from the phone call between Trump and Putin concerns prisoners of war. During the interview, the Kremlin reported an imminent exchange of 175 Russian prisoners for as many Ukrainian prisoners, scheduled for March 19th. Truce in Ukraine: Moscow conditions and Kyiv's reactions The Kremlin would not have accepted the American request of a ceased the total fire of 30 days, but would have limited itself to granting a partial respite focused on energy infrastructures. It would also have added that, once more precise information has been received from the United States, Ukraine will formulate an adequate response and its team will be ready to start technical interviews. Speaking from Finland, where he was for an official visit, the Ukrainian president, however, stressed that Putin's requests show that Russia is not really willing to cease permanent fire. The White House has outlined some possible moves for the next steps after this first partial agreement. State secretary Marco Rubio has declared that a new round of interviews between Russian, Ukrainian and American representatives could be held within two weeks. Meanwhile, British Foreign Minister David Lammy expressed the support of the United Kingdom to any initiative aimed at reducing the suffering of Ukrainian civilians, while reiterating that respect for Ukraine territorial sovereignty will have to remain a fundamental principle in any future negotiation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What's more, it is possible to support multi-vendors, which preempts user needs. The company's unique idea that AI agents are also subject to human resource management was interesting, so we asked Koimai Hiroshi, Chief Technology Officer of Workday, about its significance and measures to expand its popularity (Photo 1). Photo 1: Workday in response to my interview with the author CTO Koimai Yutaka Photo 1: Workday in response to my interview with the author CTO Koimai Yutaka Workday recently announced a solution called "Agent System of Record" that allows companies to centrally manage AI agents provided by the company and third parties. The company revealed the background to this announcement, saying, "As the number and complexity of AI agents increases, companies of all sizes are facing new challenges such as AI agents implementation management, ensuring security and compliance, optimizing operational efficiency, and cost management. If these challenges cannot be addressed centrally, companies will face risks such as division of operations, increased security risks, and difficulty in measuring the value of AI investment." By providing a single system for managing AI agents used across the enterprise, IT and business leaders can make AI agents transparent and control the effectiveness of AI agents on their operations. By utilizing this solution, companies are able to select and use AI agents from a wide variety of AI agents that meet business needs while achieving centralized management, governance and visualization. What's noteworthy about Figure 1 is the mid-level "agent gateway." This part connects with a wide variety of AI agents, including external vendors, and centrally manages them using the Agent System of Record.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

My retro dream is about to come true. Two models are scheduled to be released: the monochrome screen "Core 2 Duo" and the "Core Time 2" with a heart rate monitor and a color screen. The design is familiar, and it feels like the 2025 edition of "Pebble 2" and "Pebble Time 2", which was not released. Before the announcement, we interviewed Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, on Zoom, and founder, both new models will support 10,000 watch faces for the old Pebble. It is compatible with both Android and iPhone, and can be hacked, so this new model should also help you implement interesting Pebble ideas that have been around for the past 10 years. However, strictly speaking, the name Pebble is not officially used. All new models have dramatically improved battery life, up to 30 days, and Migicovsky said this was due to the evolution of battery and chip technology. It also has a microphone and speaker, but it is not intended for calls, but for apps that make use of these. The $149 Core 2 Duo is scheduled to be shipped in July, making it look like the old plastic Pebble watch is back. It is equipped with a simple monochrome display 1.26-inch display (with backlight), and features traditional Pebble-like features such as steps, sleep tracking, and dedicated buttons. Meanwhile, the $225 (approximately 34,000 yen) Core Time 2 is scheduled to ship in December and will feature a larger 1.5-inch touch-enabled color display and heart rate sensor. The side buttons are still there, but using a glass touchscreen you can tap on a complication and operate the apps that use it. This is the first time Pebble has installed a touchscreen. According to Migicovsky, the new model was developed with the aim of not being for everyone, and is also a personal project that he had been looking forward to reviving. These new products will be coming at an interesting time for the smartwatch world. The new Pebble cannot do contactless payments, calls, music playback, or even more advanced fitness or health tracking like the latest smartwatches. However, you will receive notifications, run the app, measure basic fitness, and more than anything, you will enjoy a huge number of unique watch faces. I can't wait to put it on my arm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

From the interface of Google's AI Gemini, you can now use the Canvas feature, which allows you to edit documents and code in real time, and the Audio Overview feature, which allows you to create podcasts. You may find it hard to imagine if you don't try it yourself, but the big difference from before is that newly changed content is that it can be changed to existing content rather than just appearing just below existing content. You can also make modifications when receiving feedback and editing suggestions from Gemini. This is because users can interact with Gemini, edit code and receive feedback. Visually check your design, making editing and adjustments easier than ever before. Starting today, Canvas will be available in stages to Gemini and paid Gemini Advanced users in all countries and regions. One of Google's most popular AI features is the voice summary. This feature allows users to convert their content they create into podcasts by two AI hosts with just the button operation. However, this feature has been installed in Google's other experimental AI product, Notebook LM, and has not been incorporated into Gemini.

The European Commission has today detailed a couple of broad interoperability measures that Apple must follow, in order to oblige with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) guidelines. These measures cover a total of nine connectivity features available on iPhones, covering everything from smartwatches to headphones. “The specification decisions are legally binding,” says the regulatory body, adding that interoperability is “key to opening up new possibilities for third parties to develop innovative products and services on Apple’s gatekeeper platforms.” The overarching idea is that apps and third-party products can be used with the same level of functional interactivity and seamlessness as Apple’s own products. Simply put, developers will be allowed to create a high-bandwidth peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection between an Apple and a third-party device to enable data transfer. The EU says Apple will also have to enable short-range wireless file transfers for third-party apps and software. The regulatory agency clearly mentions that these measures will allow developers to create alternatives to AirDrop, as well as, media-casting services that can take on AirPlay. Doing so would allow peripherals such as wrist-worn wearables and rings to enable contactless payments without mandatorily carrying an iPhone on them. The connectivity recommendations also extend to automatic pairing with nearby devices. Apple has contested the changes and can appeal them in court. This was accompanied by major relaxations to payment rules covering in-app purchases.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Smartwatch maker Pebble has made a "revival" after about 10 years since its market withdrawal. Pebble, which was a huge success with Kickstarter in 2012, took the market by adopting an e-paper display before the Apple Watch was introduced. It has successfully differentiated its features such as notification display, custom dials, and app store compatibility, as well as battery life that lasts for a week even when viewed at any time. Google later acquired Fitbit, and assets related to Pebble's products were also included under its umbrella. The original Pebble did not disappear anytime soon, and Fitbit continued to support it for a while. "I politely asked if the OS would be open sourced, and they responded very generously," Migikovsky told WIRED. "If Google hadn't done that, we wouldn't have been able to do what we were doing now. This time, Migikovsky himself, one full-time employee and several contract employees are aiming to develop a more robust business. Therefore, the Core 2 Duo will be produced in a limited number with approximately 10,000 units, while the Core Time 2 will be produced in a slightly larger number, and reservations will be available for reservations from the 18th.

Since Amazon announced plans for Alexa, which is powered by the AI, its privacy impact has been attracting attention. As a result, it has become clear what privacy changes users need to take when using AI voice assistants on handy devices. From March 28th, everything you say to Alexa on Echo's speakers and smart displays will be automatically sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud. Amazon emailed the following about the change: "We have decided to end support for this configuration as we continue to expand Alexa's capabilities with generation AI capabilities that leverage the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud." This also applies to users who are not interested in the paid version of Alexa, or those who want to use Alexa+ but do not need a voice identification function. Furthermore, issues with Amazon's Alexa voice recording management system have also been revealed.

【基礎⽤語】

01｜量子 / quantum

エネルギーは、どんどん細かく分割していくと「それ以上分割できない飛び飛びの値」をとる。この最小単位のことをエネルギー量子と呼び、物理系にこのような飛び飛びの性質が表われるようにすることを量子化という。このように、「量子」という用語は元々単体では使用せず、形容詞的に用いていたが、現在では、原子や電子などの「量子化された小さな粒子の総称」として名詞的に「量子」と使用されることもある。

02｜量子力学 / quantum mechanics

微小な世界に働く物理法則のこと。対して、わたしたちの暮らす世界（＝日常スケール）に働く基本的な物理法則は古典力学と呼ばれ、19世紀までは身の回りの現象をすべて説明できた。しかし20世紀以降、人類が微小な世界を観察できる技術を手に入れるとともに、古典力学では説明がつかない振る舞いが次々と見つかった。それを説明するための新しい解釈こそが量子力学である。

03｜重ね合わせ / superposition

量子力学のルールのなかでのみ許されている状態のこと。重ね合わせ状態になった対象は、エネルギー、位置、スピンの向きなど、あらゆる物理量が一定の値に定まっておらず、複数の値が「確率の状態」で重なり合っているとしか表現ができない。また、重ね合わせ状態は非常に繊細。意図の有無にかかわらず「外部から関与される」ことで重ね合わせ状態は壊れてしまい、ひとつの値に確定してしまう。

04｜測定 / measurement

重ね合わせ状態を壊し、ひとつの値を取り出すこと。「観測」と表現することもある。同じ重ね合わせ状態からでも、測定するたびに得られる値は確率によって変化しうる。20世紀初頭、重ね合わせや測定といった「わたしたちの直感に反する振る舞い」を肯定する量子力学は、「シュレーディンガーの猫」や「ウィグナーの友人」といった思考実験によって不完全であると批判された。しかし、その後の研究者たちが理論と実験の双方向から量子力学を検証し続けた結果、現在では破綻のない理論と見なされている。

05｜量子もつれ / quantum entanglement

複数の量子を測定したとき、その結果が常に連動する関係をもつことがある。このように、複数の量子間に働く強い相関関係を「量子もつれ」と呼ぶ。量子もつれは一度発生すると、量子間の距離に関係なく維持される。そのため、かのアインシュタインは「不気味な遠隔作用」と批判し、その存在に否定的であった。しかし、2022年ノーベル物理学賞を獲得した一連の研究により、実際に量子もつれが存在することが示された。

06｜二重スリット実験 / double-slit experiment

重ね合わせの原理を用いないと説明できないものの代表例となる実験。英国物理学会の発行する雑誌の読者が選ぶ「最も美しい実験」に選ばれたことがある。2つのスリットが開いた板をスクリーンの手前に設置し、その方向に電子を一粒ずつ撃ち出していく。すると、スクリーンに着弾した電子の跡が縞模様を形成する。これは、2つのスリットを電子が重ね合わせの状態で波として同時に通過し、その波が干渉したことを示す。

07｜決定論と確率論 / determinism and probability theory

古典力学では、ある系の初期状態が正確に把握できれば「運動方程式」によって未来の状態を完璧に計算で知ることができる。つまり、未来のことは決定されているという考え方、すなわち決定論的な立場をとる。一方の量子力学では、「波動関数」によって未来の状態は表される。つまり、測定をするまで未来の状態は定まらず、測定をすることで波動関数に基づいて確率的に状態が定まる。この量子力学の解釈は、発表当時は不完全と見なされ、アインシュタインに「神はサイコロを振らない」とまで言わしめた。

08｜ブロッホ球 / Bloch sphere

ある量子系の重ね合わせ状態を図示するための仮想の球体のこと。量子状態に情報をもたせる量子情報の分野でよく用いられる。量子状態を記述する方法はほかにもブラケット記法や行列で表現する方法があるが、ブロッホ球は視覚的にわかりやすいというメリットがある。特に量子コンピューターの文脈においては、ひとつの量子ビット（→15）の状態を簡潔に表現できるため重宝されている。名称の由来は、スイスの物理学者でありノーベル物理学賞受賞者であるフェリックス・ブロッホから。

【歴史】

09｜ロルフ・ランダウア / Rolf Landauer

「Information is Physical（情報には必ず物理的実体が伴う）」をスローガンに掲げ、物理学に新しい視点をもたらした人物。1961年に発表したランダウアの原理で、情報を消去すると発熱することを示し、情報と物理の密接な関係を明らかにした。さらに、量子コンピューターの発展にも寄与。ドイッチュらに、誤り訂正（→24）を行なえないままでは机上の空論と指摘。誤り訂正の研究を加速させる契機となった。量子コンピューター発展の下準備をした人物といえる。

10｜リチャード・ファインマン / Richard P. Feynman

1965年にノーベル物理学賞を受賞したファインマンは、優れた先見性をもっていたことで知られる。早くからコンピューターシミュレーションに注目していた彼は、1981年に開催された会議「Physics of Computation」の講演で、「自然は、古典力学で動いていない。だから、自然をシミュレーションしたいのなら量子力学的にやるべきだ」と発言。量子コンピューターの価値を予言するこの発言は、多くの物理学者を刺激。量子コンピューター誕生につながった。

11｜デイヴィッド・ドイッチュ / David Deutsch

量子コンピューターの基礎理論をつくった物理学者。古典コンピューターのひな型は1936年に考案されたチューリングマシンだが、量子コンピューターは、1985年にドイッチュが発表した量子チューリングマシンがひな型とされる。80年代、ランダウアを筆頭に物理学者たちは「計算を実現する物理現象」に注目。ドイッチュは、計算に使う物理には、古典力学だけでなく量子力学も使えると思いつき、量子力学に基づいたチューリングマシンの拡張に成功した。

12｜ジョン・マルティネス / John Martinis

今日の「第二次量子コンピューターブーム」のきっかけをつくった物理学者。第一次ブーム（1990年代半ば〜2000年代初頭）で多くの実験提案がされたものの、量子を操ることは難易度が高く、量子コンピューターは実現不可能に思われブームは収束。冬の時代が続くなか、マルティネスは2014年に5つの超伝導量子ビットを精度高く動作させることに成功。量子誤り訂正を実装するには、ある一定のエラー率に抑える必要があるが、それをクリアし、量子コンピューターが実現可能な技術であることを示した。

13｜ショアのアルゴリズム / Shor’s algorithm

1994年に数学者ピーター・ショアが考案した量子アルゴリズム。量子コンピューターで素因数分解を高速に行なえることを示した。現在広く使われるRSA暗号は、古典コンピューターでは「大きな数の素因数分解が困難」なことによって安全性を担保しているが、量子コンピューターで解読される懸念が生まれた。この大事件で、当時あまり注目されていなかった量子コンピューターの有用性が見直され、第一次量子コンピューターブームが巻き起こった。

14｜ベルの不等式の破れ / violation of Bell’s inequality

アインシュタインは、量子もつれという「不気味な遠隔作用」は実在論と矛盾するとして量子力学を不完全な理論と主張し、1935年にEPRパラドックスを共同で発表。それが、量子力学にはまだ含まれていない隠れた変数の存在を探る端緒となる。1964年にジョン・スチュワート・ベルが、隠れた変数が存在するなら満たされるべき「ベルの不等式」を発表。1982年にアラン・アスペが実験でこの不等式が破れることを示した。量子もつれの検証実験は「量子情報科学を開拓した」として、2022年にアスペらにノーベル物理学賞が授与された。

【技術と概念】

15｜量⼦ビット / qubit

量子コンピューターの情報の基本単位。0か1に加え、0でもあり1でもある「重ね合わせ状態」を取る。これによりn量子ビットあれば、2 n通りの値を同時にもつことができる。ただし、計算結果を取り出す「測定」で取り出せる値は1通りである。重ね合わせ状態において、0と1のどちらが測定されやすいかを決める確率は操作可能であり、この確率を操作しながら計算を進めていくのが量子コンピューターだ。

16｜超伝導方式 / superconducting qubit technology

「電気回路そのもの」を量子ビットとして利用する方式の量子コンピューター。極低温で起きる超伝導では、回路を流れる電子のペア（クーパー対）の集団が量子状態をつくりだす。マイクロ波を使ってこの量子状態の操作を行なう。グーグルやIBMなど多くの企業が研究開発を行なっており、現時点で最も先行している方式といえる。国内では、富士通や理化学研究所（以下理研）、大阪大学などが研究を行なう。回路設計によって特性を調整できることが強み。大規模化に向けてケーブル配線の処理やシステム全体の効率化が課題。

17｜イオントラップ方式 / trapped ion technology

「イオン」（＝原子から電子をひとつ取り去ることで正の電荷を帯びた原子）で量子ビットをつくる方式の量子コンピューター。電気の力で荷電粒子を空間に捕捉する「イオントラップ」を使って、イオンを真空容器に閉じ込める。レーザー光で量子状態を操作できる。QuantinuumとIonQの2社がこの方式の研究開発をリードする。理研とQuantinuumでスパコンとの連携利用を行なうプロジェクトが進んでいる。ゲート操作の精度の高さや長いコヒーレンス時間（→30）が強みだが、量子ビットを増やしにくいことが課題。装置同士を接続する技術の確立が必要と考えられている。

18｜中性原子方式 / neutral atom technology

「原子」を量子ビットとして利用する方式の量子コンピューター。“中性”は、電気的に中性であることを意味し、先行して成果を上げたイオントラップ方式との違いを明確にするために付いている。光の圧力によって空間で粒子を捕捉する「光トラップ」を使って真空容器中に捕らえた原子に、レーザー光を照射し状態を操作する。QuEra ComputingやMIT、国内では分子科学研究所で研究開発が進む。計算時に原子を自在に動かせる接続性の高さが強み。他の方式と比べて後発なため、周辺技術が未成熟。共に成長できるかどうかが鍵を握る。

19｜シリコン方式 / silicon quantum electronics

半導体基板に、電子ひとつだけを閉じ込める「量子ドット」を形成し、電子スピンの向きに0と1を対応させることで量子ビットを実現する方式の量子コンピューター。Intel、日立、blueqat、理研、産業技術総合研究所（産総研）などで研究開発が進む。半導体技術というすでに成熟した技術を応用できること、量子ドットのサイズは数nmであり大規模な集積化が可能であることが特長。電子ひとつを制御する技術は難易度が高く、電子輸送や、2量子ビットゲートを高精度に行なう手法の確立が必要とされる。

20｜光量子方式 / optical quantum computers

この方式の量子コンピューターは、大きくふたつに分けられる。ひとつは、光子を使う方法。光子の偏光の向きなどを0と1に対応させ量子ビットを実現する。もうひとつは、光の振幅や位相といった連続量を使う方法。振幅が重ね合わせ状態になった量子的な光「スクイーズド光」を使って計算する。海外では、XanaduやPsiQuantum、国内では東京大学で研究開発が進む。室温・大気圧下で動作できる点や量子センサーなど他の量子デバイスとの接続性の高さが強み。一部の演算が苦手な点や、エラー率の高さが課題。

21｜量子アルゴリズム / quantum algorithm

量子コンピューターで問題を解くための、量子ビットの操作方法や手順のこと。古典コンピューターにもアルゴリズムは存在するが、その量子コンピューター版である。既知の代表的な量子アルゴリズムは「ショアのアルゴリズム」「グローバーのアルゴリズム」などがある。一方で、実用的なものはまだ数が少なく、量子アルゴリズムを新たに見つけ出していくことは量子コンピューター研究においてひとつの大きな課題である。

22｜量子回路 / quantum circuit

複雑な計算をするために量子ゲートを組み合わせたもの。古典コンピューターにも論理回路はあるが、これは入力と出力のビット数が異なる場合がある。量子回路は使用する量子ビット数ぶんの線を使い、それぞれの線にゲートを置いていくことで各量子ビットの状態を変化させていく。その見た目から、楽譜に例えられることもある。

23｜量子ゲート / quantum gate

量子ビットの状態を、「どれくらい」「どのように」変化させるかといった操作のこと。「Hゲート」「Φゲート」など文字や記号で表現されるが、その正体は数学的な行列である。量子ビットの状態も同じく行列で表すことができるため、実は量子コンピューターにおける計算は行列同士の計算である。古典コンピューターのゲートはモノ（電子回路）として存在するが、量子ゲートは電磁波での操作であるためモノではない。

24｜量子誤り訂正 / quantum error correction

量子コンピューターの計算中に発生する誤り（エラー）を訂正すること。量子コンピューターは熱や電磁波などのノイズに対してとても脆弱で、古典コンピューターよりもエラーが発生しやすい。また、量子ビットを扱うが故に訂正する方法も複雑となる。そのため、量子誤り訂正は量子コンピューター実現のための難関である。

25｜NISQコンピューター / NISQ

量子ビットの数が数十〜数百程度の、量子誤り訂正を十分に行なえない量子コンピューターのこと。NISQとは、Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantumの略であり、「雑音のある中規模な量子」という意味である。2025年現在における量子コンピューターはまさにNISQコンピューターといえる。大規模な計算はエラーが蓄積してしまい実行できないため、その限られたリソースを用いてどのような実用的な計算が可能か日々研究されている。

26｜誤り耐性型量子コンピューター / FTQC

量子誤り訂正の能力を十分に備え、大規模な計算が可能で汎用性の高い量子コンピューターのこと。FTQCとはFault-Tolerant Quantum Computerの略であり、「誤り耐性型量子コンピューター」という意味である。FTQCは量子コンピューター研究が目指すひとつのゴールであり、完成に向けて誤り訂正方法とハードウェアの両輪で開発が進められている。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing). Developers will benefit from a fast and fair handling of their interoperability requests. The measures will accelerate their ability to offer a wider choice to European consumers of innovative services and hardware that interoperate with iPhones and iPads. "Companies operating in the EU, irrespective of their place of incorporation, must comply with EU rules, including the Digital Markets Act. Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple's ecosystem. Also, from now on, developers will enjoy more transparency as to how their interoperability requests are handled by Apple. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts. The European Commission today announced the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them "bad for our products and bad for our European users. "The DMA, which came into force last year, requires major platform holders or "gatekeepers" like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features The Commission's first proceeding focused on iOS connectivity features for third-party connected devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets. The decisions specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability for functionalities such as notifications, device pairing, and connectivity and data transfer functions like AirDrop and AirPlay.The second proceeding focused on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS.The final measures set out in the two specification decisions follow an extensive engagement with Apple and input by third parties as part of the public consultation launched in December 2024.However, according to Apple, the DMA effectively requires it to hand over intellectual property to competitors, including companies whose business model relies on copying others. This intervention, argues the company, allows officials or third parties to influence iPhone development to the point of micromanagement, making it harder to introduce new technologies in Europe.Apple also expressed its concern that some data-driven companies are exploiting the DMA to bypass EU data protection standards, and seeking unfettered access to user devices and data, including unencrypted access to user notifications and details on connected Wi-Fi networks — amongst other privacy and security risks Apple flagged in its December 2024 report , which specifically calls out Meta.To comply with the DMA, Apple launched a portal for EU developers to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS. The company believes it has met all requirements, and will continue engaging with regulators. But it's unconvinced the current demands will foster competition or innovation as intended.The DMA's specification decisions are legally binding and Apple is required to implement the specified measures. However, the Commission says the decisions "fully respect Apple's rights of defense" and remain subject to independent judicial scrutiny.Article Link: Apple Says New EU Interoperability Rules 'Bad for Our Products and Our Users'</p></b><br/><br/></div>

生成AIの人気が急上昇し始めた頃から存在する、簡単で楽しい利用法の1つが、テキストでの説明からメディアを生成することだ。ビジネスにAIを利用しているプロフェッショナルか、一般人を問わず、簡単にテキストでプロンプトを入力してボタンを押すだけで、思い描いた画像や動画など生み出す楽しい経験を味わうことができる。

その体験は一見無害に見える。しかしその裏側では、アーティストにさまざまな影響が及んでいる。

何が問題なのか

画像生成AIブームの火付け役となったOpenAIの「DALL・E 2」をはじめ、世の中に出回っているテキストからメディアを生成するAIの多くは、インターネット全体からかき集めたデータをクリエイターからの明確な許諾がないまま使ってトレーニングされたものであり、これにはアーティストが生み出したさまざまな作品が含まれている。

これは、写真や、絵や、詩や、アートや楽曲といった、アーティストたちが創作活動をしながら積み上げてきたものすべてが、本人の許可なく簡単に複製できてしまうことを意味する。作品がトレーニングに使われてしまったことで、アーティストは自分たちの作品を勝手に再生産され、創作スタイルのオーナーシップを制御する手段を奪われ、アーティストのアイデアをコピーすることでAI企業が得ている収入に対して権利を主張することもできなくなっている。

AI企業やAIモデルとアーティストの関係は収奪的なものだ。AI企業は、アーティストが人生を賭けて作ってきた作品を奪い、それを利用して利益を上げている。この問題には多くの人々が声を上げており、モデルを構築する際にはアーティストのことを考慮すべきであり、その作品の利用に対して公正な対価が支払われるべきだと要求している。

2010年からAI音楽の分野に携わっており、自身も作曲家であるEd Newton-Rex氏は、2024年に生成AI企業のトレーニングデータに関する取り組みが公正であることを認証する非営利組織「Fairly Trained」を設立した。同氏は以前、Stability AIで「Stable Audio」の開発チーム責任者を務めていたが、アーティストからの許諾なしに作品を使ってトレーニングを行うことに対する同社の立場に反対して、その役職を辞した。

Newton-Rex氏は、South by Southwest（SXSW）で行われたカジュアルな対話形式でのセッションで、著作権が抱えている大きな問題に光を当て、アーティストの作品を作者の許諾なしに使用するのは不当であるだけでなく、すでに飽和状態にある市場の競争をさらに厳しくするものだと指摘した。しかもそれには、アーティストら自身の作品が利用されているのだ。

「生成AI市場に参入している企業の多くは、莫大な資金をつぎ込んで、クリエイターの意向に反して、クリエイターを利用してクリエイター自身にとって非常に強大な競争相手を生み出している」と同氏は言う。

米国の著作権法にはフェアユースの概念があり、AI企業は、著作権で保護された素材を使って合法的にAIモデルをトレーニングすることができる。フェアユースとは、公正な利用であれば著作物を許可なく利用できるとする考え方だ。

今ある法律が明確にクリエイターの味方をしてくれていない中で、クリエイターとAIシステムの両方が共存共栄できる方法はあるのだろうか。端的に言えばその答えはイエスであり、その解決策は利用許諾の取り扱い方にあるかもしれない。

企業にできること

テキストからメディアを生成するAIには、スキルやリソースを持っていない人でも何かを生み出す手段にアクセスできるという明確なメリットがある。しかし理想を言えば、そうしたAIは、クリエイターに取って代わるものではなく、クリエイターを支え、創作のエコシステムを豊かにするものであるべきだ。Newton-Rex氏によれば、その目標に向けた最初の一歩は単純なことだという。

「まず、何かを盗むべきではない」と同氏は言う。

すでに一部の企業は、このアプローチを採用し始めている。例えばGetty Imagesは、2023年に「生成AI by Getty Images」を発表した。このAIはGetty Imagesが持つ豊富な画像ライブラリーのみを使ってトレーニングされており、その際に作品が使用されたクリエイターは収益を得られる仕組みになっている。

Adobeの生成AI「Firefly」でも同様のアプローチが採用されており、より安心して商業利用できるものになっている。このモデルのトレーニングには、「Adobe Stock」の画像、オープンライセンスのコンテンツ、パブリックドメインのコンテンツだけが使用されている。同社はまた、トレーニングセットに作品が使用されたクリエイターへの補償も行っている。

しかしこのアプローチには、ライセンス的に安全なデータセットの入手や作成にはコストと時間がかかるといった本質的な課題があり、多くの企業はこのやり方を採用していない。これは、AI開発競争を勝ち抜くために、急いで次のモデルをリリースしたいと考えているAI企業にとって非常に不利だからだ。

「そうすれば確かに動きは遅くなるだろうが、最終的に同様のレベルにたどり着けることは明らかであり、法律を破らず、しかもクリエイティブ業界全体やクリエイターの世界を敵に回さずにそれを実現できる。多くのAI企業は、その大きな間違いを犯している」とNewton-Rex氏は言う。

また、メディア生成AIの使われ方については、もう1つしっかりと考えておくべきことがある。それは、これだけ簡単にコンテンツが生み出せるようになると、メディアプラットフォームがAIが生成した音楽や、画像や、動画などで溢れかえってしまう可能性があるということだ。Newton-Rex氏は、そうなれば、いずれクリエイターが作品から得ている収入やロイヤルティに対する関心が希薄化してしまうことに繋がる恐れがあると考えている。

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230547/'>Actual state of DX human resources development for all employees--Expected and results for digital literacy training</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 07:00:00 <p>
Human resource development is an important initiative in promoting DX, and many companies in particular are conducting digital literacy training for all employees. However, there are not many companies that match expectations for digital literacy training with their results.

Development of human resources that will be neglected

When considering the type of talent required to promote DX, we tend to focus on technical experts such as data scientists and programmers. This refers to the "D" part of DX, namely the digital talent. A certain number of digital talent is required, but technology and methods are progressing rapidly, and can be trained and secured for each purpose.

On the other hand, at DX, it is more important to have people who drive change, that is, people who will push forward the "X" part of DX. To promote DX, we must encourage each employee to change their awareness, and all of them must work on a wide range of changes as their own, and we cannot rely on external sources for this. The need for change personnel who will be responsible for the "X" of DX should not be underestimated (Figure 1).

The "Digital Skills Standard" (DSS) published in December 2022 by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) defines the "DX Literacy Standard" (DSS-L) as the standard for the abilities and skills that all business people, including managers, should acquire, and points out the importance of improving digital literacy for all employees who are users and who are the main actors who deliver value to customers. Additionally, the components of DSS-L include the "DX background" (Why) that correctly understands why it is necessary to tackle DX based on the "mind stance" that creates new value.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Second, the company has implemented over 400 pilot projects in a year with its customers and partners. It is said that the AI ​​skills that have been cultivated through this initiative can be advanced towards practical use. The Granite 3, released in 2024, is an open, small-scale foundation model that has been incorporated into IBM's software and partner products, such as the code generation support "watson Code Assistant" and the AI ​​agent "watsonx Assistant." Based on these factors, Murata explains, "We are a technology company and have expertise in the field of consulting. IBM Japan will set 2025 as the year that will transform AI into business value, and as an "AI service integrator," it will be a bridge that allows customers to quickly, productively and safely transform AI capabilities into business value. To this end, we will prioritize three things: "Providing open AI platform services," "Applying and expanding AI solutions for IT transformation in production environments," and "AI partnerships will help customers accelerate the transformation into AI+." Companies that are implementing pilot projects to put AI into practical use are deploying AI to meet business needs, and each project is littered with network connection methods, browsers, large-scale language models (LLMs), and their positional relationships with data. To this end, we will expand the "Digital Services Platform" (DSP) and develop it into AI. The DSP has the container infrastructure Red Hat OpenShift and HashiCorp Terraform on top of open hybrid cloud infrastructures such as IBM Cloud, IBM Fusion, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). By installing the developed and verified AI platform services here, you can connect AI applications at any time, allowing you to run the entire system with confidence.

This is because scam messages have some unnatural points, such as forcing them to pay, demanding payments with gift cards, and being written in strange words. Many people are wary of seeing phishing scams (mechanisms that pretend to be trustworthy and direct them to malicious links), but phishing using QR codes - so-called "quishing" and "QRishing" can be quite difficult to spot. According to the Phishing Threat Trends Report from security company Egress, the percentage of phishing scams using QR codes rose sharply from 0.8% in 2022 to 12.4% in 2024. However, it is also difficult to avoid using QR codes at all. "To avoid QR phishing, it's important to keep your smartphone's security settings up-to-date and use reliable security software," said Lisa Plaggemyer, executive director of the National Cybersecurity Alliance. QR phishing is a cyber attack in which users use QR codes to direct users to malicious sites, download malware, and enter personal information. Once you download or enter it, your personal information such as passwords and financial data will be stolen and will likely be misused for identity fraud or financial fraud. However, I would like you to use your intuition. In the first place, it is important to always be suspicious where QR codes are attached. Be especially careful if you see it in places like the following: In addition, even QR codes on regular signs, parking meters, or restaurant menus may have an illegal sticker on top of them. When looking at QR codes in public places, make sure you check for any signs of replacement. You should be particularly wary of QR codes that you don't remember on emails or SMS, or QR codes that offer extremely good comments such as "Free gift!" As a last resort, it is also important to carefully check the URL that appears after scanning before accessing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We have further improved development productivity and responded to quantum resistant cryptography. It is said that in May they will also be planning a ceremony to mark the 30th anniversary of Java. Current Java uses a release cycle every six months. This time, Java 24 reflects 24 major updates, including previews, based on the "JDK Enhancement Proposals" (JEPs). For example, in terms of performance, JEP 491 (synchronizes virtual threads without pinning) has improved scalability for Java code and libraries that use synchronization methods and statements. This is an API to ensure that vector calculations used in AI development and other applications are compiled to vector instructions of CPU architectures that are supported at runtime. According to Arimura, the project results continue to be updated, and Java 24 is now in the ninth incubator, which is more common than usual. Arimura said that, just like when TLS 1.3 was introduced, he would help developers prepare by reflecting various standards and other issues (from Arimura's explanatory materials). Arimura said that, just like when TLS 1.3 was introduced, it would help developers prepare by reflecting various standards and other issues (from Arimura's explanatory materials).

The pharmaceutical industry is exposed to an unprecedented wave of change. Development of new drugs costs a lot, while the success rate is low, and there are many challenges such as reduced sales due to patent expiration, stricter regulations, and delayed DX. Issues for cost and success rates of new drug development Nevertheless, the success rate of clinical trials is low at just 0.02%, with many companies taking risks. In particular, failures in the Phase III exam (large scale exams) are a serious problem, with most of the development funds being lost at this stage. Rather than traditional groping compound screening, AI can read researchers' intents and present the most promising candidate compounds in real time, reducing development time by several years and cost by several tens of years. In addition to real-time market analysis, "Intent AI for Discovery of New Indications" will allow you to analyze market trends in real time and immediately discover the possibilities of new indications (off-label adaptations). This process will allow for direct links to stabilizing sales and ensuring market advantage. By utilizing intent AI, automation of regulatory compliance and the use of RWD can be stimulated, and from there, regulatory requirements can be automatically analyzed and the creation of approval application documents can be made more efficient. Additionally, by integrating RWD analysis and increasing the consistency of clinical trial data and actual clinical data, the possibility of rapid regulatory approvals being obtained.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But the Commission’s hands are tied. An immovable deadline for the Commission to tell Apple exactly how it should open its products and services up to rivals runs out on March 19.

Normally, this would be uncontroversial; a procedural step in getting a company to comply with a new law. But any decision to censure Big Tech under the DMA risks angering Trump, who last week called Apple “a great company.”

After that, things get serious, as the Commission starts butting up against deadlines to wrap up multiple year-long noncompliance investigations against Apple, Meta and Google.

EU officials have repeatedly promised that decisions are coming soon, at least for Apple and Meta, spurred on by complaints from users like Epic Games and Spotify, which say compliance efforts by Big Tech to date fall short.

“The Commission would face a lot of criticism if it was perceived to be taking a deliberately ‘soft’ approach for geopolitical reasons,” says Zach Meyers, director of research at the Centre on Regulation in Europe think tank.

Mindful of fraught geopolitics, the executive’s leadership has sought in recent weeks to smooth over tensions by insisting that its approach is not anti-American. "[The DMA] does not target U.S. companies," European commissioners Teresa Ribera and Henna Virkkunen wrote to a U.S. lawmaker earlier this month, stressing that the EU’s aim “is to ensure compliance — not to issue fines.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

LONDON — The European Union on Wednesday outlined the steps that Apple must take to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to work better with competing technologies. It’s the first time the EU has moved to compel a technology company to comply with the bloc’s digital Digital Markets Act — a wide-ranging set of regulations designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies from cornering markets. After the DMA took effect a year ago, the EU’s executive Commission moved swiftly to open a raft of investigations into Big Tech companies. Brussels also opened two “ specification proceedings ” in September to spell out what Apple needs to do under the DMA, which aims to make digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable” by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services. In its legally binding decision, the commission detailed measures that the iPhone maker has to take involving nine connectivity features for its iOS operating system. The measures will give device and app makers better access to iPhone features that work with devices. The commission also laid out a second set of measures to make the process for software developers requesting access to iPhone features more transparent and effective. With its decision, Brussels is “providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera said in a press release. “For too long, Apple has operated a walled garden around its products and prevented interoperability,” Director General Agustin Reyna said. The Commission also said Wednesday that Google wasn’t doing enough to comply with DMA. Despite making changes, including removing flight listings, Google was still giving preference to its own services in search results, it said. Google is also failing to let app developers steer users to cheaper options outside its Google Play Store app marketplace, the commission said in preliminary findings. Vice-President JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation, in a rebuke aimed at the EU’s sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act. However, both companies have been under pressure in the U.S. too. Apple is facing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing it of engineering an illegal smartphone monopoly. Meanwhile, federal antitrust regulators are seeking to break up Google after a federal judge ruled Google’s ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/google_apple_dma_eu/'>EC says Google, Apple in violation of DMA gatekeeper rules</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 00:00:00 <p>
A year after kicking off its probe into three American tech giants, the European Union has fired off two sets of preliminary findings accusing Google parent Alphabet of failing to comply with Europe's monopoly-busting Digital Markets Act (DMA). Self-preferencing practices are banned for DMA-designated gatekeepers – Alphabet included – which the EU considers to have significant control over digital markets and the ability to tilt the playing field in their own favor and screw over any competition. "Alphabet treats its own services, such as shopping, hotel booking, transport, or financial and sports results, more favorably in Google Search results than similar services offered by third parties," the EC said. Regulators also flagged Google for giving its own services more prominent treatment - displaying them in dedicated spaces, at the top of results, and with enhanced visual formats that make them stand out from rivals. The commission's other preliminary finding against Google focuses on its Play Store rules, which restrict app developers from steering users to cheaper stuff outside Google's platform. That is to say, according to Euro watchdogs, Google unfairly tries to keep people buying software and other things via its services, so it can take a cut of the sale, when it would be possible to purchase all that stuff more cheaply directly from third-party app makers and the like. Investigators found Google not only prevents app developers from steering users to alternative offers and channels of their choice, where it does allow steering, it imposes fees for outside payment systems that "go beyond what is justified." Its senior director for competition Oliver Bethell responded by claiming the EU's findings "will hurt European businesses and consumers, hinder innovation, weaken security, and degrade product quality." If we can't protect our users from scammy or malicious links … then the commission is effectively forcing us to choose between a closed model and an unsafe one In defending its steering restrictions, Google argues the commission's findings force a false choice between openness and security. "If we can't protect our users from scammy or malicious links … then the commission is effectively forcing us to choose between a closed model and an unsafe one," Bethell continued. As for its cut of purchases, Google argues it needs to "charge reasonable fees" to fund the development of Android and Play services, claiming this supports an open platform for billions of users - not just those splurging €1,000 on premium phones. Separately from the Google, Apple, and Meta non-compliance probes launched last year, the European Commission also yesterday issued a legally binding specification decision detailing how Apple must meet its interoperability obligations under the DMA, following preliminary findings published in December. The measures require Apple to open iOS and iPadOS connectivity features to third-party devices, including smartwatches, headphones, and televisions, enabling functions including displaying iOS notifications on non-Apple hardware, speeding up data transfers, and simplifying device pairing. "As a result, connected devices of all brands will work better on iPhones," the EC said. The decision also requires Apple to improve how developers access technical documentation and specifications needed for interoperability by providing clearer communication, more timely updates, and a predictable timeline for reviewing interoperability requests.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Union has mandated that Apple must open its iOS operating system to enhance compatibility with competing technologies, Financial Post reports. As ordered by the European Commission, Apple needs to make its iOS operating system more accessible to third-party developers and rival device manufacturers. This includes allowing seamless integration of non-Apple devices and applications, such as smartwatches and wireless headphones, with Apple’s products. Additionally, Apple is required to make the process for software developers requesting access more transparent, thereby enhancing interoperability and providing consumers with more choices. Apple has expressed concerns regarding the EU’s directive, arguing that such measures could stifle innovation and unfairly benefit competitors. The company fears that opening its closed ecosystem may compromise user security and privacy, which have been foundational to its products and services. Despite its reservations, Apple has initiated steps to comply with the DMA. The company has announced a series of changes, including allowing app developers to distribute their iPhone apps directly to consumers outside of Apple’s App Store. For Apple, this could translate to substantial financial penalties. U.S. President Donald Trump has condemned the EU’s fines on American tech firms as “overseas extortion” and hinted at retaliatory tariffs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Apple said “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users”. In regards to customer privacy, Apple is especially concerned with the requirements surrounding opening up access to the iOS notification system. The company indicated these measures would allow companies to suck up all user notifications in an unencrypted form to their servers, sidestepping all privacy protections Apple typically enforces. It said the decision allows officials and third-parties to get in the way of Apple releasing new products and features to customers. As well as frustrating the development process, it is essentially being forced to give away all of its innovations to others for free. So far, the European Commission has only used these Digital Markets Act specification tools with Apple. That means only Apple is being forced to comply to this degree, while others can freely leech off of it. Apple does not believe these measures encourage competition and innovation.

Today’s announcement details exactly what third-party integrations the EU commission expects Apple to implement. This includes giving third-party devices access to iOS notifications, as well as way for companies to make like-for-like competitors to AirDrop file sharing, AirPlay streaming, and much more.

They also warned that failure to adhere could trigger an investigation and penalties. This decision from the European Commission follows six months after it initiated specification proceedings to enforce Apple’s compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Per the Commission’s orders, device makers and app developers should gain access to nine iOS connectivity features previously reserved solely for Apple, including peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, NFC capabilities, and device pairing. This could allow Google to integrate AirDrop functionality with Android devices. For Apple device users, security and privacy issues could arise. The first EU order requires Apple to give rival makers of smartphones, headphones and virtual reality headsets access to its technology and mobile operating system so they can connect with iPhones and iPads seamlessly. Apple slammed the EU order, saying it would hurt users and help its rivals. “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” the company said in an email. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.” Apple could face an investigation if regulators subsequently find that it has not followed through on the order that could lead to a fine as much as 10% of its global annual sales.

A man holds an Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max ahead of the launch of sales of the new iPhone 16 series smartphones in a store in Moscow, Russia September 20, 2024.

European Union regulators are taking steps to rein in Google and Apple on antitrust charges, even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to hit the bloc with tariffs for alleged "overseas extortion" of America's tech giants.

The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, said Wednesday that it found Google parent company Alphabet in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) — a landmark law aimed at tackling tech competition issues — with its Search and Google Play products.

The bloc accused Google Search of treating Alphabet's own services more favorably compared to rival ones — a practice known as "self-preferencing," which is not permitted under the DMA.

The EU also said Google Play, Alphabet's mobile app store, prevents app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives.

Google, in response to the EU's actions Wednesday, said they threaten to hurt consumers and businesses. The firm gave the example of a change it made to search results to comply with the DMA that diverts traffic to intermediary platforms, which it said has resulted in higher costs for consumers.

"The Commission's findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of Search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses. This is, quite simply, misguided," Oliver Bethell, Google's EMEA director for competition, said in a blog post.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We will be publishing an in-depth overview of all of the requirements, but in the meantime we have highlighted some key items below. Third-party smartwatches must be able to display and interact with iOS notifications by the end of 2025, which likely means iOS 19.2 or earlier. Apple must make its automatic audio switching feature available to third-party headphones by June 1, 2026, which likely means iOS 19.4 or earlier. This is the feature that allows most AirPods and select Beats to automatically switch connection between Apple devices, such as a Mac and an iPhone. Apple must make changes to iOS that allow for third parties to offer equivalent AirDrop alternatives by June 1, 2026. Apple must make changes to iOS that allow for third parties to offer equivalent AirPlay alternatives by iOS 20, or the end of 2026. iOS 20 is expected to be released to the general public in September 2026.

But so many people appreciated the jab that users convinced Bluesky to reproduce and sell Graber’s shirt — even though it was an esoteric Latin language reference written in black ink on a black fabric. Rose Wang, Bluesky’s COO, said that the company made more money in one day of T-shirt sales than in two years of selling custom domains. The shirts, which Bluesky is selling for $40, are a rebuttal to a shirt that Zuckerberg designed and wore at an event last year. Graber’s shirt says Mundus sine Caesaribus, or, “a world without Caesars.” Like Caesar, Zuckerberg is both powerful and divisive, but it takes a lot of hubris to compare yourself to one of the most controversial political figures in world history. Graber’s fans — or, perhaps, Zuckerberg’s haters — liked the shirt so much that Bluesky almost immediately sold out of its first printing of the shirts. As Wang said, the company made more money in one day selling shirts than it did in two years of custom domain sales. Impressive as it seems, Bluesky didn’t push its domain sales very hard, Wang told TechCrunch. Domain sales make sense for Bluesky, since users can turn domains they own into their social handles, but the ability to buy domains was never even integrated into the Bluesky app. If Bluesky’s other monetization ideas don’t work out, then maybe it’s time for these coders to pivot to irreverent fashion design.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For comparison, AI startup Black Forest Labs, with which xAI partnered last year to launch image generation on Musk’s social network X, charges around $0.05 per image. Another popular image model provider, Ideogram, charges $0.08 on the higher end.

In its documentation, xAI notes that the API doesn’t support adjusting the quality, size, or style of images yet, and that prompts in requests are subject to revision by a “chat model.”

xAI, which launched its API in October 2024, appears to be on the hunt for meaningful sources of revenue as it ramps up training and development of flagship models like Grok 3. The company is reportedly meeting with investors about a potential $10 billion funding round that could bring its valuation to $75 billion.

Hinting at its other ambitions, xAI recently acquired a generative AI video startup and is in the process of expanding the Memphis-based data center it uses to train and run its various models.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dataminr, a data analytics company that counts NATO and OpenAI among its customers, has raised $85 million in a combination of convertible financing and credit, Dataminr announced on Wednesday. “The new capital will allow Dataminr to accelerate its growth trajectory, [and] provide investors with a discount to the IPO price or subsequent round of financing,” CEO Ted Bailey told TechCrunch. “[We’ll] also use this new funding to expand [our] international go-to-market in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and to power additional products in new verticals.” Bailey added that the new tranche, which was led by security-focused VC NightDragon and HSBC, is “pre-IPO convertible financing” and doesn’t set a valuation. NightDragon also created a special-purpose vehicle (SVP) for an additional $100 million in convertible financing from the VC’s affiliates and partners. SVPs are alternative fundraising structures that allow multiple backers to pool their capital and make a single large investment. Dataminr monitors events around the web and processes them using AI algorithms. Dataminr, which Bailey founded in 2009 alongside fellow Yale graduates Sam Hendel and Jeff Kinsey, monitors real-time events around the world. But Dataminr’s history is somewhat clouded with controversy. Police departments are said to have used Dataminr services for surveillance during Black Lives Matter protests. Dataminr said that it’s constantly improving its technology, and that it doesn’t offer functionality that would allow a customer to pinpoint a person’s — or protestor’s — location on a map.

), buying a home is simply not that attainable for many people. Founded in 2022, Multiply Mortgage originally set out to help tech employees access some of the value of their equity compensation while their employers were still private. “Homeownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and we don’t expect interest rates to fall to the levels we saw in 2020 ever again,” White told TechCrunch. So in July 2024, the startup altered course to offer a mortgage benefit program that helps employees of its partner companies, which include the likes of Anduril and Ramp, navigate a home purchase. Today, Multiply offers employees 1:1s with mortgage advisors, employee education sessions around the home purchase and financing process as well as mortgage interest rate discounts of up to .75%. The startup works with a network of 15-20 lenders to access discounted interest rates. For companies, claims CEO White, it’s a no brainer as they incur no costs and what he described as “low administrative overhead” to offer the program. “We’re really creating the category of mortgage as a financial wellness benefit,” he told TechCrunch. Traditional lenders are effectively its main competition, he said, but the startup aims to differentiate itself by a focus on financial wellness via employers in addition to its discounted rates. The company declined to reveal at which valuation this new round was raised. Multiply currently operates as a broker, and is licensed to originate mortgages in 19 states. It also has broker partners in 26 additional states plus the District of Columbia. In a few months’ time, the startup plans to do actual lending itself. Since its pivot, the company has helped more than nearly 100 people finance their homes, White said. Once they’re validated as an employee, they can set up meetings with advisors and then access its online application, transaction dashboard, and education curriculum. White said Multiply is able to offer discounts in that it has automated the mortgage origination process as opposed to a more traditional “very human labor intensive process.” Multiply is not the only company that aggregates potential lenders. But White asserts that the biggest difference between Multiply and LendingTree is the latter is more of a self-serve marketplace to find lenders and compare them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

Nvidia has reportedly acquired Gretel, a San Diego-based startup that’s developed a platform to generate synthetic AI training data. Terms of the acquisition are unknown. The price tag was said to be nine figures, exceeding Gretel’s most recent valuation of $320 million, according to Wired.

Gretel and its team of roughly 80 employees will be folded into Nvidia, where its tech will be deployed as part of the former’s suit of generative AI services for developers, Wired reported.

Gretel was founded in 2019 by Alex Watson, Laszlo Bock, John Myers, and Ali Golshan, who also serves as the company’s CEO. The startup fine-tunes models, adds proprietary tech on top, and then packages these models together to sell them.

Gretel raised more than $67 million in venture capital from investors including Anthos Capital, Greylock, and Moonshots Capital prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.

Nvidia’s acquisition is strategic — and timely. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic are already using synthetic data to train flagship AI models as they exhaust sources of real-world data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The 41-page interim report released on Tuesday comes from the Joint California Policy Working Group on Frontier AI Models, an effort organized by Governor Gavin Newsom following his veto of California’s controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047. In the report, Li, along with co-authors UC Berkeley College of Computing Dean Jennifer Chayes and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace President Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, argue in favor of laws that would increase transparency into what frontier AI labs such as OpenAI are building. According to the report, the novel risks posed by AI systems may necessitate laws that would force AI model developers to publicly report their safety tests, data acquisition practices, and security measures. The report also advocates for increased standards around third-party evaluations of these metrics and corporate policies, in addition to expanded whistleblower protections for AI company employees and contractors. Li et al. write there’s an “inconclusive level of evidence” for AI’s potential to help carry out cyberattacks, create biological weapons, or bring about other “extreme” threats. The report recommends a two-pronged strategy to boost AI model development transparency: trust but verify. AI model developers and their employees should be provided avenues to report on areas of public concern, the report says, such as internal safety testing, while also being required to submit testing claims for third-party verification. Dean Ball, an AI-focused research fellow at George Mason University who was critical of SB 1047, said in a post on X that the report was a promising step for California’s AI safety regulation. It’s also a win for AI safety advocates, according to California State Senator Scott Wiener, who introduced SB 1047 last year. The report appears to align with several components of SB 1047 and Wiener’s follow-up bill, SB 53, such as requiring AI model developers to report the results of safety tests.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Newsletter platform Ghost, an open source competitor to Substack, is now connected to the fediverse, also known as the open social web. Ghost said last year that it was working on an integration with ActivityPub, which would allow its publishers to share their blog posts with the broader open social web. However, Ghost this week announced the launch of its social web beta, which now allows any site running on its Ghost Pro subscription to try out the new ActivityPub integration. When Ghost Pro users connect their blog or newsletter to the fediverse, others across the open social web will be able to follow their account’s handle. Users on federated apps will then be able to follow the Ghost publisher’s posts, as well as interact with them by liking, replying, or reposting. When you follow other publications on the social web, new articles they publish will show up here,” Ghost’s help page explains. “Clicking on a post will open an inline reader view, right inside Ghost, and when you get to the end you’ll be able to like, repost or reply.” With the integration of these two feeds into Ghost’s admin, Ghost will also now allow its publishers to directly post short-form content to the fediverse, helping them to build their reputation and following on the open social web. Ghost’s Reader also alerts users of interactions like follows, replies, likes, and reposts in its “Notifications” section. Later, the company hopes to more deeply integrate users’ social web profiles with Ghost memberships, but for now, they operate independently from one another. The company says that Ghost users can search for and find Threads users’ profiles, but no interactions work because Threads blocks them.

In Brief

Social media site X’s valuation has bounced back to $44 billion, according to a new report from the Financial Times. Elon Musk purchased the platform, formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion back in 2022.

However, a report from Bloomberg states that X has raised close to $1 billion from investors in a deal that values the company at around $32 billion. Musk participated in the equity raise himself, the report says.

Despite the two differing valuations, it’s apparent that X has taken sharp turnaround in terms of its finances, given that Fidelity Investments estimated last September that X’s valuation was below $10 billion.

The platform’s revenue dropped since Musk’s takeover, but X posted $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for 2024, which is about the same as the amount before Musk took over, the Financial Times reports.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A federal judge Tuesday found the Environmental Protection Agency acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when terminating contracts with three nonprofits. The judge issued a temporary restraining order that requires the EPA and Citibank to give nonprofits access to funds in their accounts. The EPA’s termination letters “vaguely reference ‘multiple ongoing investigations’ into ‘programmatic waste, fraud, and abuse and conflicts of interest’ but offer no specific information about such investigations, factual support for the decision, or an individualized explanation for each [of the nonprofits],” the judge wrote. One of the plaintiffs, Climate United, has already committed $392 million to projects that qualify for money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including $31.8 million for solar projects in rural Arkansas and $63 million for solar power plants to be developed in Oregon and Idaho in conjunction with tribal communities. Another plaintiff, Power Forward, has committed $539 million, and the freeze on its accounts has left it “unable to pay outstanding invoices from contractors.” Normally, when the EPA or any other government agency moves to terminate a contract, it sends written notice and gives the awardee an opportunity to object. In this case, the nonprofits didn’t hear from the EPA or Citibank before their accounts were frozen. Instead, when the nonprofits requested withdrawals in February and March, Citibank didn’t release the money, and when asked about it, ignored their inquiries. That termination letter, though, “appears to contravene a duly enacted statute and interferes with [the nonprofits’] statutory rights to these funds,” Judge Chutkan wrote. “It does not appear that EPA…took the legally required steps necessary to terminate these grants, such that its actions were arbitrary and capricious.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Robots are part of an exciting new frontier in tech, but here’s the challenge: robots rely on arrays of sensors, external signals like GPS and Wi-Fi, and customized software to navigate their environments. Further, robotics often involves expensive, ready-made hardware solutions that include built-in software and sensors designed for specific tasks, like estimating relative motion. This technology is used in various applications, including robotic manipulation, mobile robotics, and automated driving. Zhang founded San Francisco-based Tera in 2023 after leading machine learning efforts at Google X, where he worked on developing and commercializing geospatial models. Spatial reasoning AI allows machines to navigate, recognize objects, and interact with three-dimensional space. General-purpose navigation software that eliminates hardware constraints could further drastically lower costs and implementation time, making robots 1,000 times more valuable, Zhang told TechCrunch. “It could also enable new capabilities for existing robots in areas where autonomy was simply impossible due to constraints on sensors,” he said. “Our key unique value proposition is that we are completely hardware agnostic, which means we focus on solving general-purpose navigation in pure software form for any robot and any new environment without needing to be re-tuned every single time,” Zhang said. The company’s clients are primarily robotic manufacturers that already have customers but face challenges when expanding their solutions to different autonomy platforms, situations, and environments. “We see a future where software becomes the most valuable asset of robotic platforms. Once people realize that existing cameras that are already on robots are sufficient for positioning and navigation, they will be able to deploy cheaper robots more quickly at scale,” Zhang told TechCrunch. Investors in Tera’s seed round include Felicis, Inovia, Caltech, Wilson Hill, and entrepreneur-investor Naval Ravikant.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia’s Omniverse is a simulation platform that allows automakers to develop and operate complex, AI-enabled virtual environments to generate synthetic data, test AV software, build digital twins of factories, and more. GM announced it has expanded its partnership with Nvidia in a collaboration that touches every aspect of the automakers business, including its factories, robots and self-driving cars. It will also use Omniverse to train robotics platforms for operations like material handling and transport. When it comes to self-driving cars, GM said it will use Nvidia’s Drive AGX for its in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin safety experiences. Self-driving truck company Gatik, which is backed by Isuzu and Goodyear Ventures, has also joined Nvidia’s automotive ecosystem. The Silicon Valley and Toronto-based company, which specializes in autonomous middle-mile logistics via self-driving box trucks, says it will develop and deploy Drive AGX, accelerated by Drive Thor, to serve as the AI brain across its fleet of trucks. Gatik says it’s also running its AI models on the DriveOS system for safety. In a statement, Plus also said that it is pioneering “AV 2.0 technologies, which comprise generative AI, visual language models and other foundational models.” As we can see from the glossary above, Nvidia’s AGX platform is more suited to ADAS and low-level autonomy. To get that more advanced sensor fusion and on-board compute that’s necessary for higher levels of autonomy, usually companies rely on Nvidia’s Orin or Thor SoCs. The startup recently made deals with commercial vehicle manufacturers including Traton Group, IVECO, and Hyundai to integrate SuperDrive into their trucks. Yet another self-driving truck company, Torc, announced it is working with Nvidia to develop a scalable physical AI compute system for its AVs. Virginia-based Torc, a subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG, will also work with Flex, which builds automotive-grade compute platforms. Torc says it is using a cocktail of Nvidia chip architecture, including Drive AGX, Drive Orin, and DriveOS to support the future deployment of autonomous driving capabilities as it works towards a 2027 commercial launch. Rather than use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulator, Volvo is working with Ansys, a software simulation company. Ansys’s so-called “Fluent” simulation software, powered by eight Blackwell GPUs, has helped Volvo design its new EX90 electric vehicle in a way that reduces aerodynamic drag and, as a result, improves battery performance. Ansys says its Fluent simulator helped Volvo reduce total simulation run time from 24 hours to 6.5 hours, allowing for multiple design iterations per day, optimized vehicle design, and accelerated time to market.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA), a labor union representing educators across the state, says hackers stole the sensitive personal information of more than half a million of its members.

PSEA is the largest organization for educators in Pennsylvania, representing current and former teachers, counselors, health care workers, and school social workers.

In a filing with Maine’s attorney general on Tuesday, PSEA said it experienced a cyberattack in July 2024 that saw an unauthorized actor access its network to steal a trove of data belonging to more than 517,000 individuals.

The stolen data includes highly sensitive personal information, such as members’ government-issued identification documents, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, medical information, and financial information containing card numbers, and their associated PINs and expiration dates.

PSEA said member account numbers, PINs, passwords, and security codes were also accessed during the breach, according to a letter sent to affected individuals.

“We want to stress that not all data elements were acquired for every impacted individual,” PSEA told affected members in the letter.

PSEA also said it “took steps, to the best of our ability and knowledge, to ensure that the data taken by the unauthorized actor was deleted,” implying that PSEA was the target of a ransomware or data extortion attack, and subsequently paid a ransom demand to the hackers responsible.

Paying a ransom demand is no guarantee that the malicious hackers deleted the stolen data. Last year’s takedown of the notorious LockBit ransomware gang unearthed evidence that the gang’s hackers still retained reams data belonging to victims who had paid a ransom demand.

PSEA did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mobile networks continue to be a major target for cybersecurity breaches, and Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon’s persistent attacks on multiple carriers are only the latest known examples. On Wednesday, Cape is announcing a few big developments in its efforts. The Washington, D.C.-based company — founded by a former head of Palantir’s national security business who previously worked in the U.S. Army’s special forces — is releasing an open beta of its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) mobile service, which comes in the form of a $99/month subscription plan. Another $15 million is coming in the form of a debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank. Cape is not disclosing valuation, but it’s notable that the funding is coming at a time when startups building military, defense, and security services are getting increased focus and priority at a time when geopolitics are shifting. In January 2025, Cape made its first move to launch a service for consumers. In addition to a commitment not to track or sell data, the plan includes unlimited voice minutes, texts, and data (but no voice over Wi-Fi yet, Doyle said; that’s still coming), as well as encrypted voicemail. As part of its plan, Cape also provides protection against two other emerging cellular threats. And it offers what it describes as “advanced signalling protection,” which is in reference to side channel attacks via telephony signaling protocol Signalling System 7. Tracking via SS7 has been a known issue for years, but in December 2024 it was highlighted by the U.S. government as a particular issue for sensitive calls, texts, and data, which it said could be accessed by spies from military and other personnel using the protocol. Doyle added that general availability for its phone plan will come later this year. There are fewer than 1,000 users on its closed beta, and a couple of hundred Obscura phone owners. Europe has proven to be a big market for privacy-first services, as well as those that provide alternatives to engaging with Big Tech. That could present an interesting addressable market for a startup like Cape. Just as mainstream carriers like to link up in marketing partnerships with buzzy consumer services to drive more signups — one recent example being T-Mobile inking a partnership with Perplexity for an “AI Phone” — Cape is doing the same with like-minded privacy-first companies. Those who sign up to a Cape $99/month phone plan can pay $1 to add six months of Proton’s Unlimited plan, which includes encrypted cloud storage, VPN, expanded secure e-mail, and more.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The governments of Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore are likely customers of Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions, according to a new technical report by a renowned digital security lab. Paragon has long tried to distinguish itself from competitors, such as NSO Group — whose spyware has been abused in several countries — by claiming to be a more responsible spyware vendor. In 2021, an unnamed senior Paragon executive told Forbes that authoritarian or non-democratic regimes would never be its customers. Israeli news outlets reported in late 2024 that U.S. venture capital AE Industrial Partners had acquired Paragon for at least $500 million upfront. Starting from that tip, and after developing several fingerprints capable of identifying associated Paragon servers and digital certificates, Citizen Lab’s researchers found several IP addresses hosted at local telecom companies.

TechCrunch reached out to spokespeople for the following governments: Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore. When reached by TechCrunch, Paragon’s Fleming said that Citizen Lab reached out to the company and provided “a very limited amount of information, some of which appears to be inaccurate.” Citizen Lab noted that all the people that were notified by WhatsApp, who then reached out to the organization to have their phones analyzed, used an Android phone. “We’ve seen first-hand how commercial spyware can be weaponized to target journalists and civil society, and these companies must be held accountable,” read Meta’s statement. Given that Android phones do not always preserve certain device logs, Citizen Lab noted that it’s likely more people were targeted by the Graphite spyware, even if there was no evidence of Paragon’s spyware on their phones. Targeting specific apps as opposed to the device’s operating system, Citizen Lab noted, may make it harder for forensic investigators to find evidence of a hack, but may give the app makers more visibility into spyware operations. “Paragon’s spyware is trickier to spot than competitors like [NSO Group’s] Pegasus, but, at the end of the day, there is no ‘perfect’ spyware attack,” Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told TechCrunch. Citizen Lab also said it analyzed the iPhone of David Yambio, who works closely with Caccia and others at his NGO. Yambio received a notification from Apple about his phone being targeted by mercenary spyware, but the researchers couldn’t find evidence that he was targeted with Paragon’s spyware.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. Has cut 45 employees, more than half of its workforce, after being acquired by cybersecurity company Armis for $120 million in March. Most of those affected are based in Israel as the company undergoes a streamlining process. Announced it will be shutting down several of its offices in accordance with Elon Musk’s DOGE, including its Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy and the DEI branch in the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. Has reportedly laid off some staff, according to LinkedIn posts from ex-employees. Announced it will lay off 65 employees, affecting 5% of its total workforce.

Last year, the travel giant cut about 1,500 roles in its Product & Technology division. Is shutting down its operations amid “ongoing challenges in healthcare.” It’s unclear the number of employees affected. In 2023, the women’s healthcare startup raised $18 million to fund its expansion. Cut 51 jobs in its San Francisco headquarters, according to state filings with the Employment Development Department. Reportedly laid off dozens of employees as part of a new cost-cutting effort that aims to ensure “long-term success” in the startup’s mission to curb misinformation online.

Reportedly let go of approximately 200 employees, according to The Verge. The company previously cut 100 employees as part of a layoff round in August 2024. Is laying off 50% of its workforce, including CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of the autonomous vehicle company will move under General Motors. Has shut down operations, CEO Paul Kesserwani announced on LinkedIn. The fintech startup’s post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook. Laid off dozens of workers in its communications department in order to help the company “move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers.” Is laying off 300 people, according to a leaked memo reported by Business Insider.

Pete Florence was listed as co-founder and CEO of Generalist AI at a panel at Nvidia’s GTC conference in San Jose yesterday. The panel was for portfolio companies of Nvidia’s VC arm, NVentures. “We are largely still in stealth,” Florence told TechCrunch, explaining that the mission of the startup is “to make general-purpose robots a reality.” Florence left DeepMind a year ago, per his LinkedIn profile. Florence joins a string of other DeepMind alums who have founded their own companies like autonomous coding startup Reflection AI, biotech startup Latent Labs, Mistral, and others. Outside of DeepMind but still within Alphabet, key leaders behind Google’s viral NotebookLM product left to found their own AI startup late last year. DeepMind has its own robotics division, which unveiled new AI models for controlling robots this month. Florence said he couldn’t specify exactly what his startup was up to during the GTC panel, but it’s clear it will focus on robotics. “We are dead set on making robots that can do absolutely anything,” Florence said in response to a question about what the world would look like if his startup was wildly successful. “So just imagine a world where the marginal cost of physical labor is driven to zero.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/eu-sends-apple-first-dma-interoperability-instructions-for-apps-and-connected-devices/'>EU sends Apple first DMA interoperability instructions for apps and connected devices</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 00:00:00 <p>
According to the Commission, device manufacturers and app developers should be able to access nine iOS connectivity features that were restricted to Apple’s exclusive use before, such as peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connectivity, NFC features and device pairing. As a result, Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, connected TVs or other, non-Apple devices should work better with an iPhone. Google could use this opportunity to make AirDrop work with Android devices. Headphone manufacturers could support SharePlay, a feature that only works with AirPods for now. This follows the Commission’s opening of two specification proceedings on Apple back in September – one of which focused on ensuring the DMA’s interoperability requirements are effectively met when it comes to Apple allowing connected devices to tap into iOS’s connectivity features, including notifications and device pairing. The second concerns requests for interoperability made by third-party app developers with features of Apple’s iOS and iPadOS platforms. (Reminder: Penalties for non-compliance with the DMA can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover.) Apple isn’t happy about either the DMA, in general, or these specific interoperability mandates. Additionally, Apple claims the specification proceedings could lead to dire consequences for its European users’ privacy and security – since it says the bloc is requiring that it sends unencrypted data to third parties. Apple claims the interoperability requirements mean it will be forced to expose potentially sensitive user data – from notifications containing personal messages or one-time-codes, to details of Wi-Fi networks users have joined – to outside developers that could abuse the information for tracking and profiling. Social media ad giant Meta – whose business empire is based on tracking and profiling to sell ads – has been a leading requester of app interoperability capabilities, per Apple. Apple also told TechCrunch the EU barred Apple from providing information to users about potential risks when they agree to receive their iOS notifications on a third party device – in this case users will see a pop-up, per Apple, but it will just ask if they wish to receive their notifications on the connected device, without the additional context the company believes users should also be given. In a statement following the EU’s preliminary decision on the specification proceedings, Apple said: “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. Earlier this week, when Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky unveiled its new smartwatches, he also wrote a lengthy blog post explaining all of Apple’s restrictions that make third-party smartwatches worse than the Apple Watch. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things,” Migicovsky wrote. And he disagrees with Apple’s attacks on the DMA. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation,” Migicovsky wrote. And things have become harder for third-party smartwatch companies in recent years. As a result, smartwatch makers can’t get the content of your notifications unless users manually enable full content previews on the lockscreen. According to them, Apple should allocate a small portion of its development resources to create a level playing field, allowing anyone to innovate and compete fairly with the tech company that currently has the greatest market capitalization in the world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
