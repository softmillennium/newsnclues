The podcast "Closing the Round" has reached the middle of its fifth season, covering topics from investments to technology. Guests
included Mykhailo Fedorov and other influential figures.

The technology podcast "Closed Round", partnered by the IT company FAVBET Tech, has reached the middle of its fifth season, reports UNN.

Behind us are 26 episodes and dozens of hours of conversations about investments, startups and technologies, as well as an overview of popular culture phenomena and interviews with people who are changing the Ukrainian technology market. Let's recall the most popular and resonant ones.

The first episodes of the season began with deep analyses of cases of global and Ukrainian companies and iconic personalities: how Sam Altman turned OpenAI into a commercial phenomenon, why startups vitally need creativity (says Ihor Finashkin from I AM IDEA), and what happens when technology giants like Google become too influential.

Next, the hosts of "Closed Round" analyzed in detail how the largest venture fund Softbank "drained" 100 billion dollars, how Victoria Tigipko created a successful investment portfolio of TA Ventures, and also talked about the influence of Peter Thiel on the American elections and the phenomenon of the popularity of vertical micro-series of Ukrainian production.

One of the most popular episodes of the season was an exclusive with Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, who shared details of the Ministry of Digital Affairs' work, the development of the "Diia" project, and his own productivity secrets. Viewers were no less actively watching releases about startup niches according to Y Combinator, investment strategies of Andriy Fedoriv, as well as about the success of a neobank for cryptocurrencies and the case of Stripe - the most expensive fintech in the world.

"In the fifth season, we decided to talk not only about traditional technological projects, such as SoftBank, or investments in the industry, but also about how the technological world affects classic industries, such as the creation of vertical series or how social networks made Formula 1 popular again. It is very interesting to understand this," says co-author Ilya Kabachinsky.

The latest episodes are dedicated to the hottest technology news and trends: the big deal to acquire Uklon and Tabletki.ua by Kyivstar, the phenomenon of the Chinese AI giant DeepSeek, and the impact of popular podcasters on US politics ("How Joe Rogan and podcasters brought Trump to power"). In addition, they talked with Alna Mysko about the success of the Ukrainian startup Fuelfinance and with the ex-president of Kyivstar Petro Chernyshov about his approach to technology investments.

"In the new season, we started inviting guests who talk about niches, for example, how payments work. It turned out that the audience is interested in this, the views are large, and most importantly, organic," adds podcast co-author Anton Poleskov.

Anton Poleskov and Ilya Kabachinsky assure that even more interesting guests and unexpected topics await the viewers. "We already have so many guests ahead, our editor is already working even on weekends. It seems that we have not covered even 3% of those we can call" - say the presenters.

The constant partner of the podcast is the IT company with Ukrainian DNA FAVBET Tech, a developer of solutions for the entertainment industry and an active participant in the technological community of Ukraine. The company is a resident of Diia.City, a member of the IT Ukraine Association. FAVBET Tech is among the top 50 product IT companies in Ukraine.

European Union Lays Out How Apple Must Open Its Tech up to Competitors Under Bloc's Digital Rules

LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday outlined the steps that Apple must take to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to work better with competing technologies.

It's the first time the EU has moved to compel a technology company to comply with the bloc's digital Digital Markets Act — a wide-ranging set of regulations designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies from cornering markets. 

After the DMA took effect a year ago, the EU's executive Commission moved swiftly to open a raft of investigations into Big Tech companies. 

Brussels also opened two “ specification proceedings ” in September to spell out what Apple needs to do under the DMA, which aims to make digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable” by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company's products or services. 

In its legally binding decision, the commission detailed measures that the iPhone maker has to take involving nine connectivity features for its iOS operating system. 

The measures will give device and app makers better access to iPhone features that work with devices. For example, iPhone users will have “enhanced possibilities” to receive notifications on non-Apple smartwatches, including receiving pictures and the ability to reply to them. Users could also benefit from more seamless pairing of wireless headphones from other brands. 

Access to Apple's wireless file transfer technology would let third-party developers create apps similar to the AirDrop feature. 

The commission also laid out a second set of measures to make the process for software developers requesting access to iPhone features more transparent and effective. Among the changes are better access to technical documentation not yet available to third parties, it said. 

With its decision, Brussels is "providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera said in a press release. 

“Effective interoperability" for will mean “better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices,” she said. 

European consumer group BEUC hailed the decision. 

“For too long, Apple has operated a walled garden around its products and prevented interoperability," Director General Agustin Reyna said. 

Apple, however, voiced its unhappiness, saying it's bad for the company's products and for European users.

“Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,” the company said in a statement. 

Apple said it will continue to work with the European Commission to "help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”

The Commission also said Wednesday that Google wasn't doing enough to comply with DMA. Despite making changes, including removing flight listings, Google was still giving preference to its own services in search results, it said. 

Google is also failing to let app developers steer users to cheaper options outside its Google Play Store app marketplace, the commission said in preliminary findings. While it's acceptable for Google to charge a fee for downloading an app in its app store, the company is charging fees that "go beyond what is justified," for every purchase of digital goods or services, it said. 

Google said the EU findings will require the company to make even more changes to how it displays some search results, “which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses. This is, quite simply, misguided.”

The commission's app store findings, meanwhile, “create a false choice between openness and security" and risk exposing Europe users to more “malware and fraud,” it added. 

Google now has the chance to reply to the findings. 

If the commission decides Google is in “non-compliance” with the DMA, it can issue a fine of up to 10% of the company's annual global revenue. But officials have said that they want to avoid issuing blockbuster fines and instead negotiate with companies to get them to comply. 

The EU's crack down on the global tech industry has irritated President Donald Trump, who recently blasted the bloc's hefty antitrust fines for U.S. tech companies. Vice-President JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation, in a rebuke aimed at the EU's sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.

However, both companies have been under pressure in the U.S. too. Apple is facing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing it of engineering an illegal smartphone monopoly. Meanwhile, federal antitrust regulators are seeking to break up Google after a federal judge ruled Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

A B.C. crowdfunding company that facilitates fractional investments as low as $1 per share in real estate developments has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine to the B.C. Securities Commission for unregistered trading.

Since July 2018, Addy Technology Corp. had not been registered in any capacity — including as a securities dealer — but commission investigators found it to be engaging in activities similar to a registrant, by soliciting investors through its online platform, email and social media.

Addy was also conducting what the commission described as "intermediating" trades and also receiving compensation in the form of fees.

Addy agreed to the fine in a March 17 settlement agreement after voluntarily providing information to investigators and admitting to the misconduct.

The platform matches small-scale investors to the likes of real estate investment trusts (REIT) and developers across Canada, known as issuers in legal terms.

For example, an issuing company in Victoria recently obtained financing for an 18-unit, purpose-built rental complex from 420 Canadians, according to addyinvest.ca.

Between July 9, 2018, and Feb. 14, 2025, Addy traded in approximately $26 million of securities of the issuers using the Addy platform. The average amount invested in the issuers was approximately $700 per investor, according to the settlement.

Addy charges investors $50 annual membership fees for early access to certain properties and additional features on Addy's online platform.

Addy tried to use exemption rules but was not eligible.

For instance, some of the issuers Addy was promoting were owned by Addy principals, according to the agreement, and this negated Addy's ability to utilize national crowdfunding rules that exempt those registration requirements, which otherwise provide a level of investor protection in the alternative lending space.

“By engaging in the above conduct, Addy engaged in the business of trading securities without being registered and without an exemption, contrary to the [B.C. Securities Act],” the agreement stated.

Addy has since made an application for registration as a dealer of securities, according to the commission.

	IT services firms Wipro, TechMahindra, and L&T Technology on Wednesday announced individual partnerships with chipmaking giant Nvidia for AI-based solutions for various industries.


	These software firms are showcasing the solutions leveraging Nvidia technologies at the US-based chip major's ongoing annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in California.


	Tech Mahindra has unveiled an autonomous pharmacovigilance (PV) solution powered by Nvidia AI software to enhance drug safety management. By leveraging agentic AI and automation, the solution improves the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of PV processes, addressing challenges like manual delays and data overload.


	It integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise tools, including NeMo, NIM microservices, and AI Blueprints, to optimise case intake, data transformation, quality control, and compliance.


	The AI-driven PV solution instantly flags prioritises, and processes the request by eliminating human intervention that could potentially lead to delays and errors.


	The solution reduces turnaround times by up to 40 per cent, enhances data accuracy by 30 per cent, and cuts operational costs by 25 per cent.


	"As the pharmaceutical industry navigates volumes of data during trials and post-launch, our collaboration with Nvidia leverages generative AI and multi-agent systems to streamline the pharmacovigilance process," Nikhil Malhotra, Chief Innovation Officer & Global Head of AI and Emerging Technologies of Tech Mahindra, said.


	Wipro has introduced new Agentic AI services aimed at enabling nations worldwide to harness their unique infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks to develop and implement artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.


	The solution integrates Wipro's WeGA Studio with Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an Agentic AI-powered ecosystem. This ecosystem supports diverse applications that can revolutionise citizen experiences in sectors like banking and financial services, emergency response, healthcare, and education. By driving public sector innovation, it aims to stimulate economic development.


	Additionally, the solution offers pre-built responsible AI accelerators, allowing clients to swiftly create tailored use cases and high-performance models aligned with their specific goals.


	"Organisations are seeking AI solutions that are not only effective but also ethical and transparent.


	"By working together with Nvidia, we will be able to quickly deploy AI agent systems and technologies while addressing the increased concerns many government agencies and organisations have over data privacy, security, and national sovereignty," said Nagendra Bandaru, President and Managing Partner, Wipro Technology Services.

With a market capitalization of $18.6 billion, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON is a leading global semiconductor company specializing in high-performance energy-efficient solutions. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company designs and manufactures a diverse portfolio of power management, sensing, and connectivity solutions that cater to key industries, including automotive, industrial, and communications.

Companies valued at over $10 billion are often categorized as “large-cap stocks,” a distinction ON Semiconductor fits this category through its strong market position. Renowned for its innovations in electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and power efficiency technologies, ON Semiconductor plays a critical role in driving the next generation of intelligent and sustainable electronics.

However, it hasn't been smooth sailing, as the stock has plummeted 45.8% from its 52-week high of $80.08, which it reached on July 29 last year. Over the past three months, the stock has dropped 33.1%, compared to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLK 3.9% decline over the same time period.  

ON Semiconductor has been caught in a relentless downtrend, plunging 41.2% over the past year and 38.5% in the last six months, a stark contrast to XLK, which dipped a mere 2.3% in six months and even managed a 2.8% gain over the year.

The stock has also exhibited sustained bearish momentum, trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since early December. 

ON Semiconductor, a key player in analog chips and silicon carbide for EVs, saw strong growth post covid but is now facing headwinds. The EV and industrial markets are slowing, leading to a 14% revenue decline in 2024 and a 23% drop in earnings. While the company remains confident in its long-term strategy, its weak price action suggests investors may want to stay cautious amid market uncertainty.

In early March, ON Semiconductor made a $6.9 billion all-cash acquisition offer for Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. ALGM at $35.10 per share, a 31% premium over its prior closing price. Allegro's board rejected the bid, deeming it inadequate. Following the rejection, Allegro's stock surged 8%, while ON's shares dropped more than 5% to a three-year low. Analysts expressed skepticism over the deal's profitability due to interest expenses, while speculation remains on whether ON will return with a higher offer.

In a similar downtrend, ON's competitor, STMicroelectronics N.V. STM, has also struggled, with its stock falling 8.3% over the past six months and plunging 42.5% over the past year, reflecting broader weakness in the semiconductor sector.

Despite its recent slump, ON Semiconductor is still catching analysts' attention, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. The stock holds a consensus "Moderate Buy" rating from 31 analysts, and with a mean price target of $61.16, it suggests a compelling 40.9% upside from current levels.

Ubisoft is banking on the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows to fight its way out of financial troubles as the French videogame publisher grapples with falling revenue, a sinking stock price and takeover speculation.

The title, which will be launched on Thursday, marks a return to the company's best-selling franchise after a string of high-profile flops including Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws cast doubts on its strategy of licensing new intellectual property to create games.

Ubisoft's stock took a beating last year, falling more than 40 percent last year and drawing interest from an activist investor. The company's founding Guillemot family, its largest shareholder, has also been exploring talks with Tencent and other investors on a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.

Ubisoft declined to comment on speculation of selling the company's intellectual property.

The launch of the latest game, however, has been marred by criticism on social media including from Elon Musk over its diverse set of characters, as backlash against diversity efforts gains momentum in the US following President Donald Trump's election.

"The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows is a bit of an existential moment for Ubisoft," said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer at NYU's Stern School of Business.

"If it does really well, it could go a long way toward repairing its financial position."

After two delays and multiple leaks, the newest entry in the best-selling franchise transports players to feudal Japan, a fan-favorite setting for gamers. It features two protagonists: Naoe, a stealthy female assassin, and Yasuke, a heavily armored African samurai inspired by the real-life eponymous figure.

Ubisoft has refined the series' core mechanics of parkour and stealth to enhance the dual-character system. "They're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but they really hope that what they tried with the previous games still works right now," said Jordan Van Andel, who has played the game and whose YouTube channel JorRaptor has over one million subscribers.

Van Andel, whose content has in the past been sponsored by Ubisoft, said the game offered a more polished experience than recent titles in the franchise but its story was disappointing.

He added that the game needs to attract a player base beyond core fans to match the financial success of "Assassin's Creed Valhalla," the last big release in the series that came out in 2020 and the first game in the franchise to make over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,652 crore) in revenue.

Diversity Conundrum 

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes the current US political climate could also pose challenges to the game, saying that Trump "has made it okay to be anti-DEI."

Since its reveal more than two years ago, "Assassin's Creed Shadows" has faced criticism from groups over its creative choices such as having a black samurai and a female assassin.

"We could argue that the people that voted for him (Trump)... they would have hated the game anyway, but I think that they would have been less vocal," Pachter said.

North America accounted for over 53 percent of Ubisoft's total videogame bookings in its fiscal year 2024, as many of the company's franchises such as "Far Cry" have a broad appeal to the American audience.

Games with diverse characters have seen strong success in the past such as Sony's "Horizon", which features a female protagonist and is one of the company's most successful franchises.

Van Dreunen believes the controversy could work in Ubisoft's favor. "It's free press this only makes the game more interesting to a lot of players, I'm sure," he said.

Recently installed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight. (AP: Justin Tang)

Canada was always meant to follow the United States in acquiring world-leading Australian radar technology but "things moved quickly" after Donald Trump won the US presidency.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight, after a conversation with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Defence Minister Richard Marles says there are still some hurdles to clear, but the sale of the technology would be the biggest defence export in Australia's history.

For months, senior officials have been discussing exporting Australia's world-leading radar technology JORN to the United States, but after Donald Trump's return to the White House, Canada saw an opportunity and leapt.

Overnight, new Canadian leader Mark Carney spoke to his counterpart, Anthony Albanese, then flew to his country's Arctic territory of Nunavut to announce a $6.5 billion high-tech Australian military purchase.

"Today, I'm announcing that our government will be working with our long-standing defence and security partner Australia to build a new, long-range, over-the-horizon military radar system," he said.

"[It] will enable Canada to detect and respond to both air and maritime threats over our Arctic both faster and from further away. It will most fundamentally keep all Canadians safe."

Following President Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada and Greenland, Ottawa is purchasing the Australian-developed technology known as the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN) to build its new Arctic Over-the-Horizon Radar system.

The Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN) has been in service for more than three decades. (BAE Systems)

Ottawa has been under pressure from Washington to step up its defence spending and the new radar system will support "NORAD", the joint US-Canadian initiative that detects incoming threats.

Now in its fourth decade of service, the high-frequency, sky-wave, over-the-horizon (OTHR) system is considered the most advanced in the world, providing wide-area surveillance of ships and aircraft out to 3,000 kilometres.

Unlike traditional radars that were limited by line of sight, Australian scientists designed JORN to beam a high-frequency radio signal skywards towards the ionosphere above the earth's surface, which then refracted the signal down to illuminate a target.

The echo from the target then travels by a similar path back to a separate receiver site and the data received is processed into real-time tracking information — a capability crucial to monitoring Australia's vast northern maritime approaches.

With the United States continuing its campaign of tariffs on foreign nations, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was good for Australia to "diversify" its trade relationships.

"[Mark Carney] certainly spoke to me about the over-the-horizon radar technology that Canada is interested in purchasing from Australia, it's important that we diversify our trade relationships," Mr Albanese said.

"It's important that we develop that diverse series of relationships and Canada is a very important one, we have so much in common."

In recent meetings, senior Australian officials have continued discussing exporting and installing the JORN technology on the United States' west coast, but the massive project faces uncertainty under the Elon Musk-led DOGE audit of Pentagon spending.

For well over a year, American military officials have privately expressed interest in purchasing Australia's JORN technology because of its potential to monitor military movements as far away as China's mainland.

One senior Australian official confirmed to the ABC that "the Canadians were always going to follow the US purchase and slipstream off that" but circumstances changed and "things moved quickly".

Following Canada's announcement, Defence Minister Richard Marles talked up the potential of the final JORN deal, which could end up being Australia's largest military export on record.

"There's a little water to go under the bridge, but what's in prospect here is potentially the biggest defence industry export that Australia has ever been a part of," he told ABC News Breakfast.

"That would obviously be very good for Australian industry."

The ABC has confirmed the United Kingdom, where the parent company of BAE Systems Australia is based, has also expressed interest in purchasing the JORN technology, but is yet to approve the idea.
