Elliott has an understandable aversion to the classic boy band track: she’s been subject to frequent teasing from her classmates over the beloved millennial ballad. “When I drop her off, the boys [sing the lyrics], ‘Tell me why,’ and she’s like, ‘Stop doing that’ … And then I start doing it to embarrass her because that’s what dads do!” AJ McLean achieved fame as a member of the Backstreet Boys, but a fair share of challenges have come along with his worldwide success. He was later joined by Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Kevin […] Luckily for McLean, he discovered that Elliott does “secretly” love some Backstreet Boys songs — even if she won’t admit to it. “‘Ava’ has changed her name quite a few times since she was about five. Last year she asked us to start calling her Elliot and it stuck. AJ told People in September 2022 that he was fully supportive of his daughter’s name change simply because it made her happy.

Principally, there is Brown’s companion, Cosmo (voiced by Alan Tudyk), based on a cartoon character with a painted face; Pratt’s motormouth utility bot, Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie), who is able to change size; and Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson), the animatronic-looking leader of the rebellion. However, the biggest challenge for production VFX supervisor Matthew Butler (“Ready Player One”) of Digital Domain was selecting the most appropriate capture technique. “ Because of the speed and adaptability that the brothers wanted to have, it made more sense to go with accelerometer-based sensor motion capture [from Xsens] instead of the more traditional optical motion capture,” Butler told IndieWire. The performers wore suits with inertial sensors that provided acceleration to compute velocity and position. “ That frees you up so that now they can be on the set without any complicated photogrammetry systems in place,” added Butler. The most complex robot, though, was Cosmo, with his oversized head and unrealistic form. He needed to be solved before anything else, so Butler arranged an early traditional mo-cap test at Digital Domain for the Russo brothers with the help of animation director Piotr Karwas. Fortunately, Karwas had a young daughter who was willing to act as Cosmo on the mo-cap stage. “ We wanted to have this innocent performance conveyed [by] Cosmo,” Butler said. “So we basically had her do some childlike performances, and we got that motion captured and applied it to a fairly crude proxy of Cosmo rendered through Unreal Engine. But when they finally got the green light, panic started to set in about Cosmo. “There was still somewhat concern about his lack of dexterity,” continued Butler. “Not only has Cosmo got a big ball for the head but he can’t talk [though he conveys a projected consciousness] and he can’t gesticulate with his face because of a permanently painted grin. Everyone goes, ‘Maybe he should have eyebrows.’ We decided to honor the painted face, knowing a lot can be done with pantomime to express emotion, and the animators took that limitation as a challenge.” Butler told the directors that they needed to find a way of making him mechanically feasible. Then they found a way of adding emotion to the painted face when Butler pitched designing the pupils of his eyes as dark smoked glass with a camera behind them. As for Herman and Mr. Peanut, they had their own limitations to overcome. “And we took Dennis’ designs and made them feel like they could actually exist in the world of robotics,” Behrens continued. “They had proper joint structure and mechanics that would allow him to do what he does [sizing up]. Meanwhile, Mr. Peanut was a challenge because they tried to figure out what level of complexity his facial expressions and animation could have. “But we also wanted that to feel limited like he’s a mechanical base with a sort of elastic, latex shell wrapped around it with some sort of capacitors and pistons that would allow him to do a slight pucker or a slight smile. You’ll notice he can do eye darts and looks around at people.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,” the Fed’s Open Market Committee said in a statement. The Fed’s dual mandate is to seek maximum employment and keep inflation in check at about 2% level.

Cooke, who has known Conover since 2018, alleged, “Craig never expressed interest. I first found out about Spritz last summer when me and Paige [DeSorbo] were on our way to @taylorswift at Metlife and the party bus was stocked with these delicious wine spritzers,” Conover wrote in a lengthy Instagram post in April 2024. “One sip was all it took for me to realize they were onto something and I needed to learn more about the brand — I loved the concept of a refreshing wine based drink & how they brought everyone together.” “Obviously I’ve always had respect for Austen [Kroll] and Kyle and all of them but being in the liquor business or wine liquor business now, I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh. Conover also claimed he “would have loved to invest” in Loverboy, but “that wasn’t an option.” Cooke initially told Andy Cohen on a May 2024 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen that there was “no bad blood” between him and Conover over Spritz Society. “I don’t really think there was an investment, and it seems like all the press is referencing me.” Cooke claimed that Conover was well aware that he was looking for investors and fundraising opportunities when they were in Vermont for Winter House in March 2022. I wanna make that very clear,” Cooke said on the podcast. “We were actually fundraising — I was very vocal about this with my close friends, Craig included, during Winter House [season 2].

Cooke claimed that “10 minutes before” their friend Tom Schwartz showed up at the bar, Conover “sprung” his Spritz Society deal on him. “The next day I texted him like, ‘Hey man, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to what you said about this opportunity you have, and please, like, hold off from signing anything.

It’s trying to stay relevant in an industry that is really good at keeping the startups small.” “The more I think about it, the more I think Craig was intentionally or unintentionally trying to justify things and misled Claudia and Ben as to what we discussed,” Cooke wrote in a comment left on Tartick’s June 2024 Instagram post. “Craig is deeply disappointed and saddened by Kyle’s abrupt accusations,” a rep for Conover told Page Six in June 2024 after Cooke’s appearance on the “Trading Secrets” podcast. “The truth only hurts one person in this instance, and it’s not Craig. Therefore, he will not comment further on this matter nor be drawn into an unprofessional arena.” The statement continued: “Craig has learned to blame himself and not others for everything that happens in his life, including the success of his products and companies. Conover exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2024 that his feud with Cooke was captured by the Summer House cameras. “Unfortunately for you, we did film it,” he teased, confirming season 9 highlights their issues. Despite their tension during summer 2024, Conover explained they had moved forward. “Andy [Cohen] caught me off guard,” Cooke exclusively told Us at Us Weekly + Pluto TV Reality Stars of the Year Party in October 2024, reflecting on his and Conover’s drama. “Ben, Claudia, you guys are good, I don’t mind anyone jumping into the alcohol [space],” he added.

The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. Looking at the more realistic possibilities, HBO is having a big comeback year. Though the latter series, which won, is over, HBO is still in strong standing now that “The Pitt,” from its sister network Max, has become one of the breakthrough shows of this current TV season. Discovery, which could use a win, but makes the Drama awards landscape not super-ideal for other companies. The question becomes, would Television Academy members want to bookend their love for the show by nominating its final season? Or are they already more partial toward “Paradise,” the latest Hulu hit that already had its FYC event where its Emmy-winning stars Sterling K. Brown and Julianne Nicholson really charmed attendees in the massive room? Next, looking at the usual suspects, Netflix has “Squid Game” and “Bridgerton,” which have both been nominated in the category before, but is still figuring out which drama to put its full weight behind. For example, “The Diplomat” Season 2 went over even better with the crowd that votes on Emmys (the addition of seven-time winner Allison Janney certainly helps), but is still getting ready to premiere “Forever” and “Department Q,” from veteran showrunners Mara Brock Akil and Scott Frank, respectively, so it will be interesting to see how Netflix’s awards strategy evolves. If it got “3 Body Problem” nominated, which did not have as passionate a reaction as some of the other shows listed above, it is safe to count on Netflix to secure at least one nomination slot. Finally, the drama most permeating the culture right now is “Severance” on Apple TV+, which was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series its first season, and has only become exponentially more popular. It is the strongest of the remaining previous nominees back in the race that have not been mentioned so far, like “Andor” (Disney+), “Slow Horses” (Apple TV+), and “Yellowjackets” (Showtime), and could even win this time. As for more buzzy new shows, Peacock’s “The Day of the Jackal” popped up in quite a few winter awards races, but it is two shows under the Paramount umbrella, “Matlock” (CBS) and “Landman” (Paramount+), that seem to have a little more momentum going into Emmys season.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/wendy-williams-guardianship-fight.html'>Hollywood’s Latest Conservatorship Battle</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 20:12:32 <p>
Wendy Williams has amped up her demands to be free of a restrictive guardianship that she alleges controls every aspect of her life. She was placed in a guardianship three years ago but took her protests to the literal streets last week, pressing a handwritten note to the window of her Hudson Yards luxury high-rise assisted-living facility that read “Help! Mathew Rosengart, the attorney and former federal prosecutor who obtained the court-ordered suspension of Britney Spears’s father, leading to her freedom, said conservatorship and guardianships were “designed by state legislatures as last resorts, generally for people who are incapacitated.” “They should, in fact, be a last resort because, in essence, they strip individuals of fundamental rights and civil liberties, as appears to be the case with Ms. Williams,” Rosengart said. But she has in no way given up her fight for more freedom. “I am not permitted to do anything but stay on this floor, the memory-unit floor, where the people are 90 and 80 and 70,” Williams said to View co-host Sunny Hostin. You know what I’m saying, where people don’t remember anything? Willams told Hostin she appreciated her giving light to her situation, adding if “I was allowed to come out and put on nice clothes and see you in person, but I cannot.” Below, a breakdown of Wendy Williams’s guardianship and how she’s fighting against it. The popular talk-show host started to act erratically in 2021. Her bank, Wells Fargo, initiated a guardianship proceeding February 14, 2022, after it reported having several interactions with Williams concerning her financial accounts. was being exploited, subject to undue influence, or experiencing dementia,” according to court papers filed in NY Supreme Court by Wendy’s court-appointed guardian, Sabina Morrissey. Sabrina Morrissey, a New York estate and guardianship attorney, was appointed by the court as Williams’s guardian. aired, Williams’s “care team” sent out a press release announcing that Williams had been “officially diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). At one point in the documentary, Wendy proclaims, “I love vodka!” and says she was glad she was done with her talk show so she could “show my boobs,” pulling down her top and grabbing her nipples. Attorneys for A&E said in court papers that it showed a “raw, honest, unfiltered reality” of Williams’s life after she had been placed under guardianship. She also filed a lawsuit against A&E, alleging Williams did not have the capacity to consent to being part of the documentary and that they knowingly exploited Williams under false pretenses, filming her and profiting from an “unauthorized and repugnant program.” She also said in that interview that she doesn’t have her phone or an iPad to contact her family and friends and that her friends are not allowed to visit. “Where I am is this place where the people are older, you know what I’m saying,” she described the facility. I don’t eat out there with the people that live here just cause it’s so goddam depressing. There’s a bathroom, there’s a closet, and the TV, which is purchased by me through the guardian person.” Williams was released from the hospital on March 12, and two days later she called in to The View and told Hostin that she passed a mental evaluation “with flying colors” during her hospital stay. Hostin said it was just “a rudimentary type of evaluation.” “But I think the important takeaway from it is that she did pass that one with flying colors as she described,” Hostin said. “Now where we are at is the guardian agrees that she should have a more robust evaluation done by experts, a psychological evaluation, and the judge has agreed.” After Williams said in multiple press statements that she was capable of managing her own affairs, Morrissey in court papers requested the court appoint a qualified expert to conduct a supplemental medical evaluation of Williams to determine her capacity. “These matters can be extremely nuanced and complex, but generally speaking, there are several tacks a lawyer can assess and potentially take in this type of situation, ranging from filing an application with the court to remove a guardian, to seeking a less restrictive guardianship or seeking to terminate it,” Rosengart said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Twenty years after its theatrical release, Joe Wright’s luminous Jane Austen adaptation “Pride & Prejudice” continues to delight fans — we’re talking hand flex freaks, “a million times yes” devotees, and anyone who loves a romantic reunion in a dawn-lit field — and is preparing for a very well-received theatrical re-release next month. That’s good news for fans, but perhaps even better news for some of its many wonderful cast members, including three-time Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan, who made her film debut in the feature as the delightfully ditzy fourth Bennet daughter Catherine (better known as Kitty). “I mean, it was the dream job,” she said. “I felt lucky at the time, obviously, but I look back now and think, ‘You lucky fucker, that you managed to land that as your first gig.’ It’s extraordinary. I was literally a student watching these unbelievable actors around me with zero responsibility, except I had to occasionally giggle. Whatever Jena did, I would just do it.” Malone, of course, played youngest Bennet sister Lydia (a character somehow even more ditzy than Kitty, and one whose romantic hijinks almost pull the entire clan into ruin).

I mean, to be in a film with Judi Dench for my first ever job out of the gate is nuts.” And even Mulligan can’t deny the impact of the film’s iconic reunion scene, in which Knightley’s Lizzy Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen’s Mr. Darcy finally profess their love to each other in a miraculously lit British field.

Put more bluntly: as a remarkably sensible audience member said to me at the conclusion of our screening, “After all that?” Yes, after all that, Webb’s Rachel Zegler-starring film is good. And while that might not be good enough for some potential audience members, let’s be honest: There are just some people who were never going to loosen up to a “colorblind” fairy tale or one that dared ask, “Hey, what if a woman could like, do stuff, too?” If it hurts you to see an updated version of a story you loved — if your childhood is ruined because of the existence of this film or the new “Little Mermaid” or the new “Aladdin” or whichever new spin on literal fairy tales has so wounded you — that’s fine. But for those film fans willing to embrace the most obvious updates and upgrades to a story over 200 years old, “Snow White” will likely please. That’s not to say every choice made here (even some of the “controversial” ones!) plunked into a world that’s otherwise photorealistic and lit to high heaven. ), and I’d love for anyone to explain to me where the hell the tons of gems they mine every single day go, but fairy tales do require a suspension of disbelief, so we’re willing to back off on the demand for P&L statements. In this version, written by “Secretary” and “The Girl on the Train” screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, Snow White (Zegler) is the sole heir of the kind of kingdom that could really only exist in make-believe (they rely on their agricultural bounty to flourish, but they also all live on a rocky outcropping without a field in sight? Her parents are so awesome their character names are literally “Good King” (Hadley Fraser) and “Good Queen” (Lorena Andrea), and the ruling life, well, rules. Sometimes, they all eat giant pies together that Snow White bakes! There are woodland creatures, well, around, and they seem happy too! And when Evil Queen (no, she never has another name) arrives, portrayed by Gal Gadot having an absolute whale of a time chewing the scenery, we all know where this is going. Good King, who falls for the temptress, promptly follows her tip to fight a far-off battle, and never returns. Evil Queen and her best pal Magic Mirror (voiced by Patrick Page) are pleased as punch with the whole thing, and when Gadot is not imploring the reflective surface to tell her how hot she is, she’s making young Snow White’s life miserable. Eventually, it becomes fairly (hehe) clear (tehehehe) that Evil Queen’s read on what being “the fairest of all” is woefully skewed. While her take on “fair” has to do with beauty, young Snow White is blossoming into someone both beautiful and just. Just as Snow White is starting to think she needs to do something to save her now-extremely sad kingdom (Evil Queen turned all the farmers into soldiers, no one wears color anymore, also everyone sort of thinks Snow White is dead?) He’s stealing potatoes from the queen, but this Robin Hood-esque bandit isn’t all terrible. But Huntsman, like many other citizens we meet along the way, can’t quite bring himself to commit such an evil act. After all, he remembers what life was like before, and wasn’t that better? After he frees a terrified Snow White, she runs deeper into the forest, where she encounters still more peppy woodland creatures (as ever, her natural animal husbandry is used as a quick way to sell her pure-hearted spirit) and eventually a quite charming cottage that houses seven very strange small men. In between some classic songs (“Heigh-Ho” and “Whistle While You Work” remain charming), new jams from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul offer a little punch-up, from Snow White’s “I want” song “Waiting on a Wish” (fine, does its job) to Evil Queen’s hilariously evil anthem (“All Is Fair”), all the way up to the standout “Princess Problems,” which is clever and self-effacing in ways that these live-action remakes can tend to miss. If there’s a quibble to be had with the film — and a real quibble, not one about the film’s casting or some production photos taken entirely out of context or some bird-brained defense of the original story in which the prince carried Snow White’s dead body around with him wherever he went until the poisoned apple was dislodged from her throat and she suddenly woke up — it’s that it can often feel as if all its various parts and players exist in a slightly different film. This is a spirited and sweet spin on classic material that deserves kudos for its balance of necessary updates and affection for the old ways.

Based on Margaret Atwood’s novel of the same name, The Handmaid’s Tale takes place in a dystopian future where low fertility rates have led women to be assigned to men for bearing children. It was previously announced that Hulu and MGM were developing the sequel series but there hasn’t been any more news yet. Keep scrolling for everything we know so far about season 6 of The Handmaid’s Tale: The Handmaid’s Tale was renewed in 2022 shortly before season 5 premiered. The main cast mentioned above are expected to return alongside recurring actors Bradley Whitford, Sam Jaeger and Ever Carradine. Ahead of season 6, Josh Charles was cast as a series regular while Timothy Simons andD’Arcy Carden joined as a guest star but details about their characters was not immediately released. Alexis Bledel is not expected to return after she left ahead of season 5. The fifth season ended with June (Moss) and Serena Joy (Strahovski) both fleeing Toronto for Vancouver.

It isn’t clear what happens next — and the book that served as inspiration hasn’t been a big help with predicting the show’s ending. Atwood’s novel wrapped up with the protagonist Offred — whose real name was never revealed — being taken away in a van. Where Serena and June go from here is anyone’s guess. “June is going to figure out who she is and who she’s going to be for the rest of her life,” Moss told Elle in November 2022 about her character’s potential story lines for the final season. Moss teased that the final season centers on a fight that “is not just about one individual.” According to Moss, fans shouldn’t expect a happy ending, adding, “I don’t think we feel an obligation to tie up the entire story of Gilead.” Showrunner Bruce Miller has been with The Handmaid’s Tale since it debuted in 2017. Before season 6, Miller offered a glimpse at his vision for the show’s ending.

Carti’s response via social media was swift and blunt, telling West: “Ye STFU.” West later insisted: “I decided North won’t be doing any songs with Carti.

Cassie responded on her Instagram Story by sharing Playboi Carti’s tweet: “YE STFU.” Schwimmer specifically referenced West calling himself “a Nazi” and perpetuating the harmful stereotype that Jewish people “steal” money from their coworkers.

West’s tweets took a decidedly dark turn the following day as he wrote, “I have dominion over my wife.

Leaving Neverland, the 2019 documentary about Michael Jackson’s alleged child abuse, is returning with a sequel, but not to HBO. Dan Reed’s movie was a hit on the platform and won the Primetime Emmy for Best Documentary or Nonfiction Special. However, Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is out on YouTube in the United States. The original Leaving Neverland chronicled the allegations of childhood sexual abuse against Michael Jackson by Wade Robson and James Safechuck. Its sequel follows Robson and Safechuck as they attempt to get a trial after suing Jackson’s companies, which are controlled by his estates. Why isn’t it on HBO or Max? Dan Reed, the British director who made both films, says releasing the documentary on YouTube was not necessarily his choice. “I would have loved to release this with HBO,” Reed told Variety on March 13. But HBO don’t call me up and say, ‘Hey, this is what’s happening with that case.’ It all happens under wraps, so I don’t know.” However, he does seem excited about the prospect of a YouTube release in comparison to a streaming project. “It feels as though maybe the world of streaming is more cautious [about] tricky subjects, political subjects, subjects that put people’s teeth on edge and make them upset,” he said to Deadline in a March 13 story. “In order not to strike the wrong note with such a vast subscribership, you can’t really afford to do anything that isn’t absolutely safe.” Reed told Variety that he considers this film, the second installment, to be “a bridge film in between what was a pretty high-profile start and what I hope will be a very dramatic ending.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ketchup Entertainment is set to acquire the Warner Bros. IndieWire has reached out to reps at WBD and Ketchup for confirmation. As Deadline reported on Wednesday, Ketchup Entertainment is negotiating an all-rights acquisition in the $50 million range for “Coyote vs. Acme,” with respect to the film’s reported $70-million budget. The film has grossed a total of $4.8 million worldwide since opening March 14. WBD infamously scrapped the completed “Coyote vs. Acme” in 2023 before it was set to stream on Max. The conglomerate opted to take a $30 million tax write-off instead. WBD later announced that it had no plans to ever release the movie, putting the film up for sale to other interested studios. The film was not picked up elsewhere, despite reported screenings at Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. WBD’s decision followed the similarly shelved films “Batgirl” and animated feature “Scoob! “Coyote vs. Acme” is directed by David Green and written by Oscar-nominated “May December” scribe Samy Burch; James Gunn produced the film and also received a story credit.

Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani have been divorced nearly 10 years, but he still has fond memories of their time together. Rossdale, 59, reflected on his and Stefani’s shared home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles while sitting down with Jesse Tyler Ferguson for the Tuesday, March 18, episode of the “Dinner’s on Me” podcast. “Oh, [I had] unbelievable memories because that was such an exciting time,” Rossdale said of the shared house while learning Ferguson, 49, lived there after he and Stefani, 55, sold it. “I was there for a number of years when we just were together. The Bush singer continued to share rare insight into his time with Stefani before their 2015 split, praising her design aesthetic in their L.A. pad. “Gwen did a beautiful job on the nursery,” Rossdale recalled. The British rocker noted that when he and Stefani lived in that house it was “right at the height of everything really fun” in his career. “It was really a great time for us,” he continued.

Ferguson agreed that the house was “such a special place” for him and his husband, Justin Mikita, as well, since it was where they welcomed their first child. “I would still get your Restoration Hardware catalog,” he said with a laugh. They went on to welcome three sons, Kingston, 18, Zuma, 16, and Apollo, 11, during their marriage. (Rossdale also shares daughter Daisy, 36, with ex Pearl Lowe.) The pair announced their separation in August 2015 after 13 years of marriage. “While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment,” Rossdale and Stefani told Us Weekly in a joint statement at the time. “To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time.” The exes finalized their divorce in 2016, and Stefani moved to have the marriage annulled in 2020 after she got engaged to Blake Shelton.

Miami Beach mayor Steven Meiner has withdrawn his proposal to terminate the lease of the arthouse theater O Cinema for screening “No Other Land” following a city council meeting on Wednesday. Per reporting in the Miami Herald, a majority of council members opposed the plan. Meiner had publicly discouraged O Cinema from screening the Oscar-winning documentary about the Israel-Palestine Crisis, which he referred to in a March newsletter as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.” (Though many have noted that the film was made by a collective of filmmakers of both Israeli and Palestinian descent.) When the theater did not comply, legislation was introduced last week to remove the independent theater from its longtime home and withdraw roughly $40,000 in grant funding from the institution. The move was swiftly criticized by activists from both the political realm and the world of independent film, all concerned about the First Amendment implications of a government telling an independent exhibitor what kinds of films it is allowed to program. CAIR, CAIR-Florida, and the ACLU — among others — applied public pressure on Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner to drop his failed proposal to censor our cherished First Amendment right to freedom of speech, which protects artistic expression. He first attempted to censor the screening of ‘No Other Land‘ and later tried to terminate the lease and evict O Cinema. We welcome Mayor Meiner’s failure on both attempts,“ the chapter’s executive director, Imam Jaber, said. “Our organization remains steadfast in its commitment to safeguarding our community’s rights and will remain vigilant against the aggression and apparent pattern of discrimination that Mayor Meiner repeatedly exhibits in targeting Arab and Palestinian residents, business owners, and visitors.” Despite winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, “No Other Land” still does not have a formal distribution deal in North America.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“We are most certainly feeling it, and it’s been quite disheartening,” said filmmaker Tommy Oliver, CEO of Confluential Films and founder and chairman of Black Love, Inc.. He’s backed projects such as “Fancy Dance,” “Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project,” and “The First Purge” director Gerard McMurray’s upcoming horror film “Goons.” “There is a lot of uncertainty,” said independent producer Avril Speaks (“Jinn,” “Dotty & Soul”). “As a producer, I don’t know how we’re going to move our projects forward,” added Speaks. “I’m not feeling the reassurance and confidence from this industry right now that these stories will be OK in their hands.” “There were lots of companies reaching out and one-on-one conversations, but now, I have meetings on the unscripted side, and their eyes dart around,” she said. “It’s not even feigned interest; you can almost see the fears in their eyes.” “But those senior executives of color are no longer there. And when you don’t have those people in the rooms, it’s harder to convince people that these stories are important to the culture.” She oversaw and implemented several pipeline programs that aimed to uplift underrepresented creators, including WB’s Reframed: Next Gen Narratives shorts series. (In October 2023, Tinisha Agramonte was hired for the same role.) These entertainment companies are among the many — including Amazon Studios — that have shuttered, tweaked, or renamed their diversity divisions and let go of staff. “I’ve seen this pendulum switch back and forth several times over the years,” said Horne. “And I’m hopeful that it centers itself, because the bottom line is that this work is good for the business and bottom line.” “They are totally dismantling divisions within our business that people spent entire careers building,” said producer Deniese Davis, CEO of Reform Media and co-founder of Issa Rae’s production company, ColorCreative. Davis sees the entertainment business losing gains made over the last 20 years “when people were just starting to expand opportunities for underrepresented creators,” she said. “Coming off the back of the writers’ strike, there was already less work to be had, and then with DEI rolling back, there’s even less opportunities for them. “What I see DEI stand for is opportunities and allowing non-privileged people a way to get their foot into the door and to get your first staffing job. Razi Jafri speaks during the 1497 South Asian Lodge Solidarity Gathering For Collection Action Panel during the 2025 Sundance Film Festival Getty Images for 1497 South Asia “I see other donors and grantees extremely worried about what they can do in terms of identifying what these programs and grants are for,” he said. Davis points to an ongoing program that ColorCreative has been able to maintain called Find Your People, which helps creatives of color build sustainable careers through networking. “As many companies that had DEI offices, there still weren’t enough people of color who could greenlight projects.” But now, “It’s infuriating because everyone is cowering and giving in because of the financial moment and they’re afraid they’re going to lose everything.” Everything in this environment is now being evaluated through a politicized lens.” Carlos Gutierrez, founder and exec director of nonprofit Cinema Tropical, which presents Latin American cinema in the United States, said these problems are much the same “for Latinx filmmakers for a long time, because we have a whole system that is not welcoming to Latinx filmmakers in terms of validation and commercialization.” “And if the demand is there, and the supply has decreased, that’s an opportunity, so we need to figure out how to bridge that gap.” I do think we need to be optimistic,” he continues, “because optimism is a political tool.” Read IndieWire’s earlier story on what Trump dismantling Voice of America means for documentary filmmakers and other public media.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/kanye-west-new-album-bully-saint.html'>Kanye West Features His Son Saint in ‘Bully’ New Album Film</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 16:58:06 <p>
The rapper has released a short film, Bully, featuring his son Saint, days after putting his daughter North on a song with Sean “Diddy” Combs. West posted three versions of Bully to X on March 18 because “the first link started acting up,” he wrote. This comes after West posted and deleted a song with Diddy, who is currently in jail on sex-trafficking charges, that featured his daughter North West, on March 15. At the time, Kanye also posted screenshots of texts from his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, claiming he put the song out against her wishes. However, after she shouted out Playboi Carti on Instagram for referencing her brand Skims on his new album, Music, Carti commented, “TELL MY NIECE NORTH SEND ME A SONG.” This seemed to trigger Kanye, who dropped Bully in the middle of an X rant about Carti, with Kanye also claiming Carti snubbed him on Music. Kanye also attacked Jay-Z and his wife, Beyoncé, along with their children, over feeling abandoned by his once collaborator. Kanye has made antisemitic comments and used anti-gay and anti-disability slurs on X in the past 24 hours, on top of threatening Carti. Kanye previously teased Bully on Justin Laboy’s podcast, The Download, in February, saying it was inspired by Saint kicking a kid he was playing with. “And Saint responded with a simple, ‘’Cause he weak.’ And I was like, This man is really a bully right here.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-couch-co-op-local-multiplayer-video-games.html'>The 15 Best Couch Co-op Video Games</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 16:40:49 <p>
Before the onset of high-speed internet connections, couch co-op, in which multiple players share a screen, was one of the only ways to game together. But in recent years, this style of collaborative local play has taken the backseat to collaborative online experiences like MMO shooter Destiny and beast-slaying extravaganza Monster Hunter Wilds. Thankfully, studios like Hazelight, the makers of 2025’s highest-rated title on Metacritic, Split Fiction, are keeping the couch co-op experience from becoming a lost art. Here, we’ve rounded up 15 inventive titles worthy of your consideration. After all, why bicker with internet strangers about a botched boss fight when there could be a close friend or partner sitting next to you? No other studios are making couch co-op experiences of such popcorn panache. Playing as Zoe and Mio, you’re thrust into the whimsical fantasy and brooding sci-fi worlds that each of them dream up as fiction writers (hence the title). So begins a self-aware celebration and deconstruction of genre tropes that always has fun with its source material. It’s the most accomplished Hazelight effort yet: video game imagined as frenetic roller coaster for two. With screen-erupting euphoria, Vampire Survivors offers an unapologetically pure take on the video-game power fantasy. In 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a return to the franchise’s side-scrolling roots, up to four players can hop into a level, sharing lives and power-ups in one of the series’ most fiercely imaginative entries. Whether playing together or alone, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a daunting experience. Every action in this isometric role-playing game is decided by the rolling of a 20-sided dice, and there is a frankly dizzying array of menus and submenus to parse. Yet no other RPG gets this close to summoning the pure freeform magic of a pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons session. Alas, you’re not able to seduce one another, but that’s really the only black mark against this absurdly fun all-timer adventure. Beat ’em ups of the 1980s and ’90s, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, helped shape an idea of couch co-op that is still with us today: bruising arcade action, furious electronic soundtracks, sick-as-hell pixel art. In short, these are perfect games for kicking back with friends. The co-op mode, which can accommodate six players, is brilliantly chaotic because, with each additional character, Shredder’s Revenge throws more enemies at you. It’s a game fundamentally about buddies kicking butt best enjoyed by buddies with a pile of New York pizza at arm’s length. Summer camp; a handful of 20-something counselors; monsters intent on ripping this do-gooding bunch to shreds. Where most couch co-op titles typically involve a little light competition if not outright working together, The Quarry sees you and up to eight friends role-playing in a narrative drama. You only need one controller, passing it around as you take turns playing your assigned character or characters, such as sensitive bro Chris (voiced by David Arquette) and sarcastic slacker Max (Skyler Gisondo). Divorces are hard, especially if the two parents have been magically shrunk. This fantasy set-up is the catalyst for a journey of reconnection for mother and father, May and Cody, across a variety of brilliantly distinct levels. Really, this isn’t so much a game about divorce as it is one about finding new ways to keep you and your playmate riotously entertained. On this level, as a teeming toybox, It Takes Two, also developed by Hazelight, is an unqualified success. That’s because you, the players, are independently controlling each of their arms and hands, a brain-scrambling challenge in its own right. As such, physics puzzler Heavenly Bodies is often a game of flailing noodle limbs and intrepid spacemen drifting out into the inky abyss. But that’s fine: In this beautifully presented starlit comedy, failure is part of the fun. At regular intervals, a new van-load of crates bearing cryptic icons arrives, and it’s your job to pack them away. Regardless, you’ll likely slip into a pleasingly Zen state shuffling them about. Through such decisions, this charming little game has the power to make — and indeed break — relationships. Then perhaps try Overcooked 2 first to see how you might handle such famously intense working environments. The task is ostensibly simple: A team of chefs cut food, cook food, and serve up finished dishes to a zombie army known as the, ahem, Unbread. What if The Shawshank Redemption was directed by Guy Ritchie, and it’s also a video game? For every on-the-nose jailbreak cliche, there is a moment of disarming emotional connection between Leo and Vincent. But beware of permadeath, which means, should you succumb to hunger or any other perilous fate, that’s it — your game is truly over. There’s something about playing with a pal that softens this finality. The 2013 original saw you control two young boys named Naiee and Naia with each analogue stick. As you push, pull, heave, and ho your way through stunning Nordic landscapes, the game builds to a show-stopping climax that delivers mightily on its coming-of-age premise. It’s a rare example of mechanics and meaning being completely intertwined. Just be sure to have a box of tissues at hand. That’s because this open-world crime thriller is less about driving and shooting than interrogating suspects. The co-op joy comes in collaborating on these interviews, choosing when to push a subject or pull back; when to buy their story or accuse them of cooking it up. There’s endless fun to be had in reading each virtual eyebrow raise and curled lip, arguing with your co-op buddy about what it could possibly mean — motive, alibis, smoking gun!</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: The following review contains spoilers for “Daredevil: Born Again” through Season 1, Episode 4.] Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) have always had a lot in common, including a shared belief their beloved city needs to be cleaned up. In “Daredevil: Born Again” Episode 4, written by David Feige & Jesse Wigutow and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff, Matt faces the limits of his above board legal work when he infers that he’s up against police officers — some of the most dangerous individuals he’ll ever encounter, all protected and propped up by the system he has no choice but to trust. Matt doesn’t believe for a second that Hector (Kamar de los Reyes) was executed by Punisher AKA Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal), and moves right to the obvious answer: it was the cops, because Hector got in their way, and his freedom was both an inconvenience and an insult. As much as Fisk was and is the de facto antagonist of our lawyerly superhero, “Born Again” has also built a thrilling dynamic between Matt and Officer Powell (Hamish Allan-Headley), a man whose presence now sends Matt into high alert. Beneath their shiny official personas, these men could — and might — kill each other. Cox and Bernthal work brilliantly together on screen, in a scene buoyed by lighting, set design, and (of course) great writing (I haven’t fact-checked this, but it’s gotta be the first use of “pussy-ass” on Disney+). Frank confirms that “fucking fanboys” have appropriated his Punisher logo, and Matt surmises that a lot of them are cops doling out their own vigilante justice so someone else takes the blame. Everyone on this show is taking things into their own hands, and it’s only a matter of time before they clash disastrously. Not BB (Gennaya Walton) telling Daniel (Michael Gandolfini) they should hit up another spot, sleep on the train, then shower, and go to work like it’s fine on a school night??

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-ending-explained-finale-mystery-analysis.html'>Adolescence Doesn’t Have the Answer</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 16:25:52 <p>
Spoilers follow for all four episodes of Adolescence, now streaming on Netflix. Each of Adolescence’s four episodes, all directed by Phillip Barantini, are structured as one-shot takes, and so the first chapter unfolds as a meticulous accounting of what happens as the boy, Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), is processed at the police station: fingerprinted, medically evaluated, and assigned a lawyer. As the camera coolly observes the system at work, it lingers on Jamie’s vulnerability and terror; we’re reminded that this is still a boy who wet himself when the police broke down his door, who’s still young enough to be instructed by his father, Eddie (Graham), to eat his police-supplied cornflakes. His interrogation by officers Luke Bascombe (Ashley Walters) and Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) culminates in the revelation of security footage that captures him stabbing his classmate, a girl named Katie Leonard, multiple times with a kitchen knife. With this early reveal, Adolescence makes its intent clear. The series is less a procedural crime drama than a social portrait diving headfirst into the simmering cultural anxiety around boys and young men in the age of incels, male dislocation, and toxic podcasts. But within that chronological structure, Adolescence abstains from any strict sociological linearity: Though we’re given some broader context for Jamie’s actions — a mixture of cyberbullying, hormonal distress, and online influence — Thorne and Graham avoid sketching out too specific of a model for why something like this happens and what, if anything, we can do about it. Adolescence’s explicit interest in incel culture gives it a timely distinction. Fear and anxiety around the subject isn’t particularly new onscreen, but works that seriously grapple with the subject are relatively uncommon. Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling builds up to laughably wacky reveal that Harry Styles was an incel all along, and Todd Phillips’s Joker is often derided as a shallow incel-flavored Taxi Driver knockoff that transposes its anti-hero onto the superhero industrial complex. Adolescence, which voyages well beyond the superficiality of those two films, marks an interesting moment when pop culture appears more willing to directly grapple with the violent specter of red-pilled young men. Last year saw the release of Rejection, Tony Tulathimutte’s short-story collection that builds and expands upon his viral 2019 short story, “The Feminist,” which plays out as a (Vantablack funny) psychological depiction of a try-hard male feminist who drifts deep into incel radicalization. At this very moment, The Pitt is in the middle of paying off its own Chekhov’s Young Adult Male, as emergency-room doctors grapple with the choice of preemptively reporting a young man who made disturbing social-media posts and a list of women he wants to hurt, which runs the risk of ruining his life, or finding some other way to help — an ethical dilemma that comes to a head when a mass shooting is called in. The officers bumble around for answers, clueless and repeatedly dunked on by students until Bascombe’s son, Adam (Amari Bacchus), finally pulls him aside. The distance between generations is emphasized in this episode, with the school depicted as an unruly wilderness that Bascombe and Frank move through as if it’s a war zone. “What am I supposed to do?” Between the haplessness of the adults and the chaos barely contained by the institution, Thorne and Graham seem to lay down another thread of possible explanation: School conditions are so crowded and chaotic, to a point where Bascombe compares it to a “holding pen,” that you can’t help but see why a boy on the edge of actual violence might be overlooked. Bascombe’s arc ends with him making an effort to reconnect with his son, a suggestion that more engaged parenting may well be the solution we need. While Adolescence doesn’t break much ground with incel interiority, it does feel genuinely novel in its commitment to steering into adolescent male sexuality. One of the more striking beats in the first episode is a moment where Bascombe and Frank show Jamie printouts of his own Instagram posts featuring female models with innuendo-laced comments. “How do you feel about women, Jamie?” Bascombe asks. If you did, would you want her to look like these women?” The line of questioning is uneasy, not just because we’re watching a 13-year-old boy being confronted with expressions of his own underdeveloped and unfocused sexuality, but because those expressions are contextualized as evidence pointing toward his potential for violence against women. The framing is literally correct but nevertheless tenuous: For better or worse, you can imagine countless other boys his age doing similar things, and it’s hard not to wonder whether 13 is old enough to begin attributing misogyny as a trait. This thrum of uneasiness further escalates in the third episode, where Jamie is visited by Briony (Erin Doherty), a therapist assigned to evaluate his mental health prior to trial. This is Adolescence’s most interesting set piece, as it labors to show a Jamie deepened in his anger by his time in the detention system. The young Owen Cooper oscillates between projecting emotions we fear from men (rage, entitlement, aggression) and reminders that Jamie is still a 13-year-old who’s now stuck ever deeper in developmental confusion, all bundled up in an interaction where he displays some adolescent sexual desire for his adult interlocutor. It’s an utterly fascinating episode that’s make-or-break for the series as a whole, and though it doesn’t entirely stick the landing, it is gutsy enough to underscore Adolescence’s ambitions to gaze into dicey, sensitive territory. That a productive answer continues to be elusive underscores the series’ defining feeling, which is a mixture of the eternal parental fear over whether you’ll ever be able to do enough, and the generational fear over how modernity has unknowably but fundamentally altered the natural dangers of boyhood. The series’ final episode, its most overtly emotional, sticks with the Miller parents as they’re tortured with questions of what went wrong — and how they failed as parents.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tim physically cannot be away from Millie, and the confounding sickness seems to be rotting him inside out. The official synopsis reads: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other. “Together” debuted at Sundance, where the indie was acquired by NEON. The IndieWire review deemed the feature to be a “crowd-pleasing (and -screaming) little ditty of a midnight treat.” IndieWire’s Kate Erbland wrote, “Shanks’ often transparent scene-setting mostly serves as an additive to the fun of the film, from the first appearance to a tiny electric saw (might as well call it Chekhov’s Tiny Electric Saw) to those bold opening scenes that don’t hide what’s to come, but that tends to add to the joy of watching the film, those edgy expectations, that desire to guess what’s coming next (and the delight when you’re right).” Franco, who previously directed wife Brie in the horror movie “The Rental” and the 2023 romance “Somebody I Used to Know,” told IndieWire that “Together” was a first for them. “This was like the most full-on thing we’ve ever done together,” Franco said. “Together” is produced by Mike Cowap, Andrew Mittman, Erik Feig, Julia Hammer, Tim Headington, and Max Silva, with both Brie and Franco also producing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Not only is that true of Barry Levinson’s “The Alto Knights,” but this tired-as-hell mafia story — which wouldn’t merit so much as a footnote in the history of mob cinema if not for the gimmick of casting Robert De Niro as real-life crime boss Vito Genovese and his best frenemy Frank Costello — seems totally at peace with it. Frank Costello knows that his era in the underworld has come to a close, and he narrates the limp saga of his own life as if it were already irrelevant. As if he were deeply embarrassed by the disconnect between how much bloodshed he survived, and how little it all mattered in the end. As if there were nothing else to say about it at this point. “The Alto Knights” is steeped in Frank Costello’s mindset to a tedious extreme; it’s the last shot of “The Irishman” stretched out to 123 dramatically inert minutes of “haven’t we seen this 1,000 different times already?” Levinson knows we have, and he doesn’t seem all that excited about showing it to us all over again. Written by 92-year-old “Goodfellas” scribe Nicholas Pileggi, produced by 93-year-old “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” producer Irwin Winkler, and shot by 81-year-old “Manhunter” cinematographer Dante Spinotti (whose only other feature since the pandemic is Nick Vallelonga’s “upcoming” musical rom-com “That’s Amore!”), “The Alto Knights” is a gangland tale by and about a handful of legends whose grip on their work has slackened to the point that most of them can’t bear to let it go. Frank’s childhood best friend — the hot-headed and increasingly paranoid Vito Genovese, convinced that his rivals will keep gunning for him until they’re buried in the ground — insists upon that second option. If you’ve ever watched “The Godfather Part II” and thought “I bet this would be better as a glorified Powerpoint presentation,” I’m afraid you might have been wrong about that. Somehow, distilling Frank and Vito’s friendship into a series of still photographs and a few unnecessary snippets of black-and-white footage doesn’t create the kind of foundation this movie needs to invest our attention in the rivalry that catches up with its characters as old men (it doesn’t help that the “archival” clips inexplicably star a pair of young De Niro look-alikes, as if the image of young Vito Corleone hasn’t been seared into the collective unconscious for the last 50 years). What the history lesson does establish is the “this happened and then that happened and then this other thing happened” cadence of a film that never establishes the narrative rhythm it needs to anchor its story in any sort of present tense, and so “The Alto Knights” tends to exist as less of a crime drama than it does as a loose constellation of dimly recreated events (shot in Cincinnati to better resemble mid-century New York, this cheap-looking period epic tries to squeeze a full American epoch out of a few prop cars and some wonderfully expressive costumes). It almost seems like the cast was trying to satisfy the specific inputs of a video game tutorial; at one point, the critic sitting next to me leaned over to ask “why does this movie feel like it was improvised?” That fumbling quality creates a strange and uneasy tension with the specificity of watching someone act opposite themselves, and it does a disservice to the relative pleasures of De Niro’s two performances. The guy isn’t exactly breaking new ground here, and the conceit of his casting doesn’t really distract from the discomfort of seeing a mob movie icon prop up a project so derivative of the ones that made him immortal in the first place (imagine if Toshiro Mifune had been alive to star in “The Last Samurai”), but De Niro isn’t phoning this in, and it can be fun to see him play off two very different sides of his screen persona, even if there’s no real thematic weight behind the decision to cast him in both roles. Known as the “prime minister of the Underworld,” Frank is cautious, rational, and so buttoned-up that he wears a full suit and tie just to watch TV at home with his wife (an unsubtle Debra Messing), and De Niro embodies him with the sedate and semi-vacant curmudgeonliness that the actor tends to bring to his talk show interviews. It’s ostensibly fascinating that a man like Frank Costello — who profited so much from the proliferation of organized crime — would play such a large role in scaling it down, but Levinson’s film is too busy laying the past to rest to bring it back to life, and “The Alto Knights” is never flatter or more overfamiliar than when it’s doing the things that should feel like gimmies to a well-heeled gangster film. It’s almost as if Frank can’t fathom why anyone today should care about the incredible true story of how some enterprising immigrants without a nickel to their names formed a multi-billion-dollar racket that shaped a huge part of 20th century America.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/reputation-taylors-version-release-timeline.html'>Reputation (Taylor’s Version) Teases: An Endless Timeline</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 15:30:00 <p>
Taylor Swift might have sung, “I swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me,” on her 2017 album Reputation, but the fanfare leading up to its loooong-awaited rerelease seems to indicate otherwise. Ever since Swift’s sixth studio record became eligible for rerecording way back in November 2022 — the same long-ago month that saw Ron DeSantis topping polls and the end of The Walking Dead — fans have eagerly lapped up any clue that Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is ready for release. But if the date comes and passes without so much as a hiss? Well, take comfort in knowing it would be far from the first time we were all fooled by Swift’s Rep teases. And while some of the examples on the list below may seem like unintentional red herrings, remember Swift’s own warning to listeners on “Mastermind” off 2022’s Midnights: “What if I told you none of this was accidental?” a potential February release, duh), there were a good amount of clues that indicated Rep (TV) would soon be on its way. Toward the end of summer 2023, Swifties were surprised with not one but two clips of songs from Rep (TV) featured on TV shows: “Delicate” on The Summer I Turned Pretty and “Look What You Made Me Do” on Wilderness. What felt like celebratory gifts were probably more like consolation prizes as we still haven’t heard full versions of either track. Also in August, Swift’s close pal and frequent collaborator Ed Sheeran revealed he had not yet recorded the new version of “End Game,” which was disappointing only if you miss the sound of Sheeran rapping. October 2023: Shout-outs in Swift’s Eras Tour Movie Post “Getaway Car”) and “look what you genuinely made me do” (which, like her reputation, needs no further explanation). Perhaps the film would contain an announcement about Rep (TV)’s release date, we thought! December 2023: Time’s “Person of the Year” Has “tRuSt iSSues” ), supported by a few seeming teases in the year’s first month. In addition to Swift sporting some very Rep-like looks at the Golden Globes and on the street, she and some of her A-list friends changed their social-media profile pictures to black-and-white, which fans took to be a hint that the album was forthcoming. Well, an album was forthcoming, but it turned out to be The Tortured Poets Department, which also features a black-and-white photo of Swift on the cover. Viewers of The Dynasty: The New England Patriots on Apple TV+ got to hear “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor’s Version)” during one episode. Perhaps Swift was lured in by the “TV” similarities? June 2024: “This Is What You Came For” Hits Eras On June 14, the lucky attendees of Swift’s second Liverpool stop on the Eras Tour got to hear her perform “This Is What You Came For,” the 2016 Calvin Harris–Rihanna hit later revealed to be written by Harris’s own ex. Many theorized the rarely heard track was bound to be a Rep (TV) vault track, especially since Swift’s breakup with Harris occurred while the original album was being recorded. All summer, it seemed as if the album might finally be released on August 17 since the date marked seven years since Swift’s social media went dark in advance of the original Rep’s announcement. During a London tour stop, Swift played Rep’s “I Did Something Bad” (one of her self-proclaimed favorite songs) for the first time, giving fans hope, but ultimately nothing came of it. Oh boy, October was a ride when it came to Rep (TV) teases. Also, both Joe Jonas and Shawn Mendes delayed their planned October 18 album releases, moves many fans took to be made out of caution over Swift’s incoming album. November 2024: The End of an Era But Still No Rep (TV) It was a solid theory strengthened by the singer’s continued love of green outfits and an astute fan noticing Swift’s recent Instagram posts seemed to indicate a countdown. After so many false hopes, most Swifties had stopped looking so closely for Rep (TV) clues by the beginning of this year. In all likelihood, it was probably just a glitch — and not the cool Midnights version. From Swift presenting at the Grammys, to boyfriend Travis Kelce saying he “can neither confirm nor deny” the Rep (TV) release date, to news that the album’s trademarks would be valid only until August, February brought some solid teases but no actual news. March 2025: An (Imaginary) Lady Gaga Collab and That Necklace Alas, the rumors proved false, and fans were left with their hopes once again dashed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pete Davidson was seen heating things up with his new flame during a sun-soaked getaway in Palm Beach, exclusive DailyMail.com photos show. Hollywood's serial dater, 31, was recently reported to have a new lady in his life with whom he's said to be 'very happy', following his split with actress Madelyn Cline last year. Notorious for his high-profile romances with A-list stars, the comedian is now dating a 'non-celebrity' - now identified by DailyMail.com as model and actress Elsie Hewitt, 29 - and appears to be keeping the relationship more lowkey this time around. Adding to the beachside spectacle was the SNL alum's numerous tattoos, which were still very much visible on his back and torso despite him undergoing a painful and pricey removal process.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/review-snow-white-is-about-leftist-infighting-inexplicably.html'>I Don’t Know Why, But Snow White Is Totally About Lefty Infighting</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 15:00:00 <p>
I don’t actually know how to judge these live-action Disney remakes on any relative scale of quality. It’s garishly ugly and padded out with new tunes from Pasek and Paul that are as smooth and unremarkable as river rocks, all of which may or may not matter to its target audience, who could just be basing their decision about whether to see the movie on how unacceptably woke social media has informed them it is. Snow White’s father is gone, his fate uncertain, and she dithers about the castle in a demoted role, fretting about how her people are suffering outside. Snow White is an institutionalist, which I suppose is a given for a princess, pining for the idealized era of Obama’s/her father’s leadership, when her family would make apple pies so the working folks could have a small taste of luxury, and unable to conceive of a way to fight the Queen, who may be pretty flashy but who also came into power via the standard methods (marriage and magic). Snow White eschews violence and gets awfully sniffy about property for someone who’ll later let herself into the Seven Dwarfs’ home, scolding her future love interest, Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), when she discovers him stealing food from the royal kitchen. What’s left for a girl to do but attempt some coalition building among a ragtag crew that includes her septuple hosts, who I will not try to fit into this larger political allegory on account of their being abominations who can only be described as garden gnomes who’ve come to life while retaining their shellacked sheen. When Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, it was history-making — the first U.S. feature animation and a hit that proved that audiences wouldn’t just turn up for full-length animated films but embrace them. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would cement fairy tales as an inextricable part of the Disney brand, in rides and merchandise and Broadway musicals, to the point where 88 years later, Disney is still in this game, albeit in an eating-its-own-tail fashion where the media giant is no longer just iterating on a well-known story but on its own previous take. That, in chasing something vaguely progressive and YA-inspired with Snow White, Disney has turned out a film with some hilariously timely choices is a great joke, though I wouldn’t call it an intentional one. The most pragmatic aspect of Snow White is that with its plasticky set design and gift-shop-tacky costuming, it already looks like it takes place in a theme park — no adaptations necessary.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Editor’s Note: This review was originally published during the 2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival. Usually, when someone says a movie is “all vibes,” they mean it as an insult. But vibes can accomplish some wonderful things: Just ask Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Amy Seimetz, Panos Cosmatos, and now Flying Lotus. Born Steven D. Bingley-Ellison, the musician and record producer claims his place in the pantheon of vibes-based filmmakers with “Ash,” a pummeling psychedelic sci-fi freakout that one doesn’t watch so much as experience. Don’t let the green mist tinged with white lightning and rotating cosmic orifices fool you, however: Ingesting psychedelic drugs is not recommended before watching this film. This was true even when one of the characters explicitly explained what was going on, which happens quite a bit — this is writer Jonni Remmler’s first produced screenplay, and it shows. But there aren’t too many dialogue scenes, thankfully, as heroine Riya (Eiza González) spends a good deal of the movie alone, walking through the husk of a wrecked spaceship after waking up bruised and bloody, trying to figure out who she is and who all these dead bodies around her used to be. Then Aaron Paul shows up as a previously unseen member of the ship’s crew, and if you’ve ever seen an “Alien” movie you’ll know immediately that this guy should not be trusted. The “Alien” series is a prominent influence on “Ash,” showing up everywhere from a scene of working-class astronauts cracking jokes over dinner to the tank tops and tight white T-shirts that make up González’s wardrobe. Riya is a Ripley type, and although her head injury and subsequent amnesia keep her from being as clever as Sigourney Weaver’s iconic sci-fi heroine, she shows an equal amount of grit in a climactic sequence involving a flamethrower and the cosmic anemone Riya just excised from her brain. Combined with first-person action sequences that play like they were filmed through a VR headset, it’s all quite dizzying — one audience member at my screening spent much of the film with his head between his knees. No worries, though, because the circular flashback structure ensures that we get to see most of the coolest images twice, first out of context and again in slightly more coherent fashion later on. The emphasis there is on “slightly.” Core themes of space colonization and human survival instincts translate clearly. But keeping track of the characters can be difficult, given that we spend barely any time with them pre-alien attack and that many of them are wearing matching space suits in pivotal scenes. The type of moviegoer who leans over to ask their seat mate what’s happening will be lost almost immediately.

North Carolina’s First Four victory Tuesday night—after sneaking into the NCAA tournament as the last team selected—only partially makes up for what has been a rough basketball season for the ACC. The conference placed four schools in the men’s draw, its lowest total in over a decade. Three coaches stepped down, adding to the group of now-seven likely Hall of Fame coaches retired since 2021. And while teams battled it out on the basketball court, conference lawyers were in courts of their own, fighting lawsuits from Florida State and Clemson—the league’s two most valuable members—who were looking to leave for greener pastures. As college sports continues its rapid professionalization, the ACC is in a difficult spot. The ACC’s settlement with FSU and Clemson, announced earlier this month, may keep the league intact until 2036 when its current media contract expires, but the entire industry will be turned on its head before then. Sportico recently asked Jay Bilas, a former Duke star and one of ESPN’s most prominent college basketball experts, for his thoughts on how the ACC could reverse its recent trend. He suggested a few changes, all built around establishing a set of minimum standards that might lift the entire league. To receive them in your inbox each morning, sign up here via Club Sportico. Bilas added that ACC schools should not be allowed to schedule “substandard teams” for its non-conference games, since it harms everyone in the league for metrics used by the NCAA Tournament selection committee. He also said the league “should be able to consult on coaching hires,” which is common in some other conferences. “You’re a member of a league, the league should be able to mandate how you do things,” Bilas said, “Especially when there are significant repercussions on the rest of the league if you underperform.” A representative for the ACC didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on whether the conference has considered spending floors. The American Athletic Conference earlier this month became the first league to issue a mandate—its teams, minus Army and Navy, will have to spend $10 million in additional benefits for athletes in the next three years. From 2017-18 to 2022-23, ACC teams reported a 20% increase in spending—the smallest increase among the major conferences and below the rate of inflation. This ACC basketball season wasn’t all bad. Conferences are compensated directly for each team they place in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament (and starting this year, the women’s tournament too). North Carolina’s surprise selection was worth about $2 million, and that will increase for each successive game played by the Tar Heels, Duke, Louisville and Clemson (including UNC’s win Tuesday).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The first time we’re going to get to see Mikey Madison act post-Anora and post-Oscar win will be as SNL host on March 29. The actress still doesn’t have any projects lined up (although there Gerwig-ian rumors), so we await a chance to see her speak in character on bated breath. She’ll be joined by Morgan Wallen, whose first performance was canceled after he violated COVID protocols in 2020. He made his return a few months later, apologizing via sketch. Notably, he cannot be musical guest as Tenacious D, which the duo did in 2006, since that relationship has blown up and the band is currently “on a break”.

The latest entry into A24’s screenplay books collection examines the creation and impact of Celine Song‘s feature directorial debut “Past Lives.” The beloved feature was IndieWire’s favorite film of 2023 and earned Song a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the 2024 Oscars. “Past Lives” is a record of the film’s creation, split into five chapters. The 86-page book opens with an introduction by playwright Lynn Nottage. The first section features Celine Song’s original screenplay, presented in both English and Korean. Section Two presents film stills shot by cinematographer Shabier Kirchner. “Someone Who Knew Me When,” an essay by New York Times bestselling author Sloane Crosley, looks at that deceptively simple question: What might have been? The final chapter — available exclusively on IndieWire — features a wide-ranging conversation between Song and author Andrew H. Miller. You can read it in full below. A Conversation Between Celine Song and Andrew H. Miller “Past Lives” asks a deceptively simple question: What might have been? Of course, there’s no such thing as a simple interrogation into the other lives we might have led—which is what prompted Andrew H. Miller to write an entire book on the topic. Miller sat down with Celine Song to talk about all that might have been, and what could still be. Andrew H. Miller: “Past Lives” is a movie that’s full of regret and full of relief, some jealousy, some envy. But the dominant feeling for me is this heartbreaking beauty. Celine Song: Well, there’s nothing more heartbreaking in life than beauty. And so much of that beauty stems from the longing we feel by living the life we live. We’re always in pursuit of it on some level, even just those small, really beautiful moments. It doesn’t always have to be an aesthetic achievement or something tangible, it can just be a beautiful feeling. Or maybe you’re in a really dark and awful place, or a horrible room, or in a space where there’s a lot of violence and something terrifying is happening, but maybe the words you say to another person there can contain so much beauty. I really believe that beauty makes life worth living. For Hae Sung and Nora, they’re both still children in each other’s eyes. There’s beauty in being able to see someone that way. You get this very ordinary street in New York, but it’s also exquisitely beautiful at the same time. CS: It is very beautiful for Nora and Hae Sung, and it’s even beautiful for Arthur. Somebody else is walking along the same street, and it’s not going to mean anything to them, but the same corner is going to hold so much meaning and so much beauty for Nora and Hae Sung. That spot, in front of a garage, where they’re waiting for an Uber, is a spot that they’re going to think of and feel something about for the rest of their lives. At that very moment, even, they’re holding back tears. CS: Yes, I think they experience all those feelings as something beautiful. But different people talk about regret very differently. I usually find when sharing “Past Lives” with an audience member—and I mean an individual audience member—that the film very much works as a mirror to where that person is in their life and what they have gone through because, depending on where they are in their life, they can think of that one moment as one that’s filled with regret, or they can think of that moment as one that’s filled with a lot of peace. I’ve heard every reaction: I’ve heard everything from “I would’ve gotten in that Uber” to “Thank God she stayed.” Both of those reactions are true—you can feel different things depending on where you are. So, when you said to me earlier in this conversation that this film is filled with regret, I thought, “Well, what does this say about Andrew and where he is in his life?” AM: We’re all living one life. AM: Each of us dreams in our own language. Even at the deepest level of intimacy you’re still going to know a language that’s unique to you—the language of your life. In fact, no other human being can know what that is, and therefore there’s no other human being who can actually judge it for what it is either. AM: One of the wonderful things about cinema is that it needn’t make heavy weather of that. It’s a deep existential truth we’re talking about here, and you could describe it in language that is very heavy, but your film is saying: No, no. CS: I feel like there’s that little gap between Nora and Hae Sung that speaks to the way we connect to everyone. There is something that is in the distance between those two characters that, throughout the film, we all understand. That is the possibility—the alternate universe or living the life that these two people are living, because Nora and Hae Sung are not going to cross that space to go toward each other. In this life, they’re going to remain at arm’s length. CS: Only broken at times by a hug. AM: “Past Lives” has been put in a lineage with the films of Yasujirō Ozu and with Wong Kar-wai’s “In the Mood for Love” (2000). You’ve said that it’s been an honor to be put in that lineage, but that each of those movies defies comparison, as “Past Lives” defies comparison. There’s an absolute specificity to his characters. I was wondering if Mike Leigh matters to you— CS: He means so much to me because I feel like the heart of his work is so connected to what I believe fundamentally, which is that there is nothing bigger in scale than the human life that everybody in the audience can connect to, captured on screen as it is. We can talk about the scale of a film and how cinema is about living in different worlds than the ones we live in currently, and I get very excited about those things, too. But Mike Leigh is so interested in capturing the totally extraordinary feelings that can happen in an entirely mundane experience. After watching a Mike Leigh film, I feel like my life is so much more significant and filled with more beauty, complexity, darkness, and perfection than I thought. So much of what I find purposeful about cinema or making art is going to always come down to love. It’s a cliché, but they say love is the greatest thing in life. Well, a part of that is being able to talk about love, and I don’t just mean romantic love, I mean love that we just experience in life. Even if it’s from a friend, from a parent, from someone you work with, whatever it may be, whatever the feeling of being seen and understood, I think that alone is worth depicting because in life it is unfortunately more rare than it should be. So if a film can convey that or suggest that— I always feel so seen by his films even though of course I don’t maybe share the same background or… It’s not about representation. It’s not about being seen in a literal way. It’s about being seen in your soul. AM: There is that extraordinary moment at the beginning of “Past Lives” where we have our proxy voices as viewers there—the couple who’s watching this film that’s starting, and they’re saying, “Who are these people? Who are they to each other?” Then Greta [Lee] looks right at us, and we think: Oh my God, I’m being seen. Well, you’re being asked to see her, because that’s what the truth is. When she has to break the fourth wall and look at the camera, she has to be both totally open and totally mysterious. What she’s telling us is: I’m going to let you—and I mean the audience whose proxy is these voices—I’m going to let you actually live through my life, through this movie… and then at the end of it, you’re going to see me. That’s a very different thing than if she were to just describe herself more literally as, say, Korean American. She can say a lot of words to describe who she is, but, in fact, what she’s saying is, “No, actually, I’m going to let you into a part of my life, not all of it, but part of my life, and at the end of it you’re going to see me. And the next time you are back in this scene, the next time you’re back in this moment, in this film, you’re not just going to look at me, you’re going to see me, and you’re going to love me, and you’re going to love these two people you don’t know.” What I mean by love… it’s not about likeability, it’s about understanding— AM: That’s remarkable that you say that because she is so… authoritative isn’t the right word, but she controls so much in the movie from the beginning. Well, it’s a story about her life—insofar as she can control her own life, the way that we are authors of our own life. I certainly don’t think that’s possible for everyone all the time, which is where all kinds of dehumanization is happening in the world. But in Nora’s situation, she’s living a very happy life, and therefore she has a great deal of authority in her life. But there is a funny wrinkle in her otherwise relentless control and power over her own life, which is Hae Sung coming to visit. AM: She says, “Why did you do that?” AM: Movies and novels and poems that are about lives we could have lived but didn’t tend to fall in patterns. “Oh, if I had married this person instead of that person.” Career. “If only we stayed in Seoul…” In “Past Lives,” the marriage is under question in a way, or she’s thinking about alternative possibilities, or the movie’s thinking about presenting alternative possibilities, or at least Hae Sung is presenting alternative possibilities. She even says, “You think I’m going to throw away my life? CS: I’m not sure how disparate these things are. What I mean is that they’re so connected. She lives in New York because of her career and her career is so connected to who she is. She’s married to this person she is in love with because her life in New York makes it possible to marry him. I don’t know if you can separate one thing from the other. He has a particular job, a particular life, language, country… I would not recommend that these two people get together. To me, that’s the crux of it. But that’s not really the point of their connection, because love does not necessarily need to have a practical end or a happy ending that is legible or tangible. There is a song that I was thinking about so much, the Leonard Cohen song he made with Phil Spector called “True Love Leaves No Traces.” I think about that song as the heart of this particular film because it’s about the way that Hae Sung and Nora’s connection has nothing tangible in it. CS: Yes, and because they have been waiting in that corner for 24 years, all they need is to get this proper goodbye—and once that happens the film can end. I think there’s a danger in what we do as modern people, which is to evaluate different connections and then assign importance: “They’re just a friend,” or, “They’re just a childhood friend, and you’re my boyfriend,” or, “You were just a boyfriend—now you’re my husband.” We tend to assign different meanings and values to certain relationships, which then flattens the connections we might have. You can’t ask Arthur, for example, to have the connection that Nora has with Hae Sung, and you can’t ask Hae Sung to have the kind of connection that Nora and Arthur have. Every single one of their conversations is going to be different, and it’s heartbreaking that Nora won’t get to have the millions and millions of conversations that she could have with Hae Sung in this particular life. But in their place, she’s able to have those kinds of conversations with Arthur, which would be different than with Hae Sung–not better or worse, but different because he is a different person and their love is unique to the two of them. Her life is what it is.” And by the way, the movie could have posed a different question: “Is there something missing in her life that she’s trying to solve by running away with somebody else?” But that’s not the point of the film. It doesn’t mean that the feeling she gets when she sees somebody who reminds her of herself as a little girl, who she probably didn’t really think was important, who she never got to say a proper goodbye to, and somebody who is still in love with that little girl… that’s such a powerful feeling. But the truth is it’s as simple as the feeling she gets when the two of them are looking at each other, which is: Oh, I remember you when you were a kid, and we were so in love as children. AM: That’s such a powerful insight about love. AM: To think about other possibilities is human. Even in the grocery line, you think, “I’d have been out of here five minutes ago if I had gotten in the other line.” It’s part of the human imagination. There’s nothing you can do about it, but it’s a very powerful thing, too, because it allows us to empathize with the person who got in the right grocery line. If you take that further, maybe somebody has gone through a certain experience that I don’t know anything about but that I can connect to through cinema. Part of why “Past Lives” has resonated with people from so many different countries is the universality of its core concept. An Italian interviewer or fan of the film will want to talk to me about In-Yun, but will say the word with an Italian accent. This film connected with people who have not exactly lived the way that Nora has or even made choices that she has, and that is a very special thing I feel so lucky to have experienced on my first film. On the set of ‘Past Lives’ Courtesy Everett Collection AM: Critics, when they’re talking about works of art, seem to say that a perfect work of art is a work of art in which nothing can be changed. On the one hand, life is just full of chaos and chance, and who knows what’s going on. But at the aesthetic level, the ideal of a work of art is one in which nothing could be changed, or it would not be as good. I know that it’s going to be completely changeable and mean completely different things to the people who see it. CS: No, I can’t control it because a part of it is like, well, when I lock everything, when I lock the film, and the film is considered finished, it has effectively become an object. It has effectively become a thing that you could watch on your phone. So it has fully become something that is, in a way, a dead thing because I am no longer able to touch it, because it’s now become a film that exists in the world. Whatever this object is, it’s going to remain the object a hundred years from now, and I hope that a hundred years from now people are able to watch the movie and still feel something for it. In that way, it is to me no longer a living, breathing thing. But I also know that in the audience, it comes back to life. In front of the audience, it does become a living, breathing thing again, and it becomes a part of their life in this way I, as the filmmaker, can only dream of. So to me, it is a changeable and contradictory thing. AM: It’s like what we were saying about characters who, on the one hand, are just one thing. Nora is this person and no one else, but, on the other hand, she could have been all these other people. She could have stayed in Seoul or could have gone to New York in her different lives. “What if she stayed in Seoul?” Which, of course, Hae Sung talks about. Every choice within this movie is one of an infinite number of choices that could have been made as well. But I believe that’s the part of artmaking where you’re trying to capture the thing that is completely alive and turn it into an object that can be approached by everyone. And, as a result, it has to be something that is open to change and to alternate universes and all the things that Nora could have done instead. All of those things have to be in the film, but, again, it’s a contradiction because it has to also be the only thing that Nora could do in the film. That’s all you’re trying to achieve. For example, you can always make Arthur a horrible person, and then the audience will have to contend with the fact that her life in New York or her marriage doesn’t seem very good. But, in fact, the thing that I’m trying to do is to make sure that Nora does not get in the Uber. You want it to feel completely inevitable because that’s what life feels like. AM: I want to ask you about Virginia Woolf. I’m not scared of your English department. One of the things I loved about your movie, as I’ve been saying, is its formal refinement, the extraordinary care with which you manage space and time and intensify the viewers’ experiences of space and time through all sorts of formal, technical choices. But then there is the harmony, a series of chord progressions on top of which your language then plays this melody. I don’t want to end without acknowledging the language. The more particular question is to ask about the translation of the very last line in the movie, when Hae Sung says, in translation, “See you then.” I take it to mean, or possibly mean, “I’ll see you in that future life.” Is that there in the original Korean, too? I would say it’s more specific than even, “See you then.” The more direct translation is, “Geuttae boja / 그때 보자.” It means, “See you at that time.” In that way, it is completely and unambiguously about that. We wanted to play that song there as a way of— CS: Revealing what is happening in the next life. They probably don’t know that they’re meeting each other again in this life after they promised to see each other then in that New York City corner in their last life. I don’t know how to describe it, but you and I, we are connected for some reason.” That’s why we chose that piece of music for a post-credit song. When her parents decide to move, one of the first things she does is choose her new name. She names herself, and she practices this new language with her sister on the plane, learns this language and enters fully into it. Was having these two languages a resource for you? If you’re thinking, “I want to write a movie about two lovers, about a past lover coming back and a present lover,” that could be done without the bilingual element. So that is to say, how did you think about using the language difference or the two languages to intensify the experience of unled lives or past lives? CS: I think it suggests, again, that this movie is some kind of a love triangle, but the truth is this movie is not at all about a love triangle. If it is a love triangle, it’s between Nora and one of her lives and another one. To me, it’s really less about language as an element. It’s so much more about somebody from that space coming to remind her of its existence, and the way that space still longs for her. I don’t even think of it as a language barrier as opposed to this language that’s coming to visit, and that’s what really poses this existential question of who Nora is, what kind of a life she lives, and what the choices are that led to her life. It’s about how this language that she forgot, this language that she doesn’t use, this language that only really exists in a certain part of her life, in her memory of the past, has come to invade her present and ask questions about her future. And these two men who each hold a key to parts of her life, and they do not have each other’s keys—they only have one key that unlocks one part of her. He’s showing up to say, “There is this little basement in your soul I don’t think you’ve thought about or accessed, but I’m still in that basement, I’m still in love with that little girl, I still miss you.” In their encounter, he’s unlocking a part of her that I don’t think she fully recognized as an important part of her until he came along. It is about her, and it is about these two men who love her differently, different parts of her, but are trying to reconcile how the woman and the girl that these two men know are somehow the same person. To love one is to love the other, and in that way, the men are then being asked to care for each other as well because the men are a part of this one woman who they both love very differently.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/good-american-family-true-story-natalia-grace.html'>The Ugly Truth(s) Behind Good American Family</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 13:00:51 <p>
But this time, the narrator is … unreliable? Good American Family is Pompeo’s first big proj away from Grey’s Anatomy and even necessitated her scaling back involvement in the titular role of the medical drama. Another limited series based on a true-crime story? The trailer claims it’s “inspired by multiple stories, perspectives, threats, interpretations,” and “accusations.” But what are those stories, and what is the truth? Good American Family stars Pompeo as Kristine Barnett. She and her husband, Michael (Mark Duplass), adopt Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism. But Kristine starts to suspect something is off with Natalia, even suspecting she may be older than her adoption papers claim. “I want people just to think about how they look at things and what kind of judgments they make based on the way people look,” Pompeo told Variety. That’s certainly how the media portrayed it. Here’s what happened IRL: The Barnetts adopted Ukrainian Natalia Grace in 2010. They then put Natalia in an apartment by herself and moved from Indiana to Canada. Natalia Grace was taken in by Cynthia Mans (played by Christina Hendricks) after she noticed Natalia had trouble caring for herself. The Barnetts maintained that Natalia was simply of Orphan age and exhibiting Orphan-style sociopathy. However, as part of Investigation Discovery’s The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, Natalia took a DNA methylation test, which determines age by how much one’s DNA has changed over time. So we finally know the truth about Natalia Grace’s age? “This one little piece of paper throws every single lie that the Barnetts said right into the trash with a match,” Natalia said in 2023. “This is so big because, literally, this has been 13 years of just two people lying their butts off. Alongside the evidence of Natalia’s real age, the second season shares her allegations of abuse by Kristine Barnett, including getting pepper-sprayed twice. There is also evidence that Natalia had been a victim of human trafficking in Ukraine. With the help of the first family that tried to adopt her, Natalia escaped and was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, according to People.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

ST. CHARLES, MO—Covering her ears as her father screamed at her mother about the overuse of suggestive POV camera shots, local child Hadley Lohman sat frightened atop the stairs last night watching her parents argue about the ending of The Sopranos, sources confirmed Wednesday. According to reports, Lohman crawled out of bed to the steps overlooking the living room, having heard her mother slam a door after her father suggested that the famous cut to black in the final episode of the HBO series was “a total fucking cop out,” and that it had clearly been resorted to because showrunner David Chase didn’t know how to end the story. The 8-year-old child then reportedly closed her eyes and wished that all the yelling about what “Don’t Stop Believing” meant would cease, especially her mother’s cries that the last scene was actually an artful use of suspense and that knowing Tony’s fate wouldn’t make it more satisfying. At press time, sources reported that Lohman had retreated back into her room and covered her head with a pillow to avoid hearing any more Sopranos spoilers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WASHINGTON—In a decisive victory for longtime champions of the cause, congressional leaders announced Wednesday the passage of a new federal law mandating that all women talk with a baby voice. “Under the terms of this legislation, every American female over the age of 18 is now required to speak with short, simple words in a high vocal register,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, underlining the Republican mission of paring down the vocabularies of every adult woman in the United States to a maximum of five words, including “night night,” “wuv,” and “tummy.” “This goes for all women, including my Senate colleagues: You must immediately tie your hair into pigtails and replace your standard laugh with a coquettish giggle. Any woman not wearing a schoolgirl uniform will be considered to have acted in direct violation of this law, as will any woman who refers to a man by any term other than ‘daddy.’” Thune went on to express his support for a similar law that would require all the nation’s men to lower their voices by at least two octaves and communicate solely through grunts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/the-last-of-us-asl-edition-max-daniel-durant-interview-1235101572/'>‘The Last of Us’ Gets ASL Edition on Max from ‘CODA’ Star Daniel Durant Ahead of Season 2</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 13:00:00 <p>
The ASL version of Season 2 will air day-and-date when it becomes available for everyone else, and Durant and director Leila Hanaumi will be the performers for Season 2. Daniel Durant on set filming for ‘The Last of Us’ ASL HBO “We always rely on captions, but they’re always in English grammar structure, and having the concept of adding a Deaf interpreter there just makes it a clearer message,” Durant told IndieWire via an interpreter. When viewers see Durant on screen, he will be superimposed in the corner of the frame itself, not isolated in a picture-in-picture box, and wearing a neutral black t-shirt throughout as to minimize any distraction from the show itself. Durant crosses his hands into a resting position when he’s not signing in order to maintain continuity between takes, and the crew even had multiple identical black shirts on hand to keep everything consistent. These presentation techniques have been refined over the last year, thanks to Max recently offering an ASL version of “Barbie,” in which Deaf actress Leila Hanaumi performed the entirety of Greta Gerwig’s film. She helped define what an ASL version of a show would look like on Max, but she’s impressed at how Durant took things to the next level. “The translation from one line to another is already a huge hurdle on your brain, but [he’s] also copying their body language and catching the mirroring of each character,” Hanaumi said. Leila Hanaumi (left) with Margot Robbie at the Regency Westwood Village Theater on Thursday, December 14 following a screening of ‘Barbie’ with ASL Courtesy of Warner Bros. In Season 1, Episode 7, “Left Behind,” in which Ellie (Bella Ramsey) ventures to an abandoned mall with her friend Riley (Storm Reid), Durant interprets a poignant scene in which Ellie, for the first time, sees the lights of the mall completely illuminated before her eyes. Durant is able to communicate it all, from making bursting gestures to capture the sounds of the generators around her, swaying his hand to the tempo of the music, finding different signs for “electric stairs” versus the appropriate “escalator,” and even angling his body from side to side in order to “role shift” his performance and convey both characters’ dialogue at once. It’s a more meticulous shooting process than you might imagine. Hanaumi, with the help of hearing interpreter Ashley Change, works through each minor detail, whether it’s background noise pertinent to the plot, inflections in a character’s voice, or simply the best sign to convey a particular word. At one point, Hanaumi coaches Durant to make the sign for “escalator” be his hand moving downwards in one direction rather than going up and down in a way that would’ve been too similar for the sign for “stairs.” In another, she encourages him to mimic the gesture Riley makes on screen when she tells Ellie “chop chop.” And after a take, Hanaumi gives Durant a note that he “didn’t look as confident as he could’ve been” with his role shifting. Durant can, at times, string together 8-10 minute long takes, acting out everything in a particular scene, so precision is key. They’ve even had to create signs, though they do so sparingly; anything more than that would defeat the purpose of making it easier for a Deaf audience to understand. All this helps even Durant better understand the show. Deaf actor Keivonn Woodard in ‘The Last of Us’ Season 1 “It’s just amazing this kind of access is capable now, because it aligns with deaf people in different work environments and fields. We have more Deaf scientists now, and they are coming up with new ASL signs for scientific terms,” Hanaumi said. “We were able to use those signs that they as Deaf people, scientific Deaf people, have developed, so it was very cool to have this process and the progress of more ASL accessibility. Fans will also know that the first season of “The Last of Us” features a Deaf child star, Keivonn Woodard, and his character’s interactions with Ellie. “The moment was profound, because the moment before Sam becomes infected, he asks Ellie, ‘Is it still you if you become a monster? “For the longest time, Deaf characters have just kind of showed up in TV shows, maybe once or twice, maybe a few episodes, and then that’s it, they’re done. But we want to see a Deaf lead, we want to see more Deaf leads, for an entire seasons and more,” Durant said. “The movie ‘CODA,’ that came out, and for a few years we did see more opportunities for Deaf people, but then we had the SAG strike, and it became really quiet. In the meantime, Durant said this type of work is a big departure from what he’s done in film and TV and on stage with Deaf West Theater, and he’s proud knowing he’s capable of doing something like this as a performer. It’s a gift to my own community,” she said. I was very fortunate to be born to Deaf parents who gave me sign language since birth, and I have made a foundation with that sign language.

What if we didn’t talk about anyone’s genitals? Jason Isaacs is walking back some comments made about onscreen nudity during press for The White Lotus. There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven’t.” During an interview with CBS Mornings on March 14, Gayle King asked Isaacs about a scene with his White Lotus character’s exposed penis in episode four. It’s all over the internet,” Isaacs said, regarding whether or not he wore a prosthetic. And I don’t see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on [the screen] all the time.” He added, “It’s interesting that there’s a double standard for men.” Isaacs says he was attempting to deflect from the personal question. “I had been asked so many times in the same day by journalists, ‘Are you wearing a prosthetic?’ Which means, ‘Have I seen your actual penis? It’s very important for me to know if I’ve seen your penis,’” Isaacs told Variety. “It just strikes me as a bit weird and slightly obsessive. In Season 3 of #TheWhiteLotus, Jason Isaacs portrays the patriarch of a wealthy Southern family on vacation with his wife and children — as his business life back home seems to be falling apart.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/john-mulaney-everybodys-live-writers-room.html'>John Mulaney’s Playhouse</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 10:00:46 <p>
“Whether something’s good or people like it is so ephemeral. This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Within minutes, they start throwing out hypotheticals and personal experiences. “If you lend a relative money to build a greenhouse, and they end up building an addition to their home with it, is that okay?” Mulaney asks the group. “I don’t mean to sow division, but she fucked you,” writer Langston Kerman says. “Because she knew it wasn’t a greenhouse from the beginning,” Kerman says. It provides endless space for Mulaney’s sharp comedic instincts, and it gives him a platform to work out the contours of his shifting onstage persona after marrying actor Olivia Munn and becoming a father. All of it is visible in the show’s premiere episode. Everybody’s Live features live calls from viewers, and more than once, the calls — some about drug addiction or housing instability — get quite sad, trapping Mulaney in an uncomfortable spot between empathy and playful detachment. But the show’s potential for improbable magic is all there, too. There’s a perfectly stupid Body Double telescope parody, where Mulaney witnesses several murders from afar and decides to shrug them off so he doesn’t have to deal with any hassle. Best of all, the episode’s unexpected combination of guest panelists and musical performers produces a transcendent moment where Joan Baez and Richard Kind start dancing ecstatically to Cypress Hill’s “Hits From the Bong.” “I can protect myself by acting like we just think it’s weird, and that way you can’t criticize it in the same way,” Mulaney says of his show’s purposeful unevenness. He will happily crack jokes about it being slapdash and unproduced: “We’ve been working on this episode all day,” he says in the premiere. “Some crew got here as early as 9:00 a.m.” But in truth, he believes this show, with its awkward phone calls and guests who have no reason at all to be there, is better entertainment. “Whether something’s good or people like it is so ephemeral. From left to right: Dave Ferguson, Rajat Suresh, Vanessa Ramos, Langston Kerman, John Mulaney, Fran Gillespie, Alex Scordelis, Jeremy Levick, writers’ assistant Kyle Martirez-McIntosh, and Anna Drezen. The planning boards are distracting, and it’s hard not to keep looking at them and trying to guess what all the cards might mean, although a few (“Richard Hair Transplant”) seem mostly self-explanatory. “Every writer here has basically run their own show,” Mulaney says. Vanessa Ramos created the show Blockbuster for Netflix; Alex Scordelis comes from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and has a journalism background that Mulaney appreciated; stand-up Langston Kerman co-created the Peacock series Bust Down; Rajat Suresh and Jeremy Levick made names for themselves as writers and producers of off-kilter digital videos. When I ask Mulaney about hiring Dave Ferguson as head writer, he notes that he and Ferguson worked together when Mulaney cohosted the Spirit Awards and that Ferguson is especially good with “the administrative aspects of running a writers’ room.” “Making Google Docs seems to fuel him,” Mulaney says. Some of the planning-board cards are bits Mulaney or other staffers have developed for the writers to appear in themselves, like Levick and Suresh, who have established onscreen personas. Some are cards Mulaney knows only a little about; at least one of them is a sketch Kerman is developing for late in the season that they’ve both decided Mulaney will not see a script for until the day it’s performed. Kerman is also responsible for the live-written lower-third gags that play during each episode, which Mulaney never sees until after the show’s finished. Did he know that in the Everybody’s Live premiere, Kerman would identify him as “John Mulaney, Host (White),” I wonder. Although Mulaney is now able to rattle off a list of Everybody’s Live’s influences and models (The Dick Cavett Show, Larry King Live, a late-’70s public-access series called TV Party), none of it was obvious at the start. Netflix originally hired Mulaney to do a streaming tie-in for its Netflix Is a Joke Festival in 2024 with little requirement for it beyond Something-Something Live Mulaney. That six-episode nightly show became Everybody’s in L.A., and all but one of the writers on Everybody’s Live were hired from that earlier trial version. Mulaney decided to develop something more like a late-night talk show with pre-produced comedy sketches, musical performances, and an organizing topic of the day related to the show’s Los Angeles focus like palm trees, coyotes, and earthquakes. “There’s no greater insight into Richard as a performer that I have, versus anyone else who watches him. It’s just so funny, and I’m never unhappy to see him.” And his impulse was to build a show that felt purposely aimless. Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, and Mulaney on the Everybody’s Live premiere. Everybody’s in L.A. was a success — as much as any show that sometimes ran over its allotted time, hung up on callers, featured a buggy delivery robot, and insisted that “Helicopter Night” also be “Sunglasses Night” could possibly succeed. Netflix agreed to let Mulaney do more of it, ordering two 12-episode seasons. They’d still be live, but they’d now be made on a weekly instead of nightly schedule; Netflix requested the word Live in the title, and it would shift away from its heavy Los Angeles focus so it could tackle a broader range of subjects. Good topics for an Everybody’s Live episode, Mulaney says, are “something that would lead to a lot of questions, stories, and conversations on Facebook groups or Quora.” When the writers first arrived at the Sunset Gower offices in January, Mulaney already had a theme in mind. “I think it’s weird,” he says of the Real ID. “Why are we all going in and getting a new photo taken by the federal government? How dare you?” This is as much of a take on the topic as he likes to have, he says: “What the hell’s going on? While some elements of the show come straight out of Mulaney’s particular obsessions and hang-ups, the writing staff is happy to make their feelings clear when he pitches an idea they don’t think will work. “He had come in so hot with this idea, and I think he was looking around the room, but no one was doing that thing where they’re nodding.” “It was a full, ‘I don’t know what that looks like, but follow your heart, I guess?’” says Ramos. As of the week before the premiere, no Korean historical drama bits had made it on to the planning board, but there is a card reading “Bring Out a Crow” and a different idea Ferguson had pitched based on NBA tunnel walks. He’s mulling a stage version of his 2019 Documentary Now! episode “Original Cast Album: Co-Op.” He’s touring again in August. His life has shifted its center of gravity over the past several years. When I reach him by Zoom after the premiere, his video pops up on screen with the identification “Olivia Munn.” There’s a running gag on Everybody’s Live where Mulaney asks callers what kind of car they drive. When I ask Mulaney about his own car, he says he sometimes drives a Mini Cooper because Munn has been teaching him to drive a stick. Consciously or not, it’s also a reflection of a Mulaney who’s still attached to an earlier iteration of his comedic persona, even as he’s actively building another one more suited to who he is now. Without the L.A. focus, Everybody’s Live has more emphasis on Mulaney himself. A minute later, he transitions into material about his family, including Munn’s cancer diagnosis, their IVF experience, and a joke that culminates in Mulaney, as Munn, miming cunnilingus. They are jokes about two different Mulaneys — one of them with a more mature look and a more complicated relationship with his audience — and they chime against one another like discordant notes. Neither version is fully integrated with who he plays as a host, either: the Mulaney with the trick of being charmingly annoyed that he has to keep checking off the chores of performing this show, even as he wanders around a world built to his specifications in the manner of Pee-wee Herman in his playhouse. He knew that even though the premiere was running long, he had to make sure there was time for the episode’s highlight, a pre-taped sketch of a panel of 11 actors who have played Death of a Salesman’s Willy Loman, written and produced by Scordelis. The sketch is an expression of all the things Everybody’s Live does best: sincere love and admiration for cultural iconography, forced through a sieve of surreal frivolity. “I was just determined to make sure that aired,” Mulaney says. “‘This is not the show we sold,’” Mulaney describes an unnamed executive saying. And then they go, ‘We don’t even understand what this rundown means!’ I’m like, Yeah, you think you’ll feel better when I explain ‘telescope murder’?

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-spy-movies-ranked.html'>The 50 Best Spy Movies of All Time</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 09:00:00 <p>
Since then, new spy movies have emerged from the shadows and joined the ranks, including Steven Soderbergh’s latest espionage thriller Black Bag. As with most genres, any attempt to define the spy movie falls apart pretty quickly. Maybe more quickly than most, given that the term can encompass films featuring everything from evil supervillains plotting to take over the world with futuristic weapons to grounded-in-fact stories of those who trade secrets behind enemy lines. (At least Westerns take place in the Old West. If it features espionage of some form as a key element, in other words, it’s a spy movie for our purposes. It’s useful to remember the terms “Martini” and “stale beer,” two categories often used to define spy stories, in movies and elsewhere. Martini stories operate in a glamorous world where bad guys live in lairs, femmes fatales wait at every backgammon table, and our hero drives fast cars and seldom takes off a tuxedo. If that puts you in mind of James Bond, there’s a reason. Even these groupings are less firm categories than the two poles between which most spy movies fall. The Bond series, for instance, has a habit of inching toward the stale-beer end every time it gets too fixated on gadgets and world-destroying plots. We tried to include a little from every corner of the spy-film world in this list without favoring one sort of spy movie over another. And while it would be easy enough to fill out a whole list with nothing but le Carré adaptations, Bourne movies, Bond movies, and Hitchcock films, we tried to look more broadly. And, as for the latter, we tried to include some representative samples from each Bond era. So, if your favorite Roger Moore movie didn’t make the cut, just assume that the one we chose is representing it as well. With that said, let’s begin with a pair of spies at the beginning of their careers then work our way toward more shadowy terrain. The perfect My First Spy Movie, Robert Rodriguez’s charmingly handcrafted kids’ film follows a couple of second-generation spies (Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara) compelled to follow in their parents’ footsteps thanks to the scheme of a dastardly supervillain/children’s show host played by Alan Cumming (one of many stars clearly having a blast in supporting roles). If James Bond resides at one end of the spectrum when it comes to glamour, you can find Miles Kendig at the other. Played by Walter Matthau in this fun send-up of Cold War intrigue, he looks disheveled, acts impatient, and appears always on the verge of packing it all in and going home. And, in fact, that’s what he’s trying to do for much of Hopscotch by way of publishing a scorching memoir and calling it a day. Only the powers that be within the CIA, including a boss played by Ned Beatty, don’t want him to leave or, more importantly, his secrets to get out. But, unglamorous as he is, Kendig’s also an extremely good spy, and much of the fun of this Ronald Neame–directed comedy comes from watching such an unlikely secret agent outwit every trap American intelligence can throw his way. (Available to stream on Tubi and The Roku Channel.) Michael Fassbender stars as George, a chilly veteran British operative who’s given a list of five possible agents who might be betraying the organization. Actually, that’s not the only twist in this taut, sexy thriller, which reveals a new secret with almost every scene as everyone on George’s list (played by Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, and Regé-Jean Page) starts to wonder who they can trust as personal and professional betrayals come to light. Robert Redford’s history with the spy movie has made casting him a kind of shortcut for anyone wishing to channel a particular vein of paranoid, post-Watergate thrillers (more on this below). That’s why he was so effective in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and why he works so well as Nathan Muir, the mentor to Brad Pitt’s Tom Bishop in this Tony Scott–directed thriller, which opens during Muir’s last day on the job then flashes back to various points in the Cold War. Scott’s slick direction is sometimes at odds with a story that tries to capture the uglier aspects of spycraft, but Redford and Pitt’s raw, nervy performances anchor it. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) If you can ignore the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably the last person who should be cast as a guy so ordinary-seeming that even his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) doesn’t know he’s actually a secret agent, there’s a lot of fun to be had in James Cameron’s lighthearted and explosion-heavy thriller. Sandwiched between Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Titanic, it can’t help but feel a bit minor by Cameron’s standards, bringing little new to the genre beyond a sense of excessiveness. When Paul Greengrass assumed control of the Bourne franchise with 2007’s The Bourne Supremacy, he helped redefine what 21st-century action scenes looked like. But that’s no reason to underrate the Doug Liman–directed The Bourne Identity, which introduced Matt Damon as Robert Ludlum’s amnesia-suffering CIA agent Jason Bourne. Damon brings a haunted intensity to the role, and Liman, who struggled with the studio throughout production, directs with style and grit. David Cronenberg found a different angle on his career-long exploration of how bodies shape identity (and vice versa) by adapting David Henry Hwang’s fact-based play about a French diplomat (Jeremy Irons) who conducts a years-long affair with Peking opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) without seeming to recognize that Song was spying on him — or that Song was a man. Philby died in 1988, by all reports a disillusioned man, but he’d already been killed off onscreen the year before in the opening moments of this Frederick Forsyth adaptation, in which a rogue branch of the KGB plots to build and detonate a bomb on British soil. Future James Bond Pierce Brosnan plays the steely eyed agent sent to do the deed, and Michael Caine (whom we’ll meet again elsewhere on this list) stars as the wild card MI5 agent who stands in his way. Robert Redford (yes, him again) heads an all-star cast in a fun, fleet thriller in which he plays a former radical whose activities in the 1960s — as a Stone Age computer hacker — have forced him to reinvent himself under another name as an independent security expert. Ang Lee’s follow-up to Brokeback Mountain garnered mixed reviews and vanished quickly from American theaters, mostly attracting attention for the explicit sex scenes that earned it an NC-17 rating. That’s too bad for several reasons, including Lee’s meticulous reconstruction of Hong Kong and Shanghai under Japanese occupation, paranoid, perilous places in which anyone could be working with the occupying forces or conspiring against them. Even more memorable, however, is the film’s intense focus on the toll taken on Wong (Tang Wei), a student who joins an acting troupe that decides to assassinate Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), a cruel higher-up in the Japanese-run puppet government. The sex scenes are just part of the film’s depiction of how much of herself Wong gives away in the course of an undercover operation instigated by passionate amateurs who have no idea what they’re doing — up to and including the person she once thought she was. And sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference. In Our Man Flint, James Coburn plays a former agent of Z.O.W.I.E. (But go deeper into the subgenre at your own peril. There’s a reason many low-budget, tongue-in-cheek Bond knockoffs like The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World have been forgotten.) (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) An even richer and more rewarding parody, Undercover Brother folds some sharp commentary into a story of the eponymous Undercover Brother (Eddie Griffin), a hero straight out of a blaxploitation movie who hooks up with the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a mostly black underground spy organization — Neil Patrick Harris plays a diversity hire — who does battle with the Man and his attempts to drain the world of soulfulness. Dave Chappelle and Chi McBride are among the other B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. operatives and the film, directed by Malcolm Lee and based on characters created by co-writer John Ridley, mixes easy jokes with smart, barbed gags about the insidious persistence of racism. That might be why Guy Ritchie’s 2015 adaptation struggled at the box office, which is a shame. Set in the 1960s, it’s a terrifically entertaining spy movie that teams the American agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill, who’s more fun here than he’s ever been anywhere else) with the Russian Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) to stop a former Nazi from executing a deadly scheme. (Alicia Vikander holds her own nicely in the middle of their over-the-top machismo.) Some decide to make real money in the private sector like the ex-spies played by Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in this clever thriller written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Why so few showed up to see it at the time remains a mystery, but it deserves to find a second life. If that sounds a lot like another, even more famous Hitchcock film (and there will be more about that one, and Hitchcock, below) just chalk it up to further support for the auteur theory. Yet Saboteur never plays like a dry run for North by Northwest. Hitchcock’s fixation on the falsely accused found a natural home in the spy genre, as did his technical gifts as a crafter of suspense sequences, which explains why his name turns up on this list more than any other director’s. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Maybe … but where the ’56 version has some great set pieces, it also features Doris Day singing “Que Sera Sera” approximately 500 times and much looser narrative than the lean original, which forces a married couple (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) to pretend nothing is wrong after a nefarious organization (that includes Peter Lorre) kidnaps their daughter. It also features a memorable trip into the London underworld and the best imaginable payoff of an early scene that sets up Best’s character as an expert skeet shooter. In this case, it’s talented amateurism for the win. The sequels and endlessly repeated catchphrases eventually threatened to make the unfrozen, Über-English superspy Austin Powers unbearable, but this first outing in Mike Myers’s affectionate send-up of ’60s spy movies (and ’60s culture in general) remains terrific fun. Myers’s script draws on a deep knowledge of a bygone era and builds to a heartfelt consideration of what’s been lost as we moved away from the ideas that fueled that decade — if not the outmoded, deeply sexist realities of the actual ’60s. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) He’s cheekily charming even when dropped in the most ridiculous situations — he even mostly keeps his dignity while wearing clown makeup in Octopussy — and though the Moore years’ lows are very low, their highs are considerable. Gone were the early attempts to set himself apart by smoking cigars and drinking bourbon. Ups (For Your Eyes Only) and downs (Moonraker) would follow, but with this film Moore established his Bond legitimacy once and for all. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Though later entries starring a series of other actors (Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine) would turn Tom Clancy’s long-serving CIA analyst Jack Ryan into a more traditional action hero, none would make him as appealing as in this first outing. Alec Baldwin plays Ryan as a man who’s more brain than brawn, and who’s frequently terrified and faking it as he attempts to avert catastrophe by convincing others that a rogue Soviet general (Sean Connery) in command of a state-of-the-art submarine is attempting to defect to America, not start a nuclear war by blowing up the East Coast. On a hot streak, Predator and Die Hard director John McTiernan keeps ratcheting up the tension as his two leads get closer to each other, building to a climax that, at the time at least, played like a farewell to American and Russian enmity. Daniel Craig’s third entry as Bond, after helping to bring the character back to his two-fisted roots in Casino Royale, is one of the series’s best thanks to a combination of elements: sharp direction by Sam Mendes, a script that doesn’t feel like a bunch of action scenes strung together by the thinnest of narratives, jaw-dropping photography by Roger Deakins, a top-tier theme by Adele, Craig’s ownership of the role, Javier Bardem as a truly menacing villain with a personal connection to Bond, and an all-star supporting cast that by this point had expanded to include Judi Dench, Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes, and Naomie Harris as a tough Moneypenny. (Mendes’s 2015 follow-up, Spectre, on the other hand, proved that a similar combination of elements could fall apart.) (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Pierce Brosnan didn’t always get the best material as Bond, but the shadow of Bond helped make him a more compelling presence. To that end, he attempts to manipulate Geoffrey Rush’s Harry Pendel, a con man turned tailor who’s not as helpless Osnard might hope. It’s a battle of wits that John Boorman directs with a palpable sense of danger, building tension by letting his characters sweat in the tropical heat. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) And 1988’s The Naked Gun, the team of Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker made this similarly molded spy spoof starring Val Kilmer as a rock star, famous for songs about skeet shooting, who’s enlisted to go behind the Iron Curtain. Donald Sutherland has a gift for dropping flashes of malevolence into his performances even when he’s playing nice guys, so he’s particularly well-suited to play a character whose genial surface masks a vicious heart. In this 1981 thriller directed by Richard Marquand (whose fine work here would him secure a job directing Return of the Jedi a few years later), Sutherland plays “the Needle,” a deep-cover Nazi spy working in World War II England. An adaptation of a Ken Follett novel, the film follows the Needle on a bloody cross-country journey to escape back to Germany with some vital secrets in hand, then slows down the action when he washes up on a sparsely populated island and seduces the unsuspecting (at first) Lucy (Kate Nelligan), a neglected wife. It both takes baby steps into exploring the emotional life of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt (which doesn’t really go anywhere) and ups the stakes of previous films’ action set pieces (including thrillingly extended chase scenes in London and Paris and a how-did-they-do-that helicopter chase) while introducing varieties of action scenes untouched by previous entries, like a brutal fight in a nightclub bathroom. Spielberg has trouble landing the film in its closing scenes, but the director’s technical skills and empathetic command of characters combine to make it an extraordinary feel-bad spy thriller. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Melissa McCarthy plays a desk-bound, overlooked CIA agent who unexpectedly gets the call-up after the apparent death of her flashy partner (Jude Law). McCarthy’s terrific fun as a shy woman who stands up to the bad guys and institutional sexism in a film written and directed by her frequent collaborator Paul Feig. (Possible alternate title: The Spy Who Came Out of Her Shell.) She also has help from a gifted supporting cast whose standouts include Rose Byrne and Jason Statham, in a pitiless spoof of the sort of macho tough-guy roles he normally takes. Isolationist senators even held a Senate subcommittee to investigate the presence of pro-war sentiment in Hollywood movies as late as September of 1941. Hitchcock’s Foreign Correspondent is one of the exceptions, casting Joel McCrea as an American reporter drawn into foreign intrigue on the eve of World War II. This was Hitchcock’s second Hollywood movie, and he earned some criticism in Britain for remaining abroad rather than returning to support the war effort. That stung, but there’s no shortage of concern for his native land to be found in a film that essentially ends with a call for America to join the war. If the stars had aligned just a little differently, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service might have been the greatest James Bond film ever made. Consider this: It features one of the film’s most memorable locales (a lair high atop the Swiss Alps), Telly Savalas as Bond’s archnemesis Blofeld, an uncharacteristically moody tone, and Diana Rigg as a love interest who effortlessly holds her own opposite Bond — a woman he seems capable of truly loving, for once. When Connery came back a few years later after Lazenby walked away, he was stuck with the so-so Diamonds Are Forever, making it that much harder not to ponder what might have been. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) In a late triumph for John Frankenheimer, Robert De Niro stars as a mysterious operative working for initially unclear purposes in Paris, Nice, and Cannes. Everything about Goldfinger is bigger and flashier than in previous entries. It’s a Martini in which every ingredient is perfectly balanced (even if Bond’s anti-Beatles joke makes him sound more out of touch now than ever). (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Part spy movie, part blaxploitation film, part call to arms, this adaptation of a 1969 novel by Chicago writer Sam Greenlee follows Dan Freeman (Lawrence Cook) as he’s selected to be the first black CIA officer, trained in a variety of espionage techniques, then given little to do. Without warning, he quits the agency and returns to Chicago, where he starts converting gang members into freedom fighters to foment an uprising. Directed by Ivan Dixon (best known as Sergeant Kinchloe on Hogan’s Heroes), the film casts no judgment on Freeman’s militancy, and its depiction of entrenched racism provides many suggestions that Freeman might have the right idea, leading to a suggestively open-ended finale. Brian De Palma kicked off this long-running, Tom Cruise–starring big-screen adaptation of the ’60s spy show with a Hitchcockian adventure that finds Cruise’s Ethan Hunt wrongly accused of treason and forced to take extreme measure to prove his innocence. Set in a post–Cold War climate in which the dissolution of old allegiances has led to corruption and confusion, it’s justly famous for a long, mostly silent mid-film heist sequence. Graham Greene spent a carer alternating between what he considered serious novels and lighter work he regarded as “entertainments,” some of which involve spies (which makes sense, since Greene himself dabbled in espionage). But time has had a way of blurring such distinctions, revealing depths in his thrillers that Greene himself may not have seen at the time. Decades later, Sydney Pollack’s quintessential post-Watergate spy movie would explore a similar mood, casting Robert Redford as a low-level analyst who returns from a lunch run to find that everyone else in his office has been murdered. Redford delivers a tough, rattled performance as a man who’s learning new skills on the job because his life depends on it. Pollack delivers some standout suspense scenes, but the best moments feature Redford wandering the New York streets and realizing anyone could be a threat. Sometimes paranoia is just another form of self defense. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) Paul Greengrass pioneered a handheld, close-to-the-action shooting style with the 2002 film Bloody Sunday, a re-creation of the 1972 Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland. He took that approach mainstream via this first sequel to The Bourne Identity, proving it could give action movies a different sort of energy. It’s been imitated to death by lesser films in the years that followed, but this first appearance still has a disarming spark. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) A kind of mirror-image Bond, author Len Deighton’s Harry Palmer is the working-class embodiment of everything grubby and unglamorous in the espionage world. In the first of his several outings as Palmer, Michael Caine is put-upon and bogged down with paperwork. London might have been swinging for other residents, but Palmer still lived in a neighborhood filled with post-War deprivation. The down-market thrills are as effective in their own way as Bond’s globe-trotting adventures, and it’s easy to see why it was part of a mid-’60s run of movies that made Caine a star. (He’d return to the part of Palmer in four sequels.) A Coen brothers riff on the spy genre, Burn After Reading is filled with self-mythologizing drunks, unskilled opportunists, and borderline morons. The film’s underlying suggestion that spies are just as susceptible to selfishness, prone to mistakes, and likely to lie as anyone lines up nicely with some of the revelations brought to light during the George W. Bush years, and little that’s happened since has made the movie seem less insightful. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) What they missed, and what an appreciative audience didn’t miss when a restored print made the art-house rounds in 2006, is a moody, gutting film about wartime sacrifice and the ugly realities of what it takes to practice espionage for even the most noble cause. Drawing from a novel by Joseph Kessel (Belle de Jour) and his own Resistance work, Melville depicts the life of those who worked against the Nazi occupation as one of constant peril and strict rules, an existence in which the fight for French ideals essentially requires those on the right side of history to sever all ties with humanity — and in which every moment of triumph can feel like it’s just forestalling an inevitable defeat down the line. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) The former finds Hitchcock coming into his own as the creator of tense, fast-paced, cleverly plotted thrillers, following Richard Hannay (Robert Donat), a wrongly accused man (yep, another one of those), as he traipses from London to Scotland and back again while trying to unmask a mysterious organization trying to steal British military secrets. The Lady Vanishes proved Hitchcock could be just as effective in tighter quarters. Both films are breathlessly entertaining, revealing a director seemingly capable of drawing thrills out of any setting (and the years to come would find Hitchcock challenging himself on this front again and again). (Both are available to stream on Tubi and Pluto TV.) Until Christopher McQuarrie followed Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation with Mission: Impossible — Fallout, the series had worked through a rotating series of high-profile directors, some of whom fared better than others. John Woo struggled to sustain the excitement found in his Hong Kong and early Hollywood work with Mission: Impossible 2, while J.J. Abrams confirmed he could make the leap from television to film with the very good Mission: Impossible III. If anything, Bird over-delivered, transporting a gift for dynamic action scenes from his animated films to create the best action movie of this century, from a film-opening prison break through a nausea-inducing trip to the top of the Burj Khalifa and beyond. The author born David Cornwell wasn’t writing as a distant observer. He spent the first decades of the Cold War working in British intelligence, growing increasingly frustrated as the years piled up and channeling that frustration into a novel that depicts espionage as a dehumanizing occupation unfit for anyone with a conscience. But, after a while, even Alec isn’t quite sure where the act ends and his true identity begins. His work would be adapted many times over the years, and both Ritt’s chilly direction and Burton’s hollowed-out performance set examples others would strive to match. That’s not a knock on Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s film, however, which finds a different kind of charge from the moral dilemmas of Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), who’s told to surveil a playwright only to discover that the motivations behind the assignment might be more personal than political, and that the time spent watching the playwright has begun to change his own point of view. The film attracted some criticism for its portrayal of a sympathetic Stasi agent, but Mühe’s performance so beautifully captures an awakening conscience that it’s hard to complain too much. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) As entertaining as Hitchcock’s ’30s spy movies are, this Hollywood effort plumbs emotional depths that Hitchcock wasn’t even attempting to explore in the previous decade. Ingrid Bergman stars as Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a Nazi spy coaxed by T.R. Hitchcock keeps the sense of dread high as Alicia embarks on a mission that takes her deeper into Alexander’s world than she imagined she’d have to go, but the film’s drama comes just as much from the tension between her and Devlin, whose love for her is complicated by his professional obligation to put her in danger and push her into the arms of another man. Based on a novel by Richard Condon, The Manchurian Candidate takes accounts of American soldiers being brainwashed during the Korean War to a nightmarish extreme via the story of a politically connected war hero (Laurence Harvey) who’s been programmed as an assassin by communist forces. John Frankenheimer fills the film with a Cold War–era sense that anyone could be the enemy — even, thanks to a chilling turn by Angela Lansbury, one’s own mother. But it’s Frank Sinatra, in one of his best performances, who embodies the exhaustion of the times, playing a weary, traumatized soldier who discovers he still has a role to play in a war that never really ended. Also worth seeing: Jonathan Demme’s 2004 remake, which revisits the story through a post-9/11 prism. (Available to stream on Prime Video and Pluto TV.) John le Carré’s densely plotted novels can be tricky to condense into feature-length films, which may explain why they’ve sometimes had better luck on TV than on the big screen (see: The Night Manager, The Little Drummer Girl, and this 1974 novel’s previous adaptation as a 1979 mini-series starring Alec Guinness). Also brilliant: Gary Oldman’s performance as George Smiley, le Carré’s signature hero, an unglamorous man in an unhappy marriage who’s become alienated from the job his extraordinary mind allows him to perform better than anyone else. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) If either could let their guards down, le Carré’s Smiley could doubtlessly have long, meaningful conversations about the personal costs of spying with Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), the protagonist of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation. But he soon finds success comes with consequences when the implications of what he’s recorded start haunting him, stirring his own fear of being watched, underscoring his profound alienation, and reminding him that the soul refuses to stay silent. Yet one of The Conversation’s most striking qualities is how little it resembles Coppola’s gangster masterpieces, trading epic sweep and classic grandeur for a tight focus and experimental flourishes — all while exploring the damage done to a man who, in the process of probing others’ lives, has come to realize the profundity of his own loneliness. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.) The best James Bond film is also something of a dead end. Connery’s second outing as the superspy is more grounded than both its predecessor and the sequels to come, teaming Bond up with a female Russian agent (Italian actress Daniela Bianchi, overdubbed by Barbara Jefford) to outwit the evil SPECTRE in Turkey. It’s similar in tone to Fleming’s early novels, a spy story whose more outrageous elements — dig those switchblade shoes with poison blades! Goldfinger would take the series on a different, and highly entertaining, path just one film later, but From Russia With Love suggests it might have found just as much success staying a little closer to the world we know. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven’s earliest memories involve falling bombs. The shock of Verhoeven’s films comes less from the graphic violence — though, sure, that can be plenty shocking — than the ways in which violence can be made casual, even acceptable, be it by greed, war, or institutional approval. It’s as if he’d spent a lifetime wondering how the world he grew up in could have been allowed to happen in the first place. Black Book was Verhoeven’s first Dutch film after a couple of decades in Hollywood, and it’s a less-than-sentimental journey back to the times and place that made him. It eschews formula, but it’s the quintessence of a fluid genre that can play host to an astounding variety of stories. The platonic ideal that all light-footed spy movies aspire to emulate, Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest gave him his biggest canvas yet to explore the theme of an innocent man attempting to outrun wrongful accusations and sinister forces. Here a case of mistaken identity sends an unsuspecting advertising agent, played by Cary Grant, on a journey across the United States (and, eventually, into the arms of Eva Marie Saint). The film offers some never-topped set pieces, but Hitchcock makes them serve his interest in what happens when characters find themselves stripped of everything that makes them feel safe and comfortable. This is a master working in top form from start to finish to create a film that’s been much-imitated but never topped.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-merritt-wever-gretchen-dylan-g-breakup-s2e9.html'>‘Severance’: Merritt Wever Explains Gretchen</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 08:00:05 <p>
Spoilers ahead for Severance season two, episode nine, “The After Hours.” But through it all, possibly the most affecting and human story line is the blossoming yet doomed relationship between Innie Dylan G. and his Outie’s wife, Gretchen George (Merritt Wever). In this season’s penultimate episode, Gretchen breaks the news to her husband that she kissed his Innie, leaving him hurt and betrayed. Despite how sweet and strange it can be to watch Gretchen connect with a different version of the husband she knows and loves, Wever has no illusions about the nature of this complicated love triangle, calling the scenario “emotionally grotesque.” “It’s a horrific bind, because if her husband quits, this man ceases to be,” Wever says. “If he doesn’t quit, this man stays down here in this underworld in pain, and she can’t see him.” I was on a job in L.A., and I got one of those “You should expect a text from Ben Stiller” messages, as one does. He reached out before I had seen the show. I had dinner plans that night, and resented them because it meant I couldn’t watch the whole series in one go. I’d been working on dialogue lately on projects where you were saying the thing that was happening, and there wasn’t a ton of room to breathe or sit in the material. I remember saying, “Can you give me an idea of where this will go?” I know what it’s like to be invited onto a project and really love it, but then get to work and find that the thing you’re being asked to do isn’t really the thing you want to be doing. They sent me a two-page document that was “This is what you can expect.” In retrospect, it was very generous of them, given that the show is so discreet about what’s coming. How did you develop your chemistry with Zach Cherry in two different forms? We didn’t do a lot of talking about it. When you first meet Dylan’s Innie, you have to balance this sense of familiarity with the politeness of meeting a new person. That’s what I responded to when they sent me the scenes. When I watched those scenes over, though, I was also like, Oh yeah, it’s a lot of two people sitting and talking to each other, which can be challenging. It reminded me of what happens sometimes when you’re rehearsing a play. The thing that’s happening is such a big deal that you feel, as an actor, How could I ever go faster? That’s what it feels like when you’re acting the scene, but when you’re the castmate sitting in the audience during tech, watching, you’re like, Yeah, it’s true. I noticed that you had your hair down in her second meeting with Dylan G., which feels looser. She’s one of the best I’ve ever worked with. On Severance, she did a lot of the work for me. I’m not sure how much you even get to see them, but there’s this amazing pair of boots she wears in episode nine. There was even a line in the very early iteration of the episode-three scene that referenced Dylan and Gretchen’s favorite movie, and it got cut, but she was able to bring that feel and aesthetic of that film into what she was wearing. For episode nine, we were choosing what dress she would wear to go see him at Lumon, and we were choosing between one that was a solid color and one with little flowers. I think in episode four, Dylan’s first line is talking about the sky. She was on the same page when it came to thoughtful details like that. She’s meeting the man she first fell in love with, the man who first fell in love with her. I can’t imagine how enticing that must be. When she tells Outie Dylan that something happened with his Innie, I don’t think it’s because she’s trying to blow something up. I think she’s weirdly trying to save her marriage. I remember standing there, with Zach on one knee, and thinking it was horrific what had happened. She doesn’t want to look or be looked at. I’m struck by the fact that Innie Dylan and Gretchen can only have so much of a happy ending. It’s a horrific bind, because if her husband quits, this man ceases to be. If he doesn’t quit, this man stays down here in this underworld in pain, and she can’t see him. I remember Zach trying to explain why he was letting it happen, instead of being the person who makes it happen. Whether she knows it or wants to be, there’s such a power discrepancy. It means that what happens in episode nine matters. The way they edited that sequence, too, gave it a kind of gravity that maybe the original scene didn’t end with — the way they cut it together with Mark and Helly. It foreshadows that this is going to have emotional consequences. When she first shows up in episode three, it’s because she has to talk to her husband about, “Can you please keep your job?” It’s a very weird line to toe. The show is part Star Trek, part Greek myth, with a dash of the importance of labor solidarity and late-stage capitalism. There’s a lot of things in the water.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/deal-or-no-deal-island-recap-season-2-episode-11.html'>Deal or No Deal Island Recap: You Get What You Give</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 02:00:10 <p>
Fresh off a deliciously diabolical run on last year’s The Traitors, Parvati Shallow came to Deal or No Deal Island to eat up the competition “like little gummy bears” — and for a while, it worked. But in the game’s penultimate episode, backed into a corner and forced to face the banker, she cut a bad deal and sent herself home. Part of the appeal of DONDI is its willingness to pit normies against reality royalty like Parvati and Australian Survivor “Golden God” David Genat. Big Brother’s infamous Dr. Will Kirby might’ve gone home relatively early, but our other two familiar faces, Parv and David, made it to the final four. Ordinary people do have one advantage, though, and that’s their sense of camaraderie. How fitting, then, that DONDI’s only remaining reality winner is David, who’s spent the game cosplaying as a buff, unassuming bloke from Australia. and Lete, and in the end, the game might’ve come down to how forgiving our most recently jilted normie, Phillip, was feeling. David was in a privileged but tough spot this week — forced to decide whether to let his work wife, Parv, play Deal or No Deal like she wanted or to make someone else roll the dice with their fate instead. The last time he had to make this choice, he overruled his “son” Dickson, who wanted to play, and watched him get sent home. With her intensity, I’m convinced she’d crush a tango. But with more than $10 million on the line, this week’s excursion still came down to relationships — which did not bode well for C.K., who’s managed to alienate pretty much everyone at one point or another. Each season, Survivor assembles a jury of recently eliminated contestants. On DONDI, the fresh departures showed up to either help or sabotage their former competitors as they attempted to cross a bridge full of obstacles, collecting unmarked cases along the way. Two alumni stood on each platform, where they could either provide helpful intel, laugh as the finalists struggled, or actively work against them. (Sorry, just one second — I’m wiping the drool and tears off my keyboard.) Obviously, alliances are crucial to this challenge, but so is trust. This would not be a problem for someone like Lete, who never let anyone forget what an honest player she was, but needless to say, C.K. Lete went first, and for the most part, everyone wanted to help. La Shell was not quite as helpful as Phil and told Lete which case not to pick, while Dr. Will helped her toss ropes with monkey’s fists at the end across the platform to create a pulley system to yank herself across. After all, once you’ve exchanged friendship bracelets, it’s forever. The funniest round of this challenge was always going to be C.K., and she did not disappoint. She’s spent weeks screwing people over, double dealing, and even got caught cheating in a challenge. As tired as this saying might be in our current era, this week was clearly the “Find Out” stage in C.K.’s “Fuck Around and Find Out” cycle. She was toast and she knew it, but that didn’t mean we couldn’t savor every smirk from a former competitor along the way. On the second platform, Phil got similarly petty, asking C.K., “Are you going to trust that I treated you better than you treated me?” He deliberately pointed her to the high-value case, knowing she’d never trust him. Indeed, she chose another, once again sealing her own fate. Even La Shell decided to be less than helpful on the third platform, forcing C.K. was Dr. Will, who declined at first but then seemingly took pity on her. David mostly did okay in this game, but Dr. Will forced him to reveal which show he’d competed on before, which briefly threatened David’s relationship with Dickson, who overheard and wondered why David would keep such a secret. Luckily for David, the answer is both obvious and understandable, and Dickson will clearly be his biggest fan for life, so it didn’t matter — he still gave him his highest-value case. : “Do you trust that I have been better for you than you have for me?” I’ll be honest: As funny and appropriate as this question might have been the first time, it felt a little obnoxious and self-righteous the second time. Then again, Phil’s downfall in this game was taking things too personally at the expense of being strategic, so this does track. Despite their beef, David trusted the case that Phil picked — which, based on what Phil did with C.K., might have been the right move. But if Phil had a different trick up his sleeve, Lete might’ve just won this thing. Curse the DONDI gods for making us wait a week to find out! David has played a great game, and while part of me suspects Phil stuck to his honorable strategy, there’s always the chance he just screwed him over. For the sake of my girl Lete, I’m hoping he did.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Eugene Henley Jr., AKA Big U -- an ex-manager of Nipsey Hussle and a founding member of Rollin' 60s Neighborhood Crips street gang -- is now charged in a federal RICO complaint that includes allegations of murder, human trafficking and extortion.

Officials from the U.S. Attorney's Office in L.A. held a press conference Wednesday confirming 10 people have been arrested, including part-time rappers Bricc Baby and Luce Cannon ... who've been frequent guests on the 'No Jumper' podcast.

Big U is listed in the docs as the Rollin' 60s kingpin and is accused of murdering an aspiring Las Vegas rapper in January 2021 in Las Vegas after the unnamed rapper allegedly recorded a diss track taking shots at Big U.

The feds claim Big U drove to North Las Vegas with another charged defendant -- Sylvester "Vey" Robinson -- fatally shot the aspiring rapper in the head, dragged the body off Interstate 15 into the desert and left the corpse in a ditch.

Big U and Robinson allegedly then drove back to L.A. and told all witnesses not to speak with law enforcement about the slaying. The feds claim they also deleted surveillance footage of the slain rapper's time spent in the studio.

If it sounds like a scene from the movie "Casino," the complaint characterizes Big U's enterprise as "a mafia-like organization" that used intimidation tactics to get over on local businesses.

There's also an allegation Big U took millions of dollars in grants from the city of L.A. and COVID 19 relief -- intended to help the community -- and instead sunk into his criminal enterprise.

The feds claim he also pocketed 2 separate $20,000 donations intended for community development from a former NBA superstar and a current one -- who, reportedly, are Shaquille O'Neal and Draymond Green.

Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally ripped Big U and his operation during the press conference, saying, "The allegations in the complaint unsealed today reveal a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder, extortion, human trafficking, and fraud -- all led by a supposed anti-gang activist and purported music entrepreneur who was nothing more than a violent street criminal.”

Big U previously spent 13 years in prison, and if convicted he could face a statutory maximum sentence of life.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A story highlighting Jackie Robinson's time in the United States Army is back up on the Department of Defense website ... less than 24 hours after it was removed. It's unclear whether the initial takedown was intentional or accidental. TMZ Sports, before the Robinson story was republished, asked Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot for answers ... and he seemed to indicate that while the Secretary of Defense wants anything DEI-related pulled, the Robinson story was taken down in error. “As Secretary Hegseth has said, DEI is dead at the Defense Department. Discriminatory Equity Ideology is a form of Woke cultural Marxism that has no place in our military. Ullyot, in a separate statement, also praised Robinson's military service. Shortly after, the article was back up and running. Of course, Robinson's exploits on the diamond are widely known ... but not everyone is aware of his service to the country. In January 1943, JR was commissioned a second lieutenant, and was ultimately assigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st "Black Panthers" tank battalion, admirably serving for about two years.

Kylie Jenner's office building served as the backdrop for a police apprehension ... because cops arrested a guy out front, and they drew their guns!!!

Photogs camped outside Kylie's office hoping for a glimpse of the reality TV star got more than they bargained for Tuesday when a police bust played out right in front of them.

Check out the gallery ... Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies rolled up on a guy on the sidewalk outside Kylie's office and arrested him with their pistols drawn.

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... the arrest was unrelated to Kylie or her office.

We're told the bust related to an alleged robbery of an Albertsons supermarket down the street from Kylie's office complex.

Cops believe the same suspect may have committed another crime earlier in the day before getting released from jail and allegedly hitting the Albertsons.

The University of Georgia student whose mug shot went viral says guys are moving faster than cops allege she was when they pulled her over ... claiming she's got dozens in her DMs -- ranging from corny young dudes to old creeps.

We spoke with Lily Stewart -- the blonde bombshell who was thrust into the spotlight when a picture of her flashing her pearly whites after her arrest received a ton of attention online ... and, she tells us gross old men and Casanovas are shooting their shot in the DMs.

Among the ones she's received ... Lily says dudes are saying things like they'll pay her bail and adding puns like "Love is fast, let's move fast."

LS says she's not replying to many of the messages ... but, she's taking them all in stride -- laughing at the funny ones and trying to ignore all the others.

Lily's mom was none too happy about her getting arrested BTW ... 'cause Lily says she's worried it could mess with her future. Stewart adds she plans on slowing down in the future -- so, don't expect another Miss America mug shot down the line.

Aubrey Plaza and her late husband Jeff Baena were separated for several months before he took his own life ... TMZ has learned. The ME says Jeff's manner of death is suicide ... which lines up with what we were originally told by our law enforcement sources. The ME's death investigation summary says Jeff's dog walker found him dead in his home and called police. Officers say the dog walker told them she showed up to his home on January 3 at her normal time to walk his dog, and she heard loud music coming from within the house, which was unusual. Cops say they were told Jeff had been separated from Aubrey since September 2024 when she moved to New York ... and officers note they were told Jeff had a phone conversation with Aubrey the night before he was found dead. Police say they spoke to Aubrey on the phone after he was found dead and she confirmed their separation. Officers also say Aubrey told them Jeff made concerning remarks in October 2024 which prompted her to call a friend to perform a welfare check on her husband. Cops say Aubrey told them Jeff had been attending therapy since the alleged October incident and she claimed he did not have any previous suicide attempts. The ME says Jeff was pronounced dead at 10:39 AM PT on January 3 and police say Aubrey told officers she last heard from him earlier that morning at 7:36 AM PT when he sent her a text message. The docs say no illicit drugs or alcohol were found on the scene or in Jeff's system and no suicide note was found.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Christina Applegate says she's been hospitalized "upwards of 30 times" from throwing up, diarrhea, and excruciating pain ... and she thinks it stems from her MS.

The "Married... with Children" star -- who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021 -- opened up about her rather crappy experiences on her latest 'MeSsy' podcast episode as she and her cohost Jamie-Lynn Sigler addressed a note from a listener also battling the autoimmune disease and dealing with frequent diarrhea and vomiting.

During the candid discussion, CA admits when she needs to go No. 2, she oftentimes also pukes ... and is certain there's a correlation between her upset stomach and MS, despite doctors not being totally convinced.

She says she's experienced "every test known to man" to get to the bottom of her toilet issues and is going to push harder about the possible correlation at her upcoming colonoscopy thanks to the listener's note.

Christina calls the whole situation "scary" and also urges her fan to chat with their doctors about motility issues and their relation to MS.

She leaves the listener with some sage advice in the meantime ... "Always have a little trash can next to your toilet. Because you can do both without it being messy."

Morris says he informed the prosecutor that Lily was being targeted by online trolls who made a slew of vile comments after her mug shot went viral. Morris says he's now calling media outlets and asking them to take down Lily's booking photo since the case is no longer active. Still, Morris says Lily is facing some punishment for driving 84 miles per hour in a 55 MPH zone. She has to do community service and take a defensive driving class. Lily Stewart -- a 20-year-old university student from the University of Georgia -- was arrested earlier this month and booked on a speeding in excess of maximum limits charge, a misdemeanor in the state. Unlike President Donald Trump's scowl in his mug shot, Lily decided to go with the Miss America look, like she just won the lottery -- instead of a one-way ticket to a holding cell. Unfortunately, the run-in with police apparently didn't do anything to quell Stewart's alleged need for speed ... 'cause this officer says mere minutes later he saw her driving 84 in a 55 -- and arrested her. As you can imagine ... people online are in Lily's corner -- with some joking they've got no idea why she was arrested, but they're sure she's innocent of all charges. Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post. BTW ... Lily clearly thinks a good picture's a good picture, regardless of why it was taken -- 'cause she decided to post the mug shot along with her favorite comments from other social users.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pete Davidson's got a new girlfriend ... and, it sounds like she'll be totally comfortable around some of his famous acquaintances -- 'cause she's actually dated them, too!

TMZ has confirmed Pete's dating Elsie Hewitt -- a model and actress with a few big-time credits to her name -- after Daily Mail published photos of the two frolicking in the cool ocean waves together.

Pete and Elsie locked lips and held hands ... with Pete's back tattoos visible, and nearly every inch of Hewitt's body on display.

Like we said, if Elsie looks familiar, it might be because she's known for dating high-profile stars -- like music producer and Selena Gomez's future husband Benny Blanco.

And, just last year, Hewitt was linked to one of Davidson's fellow "Saturday Night Live" alums, Jason Sudeikis. Page Six broke the news about Hewitt's identity.

Obviously, Pete's dated his fair share of Hollywood stars too ... most notably Kim Kardashian from late 2021 to the middle of 2022 after the pair kissed on an episode of "Saturday Night Live."
