The profusion of artificial intelligence tools in clinical practice is leading to the development of new health system roles such as the chief health AI officer. In one such move, the University of California San Francisco has named an inaugural executive director of AI monitoring in clinical care.In this new role within the Division of Clinical Informatics and Digital Transformation (DoC-IT), Jinoos Yazdany, M.D., M.P.H., will spearhead the development of the foundational components of the Impact Monitoring Platform for Clinical Care (IMPACC), a real-time AI monitoring platform designed to continuously evaluate the efficacy, safety, fairness, and overall value of AI tools deployed at UCSF Health. A central focus of her role will also be to expand access to data on AI implementations, ensuring that UCSF's research community can leverage these data to drive innovative research.Yazdany serves as chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and is the UCSF Alice Betts Endowed Professor of Medicine. As a rheumatologist specializing in systemic lupus, she practices at ZSFG and co-directs the UCSF Health Lupus Clinic.In her new role, she will work closely with Sara Murray, M.D., UCSF's chief health AI officer; Julia Adler-Milstein, Ph.D., chief of DoC-IT; and Hossein Soleimani, Ph.D., senior data scientist.“AI is no longer just hype—it's fundamentally transforming the way we deliver healthcare,” Yazdany said in a statement. “For example, the AI scribe I use in the clinic feels like a leap forward, freeing me from my keyboard so I can be fully present with my patients. What excites me most is ensuring we strategically deploy AI tools and evaluate whether they improve patient outcomes and increase the joy of practicing medicine.”

As AI becomes more deeply embedded in healthcare, we must take an active approach to monitoring,”  she added. “IMPACC will be essential to ensuring these technologies are not only safe but also fair and truly beneficial for both patients and our health system. Our team aims to set the gold standard for AI oversight, ensuring these tools earn our trust and truly enhance patient care.”In the near term, UCSF said IMPACC will deploy robust, readily implementable metrics to ensure AI tools are safe and effective, while simultaneously building a research pipeline to pioneer new monitoring approaches. Beyond UCSF, the open-source AI-monitoring metrics developed by the IMPACC team will enable institutions nationwide to learn from and tailor evidence-based strategies to their own needs.

Two local hospitals have been presented with the 2025 Patient Safety Excellence Award from Healthgrades, a website where customers can get information about medical care and hospitals, according to a press release from HCA Florida Healthcare.

The announcement about the two hospitals, HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital, was made public on Tuesday.

Hospital officials said it's the "eighth year in a row that HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital have been recognized as a Patient Safety Excellence Award recipient."

Both hospitals were recently recognized as among the nation's 250 Best Hospitals, which placed them "among the top 5% of hospitals in the country for clinical excellence," the release noted.

The hospitals have received other honors for orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, spinal surgery, prostate surgery and joint replacement surgery, hospital officials said.

“We at HCA Florida Ocala Hospital and HCA Florida West Marion Hospital are wholly committed to providing the Marion County community and its visitors safe, collaborative, and timely care,” Dr. Dave MacIntyre, chief medical officer for HCA Florida Ocala and HCA Florida West Marion Hospitals, said in the news bulletin. 

The release points out that HCA Florida Healthcare, a part of HCA Healthcare, is a family of more than 650 affiliated sites of care, including hospitals, physician practices, freestanding emergency rooms and urgent care centers.</p>

JPMorgan Chase mismanaged employee health benefits, resulting in past and present employees paying inflated prices for prescription drugs and other health care costs, a lawsuit filed last week alleges.

Filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the lawsuit accuses central Ohio's largest private employer of failing its employees by agreeing to overcharges in prescription drugs by the company's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), CVS Caremark. As a PBM, Caremark sets the drug prices for JPMorgan Chase's employee health plans.

JPMorgan Chase employs roughly 20,000 people in central Ohio. The lawsuit is being brought by both current and former employees across the country.

The consequence, according to the lawsuit, is JPMorgan Chase itself and employees and their families paying an average of over 200 times the cost for hundreds of generic prescription drugs available at drastically cheaper prices, even for the uninsured.

One example includes the plan's purchase of the multiple sclerosis drug teriflunomide, which was allegedly bought at a price of $6,229. At retail pharmacies, the drug can be purchased for around $30 without insurance. A drug price like this paid by a health plan can result in higher out-of-pocket costs and higher premiums for participants, while much of the money is pocketed by a PBM.

The lawsuit further alleges that any lack of oversight by the company is "willful" and violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

ERISA is a federal law that aims to protect the interests of participants in a health plan, by setting industry standards and the fiduciary responsibilities of employers and others who control health plans. The lawsuit accuses JPMorgan Chase of abandoning that "fiduciary responsibility" by agreeing to inflated drug prices to the detriment of their employees, even though less expensive options and health plan models were available.

"No prudent fiduciary would agree or allow for its plan and participants/beneficiaries pay a price that is more than two hundred times higher than the price available to any individual who just walks into a pharmacy and pays out-of-pocket, and five hundred sixty times higher than the price available with just a few clicks online," the lawsuit reads.

JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH recently announced that its subsidiary, Molina Healthcare of Illinois, has been selected as one of four organizations to provide a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) in Illinois. This contract, awarded by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, positions Molina Healthcare for strategic growth while enhancing its service offerings for dual-eligible beneficiaries.

This new contract will replace Illinois' existing Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative, which currently covers approximately 73,000 beneficiaries. With the go-live date set for Jan. 1, 2026, Molina Healthcare of Illinois stands to gain from the transition as it strengthens its foothold in the state's healthcare landscape.

In December 2024, MOH secured wins by expanding its services to dual-eligible populations in Michigan and Idaho. Contract wins like these are expected to increase the overall membership and drive premiums. Premiums remain the most significant contributor to a health insurer's top line. As of Dec. 31, 2024, MOH's Medicaid and Medicare membership grew 7.7% and 40.7% year over year, respectively. For 2025, management estimates Medicaid and Medicare membership to be around 5 million and 250,000, respectively.

By integrating care services more efficiently under the new D-SNP model, Molina Healthcare can enhance patient outcomes while streamlining operations, potentially driving cost savings and improved member retention. This latest success reaffirms Molina Healthcare's commitment to serving vulnerable populations and positions the company for continued expansion in the competitive healthcare market. It expects total revenues to rise approximately 8% year over year in 2025.

Shares of Molina Healthcare have gained 7.6% over the past three months compared with the industry's 3.1% growth. MOH currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Former Bachelorette Katie Thurston is opening up about being diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at age 34.

"You're so devastated. It's so shocking," Thurston told ABC News' Eva Pilgrim in an interview that aired Wednesday on "Good Morning America." "As a 34-year-old woman, it's just, you're not prepared."

Thurston, who starred in season 17 of "The Bachelorette" in 2021, said the road to her diagnosis began when she noticed a small lump on one of her breasts, a symptom of breast cancer that she said she initially dismissed.

"When I felt my lump, it was sore, and as women were used to being told like, 'Oh, it's it's probably their time of the month,' or 'Oh, it's from working out,' so I brushed it off for a while," Thurston said. "And then finally I decided to go to the doctor."

After seeking medical care, Thurston said she was diagnosed with Stage 3 triple positive ductal carcinoma, a type of cancer where tumor cells have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 receptors on their surface, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.

For Thurston, the diagnosis meant she would need to undergo chemotherapy before she could have the cancerous tumor removed.

"You're on, like, survival mode. Like, you don't have a choice -- you show up, or you die," Thurston said of her experience being quickly thrust into the world of breast cancer treatment and appointments. "And I hate to say it that way, but, like ... every day you have an appointment, every day you have to show up. You don't have a choice."

Thurston received her diagnosis in February, just a few months after she became engaged to comedian Jeff Acuri. Instead of planning their wedding, she said she and Acuri began planning for their future in a different way.

"We thought we'd be planning a wedding. We thought we'd be trying for a baby," she said. "And instead, we know that this year is really dedicated to just treatment and getting better."

Thurston said she chose to harvest her eggs following her diagnosis in case she and Acuri try to have a child together in the future.

"We've done everything we can to be, you know, proactive for our future and our family plans," she said, adding that she and Acuri are also OK if their proactive steps ultimately don't work. "But in the event that IVF didn't work out, in the event that chemo did impact me in a negative way when it comes to my reproductive health, we're also OK being a childless couple."

Former 'Bachelorette' star Katie Thurston and Blake Moynes split

Thurston shared her breast cancer diagnosis publicly in an Instagram post on Feb. 15, writing that she found support and hope after her diagnosis in the stories of other women who also faced breast cancer.

Thurston told Pilgrim that she hopes sharing her story encourages people to be proactive about their own breast health.

"I think that's the biggest takeaway, is telling people like, 'Don't wait,' you know, 'Be proactive, get checked out,'" she said. "You could be doing yourself a favor in the future."

Most women with average risk should start screening for breast cancer at age 40, and get screened every other year through age 74, according to guidance from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed group of experts whose conclusions guide medical decision making and determine some insurance policies.

Breast cancer screening tools include a mammogram, which is an X-ray of the breast.

Dense breast tissue may make a mammogram more difficult to interpret, and may make detecting cancer more difficult, according to the National Institutes of Health. Women with dense breasts may be called back for follow-up testing, including ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

Women at higher risk of getting breast cancer may also receive an MRI scan.

Throughout their lifetime, women should also watch for new lumps, skin changes and nipple changes, including unusual discharge, pain, and redness.

Over 10 years, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability care providers. But intense pressures to turn a profit could harm quality, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.

Private equity firms have recently come under fire for their role in healthcare, including their management of hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

However, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says the financiers' inroads into disability care, which manages services including residential care, home health and personal assistance, is just as troubling, but has yet to garner attention.

Private equity firms are attracted to the industry because of growing demand for care, high levels of fragmentation across disability care, and its expected recession-resistant nature, according to the report.

But patients in disability care centers tend to be some of the most disadvantaged, and often have multiple comorbities, making them unable to stand up for themselves in cases of questionable management practices. The report accuses private equity firms of neglecting or abusing patients, adding that poor care is possible in part due to regulatory loopholes that allows for varying safety standards.

“Private equity firms are fundamentally altering these services in ways that put some of the most vulnerable members of our communities at risk,” said Eileen O'Grady, director of programs at PESP and lead author of the report, in a statement. “The private equity model prioritizes short-term financial gains, often at the expense of staffing levels, service quality, and even basic client safety.”

Investigations in Florida, Indiana, California and Illinois found cost-cutting measures by private equity firms led to problems that impacted patient care, including severe understaffing and improper use of restraints at some facilities. 

The watchdog organization said intense pressures to cut costs are in part to blame for the failures. In some cases, while the facilities were accused of neglecting patients, they were simultaneously funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to investors through debt-funded dividends. 

For example, Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group paid themselves more than $600 million in dividends from Sevita and Help at Home, even as the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says care standards declined.

In some cases cost-cutting measures resulted in direct harm to patients.

Regulators shut down Broadstep Behavioral Health group homes in Illinois after finding “significant deficiencies” in medication management, staff training and safety measures, including repeat violations in safety drills and deficient cleanliness. In Indiana, a patient reportedly died of neglect after weighing just 71 pounds at a facility run by Help at Home, according to the report.

“Home and community-based services are essential for hundreds of thousands of Americans with disabilities,” O'Grady said. “Private equity ownership imperils the effective delivery of these services and puts individuals with disabilities at risk.”

This week, several vendors are partnering up and validating new tools to scale cybersecurity protections for providers, payers and healthcare innovators. 

Google announced on March 18 that it has signed an agreement to acquire Israeli cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion – it's the biggest and most expensive acquisition it's ever made.

The rapidly growing startup's technology will enable Google Cloud to improve cloud security and scale security across multiple clouds, the company says.

The Wiz security platform connects to all major clouds and code environments and can be used by organizations of all sizes to secure platforms they build and run in the cloud. 

"Enabling more companies to prevent cyberattacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents," Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, said in a statement.

"Businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions and greater choice in cloud computing providers," Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, said in a statement. "Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds."

The company's products will remain available on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and other platforms.

Nashville-based Clearwater said Tuesday that it is the first CancerX member company to focus on advancing cybersecurity and data privacy in oncology innovation. 

The company said it will contribute its expertise and resources to educate the public-private partnership's community members, including the recently announced 2025 Accelerator cohort. 

Clearwater will work with the cohort on building cybersecurity and privacy programs that align with best practices and healthcare industry standards.

"Clearwater is honored to join such a prestigious group of organizations that are dedicated to addressing critical challenges in oncology," Steve Cagle, the company's CEO, said in a statement. "As a champion, our role is to help ensure that innovation advances unabated by concern over the security and privacy of data and systems."

CancerX is hosted by the Moffitt Cancer Center, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.

DrFirst, a provider of end-to-end medication management solutions, announced Tuesday that all of its medication management products are now HITRUST-certified and protect against current and emerging threats. 

With validated controls, customers can address cybersecurity challenges and remain cyber-resilient over time, the company said. The controls protect and effectively manage data, mitigate information and cybersecurity risks, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including HIPAA requirements. 

"Strong cybersecurity measures are essential to protecting our organization and the stakeholders who rely on us," G. Cameron Deemer, CEO of DrFirst, said in a statement.

Both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly are pushing for healthcare reforms to provide price transparency and authorization efficiency for patients across the state, but questions remain about whether the House and Senate will unite in their proposals to approve health reform legislation during the 2025 session.

The Care First Act aims to eliminate red tape that causes delays in the authorization process that patients must endure in order to receive treatment. House Bill 434 requires timely decisions so that patients and doctors are not left wondering for weeks or months if the patient will receive the needed authorization for treatment coverage. 

The House proposal aims to reform the broken prior authorization process in North Carolina's healthcare system, which has become a major barrier for doctors and patients seeking timely care. During a recent press conference, the bill's sponsors and supporters from the medical community emphasized the need to restore doctors' authority in making medical decisions for their patients without unnecessary delays from insurance companies.

Representative Grant Campbell, R-Cabarrus, a practicing physician, highlighted that physicians currently spend an average of 13 hours per week navigating prior authorizations, which leads to delays and negatively impacts patient care. He shared a personal example of a six-week delay in surgery for a patient due to repeated authorization hindrances. Campbell pointed out that physicians sometimes have to appeal to out-of-field non-specialists, such as psychiatrists, for approval on treatments that require specialized knowledge in a different area of medicine.

“On one side, you have the doctor and the patient who have easily known each other for years,” explained Campbell. “That same doctor has examined them, discussed their options, looked at their testing; and on the other side, you have someone sitting in a cubicle in a corporate office that may be a physician, may not be a physician, may be in your specialty, may not be in your specialty, may be seeing patients anymore, and may not be seeing patients. The parade of people that are trying to interfere with the relationship with the patient and their physician has got to stop, and this is one of the great first steps to do that.”

The bill, supported by various medical organizations such as the North Carolina Medical Society and the NC Health Care Association, aims to streamline the authorization process. It also requires health insurers to consult with the doctors prior to a denial, in addition to setting time frames and minimum clinical standards.

The bill would purportedly save $1.8 billion annually, as the state health plan's reduces procedures requiring prior authorization from 2,600 to 1,600..

The House effort comes one day after senators introduced two bills targeting health care, which will be merged together during the committee process. Senate Bill 316, Lower Healthcare Costs, would help North Carolinians understand the costs and fees associated with their healthcare services by requiring disclosures for billable items. The price transparency would incentivize customers to shop around, say bill sponsors. 

The legislation takes other steps to reduce costs as well, such as tasking the state auditor with reviewing facility prices, deregulation to allow more dentists to practice more freely, and eliminating Certificate of Need review for inpatient rehab.

Senate Bill 315, More Transparency/Efficiency in Utilization Reviews, proposes reforms to prior authorization practices to keep costs down and ensure timely care. The bill requires urgent health care services to be reviewed in 24 hours or less, codifies the appeals process, and requires that any doctor conducting a review be actively licensed in that specialty for at least three consecutive years, according to a press release. 

“In order to make the best decisions for their care, patients need to have all of the information about their procedure at their fingertips,” said bill sponsor Sen. Amy Galey, R-Alamance. “Shedding light on the true costs of healthcare is good for patients and providers. These proposals will provide much-needed transparency for North Carolinians when they're making decisions about their health.”

The bills will be heard in the Senate Health Care Committee on Wednesday. While similar prior authorization legislation passed the House unanimously in 2023, the bill stalled in the Senate.

“We would like to applaud the efforts by both the House and Senate leadership to bring these issues to the forefront,” said a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina. “We support their efforts to work with stakeholders to hold everyone accountable for the costs and access to health care. We appreciate the efforts to respond to North Carolinians' frustrations with the health care system. We are committed to keeping health care affordable and look forward to working with anyone who shares that goal.”

Rep. Timothy Reeder, R-Pitt, expressed optimism that the Senate has acknowledged the issue of prior authorization in healthcare, but he also noted that the House bill includes several key provisions absent in the Senate's version, such as requirements for insurers to disclose authorization criteria, a shorter processing time, and a mandate for peer reviewers to be licensed in North Carolina. 

“There's a number of things that I'm hopeful that the Senate will consider as we debate both bills and move them forward,” said Reeder. “But I just really am happy and thankful that the Senate acknowledges that this is an issue that we need to deal with.”


						North Carolina could soon recognize November as Military Appreciation Month after the state House passed a bill unanimously on Tuesday aiming to honor those in the military.					


						With a little more than two months under his belt, North Carolina Democrat Gov. Josh Stein is in a strong honeymoon phase with approval ratings north of 50%. Stein is on par with previous governors at the beginning of their tenure, leading Cooper by five points, and trailing McCrory by one.					


						If a regulation created by officials in the executive branch is going to have significant economic impacts upward of $1 million, then the North Carolina General Assembly should have a statutory role in approving the proposed rule, said lawmakers on Tuesday. 					


						North Carolina Democrats are pushing to restore public access to General Assembly records, challenging Republican-led restrictions from 2023 that limited transparency in state government.

Concerns over healthcare funding brought dozens of protesters to the office of U.S. Senator Steve Daines in Missoula. The demonstration took place outside the Union Club, adjacent to Conflux Brewery, where activists gathered to express their worries about potential budget cuts.

MISSOULA, Mont. – Concerns over healthcare funding brought dozens of protesters to the office of U.S. Senator Steve Daines in Missoula. The demonstration took place outside the Union Club, where activists gathered to express their worries about potential budget cuts.

Protesters held signs with messages like "Save Medicaid" and "Care, Not Cuts." The protest was in response to discussions on Capitol Hill regarding possible reductions in healthcare program funding.

Celeste Thompson, a home health worker who joined the protest, shared her concerns. "My job is on the line because I do home health and Medicaid dollars pays my wages," she said. "My clients and that... they... they will lose their hours, and then that will make me lose my hours."

In response to the protest, a spokesperson for Senator Daines provided a statement. "Senator Daines supports Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. He also supports efforts to address waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs – the same stance as President Trump. Senator Daines has been in close contact with the DOGE team and believes they are doing important work identifying instances of wasteful spending, and then the appropriate agencies are able to decide what to do from there."

Protesters say they will continue to push for answers, while Senator Daines' office focuses on addressing waste in the system.

Published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, the study aimed to provide robust insights into adolescent mental health trajectories in two different cultural contexts by comparing large samples of 11 to 16 years olds in London and Tokyo over time. The two studies are the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) and the Resilience Ethnicity and AdolesCent Mental Health (REACH) cohorts from South London. Both groups collected data in the period 2014 to 2020 and at three different time points as the teenagers grew older. 

Researchers used the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) to measure depressive symptoms. 

In both groups there was a difference between teenage boys and girls in the average level of depressive symptoms and this difference widened year-on-year. In the London sample the gender difference started slightly earlier (evident by 11-12 years) than in the Tokyo sample where it emerged between 11 and 14 years, and the average rate of change in depressive symptoms per year in London girls was around four times greater than among girls in Tokyo. By the age of 16 the difference in depressive symptoms between boys and girls in London was around twice as large as in Tokyo. The average level of depressive symptoms in teenage boys in Tokyo declined between ages of 11 and 16, whereas for boys in London it increased slightly over time, following a similar trajectory to that of teenage girls in Tokyo. 

Our study suggests that from around early adolescence onwards girls have higher levels of depression than boys in both Tokyo and London, but the disparity is larger, starts a bit earlier, and increases at a faster rate in London. The trajectory for boys in London closely mirrors the trajectory for girls in Tokyo. These findings suggest we need to rethink and challenge popular narratives around gender differences in mental health – for example, the idea that girls are naturally or inevitably more likely to struggle with their emotional health – and to understand the contexts and conditions that enable teenage girls and young people to thrive."

Dr. Gemma Knowles, First Author, Lecturer in Epidemiology and Youth Mental Health at IoPPN, King's College London

Currently the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) - an index designed to measure gender equality - ranks UK 15th out of 149 countries while Japan is ranked 125th. However, insights from young co-researchers from both cities suggests there are social influences at play which are not captured in these indexes. For example, teenage girls may assume adult roles and responsibilities at a younger age in London and there are lower levels of violence and crime in Tokyo. There are also differences in socioeconomic and political trends between the two places that could contribute to differences, for example, the prolonged period of austerity in the UK. 

Dr Knowles said: "This a complex area with a multitude of possible factors that may contribute to the difference between girls and boys and between the two places. We need to better understand the social contexts and experiences that give rise to gender inequalities in mental health and the conditions that support teenage girls to thrive. It's also important to understand how these social experiences interplay with young people's physical development at this age." 

An important part of this study was to investigate the extent to which scores derived from the measure SMFQ can be meaningfully and appropriately compared across genders, ages, and contexts. While these tests are not perfect, they found no evidence of incomparable measurement, which suggests that any differences in SMFQ scores between groups are due to real differences in depressive symptoms rather than differences in reporting. 

The study was funded by the Invitation Program for Foreign Researchers at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the ESRC Centre for Society and Mental Health, the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science, and the European Research Council.

Multiple staff members at Wales' biggest hospital are understood to be under investigation after claims that strangers were allowed in to watch surgery on unaware patients. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board is probing what it called "deeply concerning" allegations over practices at University Hospital of Wales' operating theatres.

In January we revealed the health board was undertaking a "comprehensive service review" of the hospital's theatres after claims of a toxic culture, racism, bullying and drug use. At that time we reported on sources' anger that the health board had not properly investigated concerns dating back to 2021 when staff members allegedly allowed their friends and family into theatres to watch surgery with no background checks. Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here.

A spokeswoman for the health board has now told WalesOnline: "During the theatres service review and subsequent investigations, it was identified that previous concerns regarding unauthorised people in theatres had been raised but not thoroughly investigated or completed." She went on to say: "Following the deeply concerning allegations made around allowing members of the public to watch operations, the health board has launched an internal investigation." We understand this is separate to the service review.

Andrew RT Davies, MS for South Wales Central and former leader of the Welsh Tories, said the Welsh Government should intervene to make sure the "shocking" allegations were investigated independently rather than in an internal probe. In response, a Government spokesman said: “Any concern about patient safety must be taken seriously. Cardiff and Vale UHB is undertaking a review of the reported incidents. It is important this is completed and the results considered.”

Speaking about the alleged surgery spectators, one hospital source claimed: "They had no background checks and it was during Covid. The very little PPE [personal protective equipment] was being used by unnecessary people. They would have been a huge infection risk to not only staff but vulnerable patients." They also alleged that staff were told not to speak about the matter and that it was "brushed under the carpet". WalesOnline understands multiple staff members are under investigation in connection to these allegations. When asked about this the health board spokeswoman told us they could not "provide any information regarding ongoing investigations".

When the service review began last October the health board told staff it would likely take 12 to 16 weeks. But the spokeswoman has now told us the review "is taking slightly longer than the anticipated timeframe" as there have been so many comments from staff.

WalesOnline has seen an internal letter sent by the health board's chief operating officer Paul Bostock in January stating: "Over 60 people have come forward to share their experience and thoughts about working in UHW theatres and people have been very measured and very honest." He added that "the allegation about allowing the public to watch operations is of great concern".

Mr Bostock also wrote that meetings with staff had made "clear there are clearly deep-seated issues which we will address in order to make theatres an attractive place to work and which provides high quality care to our patients". He asked employees to "resist engaging in public commentary on social media but to use the correct channels for addressing concerns".

One source claimed the concerns over operations being watched had been "raised so many times" since the pandemic, adding: "It's only now being taken seriously and investigated after the WalesOnline article". In response, the health board spokeswoman said: "We take the allegations of all colleagues, and those reported in WalesOnline, extremely seriously and we are now in the process of completing the internal review and investigating all concerns raised, regardless of the historic nature of these allegations."

The service review is investigating "serious concerns" over staff turnover, leadership, and "values and behaviours". A whistleblower claimed to WalesOnline that the health board was prompted to act after a staff survey revealed widespread anger over a toxic culture that had allegedly plagued the hospital's theatres for years. They claimed that recent staff turnover had been "huge" because of alleged bullying.

We previously reported allegations that one member of staff had been suspended after saying a group of Indian nurses needed name badges as they "all looked the same". Sources claimed the staff member returned from suspension and took diversity classes but was then suspended again over further allegations of bullying and racism.

One whistleblower claimed: "The department since the start of Covid has turned into the wild west. A member of staff was caught with the drug speed in their locker, suspended, then allowed back, and is still there now. There's a big increase in 'never events' [serious, preventable safety incidents] as experienced staff have left due to the way [the theatres] are managed. There are no experienced theatre staff to teach juniors."

The health board spokeswoman said "all colleagues affected" by the service review would receive the final report and recommendations when available, adding: “We are committed to providing a positive and equitable working environment for all colleagues. As part of our Speaking Up Safely process, we encourage all colleagues to speak up and raise any concerns they have with the confidence that their voices will be heard and suggestions acted upon.”

She continued: "There are occasions when members of the public have viewed operations, instances include, filming for Saving Lives in Cardiff and for media packages, but we would like to reassure colleagues, patients and their families that these are subject to strict policies and protocols that are adhered to at all times, especially in relation to patient consent."

University Hospital of Wales, in the Heath area of Cardiff, contains 12 theatres. The theatres department cares for children and adults undergoing surgery. Its work includes surgery and anaesthesia for emergencies, trauma and orthopaedics.</p>

ATLANTA, March  19, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rimidi, a market-leading digital health company that supports healthcare providers in the delivery of remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management with EHR-integrated software, services, and connected devices, has introduced Rimidi 2.0, a next-generation platform enhancement designed to address the increasing complexity of healthcare delivery. 

While Rimidi's platform already enables clients to configure alerts, risk scores, and triage statuses to align with their specific protocols, care team structures, and clinical priorities — such as Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM) — Rimidi 2.0 takes these capabilities even further. With enhanced scalability, strengthened data security, expanded device integration, and a flexible framework designed for the rapid adoption of emerging technologies like AI, the upgraded platform provides both clinical and IT teams with a future-ready solution to optimize patient care, streamline workflows, and improve operational efficiency.

“Virtual care is evolving faster than ever, and healthcare organizations face mounting pressure to meet new demands while delivering excellent patient care,” said Lucienne Ide, MD, PhD, Founder and CEO of Rimidi. “Rimidi 2.0 supports today's needs and is designed to scale as the industry changes. This ensures providers can stay agile with expanding payment models, new workflows, and the rapid adoption of connected health devices.”

As the demand for more flexible and feature-rich healthcare platforms grows, Rimidi 2.0 meets the challenge by improving adaptability, cybersecurity, and overall performance. It is built on a microservices framework, a software architecture model that makes it easy to expand and enhance the platform over time. Instead of operating as a large static system, the platform is divided into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function. This means growing healthcare organizations can add capabilities quickly and efficiently without disrupting existing workflows — allowing them to get more value from their technology investments.

“The new framework is cleaner and more dynamic, allowing for rapid integration or adoption of emerging capabilities – whether that's AI, new advanced sensors or medical devices, or new policies surrounding reimbursable care models,” said Catriona Tarto, Vice President of Technology at Rimidi.

In addition to scalability, the upgraded platform supports several key pillars of healthcare, including:

Seamless Integration and Data Standardization with Connected Health Technologies





Enhanced Clinical Trial Support for Chronic Disease Research





Optimized Financial Sustainability through Reimbursable Care Models





With Rimidi 2.0, providers gain a more efficient, integrated, and future-proof solution designed to simplify workflows, enhance clinical decision-making, and improve care quality. The new version's launch underscores Rimidi's mission to equip healthcare organizations with the tools needed to thrive in a rapidly transforming industry. 



About Rimidi

Created by doctors, for doctors, Rimidi is a digital health company that supports healthcare providers in the delivery of remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management with EHR-integrated software, services, and connected devices. By combining clinical data from the EHR with data from connected devices and patient surveys, Rimidi presents a complete picture of the patient and supports care delivery across the continuum from the clinic to the home to allow for proactive, guideline-based management and prioritization of highest-need patients.

As Saskatchewan awaits details of the 2025-26 provincial budget, the state of health care in the province is front of mind for many.

The government will “continue to deliver better access to health care and deliver on our commitment to increase the number of surgeries performed annually to reduce wait times,” Premier Scott Moe said in a social media post Monday.

His post went on to say that his government will “build on investments,” like the $15-million recently announced for the expansion, renovation and equipment upgrades at Saskatoon's City Hospital, and shorten surgical wait times “by ensuring 450,000 surgeries are performed over the next four years.”

But the Opposition has its doubts.

Saskatchewan has “fallen to the back of the pack” when it comes to health care, the NDP said in a news release issued Tuesday.

Saskatchewan to unveil first budget since class-complexity ruling

Saskatchewan's 2025-26 budget: Municipal revenue sharing to see an increase

“We need more doctors, nurses, and frontline health care workers — but instead of fixing the crisis, the Sask. Party is driving workers out and expanding the bureaucracy,” said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat in the release.

And the Opposition's critic for the status of women took issue with the fact that some Saskatchewan patients have had to go out of province for breast cancer screening.

“It shouldn't be too much to ask for a mammogram close to home,” Brittney Senger said in the release.

In late 2023, former health minister Everett Hindley said out-of-province mammogram referrals to a clinic in Calgary was a short term solution to cut down on surgical wait times. In February, the government renewed its contract with that clinic to continue referrals until March 31, 2026.

The province also announced multiple initiatives in 2024 relating to breast cancer care and screening, including a new Breast Health Centre in Regina, which is slated to open in spring 2025.

The 2024-25 budget allocated some $7.6-billion toward health. When released in March 2024, the government said that budget was intended to “stabilize” the health sector. But despite ongoing work through the province's Health Human Resources Action Plan (meant to recruit and retain health-care workers) and capacity pressure action plans put in place in Regina and Saskatoon, health-care unions have continued to ring alarm bells over staffing shortages, high patient numbers and overflowing emergency rooms.

The 2025-26 budget will be unveiled Wednesday afternoon.

GE HealthCare has announced the launch of the AltiX AI.i edition of its Mac-Lab, CardioLab and ComboLab cath lab and electrophysiology (EP) lab systems.

The AltiX AI.i editions are designed to improve the user experience, elevating workflow in the cardiac cath lab and supporting even the most complex EP procedures. These latest editions offer new features that can streamline workflow and enhance interoperability, while upholding strong cybersecurity standards, the company says in a press release.

“AltiX AI.i is built on more than two decades of experience, leadership and innovation in invasive cardiology to enhance cath labs and EP procedures and empower clinicians to deliver the best possible outcomes,” said Jyoti Gera, CEO, CardioVascular & Interventional Solutions, GE HealthCare. “By automating routine tasks and streamlining workflow, AltiX AI.i allows clinicians to focus on what truly matters—providing exceptional patient care.”

The AltiX AI.i edition of the Mac-Lab recording system integrates diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) algorithm and builds on its ability to capture diastolic hyperemia-free ratio (DFR) measurements. These measurements are used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease.

Operational efficiency relies on understanding the right data. Failing to ensure your healthcare practice is monitoring the correct data means that inefficiencies can go unnoticed, driving provider burnout, staff overload, patient dissatisfaction, and missed opportunities for growth.

A healthcare practice's contact center plays a crucial role to ensure that improvements translate into a frictionless patient experience. For example, the rate at which waitlisted patients are successfully scheduled into newly available appointment slots can mean the difference between wasted opportunities for both providers and patients, and ensuring that provider time isn't wasted and patients receive timely care.

A new report from Relatient offers a checklist designed to help healthcare organizations optimize their performance.

“Patients expect more control and convenience throughout their healthcare experiences,” observed Relatient Chief Product Officer David Dyke in the report. “Empowering them with easy-to-use self-scheduling demonstrates a deep understanding of patient perspective early in the care journey, laying the groundwork for high patient satisfaction and optimal practice efficiency by reducing back-and-forth of appointment management for which healthcare is sadly famous for.”
