Neuropsychiatric considerations

Future research and clinical implications

Conclusion

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were initially developed to regulate blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their therapeutic effects extend beyond glycemic control, particularly in weight management and metabolic disorders. Recently, GLP-1 RAs have gained prominence for their role in weight loss, leading to their approval for obesity treatment.1

Beyond diabetes and obesity, GLP-1 RAs exhibit a broad spectrum of physiological effects that significantly impact women's health. These include cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, and metabolic regulation, which can influence conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and osteoporosis.

Emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs modulate hormonal balance, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways, offering potential therapeutic benefits in reproductive health and menopause-related metabolic changes. Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have shown promise in reducing cancer risk, particularly in hormone-related malignancies such as breast and ovarian cancer.1

This article explores the unexpected effects of GLP-1 RAs on women’s health, highlighting their impact on metabolic, reproductive, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric health while identifying gaps in research and future clinical implications.

Metabolic and hormonal effects

GLP-1 RAs have emerged as promising therapeutic agents in managing metabolic and hormonal disturbances in PCOS. Originally developed for T2D, these agents enhance insulin sensitivity by reducing insulin resistance, as demonstrated by significant declines in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores.

Improved insulin sensitivity is closely linked to favorable changes in body composition, such as decreased BMI and waist circumference, which are critical for PCOS patients who often present with obesity.2

Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have been shown to modulate the hormonal milieu in PCOS. They contribute to a mild reduction in androgen levels, evidenced by decreases in total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), while simultaneously increasing sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. These shifts help to restore a more balanced hormonal profile, potentially mitigating the hyperandrogenism that underlies many PCOS symptoms.2

In addition to metabolic and androgen improvements, GLP-1 RAs appear to influence menstrual cyclicity positively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity and direct effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis may promote more regular ovulatory cycles and improved fertility outcomes.2

Reproductive health

GLP-1RAs have demonstrated benefits in restoring ovulation, particularly in women with PCOS, by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels. However, their impact on endometrial receptivity and implantation remains unclear.2,3

GLP-1RAs influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, enhancing gonadotropin secretion and improving ovarian function. While this supports fertility, concerns persist about their effects on early pregnancy.

Limited data suggest GLP-1RAs may alter endometrial receptivity, potentially affecting implantation success rates. Animal studies indicate GLP-1RA treatment improves ovarian morphology in PCOS models, but human data are sparse.2,3

During pregnancy, GLP-1RAs may impact fetal development due to their metabolic effects. Current guidelines advise discontinuation before conception due to unknown teratogenic risks. Furthermore, their influence on placental function and fetal growth requires further investigation.3

Overall, GLP-1RAs offer promise in reproductive medicine, particularly for obesity-related infertility. However, their safety and efficacy in pregnancy require more research to determine optimal use in fertility treatments and assisted reproduction technologies (ART).3

Who Should Take Weight Loss Injections, and Who Shouldn’t?

Bone and cardiovascular health

GLP-1RAs influence bone metabolism by promoting bone formation and reducing resorption, potentially mitigating osteoporosis risk. However, some studies indicate an increased risk of fractures, possibly due to weight loss-associated reductions in bone mineral density (BMD).4

Postmenopausal women, already at heightened risk for osteoporosis, may benefit from GLP-1RAs’ anabolic effects on bone, yet data on long-term fracture risk remain inconclusive.

The cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs are well-established, with clinical trials demonstrating reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), improved endothelial function, and lower blood pressure. These benefits are particularly relevant for women who often present with atypical cardiovascular symptoms and higher heart failure risk.4,5

Despite these advantages, concerns about potential adverse effects, including gastrointestinal intolerance and possible cardiovascular adaptations that may influence bone health, warrant further investigation.

A personalized approach considering individual bone and cardiovascular risk profiles is essential when prescribing GLP-1RAs to women, particularly those with osteoporosis or high cardiovascular risk.4,5

Role of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for Weight Loss Play

Neuropsychiatric considerations

Emerging reports indicate potential neuropsychiatric effects of GLP-1RAs, including mood changes, appetite suppression, and cognitive function implications. Patients have reported both positive and negative mood alterations.

Some individuals experience improved well-being, reduced anxiety, and better emotional stability, potentially linked to weight loss and metabolic improvements. Conversely, others report increased depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has begun monitoring these concerns.6

GLP-1RAs significantly reduce appetite, which may help control compulsive eating behaviors. Notably, some users report a reduction in cravings for not just food but also substances like alcohol and nicotine, suggesting a potential role in managing addictive behaviors.6

Preliminary evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs may influence cognitive function by modulating neurotransmitters and inflammation. Some users report clearer thinking and improved focus, while others experience brain fog or fatigue, potentially linked to hypoglycemia.

While GLP-1RAs offer substantial benefits, their psychological impact requires further investigation to ensure long-term safety.6

Are GLP-1 Drugs the Future of Alcohol Addiction Treatment?

Future research and clinical implications

Current studies focus on short-term efficacy, but gaps persist regarding the impact on reproductive health, hormonal balance, and bone density over prolonged use. Ongoing research aims to assess GLP-1 RAs’ influence on menstrual irregularities, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes.

Given their appetite-suppressing properties, concerns arise about potential nutritional deficiencies and their consequences on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, their effects on postmenopausal women, especially regarding osteoporosis risk, warrant further investigation.7

The metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs are evident, yet sex-specific responses remain unclear. Women’s hormonal fluctuations may alter drug efficacy and side effect profiles, necessitating gender-stratified trials. Furthermore, the psychosocial impact, particularly in those with eating disorders, requires careful evaluation.7

Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to determine safety and effectiveness in diverse female populations.

Tailored dosing and monitoring guidelines must be developed to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring that GLP-1 RAs serve as a safe and effective intervention for women’s metabolic health.7

Conclusion

Current evidence supports the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in managing T2DM and obesity, with additional benefits for cardiovascular and renal health. However, specific considerations are necessary for women, including reproductive health, pregnancy, and long-term metabolic outcomes.

While GLP-1 medications show promising weight loss effects and glycemic control, their safety in pregnancy remains uncertain, necessitating alternative therapeutic approaches for women of childbearing age.

Emerging research focuses on optimizing GLP-1 therapies through combination treatments, novel oral formulations, and personalized medicine approaches. Investigations into sex-specific metabolic responses, hormonal influences, and potential long-term adverse effects are crucial for refining treatment guidelines. Moreover, research into GLP-1’s impact on PCOS, menopausal metabolic shifts, and osteoporosis risk is gaining attention.

Clinicians should adopt an individualized approach, considering patient-specific factors such as age, reproductive plans, comorbidities, and tolerance. Ongoing trials and real-world data will further shape best practices, ensuring the safe and effective use of GLP-1 medications in women.

Collaborative, interprofessional care remains essential in maximizing benefits while mitigating risks associated with this drug class.

                <p>Mindfulness, total sleep quality, and alcohol consumption may help explain why people who stay up late have a greater risk of depression, according to a new study publishing March 19, 2025, in the open-access journal PLOS One by Simon Evans of University of Surrey, UK, and colleagues.

Previous research has shown that night owls who stay up late, called "evening chronotypes," have more depression symptoms than people who are early risers, or "morning chronotypes." In the new study, Evans and colleagues collected data from 546 university students using an online questionnaire. The data included self-reported information on the students' sleep patterns, mindfulness, rumination tendencies, alcohol use, and depression and anxiety levels.

The study confirmed that people with an evening chronotype were at a notably higher risk for depression and that the association could be explained by differences in mindfulness, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption. On average, evening chronotypes had poorer sleep quality, higher alcohol consumption, and acted with less mindfulness than morning chronotypes.

The study was limited in its ability to prove cause-and-effect because of its cross-sectional design which relied on data at only one time point. In addition, the findings may not apply to age groups outside of the university students included in the study.

With those caveats in mind, the authors conclude that interventions aimed at mindfulness, sleep and alcohol use might have the potential to reduce depression risk, amongst young adults in particular.

The authors add: "With many young adults' experiencing poor mental health, these study findings are particularly important many young adults tend to stay up late and the results point to how interventions could be implemented to reduce their risk of depression."</p></b>

                <p>Researchers and pediatric neurosurgeons at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh developed a new way to profile brain cancers in children, paving the way for improved diagnostics and treatments.

Today in Science Translational Medicine, researchers describe a diagnostic platform that could classify brain tumors based on the body's cancer-fighting immune response. This approach, which is complementary to traditional microscopic and genetic cancer cell analyses, establishes an opportunity to tailor cancer therapies to each patient's unique immune response and harness the success of immunotherapies that revolutionized the treatment of childhood leukemias.

Understanding how the repertoire of immune cells fits with the diverse landscape of brain cancer types can help us find new therapies in the future." Itay Raphael, Ph.D., lead author, research assistant professor of neurological surgery at Pitt

Brain cancer is the second most common cancer in children after leukemia, and it is also the deadliest. This is due to a constellation of factors: Brain tumors are diverse, resistant to treatments and often hard to access surgically. On the other hand, the sharp reduction of deaths from leukemia over the recent decades is due in part to the enormous success of immune-based therapies, which harness the body's intrinsic protective mechanisms by expanding the pool of cancer-fighting white blood cells called T cells.

T cells are precisely tuned to recognize molecules on the surface of cancer cells – called antigens – and use them as signals to attack and clear out tumor cells while leaving healthy cells intact. When T cells find a target on the tumor cell surface, they become activated and start rapidly doubling their numbers in a process called clonal expansion, aimed to clear the cancer.

Because of how varied brain tumors and their antigens are, understanding the tumor's molecular composition can help clinicians personalize each patient's treatment. Similarly, the new study's complementary approach can help pinpoint the best treatment option by identifying which T cell-surface receptors are most abundant in the environment surrounding the tumor.

"The success of T cell-based therapies for non-brain tumors, including childhood leukemias, suggests tremendous potential for brain cancers," said senior author Gary Kohanbash, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurological surgery at Pitt. "Having access to an unprecedented dataset of pediatric tumors and new bioinformatic tools allowed us to investigate how T cell immune response and clonal expansion could be used as markers for treatment classification and prognosis independent of other diagnostic tools."

As part of the study, the researchers profiled nearly 1,000 pediatric brain tumor samples, which were collected through the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN), a medical research consortium of 35 medical centers across the nation and globally. The study was first to look at the T cell clonal repertoire and expansion in this sample group.

The group observed that very aggressive tumor types are associated with less T cell expansion than less aggressive ones, suggesting that clonality can inform patient outcomes across tumor types. On the other hand, studying T cell response can shed light on which antigens on the surface of cancer cells can be exploited therapeutically, offering avenues for development of cancer-antigen peptide immunotherapy.

"Ultimately, we hope for a future where clonal T cell expansion is incorporated into pediatric cancer diagnosis," said co-author Ian Pollack, M.D., distinguished professor of neurological surgery at Pitt, and a founding institutional principal investigator of CBTN. "UPMC Children's Hospital is committed to supporting brain tumor research and developing new life-saving treatments, and we think that this landmark study represents a foundational shift to how the field will be considering pediatric tumors in the future."

                <p>A team at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) led by Dr. Andrés Hidalgo has discovered a specialized population of neutrophils in the skin that produce extracellular matrix, helping to maintain the skin's resistance and integrity. The study, published in Nature, demonstrates that the immune system not only targets pathogens, but also physically strengthens the skin to prevent them entering the body.

Neutrophils are an important type of circulating immune cell. The specialized neutrophils described in the new study populate the skin, where they produce collagen and other matrix proteins that strengthen the skin barrier. The discovery broadens understanding of the immune system and may lead to new strategies for treating skin diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and age-related conditions.

Although neutrophils are best known for their microbicidal properties, the new study reveals an unexpected role for these cells in the generation and remodeling of the subepidermal extracellular matrix.

The extracellular matrix is critical for maintaining the structure and function of the skin and other tissues, acting as a barrier to the entry of microorganisms and toxins." Dr. Andrés Hidalgo

First author Tommaso Vicanolo adds that the study, "demonstrates that these neutrophils help to maintain skin integrity under normal conditions and are activated in response to injury to generate protective structures around wounds that prevent the entry of bacteria and toxins."

The study further shows that this structural function of skin neutrophils is regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway. By genetically deleting this pathway in mice, the authors showed that the deposition of extracellular matrix was diminished, resulting in skin that was more fragile and permeable. Hidalgo notes that, "This suggests that the interaction between the immune system and the body's structural components is much more direct than previously believed."

Another fascinating result emerging from the study is that the activity of these skin neutrophils follows a day-night pattern, adjusting the production of extracellular matrix according to the body's circadian cycle. As a result, the skin of mice is more resistant at night than during the day, thanks to the nocturnal peak in neutrophil activity. Hidalgo underlines that, "This finding opens new avenues for investigating how internal body rhythms influence tissue defence, regeneration and repair."

For Hidalgo, now at Yale University School of Medicine, the discovery of matrix-producing neutrophils not only broadens knowledge about innate immunity, but also suggests new treatment strategies for skin diseases and immunological disorders. He explains, "These findings will help develop treatments to strengthen the skin barrier in patients with inflammatory diseases or immunological alterations, including patients with diabetes and older adults."

The authors conclude that this advance-the fruit of collaboration between various CNIC groups and laboratories in Germany, the United States, Singapore, and China, "signals a change in the way we view the immune system's protective role in the body."

Dr. Hidalgo is currently investigating the possible implications of the study findings for fibrotic processes and cancer.

The study was supported by funding from Fundación "la Caixa", the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

The CNIC is an affiliate center of the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), an executive agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities. Directed by Dr. Valentín Fuster, the CNIC is dedicated to cardiovascular research and the translation of the knowledge gained into real benefits for patients. The CNIC has been recognized by the Spanish government as a Severo Ochoa center of excellence (award CEX2020-001041-S, funded by MICIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

                <p>By revealing for the first time what happens in the brain when an animal makes a mistake, Johns Hopkins University researchers are shedding light on the holy grail of neuroscience: the mechanics of how we learn.

The team pinpointed the exact moment mice learned a new skill by observing the activity of individual neurons, confirming earlier work that suggested animals are fast learners that purposely test the boundaries of new knowledge.

The federally funded work, which upends assumptions about the speed of learning and the role of the sensory cortex, and which the researchers believe will hold true across animal species including humans, is newly published in Nature.

"Looking at a tiny part of the brain in a mouse, we can understand how the brain learns, and we can makes predictions about how the human brain might work," said Kishore Kuchibhotla, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist who studies learning in humans and animals. "The field of neuroscience has made great progress decoding motor activity and how the brain processes sight and sound. But a holy grail of this type of research is thought-what comes between the hearing and the doing-we're all still trying to understand the patterns of brain activity that underly higher-order cognitive processes. These findings are a step in that direction."

Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. It typically takes mice, for instance, thousands of tries to learn a task, several hundred at best.

Kuchibhotla's lab previously found that animals' performance doesn't necessarily sync with their knowledge-or that animals might know a lot more than they demonstrate in tests. The lab also found that animals that seem to be slow learners might be testing their new knowledge. But by merely watching animals struggle at tasks, they couldn't tell a slow learner from a strategic tester of boundaries.

We are interested in the idea that humans and other animals may know things about the world, things that they choose not to show. Our core question is what is the neural basis of this distinction between learning and performance." Kishore Kuchibhotla, Johns Hopkins neuroscientist

The researchers taught mice to lick when they heard one tone but not to lick when they heard a different sound. From the moment training began, the team recorded the activity of neurons in the auditory cortex, an area of the brain associated with hearing and perception.

There were two major surprises. First, the mice learned in 20 to 40 tries, "extraordinarily fast," according to Kuchibhotla. And second, this learning activity happened in the sensory cortex, something that has typically been associated with nonsensory brain areas.

"This work illustrates the importance of assessing how brain activity impacts behavior at different stages of the learning process and in different conditions," said first author Celine Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow studying neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. "Our results show that a sensory cortex does more than processing sensory inputs; it is also crucial to form associations between sensory cues and reinforced actions."

When the mice continued to make errors, licking at the wrong times long after their neural activity showed they'd learned the task, their brain activity confirmed to the researchers that the mice knew the rules of the game-they were just experimenting.

'We were able to decode the cognitive driver of an error," Kuchibhotla said. "We could tell if the animal was making a mistake or just wanted to give the other option a shot."

Once the mice had mastered the task and ceased their exploratory behavior, this higher-order activity started to diminish, and the sensory cortex was no longer involved in the task.

"We think this means that animals are smarter than we think, and that there are distinct brain dynamics related to learning. You might know something, but there's a parallel process related to how you use it. The brain seems wired to do that well, to allow us to toggle between performance and learning as we get better and better at something."</p></b>

                <p>To uncover what drives sexual behavior in animals, researchers studied the brain activity of male mice throughout the series of actions involved in sex leading up to ejaculation. Their results, publishing in the Cell Press journal Neuron on March 19, show that the intricate dance in the brain area responsible for pleasure between two chemicals-dopamine and acetylcholine-controls the progression of sexual behavior. These findings could inspire treatments for disorders like premature ejaculation.

Sexual behavior is a complex sequence of events. The study revealed the dynamics of how different chemicals work together in the brain to regulate the transitions through different stages of male sexual behavior." Qinghua Liu, senior author of the National Institute of Biological Sciences in Beijing

Previous studies of male sexual behavior focused on the initiation of sexual behavior. What exactly happens in the brain during other phases of sex remained unknown, from mounting and intromission-the insertion of the penis into the vagina-to ejaculation.

The nucleus accumbens, a brain region that plays a role in reward, responds to dopamine-a chemical often associated with pleasure. To deepen this knowledge, the team injected florescent sensors that can detect neurotransmitters, the brain's chemical messengers, into the nucleus accumbens of male mice. An optic fiber would light up if the brain released dopamine and acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter known to regulate dopamine.

The researchers found that mouse brains started to release acetylcholine rhythmically prior to the mounting. About six seconds after acetylcholine release began, the brain also began releasing dopamine. During intromission, the release of acetylcholine and dopamine fluctuated rhythmically in time with the mouse's thrusting movements. For the mice that reached ejaculation, the dopamine release then slowed down significantly before quickly rising during the transition from intromission to ejaculation.

"We are able to look at these events at a very fine time resolution to understand how neurotransmitters interact with each other," says first author Ai Miyasaka, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tsukuba in Japan.

The researchers also found that the concentration of dopamine played an important role. During intromission, the nerve cells expressing two major dopamine receptors, D2R and D1R, were less active than usual. If the researcher artificially activated D1R cells during intromission, the mice would immediately revert back to the mounting stage. If D2R nerve cells were activated, the mice stopped engaging in sexual activity altogether.

"We uncovered the precise dopamine signaling mechanism that helps ensure that sexual behavior follows the correct sequence," Liu says.

While mice and humans have different sexual behaviors, the brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in sexual function might be similar, note the authors. They suggest that this research could provide new clues to treating sexual dysfunction, particularly premature ejaculation, which affects 20% to 30% of sexually active men.

"Now we have a precise understanding of how dopamine works during sex and ejaculation," Miyasaka says, "so I believe our study has opened the door to the development of clinical treatments."</p></b>

                <p>For the first time, scientists have witnessed the very moment DNA begins to unravel, revealing a necessary molecular event for DNA to be the molecule that codes all life. A new study from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), published in Nature, captures the moment DNA begins to unwind, allowing for all the events that follow in DNA replication. This direct observation sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that allow cells to faithfully duplicate their genetic material, a cornerstone for growth and reproduction.

Using cryo-electron microscopy and deep learning to observe the helicase Simian Virus 40 Large Tumor Antigen interacting with DNA, the laboratories of KAUST Assistant Professor Alfredo De Biasio and Professor Samir Hamdan provide the most detailed description yet of the very first steps of DNA replication: 15 atomic states that describe how the enzyme helicase forces the unwinding of DNA. The achievement is not only a milestone in helicase research, but also a milestone in observing the dynamics of any enzyme at atomic resolution.

While scientists have long known the importance of helicase in DNA replication, "they did not know how DNA, helicases and ATP work together in a coordinated cycle to drive DNA unwinding," De Biasio said.

When Watson and Crick reported the double helix in 1953, they gave the scientific community a breakthrough understanding of how genetic information is stored and copied. For DNA to replicate, the helix must first unwind and break the DNA from a double strand into two single strands.

Upon binding, helicases melt the DNA, breaking the chemicals bonds holding the double helix together. They then pull the two strands apart, allowing other enzymes to complete the replication. Without this first step, no DNA can be replicated. In this way, helicases are machines or, because of their size, nanomachines.

If helicases are nanomachines, then 'ATP', or adenosine trisphosphate, is the fuel. Much like how burning gas drives the pistons of a car engine, burning ATP, the same fuel used to flex your muscles, causes the six pistons of a helicase to unwind DNA. The study found that as ATP is consumed, it reduces physical constraints that allow the helicase to proceed along the DNA, unwinding more and more of the double strand. Thus, ATP consumption acts a switch that increases the amount of entropy – or disorder – in the system, freeing the helicase to move along the DNA.

The helicase uses ATP not to pry DNA apart in one motion, but to cycle through conformational changes that progressively destabilize and separate the strands. ATP burning, or hydrolysis, functions like the spring in a mouse trap, snapping the helicase forward and pulling the DNA strands apart." Alfredo De Biasio, KAUST Assistant Professor

Among the many discoveries made by the KAUST scientists was that two helicases melt the DNA at two sites at the same time to initiate the unwinding. The chemistry of DNA is such that nanomachines move along a single DNA strand in one direction only. By binding at two sites simultaneously, the helicases coordinate so that the winding can happen in both directions with an energy efficiency unique to natural nanomachines.

That efficiency, explains De Biasio, makes the study of DNA replication more than an attempt to answer the most fundamental scientific questions about life, it also makes helicases models for the design of new nanotechnology.

"From a design perspective, helicases exemplify energy-efficient mechanical systems. Engineered nanomachines using entropy switches could harness similar energy-efficient mechanisms to perform complex, force-driven tasks," he said.</p></b>

                <p>For the first time, scientists have systematically analyzed somatic mutations in stomach lining tissue to unpick mutational processes, some of which can lead to cancer. The team also uncovered hints of a potential new cause of stomach cancer that needs further research.

Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the University of Hong Kong, and their collaborators sequenced the whole genomes of normal stomach lining samples from people with and without gastric cancer.

The team found that despite regular exposure to the acidic contents of the stomach, the gastric lining is protected from any toxic effects. They discovered that cells with 'driver' mutations in cancer genes occupy almost 10 per cent of the gastric lining by age 60. Plus an unusual discovery that some individuals, but not all, had mutations resulting in three copies of certain chromosomes, hinting towards exposure to an unknown mutagen.

The results, published today (19 March) in Nature, add to a map of mutations in normal tissue from the gastrointestinal tract. This work enables researchers to explore fundamental mutational processes and compare mutation rates across the body, and further understanding of the earliest stages of cancer development.

Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly one million new cases in 2022.1 It is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,2 with the highest number of cases in East Asia and South America.

Factors that increase the risk of developing stomach cancer include being overweight, smoking and infection with the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which can trigger inflammation and stomach ulcers. H. pylori infection causes around 40 per cent of stomach cancers in the UK.3

The stomach contents are acidic, as it acts as a reservoir at the first stage of processing food for digestion. The layer of cells that line the stomach – the gastric epithelium – form gastric glands, or pits, and these contain the cells that can give rise to stomach cancer.

The cells in our body acquire genetic changes, known as somatic mutations, throughout our lifetime. With new DNA sequencing technologies, researchers can now analyse these mutations in normal tissues and trace them back over time, providing insights into ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development.

In a new study, Sanger Institute researchers and their collaborators set out to investigate somatic mutations within the gastric epithelium to explore the transition between normal age-related mutations, and those that go on to form stomach cancer.

The team sequenced the whole genomes of 238 samples of normal, non-cancerous gastric gland tissue from the stomachs of 30 people from Hong Kong, the United States and the UK, of whom 18 had gastric cancer and 12 did not.4 With laser capture microdissection, they used a laser to precisely dissect individual cells, or glands, from the stomach lining samples for genome sequencing.

The researchers found that despite regular exposure to the acidic contents of the stomach, mutations in normal gastric glands were generated at a similar rate to most cells of the body. This suggests the cells in the gastric epithelium are protected against any toxic effects of the acidic stomach contents.

However, in people with gastric cancer, some of the glands from the normal, non-cancerous stomach lining showed changes under the microscope that resembled the early stages of transitioning to cancer. These normal glands had increased numbers of mutations, which may have contributed to initiating gastric cancer. In the cancerous tissue, numbers of mutations were much higher, showing that gastric cancers massively accelerate mutations later during their development.

An unusual finding was that some of the stomach lining cells carried three copies of certain chromosomes – chromosomes 13, 18 and 20 – known as trisomy. This has not been seen in other tissues in previous studies, suggesting it is unique to the stomach. Trisomies were found multiple times in some of the individuals, but not present in others. This implies these individuals may have been exposed to an unknown, external mutagen.

The team also found that 'driver' mutations5 in cancer genes, many of which are known to be mutated in gastric cancer, occupy almost 10 per cent of the stomach lining by age 60. This proportion increases when patients experience severe chronic inflammation, a known risk factor for gastric cancer. Therefore this provides a question for further research into the mechanism by which chronic inflammation increases the risk of gastric cancer.

Dr Tim Coorens, first author previously at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and now at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said: "By studying somatic mutations in normal tissues, which we acquire over our lifetimes, we can explore the earliest stages of cancer development. We found that despite constant exposure to acidic stomach contents, the stomach lining is protected. However in those with gastric cancer, we see higher numbers of mutations in normal cells, resembling the earliest stages of stomach cancer. This research adds to a mutation map of the gastrointestinal tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and colon, to compare mutation rates and mutational processes across the body."

We discovered an unusual phenomenon, where some individuals had three copies of certain chromosomes – known as trisomy – whereas others did not. We've not seen this in any other tissue, and it hints towards an unknown, external mutagen that only some of these people may have been exposed to." Professor Suet Yi Leung, co-lead author at the University of Hong Kong

Professor Sir Mike Stratton, co-lead author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Ten years ago, we knew very little about the fundamental processes of mutations that are occurring in our bodies. Now with advanced genome sequencing technologies, we can investigate somatic mutations in all cell types, across various normal tissues. This enables us to look back at the evolution of our cells over a lifetime, to understand the key mutational processes that can lead to cancer. At the Sanger Institute we are leading the way in investigating the causes and consequences of somatic mutations, and exploring the possibility that somatic mutations may also contribute to diseases other than cancer."</p></b>

                <p>A vaccine's ability to generate long-lasting, high-affinity antibodies hinges on a delicate balance. Upon exposure to a vaccine or pathogen, B cells scramble to refine their defenses, rapidly mutating in hopes of generating the most effective antibodies. But each round of this process is a roll of the genetic dice-every mutation has the potential to improve affinity; far more often, however, it degrades or destroys a functional antibody. How do high-affinity B cells ever beat the odds?

New research now suggests that B cells avoid gambling away good mutations by strategically banking successful ones. As described in Nature, successful high-affinity B cells can proliferate under special conditions that reduce risk of mutation. Capturing this mechanism in the lab may lead to more efficient vaccine strategies in the clinic.

Our work shows how high-affinity B cells can bank really advantageous mutations by essentially cloning themselves rather than continuing to mutate. Perhaps we will soon be able to tailor vaccines to tip the scales either toward mutation or cloning." Julia Merkenschlager, first author, visiting assistant professor in Michel C. Nussenzweig's Laboratory of Molecular Immunology at Rockefeller and member of the faculty of immunology at Harvard Medical School

The downsides of evolution

Vaccines and infections alike lead to the construction of germinal centers, specialized immune structures where B cells mutate and mature. Germinal centers rapidly introduce mutations into an otherwise average army of B cells. But since mutagenesis is random, the probability of B cells acquiring worthless or deleterious mutations far outweighs the chance they'll acquire mutations that enhance their affinity for an antigen.

As a consequence, high-affinity B cell lineages should frequently degrade. Yet studies have repeatedly shown that germinal centers produce high-affinity antibodies with remarkable efficiency. The existing model suggested, improbably, that B cells essentially win the lottery again and again, even while risking everything on the next ticket. "If we're imagining that antibodies get better over time through a process like Darwinian evolution, there should be negative consequences too," Merkenschlager says. "But that math doesn't add up."

Gambling shouldn't pay off so consistently. Unless the game is rigged. The team suspected that the system had a safeguard-some way for high-affinity B cells to pause mutating and hold onto their best traits. The question was how that safeguard worked.

In vaccine development, the ability to tailor the body's immune response to a particular pathogen would be a game changer. If scientists could figure out how the immune system shifts from randomly generating antibodies to stabilizing its best ones, that knowledge could be harnessed to create vaccines that extend the "gambling" phase-mutating repeatedly to generate highly evolved antibodies for difficult targets, such as HIV-or accelerate to the "banking" phase to preserve effective antibodies.

Different strategies for different outcomes

The team started by mapping B cell lineages with single-cell RNA sequencing, to determine whether various populations of B cells were, in fact, mutating. They soon discovered that high-affinity B cells were somehow dividing more, but mutating less per division.

Flow cytometry then revealed that high-affinity B cells had elevated levels of a key transcription factor that indicates when T cells are helping B cells more than usual. This extra support allows high-affinity B cells to move quickly through the cell cycle and spend less time in the G0/G1 phase where hypermutation occurs. Meanwhile, B cells that have yet to win the jackpot continue to roll the dice with drawn-out G0/G1 phases and baseline assistance from T cells.

The findings were confirmed in mouse immunization studies involving model antigens as well as exposure to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

"We learned that there are two mechanisms: diversify and clone," Merkenschlager says. "Weaker B cells can diversify, with extended hypermutation. Higher-affinity B cells can clone, copying those traits so they can proliferate without fear of deleterious mutations."

Both findings may have significant implications for vaccine design. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV, for instance, require extensive hypermutations to have any hope of latching onto that elusive virus, which constantly mutates and hides key targets under a sugar-coated shield. An ideal HIV vaccine would therefore extend the mutational phase before allowing clonal expansion, ensuring that only B cells with the most refined antibodies win out-a strategy that has, until now, been out of reach. But first, the team will focus on validating the findings in humans and determining whether vaccine adjuvants or other strategies can tilt the balance between gambling and banking.

"Now that we have an idea of how to control what a cell will bank versus what it will gamble, we can begin to think about how to design a more effective HIV vaccine," Merkenschlager says.</p></b>

                <p>Germinal centers are high-speed evolution machines. Tiny clusters in the lymph nodes, germinal centers refine antibodies through mutation and expansion until they produce high-affinity B cells adapted to keep different pathogens in check. But rapid evolution should come at a cost. Most mutations are deleterious, so constant mutation during every cell division, coupled with unchecked proliferation, should be a recipe for disaster. How B cells somehow rapidly mutate and improve all at once was a long-standing mystery.

Now, advanced imaging techniques reveal the germinal center's secret weapon: the ability to suppress mutation during rapid proliferation. This built-in safeguard allows germinal centers to mass-produce successful clones without compromising antibody quality. The findings, published in Nature, solve the paradox of how the immune system balances speed and precision.

The germinal center is using a really smart strategy to do two things at once-two things that are, at face value, incompatible." Gabriel D. Victora, Head of the Laboratory of Lymphocyte Dynamics

Mutate-and-check

Since the early 1990s, scientists have known that B cell evolution is unusual. Mathematical modeling from that era suggested that germinal centers improve antibodies by alternating between mutation and selection-mutations occur once every division cycle, followed by a testing phase, in which B cells with harmful mutations die out and those with the strongest antibodies multiply on. This mutate-and-check scheme shaped our understanding of B cell evolution for decades.

"This particular model was one of the most important contributions of mathematical modeling to immunology," Victora says.

But in 2016, the Victora lab discovered clonal bursting, a phenomenon in which a single B cell multiplies so rapidly that it takes over the entire germinal center. This kind of unchecked proliferation didn't fit with the cautious step-by-step process proposed in the 1990s. Then, in 2021, the lab showed that clonal burst happen by what they dubbed "inertial" cell cycling, in which B cells multiply continuously without selection between each round. Neither finding fit with the mutate-and-check model. "At some point we realized there must be a rule that prevents mutation during inertial cycles," Victora says.

Pause-and-proliferate

To find this elusive rule, the team used a number of advanced imaging techniques. With Brainbow imaging-a genetic cell-labeling technique-they were able to spot clonal bursts: single B cells dividing so rapidly that they took over the entire germinal center. Surprisingly, the population of cells that resulted from these bursts had fewer mutations than expected, suggesting that B cells are placing mutation "on hold" while they carry out inertial proliferation.

Then, in mice engineered with a fluorescent reporter protein, they pinpointed the precise moment in the cell cycle in which B cells mutate. What they found was striking-during inertial cycling, bursting B cells skip precisely the cell cycle phase in which mutation takes place. To confirm this finding, they used image-based cell sorting, isolating B cells and sequencing them to demonstrate that only B cells in the paused state were accumulating mutations, demonstrating that mutation is restricted to this stage-and that skipping it is how some B cells avoid mutating during inertial cycles. Combining these findings with mathematical models confirmed that germinal centers dynamically regulate mutation, turning it on and off to generate the highest affinity B cells without sacrificing speed.

"Imaging was key in making this project work," says Juhee Pae, a research associate in the Victora lab, who was also the lead author on the 2021 paper. "Together, these techniques pointed us to the issue, allowed us to figure out the particular stage of the cell cycle being skipped, and then helped us isolate cells to see which were making the mutation."

The results reveal how germinal centers refine antibody responses with maximum efficiency. By demonstrating that B cells suppress mutation during rapid proliferation and resume it only after expansion, the findings explain how the immune system quickly makes many copies of the best B cells while still improving their ability to fight infections. These principles, which shed light on precise mechanisms shaping adaptive immunity, may have broader implications for vaccine design and immune therapies.

"There's a mini-evolution machine inside our lymph nodes-and I like to think about the study of germinal centers as trying to figure out how a clump of cells forms such an efficient machine," Victora says.

"It's such fundamental knowledge," Pae adds. "We're learning how our immune system works."</p></b>

A recent study published in Nature Communications explores the relationship between diet, blood glucose levels, and cancer incidence across vertebrate species.

Glucose levels in birds

For humans and organisms with human-like glucose metabolism, increasing blood sugar levels can lead to oxidative stress, DNA damage, protein glycation, and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for cancer.

Birds often lack the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, which allows glucose to enter cells. As a result, birds have higher energy expenditures and are more reliant on fatty acids as an energy source, rather than glucose.

As blood glucose levels rise, birds produce larger clutches, which similarly increases their risk of developing cancer. Despite this association, birds have the highest average blood glucose concentrations among all vertebrates while being the least likely to die from cancer as compared to reptiles and mammals.

What is the relationship between diet, plasma glucose levels, and cancer across vertebrates, and could it help explain why birds get less cancer?”

About the study

The current study investigated the relationship between diet, blood glucose levels, and cancer incidence across vertebrates. To this end, diet was categorized by its trophic level, of which included herbivore, invertivore, primary carnivore, and secondary carnivore diets, as well as the percentage of each type of food consumed in the diet.

Differences in blood glucose unrelated to diet

The researchers identified significant differences in blood glucose concentrations across vertebrates, with the lowest levels of 1.2 mmol/L observed in the Burmese python as compared to 21.1 mmol/L in the blue-bellied roller bird.

Amphibians and birds had the lowest and highest average blood glucose concentrations, respectively, at two and 15 mmol/L, respectively, Mammals had a mean blood glucose of 6.7 mmol/L.

Trophic levels failed to show correlations with blood glucose levels. Likewise, the percentage of fruit, invertebrates, plants, seeds, vertebrate ectotherms, vertebrate endotherms, and animal products did not correlate with blood glucose levels.

Both animal- and plant-based diets were associated with similar blood glucose concentrations, as carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores did not exhibit significantly differences in their blood glucose levels.

Blood glucose unrelated to cancer prevalence

We show that there is a negative correlation between cancer prevalence and mean plasma glucose concentration across vertebrates but not within birds, mammals, or reptiles.”

Blood glucose levels did not predict cancer prevalence in any of these classes after accounting for other cancer risk factors such as body mass, lifespan, length of pregnancy, domestication, and trophic level. This adjustment was crucial, as body mass is negatively associated with blood glucose levels.

For both benign and malignant tumors, cancer prevalence was most accurately predicted by both domestication and trophic level, with blood sugar having no effect.

Primary carnivores were associated with a greater cancer prevalence than herbivores after adjusting for domestication. This difference was not observed after accounting for the difference in blood glucose levels.

The increased cancer risk among primary carnivores may be due to toxin accumulation with rising trophic levels, their relatively high proportion in the study, and the higher oxidative stress and DNA damage associated with red meat consumption.

Domestication reduces genetic diversity and suppresses natural selection against carcinogenic or harmful gene variants. Domesticated bovine species have lower blood glucose levels as compared to their wild counterparts, which may increase the risk of cancer among these animals.

Conclusions

Plasma glucose levels were not predictive of cancer prevalence across vertebrate species. Moreover, diet type was not correlated with blood sugar levels across species.

Domesticated primary carnivores had the highest risk of cancer. However, most primary carnivores in the current study were mammals or reptiles, which may account for the relatively lower cancer prevalence in birds.

A notable limitation of the current study was the inability to determine absolute correlations of various outcomes with mean blood glucose levels due to the lack of individual tracking. Blood glucose levels can also be affected by variations in health status at the time of collection, stress, and dietary status. The number of species for which required data was available was also low, which can be addressed with the currently available millions-strong cancer death databases like Species360.

Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the low cancer prevalence in birds, as these findings could support the development of more effective cancer prevention strategies in humans.</p></b>
