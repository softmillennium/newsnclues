<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/health/The-Unexpected-Effects-of-GLP-1-Medications-on-Womene28099s-Health.aspx'>The Unexpected Effects of GLP-1 Medications on Women’s Health</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 09:09:00 <p>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were initially developed to regulate blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their therapeutic effects extend beyond glycemic control, particularly in weight management and metabolic disorders. Beyond diabetes and obesity, GLP-1 RAs exhibit a broad spectrum of physiological effects that significantly impact women's health. This article explores the unexpected effects of GLP-1 RAs on women’s health, highlighting their impact on metabolic, reproductive, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric health while identifying gaps in research and future clinical implications. Improved insulin sensitivity is closely linked to favorable changes in body composition, such as decreased BMI and waist circumference, which are critical for PCOS patients who often present with obesity.2 Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have been shown to modulate the hormonal milieu in PCOS. They contribute to a mild reduction in androgen levels, evidenced by decreases in total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), while simultaneously increasing sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. These shifts help to restore a more balanced hormonal profile, potentially mitigating the hyperandrogenism that underlies many PCOS symptoms.2 While this supports fertility, concerns persist about their effects on early pregnancy. Limited data suggest GLP-1RAs may alter endometrial receptivity, potentially affecting implantation success rates. Animal studies indicate GLP-1RA treatment improves ovarian morphology in PCOS models, but human data are sparse.2,3 However, some studies indicate an increased risk of fractures, possibly due to weight loss-associated reductions in bone mineral density (BMD).4 These benefits are particularly relevant for women who often present with atypical cardiovascular symptoms and higher heart failure risk.4,5 Despite these advantages, concerns about potential adverse effects, including gastrointestinal intolerance and possible cardiovascular adaptations that may influence bone health, warrant further investigation. Emerging reports indicate potential neuropsychiatric effects of GLP-1RAs, including mood changes, appetite suppression, and cognitive function implications. Conversely, others report increased depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts. Preliminary evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs may influence cognitive function by modulating neurotransmitters and inflammation. Some users report clearer thinking and improved focus, while others experience brain fog or fatigue, potentially linked to hypoglycemia. While GLP-1RAs offer substantial benefits, their psychological impact requires further investigation to ensure long-term safety.6 Ongoing research aims to assess GLP-1 RAs’ influence on menstrual irregularities, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, their effects on postmenopausal women, especially regarding osteoporosis risk, warrant further investigation.7 The metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs are evident, yet sex-specific responses remain unclear. Women’s hormonal fluctuations may alter drug efficacy and side effect profiles, necessitating gender-stratified trials. Furthermore, the psychosocial impact, particularly in those with eating disorders, requires careful evaluation.7 Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to determine safety and effectiveness in diverse female populations. Tailored dosing and monitoring guidelines must be developed to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring that GLP-1 RAs serve as a safe and effective intervention for women’s metabolic health.7 However, specific considerations are necessary for women, including reproductive health, pregnancy, and long-term metabolic outcomes. While GLP-1 medications show promising weight loss effects and glycemic control, their safety in pregnancy remains uncertain, necessitating alternative therapeutic approaches for women of childbearing age. Emerging research focuses on optimizing GLP-1 therapies through combination treatments, novel oral formulations, and personalized medicine approaches. Investigations into sex-specific metabolic responses, hormonal influences, and potential long-term adverse effects are crucial for refining treatment guidelines. Moreover, research into GLP-1’s impact on PCOS, menopausal metabolic shifts, and osteoporosis risk is gaining attention. Clinicians should adopt an individualized approach, considering patient-specific factors such as age, reproductive plans, comorbidities, and tolerance. Collaborative, interprofessional care remains essential in maximizing benefits while mitigating risks associated with this drug class.

Mindfulness, total sleep quality, and alcohol consumption may help explain why people who stay up late have a greater risk of depression, according to a new study publishing March 19, 2025, in the open-access journal PLOS One by Simon Evans of University of Surrey, UK, and colleagues.

Previous research has shown that night owls who stay up late, called "evening chronotypes," have more depression symptoms than people who are early risers, or "morning chronotypes." In the new study, Evans and colleagues collected data from 546 university students using an online questionnaire. The data included self-reported information on the students' sleep patterns, mindfulness, rumination tendencies, alcohol use, and depression and anxiety levels.

The study confirmed that people with an evening chronotype were at a notably higher risk for depression and that the association could be explained by differences in mindfulness, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption. On average, evening chronotypes had poorer sleep quality, higher alcohol consumption, and acted with less mindfulness than morning chronotypes.

The study was limited in its ability to prove cause-and-effect because of its cross-sectional design which relied on data at only one time point. In addition, the findings may not apply to age groups outside of the university students included in the study.

With those caveats in mind, the authors conclude that interventions aimed at mindfulness, sleep and alcohol use might have the potential to reduce depression risk, amongst young adults in particular.

The authors add: "With many young adults' experiencing poor mental health, these study findings are particularly important many young adults tend to stay up late and the results point to how interventions could be implemented to reduce their risk of depression."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Today in Science Translational Medicine, researchers describe a diagnostic platform that could classify brain tumors based on the body's cancer-fighting immune response. Itay Raphael, Ph.D., lead author, research assistant professor of neurological surgery at Pitt When T cells find a target on the tumor cell surface, they become activated and start rapidly doubling their numbers in a process called clonal expansion, aimed to clear the cancer. Because of how varied brain tumors and their antigens are, understanding the tumor's molecular composition can help clinicians personalize each patient's treatment. "The success of T cell-based therapies for non-brain tumors, including childhood leukemias, suggests tremendous potential for brain cancers," said senior author Gary Kohanbash, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurological surgery at Pitt. "Having access to an unprecedented dataset of pediatric tumors and new bioinformatic tools allowed us to investigate how T cell immune response and clonal expansion could be used as markers for treatment classification and prognosis independent of other diagnostic tools." The group observed that very aggressive tumor types are associated with less T cell expansion than less aggressive ones, suggesting that clonality can inform patient outcomes across tumor types. "Ultimately, we hope for a future where clonal T cell expansion is incorporated into pediatric cancer diagnosis," said co-author Ian Pollack, M.D., distinguished professor of neurological surgery at Pitt, and a founding institutional principal investigator of CBTN. "UPMC Children's Hospital is committed to supporting brain tumor research and developing new life-saving treatments, and we think that this landmark study represents a foundational shift to how the field will be considering pediatric tumors in the future."

A team at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) led by Dr. Andrés Hidalgo has discovered a specialized population of neutrophils in the skin that produce extracellular matrix, helping to maintain the skin's resistance and integrity. Neutrophils are an important type of circulating immune cell. The discovery broadens understanding of the immune system and may lead to new strategies for treating skin diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and age-related conditions. Although neutrophils are best known for their microbicidal properties, the new study reveals an unexpected role for these cells in the generation and remodeling of the subepidermal extracellular matrix. First author Tommaso Vicanolo adds that the study, "demonstrates that these neutrophils help to maintain skin integrity under normal conditions and are activated in response to injury to generate protective structures around wounds that prevent the entry of bacteria and toxins." The study further shows that this structural function of skin neutrophils is regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway. By genetically deleting this pathway in mice, the authors showed that the deposition of extracellular matrix was diminished, resulting in skin that was more fragile and permeable. Hidalgo underlines that, "This finding opens new avenues for investigating how internal body rhythms influence tissue defence, regeneration and repair." For Hidalgo, now at Yale University School of Medicine, the discovery of matrix-producing neutrophils not only broadens knowledge about innate immunity, but also suggests new treatment strategies for skin diseases and immunological disorders. He explains, "These findings will help develop treatments to strengthen the skin barrier in patients with inflammatory diseases or immunological alterations, including patients with diabetes and older adults." The CNIC is an affiliate center of the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), an executive agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250319/Study-sheds-light-on-brain-activity-during-learning-in-mice.aspx'>Study sheds light on brain activity during learning in mice</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 00:00:00 <p>
"Looking at a tiny part of the brain in a mouse, we can understand how the brain learns, and we can makes predictions about how the human brain might work," said Kishore Kuchibhotla, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist who studies learning in humans and animals. But a holy grail of this type of research is thought-what comes between the hearing and the doing-we're all still trying to understand the patterns of brain activity that underly higher-order cognitive processes. These findings are a step in that direction." Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. It typically takes mice, for instance, thousands of tries to learn a task, several hundred at best. Kuchibhotla's lab previously found that animals' performance doesn't necessarily sync with their knowledge-or that animals might know a lot more than they demonstrate in tests. But by merely watching animals struggle at tasks, they couldn't tell a slow learner from a strategic tester of boundaries. We are interested in the idea that humans and other animals may know things about the world, things that they choose not to show. The researchers taught mice to lick when they heard one tone but not to lick when they heard a different sound. And second, this learning activity happened in the sensory cortex, something that has typically been associated with nonsensory brain areas. "This work illustrates the importance of assessing how brain activity impacts behavior at different stages of the learning process and in different conditions," said first author Celine Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow studying neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. 'We were able to decode the cognitive driver of an error," Kuchibhotla said. "We could tell if the animal was making a mistake or just wanted to give the other option a shot." "We think this means that animals are smarter than we think, and that there are distinct brain dynamics related to learning.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

To uncover what drives sexual behavior in animals, researchers studied the brain activity of male mice throughout the series of actions involved in sex leading up to ejaculation. These findings could inspire treatments for disorders like premature ejaculation. Sexual behavior is a complex sequence of events. The nucleus accumbens, a brain region that plays a role in reward, responds to dopamine-a chemical often associated with pleasure. An optic fiber would light up if the brain released dopamine and acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter known to regulate dopamine. "We are able to look at these events at a very fine time resolution to understand how neurotransmitters interact with each other," says first author Ai Miyasaka, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. During intromission, the nerve cells expressing two major dopamine receptors, D2R and D1R, were less active than usual. If D2R nerve cells were activated, the mice stopped engaging in sexual activity altogether. "We uncovered the precise dopamine signaling mechanism that helps ensure that sexual behavior follows the correct sequence," Liu says. While mice and humans have different sexual behaviors, the brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in sexual function might be similar, note the authors. They suggest that this research could provide new clues to treating sexual dysfunction, particularly premature ejaculation, which affects 20% to 30% of sexually active men. "Now we have a precise understanding of how dopamine works during sex and ejaculation," Miyasaka says, "so I believe our study has opened the door to the development of clinical treatments."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new study from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), published in Nature, captures the moment DNA begins to unwind, allowing for all the events that follow in DNA replication. This direct observation sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that allow cells to faithfully duplicate their genetic material, a cornerstone for growth and reproduction. The achievement is not only a milestone in helicase research, but also a milestone in observing the dynamics of any enzyme at atomic resolution. When Watson and Crick reported the double helix in 1953, they gave the scientific community a breakthrough understanding of how genetic information is stored and copied. Without this first step, no DNA can be replicated. In this way, helicases are machines or, because of their size, nanomachines. If helicases are nanomachines, then 'ATP', or adenosine trisphosphate, is the fuel. The helicase uses ATP not to pry DNA apart in one motion, but to cycle through conformational changes that progressively destabilize and separate the strands. By binding at two sites simultaneously, the helicases coordinate so that the winding can happen in both directions with an energy efficiency unique to natural nanomachines. That efficiency, explains De Biasio, makes the study of DNA replication more than an attempt to answer the most fundamental scientific questions about life, it also makes helicases models for the design of new nanotechnology. "From a design perspective, helicases exemplify energy-efficient mechanical systems. Engineered nanomachines using entropy switches could harness similar energy-efficient mechanisms to perform complex, force-driven tasks," he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For the first time, scientists have systematically analyzed somatic mutations in stomach lining tissue to unpick mutational processes, some of which can lead to cancer. Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the University of Hong Kong, and their collaborators sequenced the whole genomes of normal stomach lining samples from people with and without gastric cancer. They discovered that cells with 'driver' mutations in cancer genes occupy almost 10 per cent of the gastric lining by age 60. Plus an unusual discovery that some individuals, but not all, had mutations resulting in three copies of certain chromosomes, hinting towards exposure to an unknown mutagen. This work enables researchers to explore fundamental mutational processes and compare mutation rates across the body, and further understanding of the earliest stages of cancer development. Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly one million new cases in 2022.1 It is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,2 with the highest number of cases in East Asia and South America. Factors that increase the risk of developing stomach cancer include being overweight, smoking and infection with the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which can trigger inflammation and stomach ulcers. H. pylori infection causes around 40 per cent of stomach cancers in the UK.3 With new DNA sequencing technologies, researchers can now analyse these mutations in normal tissues and trace them back over time, providing insights into ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development. These normal glands had increased numbers of mutations, which may have contributed to initiating gastric cancer. This implies these individuals may have been exposed to an unknown, external mutagen. The team also found that 'driver' mutations5 in cancer genes, many of which are known to be mutated in gastric cancer, occupy almost 10 per cent of the stomach lining by age 60. This proportion increases when patients experience severe chronic inflammation, a known risk factor for gastric cancer. Dr Tim Coorens, first author previously at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and now at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said: "By studying somatic mutations in normal tissues, which we acquire over our lifetimes, we can explore the earliest stages of cancer development. We discovered an unusual phenomenon, where some individuals had three copies of certain chromosomes – known as trisomy – whereas others did not. We've not seen this in any other tissue, and it hints towards an unknown, external mutagen that only some of these people may have been exposed to." Professor Suet Yi Leung, co-lead author at the University of Hong Kong Professor Sir Mike Stratton, co-lead author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Ten years ago, we knew very little about the fundamental processes of mutations that are occurring in our bodies. Now with advanced genome sequencing technologies, we can investigate somatic mutations in all cell types, across various normal tissues.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250319/Study-reveals-how-B-cells-safeguard-high-affinity-antibodies.aspx'>Study reveals how B cells safeguard high-affinity antibodies</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 00:00:00 <p>
Upon exposure to a vaccine or pathogen, B cells scramble to refine their defenses, rapidly mutating in hopes of generating the most effective antibodies. But each round of this process is a roll of the genetic dice-every mutation has the potential to improve affinity; far more often, however, it degrades or destroys a functional antibody. New research now suggests that B cells avoid gambling away good mutations by strategically banking successful ones. As described in Nature, successful high-affinity B cells can proliferate under special conditions that reduce risk of mutation. Our work shows how high-affinity B cells can bank really advantageous mutations by essentially cloning themselves rather than continuing to mutate. Germinal centers rapidly introduce mutations into an otherwise average army of B cells. But since mutagenesis is random, the probability of B cells acquiring worthless or deleterious mutations far outweighs the chance they'll acquire mutations that enhance their affinity for an antigen. As a consequence, high-affinity B cell lineages should frequently degrade. Yet studies have repeatedly shown that germinal centers produce high-affinity antibodies with remarkable efficiency. "If we're imagining that antibodies get better over time through a process like Darwinian evolution, there should be negative consequences too," Merkenschlager says. The team started by mapping B cell lineages with single-cell RNA sequencing, to determine whether various populations of B cells were, in fact, mutating. They soon discovered that high-affinity B cells were somehow dividing more, but mutating less per division. This extra support allows high-affinity B cells to move quickly through the cell cycle and spend less time in the G0/G1 phase where hypermutation occurs. Meanwhile, B cells that have yet to win the jackpot continue to roll the dice with drawn-out G0/G1 phases and baseline assistance from T cells. "We learned that there are two mechanisms: diversify and clone," Merkenschlager says. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV, for instance, require extensive hypermutations to have any hope of latching onto that elusive virus, which constantly mutates and hides key targets under a sugar-coated shield. An ideal HIV vaccine would therefore extend the mutational phase before allowing clonal expansion, ensuring that only B cells with the most refined antibodies win out-a strategy that has, until now, been out of reach. "Now that we have an idea of how to control what a cell will bank versus what it will gamble, we can begin to think about how to design a more effective HIV vaccine," Merkenschlager says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Most mutations are deleterious, so constant mutation during every cell division, coupled with unchecked proliferation, should be a recipe for disaster. How B cells somehow rapidly mutate and improve all at once was a long-standing mystery. This built-in safeguard allows germinal centers to mass-produce successful clones without compromising antibody quality. Since the early 1990s, scientists have known that B cell evolution is unusual. Mathematical modeling from that era suggested that germinal centers improve antibodies by alternating between mutation and selection-mutations occur once every division cycle, followed by a testing phase, in which B cells with harmful mutations die out and those with the strongest antibodies multiply on. This mutate-and-check scheme shaped our understanding of B cell evolution for decades. "At some point we realized there must be a rule that prevents mutation during inertial cycles," Victora says. To find this elusive rule, the team used a number of advanced imaging techniques. With Brainbow imaging-a genetic cell-labeling technique-they were able to spot clonal bursts: single B cells dividing so rapidly that they took over the entire germinal center. Surprisingly, the population of cells that resulted from these bursts had fewer mutations than expected, suggesting that B cells are placing mutation "on hold" while they carry out inertial proliferation. What they found was striking-during inertial cycling, bursting B cells skip precisely the cell cycle phase in which mutation takes place. To confirm this finding, they used image-based cell sorting, isolating B cells and sequencing them to demonstrate that only B cells in the paused state were accumulating mutations, demonstrating that mutation is restricted to this stage-and that skipping it is how some B cells avoid mutating during inertial cycles. Combining these findings with mathematical models confirmed that germinal centers dynamically regulate mutation, turning it on and off to generate the highest affinity B cells without sacrificing speed. The results reveal how germinal centers refine antibody responses with maximum efficiency. These principles, which shed light on precise mechanisms shaping adaptive immunity, may have broader implications for vaccine design and immune therapies. "There's a mini-evolution machine inside our lymph nodes-and I like to think about the study of germinal centers as trying to figure out how a clump of cells forms such an efficient machine," Victora says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A large-scale comparative study exploring the role of blood sugar levels, diet composition, and domestication in vertebrate cancer risk. Study: The relationship between diet, plasma glucose, and cancer prevalence across vertebrates. A recent study published in Nature Communications explores the relationship between diet, blood glucose levels, and cancer incidence across vertebrate species. For humans and organisms with human-like glucose metabolism, increasing blood sugar levels can lead to oxidative stress, DNA damage, protein glycation, and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for cancer. As blood glucose levels rise, birds produce larger clutches, which similarly increases their risk of developing cancer. Despite this association, birds have the highest average blood glucose concentrations among all vertebrates while being the least likely to die from cancer as compared to reptiles and mammals. Both animal- and plant-based diets were associated with similar blood glucose concentrations, as carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores did not exhibit significantly differences in their blood glucose levels. We show that there is a negative correlation between cancer prevalence and mean plasma glucose concentration across vertebrates but not within birds, mammals, or reptiles.” Blood glucose levels did not predict cancer prevalence in any of these classes after accounting for other cancer risk factors such as body mass, lifespan, length of pregnancy, domestication, and trophic level. This adjustment was crucial, as body mass is negatively associated with blood glucose levels. Primary carnivores were associated with a greater cancer prevalence than herbivores after adjusting for domestication. Domestication reduces genetic diversity and suppresses natural selection against carcinogenic or harmful gene variants. Domesticated bovine species have lower blood glucose levels as compared to their wild counterparts, which may increase the risk of cancer among these animals. Plasma glucose levels were not predictive of cancer prevalence across vertebrate species. Moreover, diet type was not correlated with blood sugar levels across species. The number of species for which required data was available was also low, which can be addressed with the currently available millions-strong cancer death databases like Species360.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
