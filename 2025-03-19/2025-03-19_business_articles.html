Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation and economic growth amid uncertainties stemming from President Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Fed officials now see inflation staying higher this year than previously estimated and economic growth going lower than prior predictions.

Policymakers estimate that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) measure of inflation will be 2.8% at the end of 2025, compared with 2.5% previously.

And the US economy is now projected to grow at an annualized pace of 1.7% instead of 2.1%. The unemployment rate is seen edging up to 4.4% from 4.3% previously.

"There are so many things we don't know," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday, and "uncertainty is remarkably high."

But what is known about tariffs is that they "tend to bring growth down and they tend to bring inflation up."

He acknowledged that the new Fed view on inflation this year can be attributed at least in "good part" to the tariffs, but his "base case" is that the inflationary effect from tariffs will be transitory.

While progress on bringing inflation down to the Fed's goal "is probably delayed for the time being," Powell noted that officials do see the goal still being reached by 2027.

Powell has also consistently stressed a wait-and-see approach to assessing the economic impact of policy changes and did the same Wednesday at his press conference, telling reporters that the Fed is focusing on "separating the signal from the noise" when evaluating how Trump's policies may affect the economic outlook.

"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance," Powell said.

The Fed has now held borrowing costs steady for two consecutive meetings, maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25%-4.5%. The pause follows three consecutive rate cuts in late 2024.

The central bank also announced it will begin slowing the pace of Treasuries being drawn off its balance sheet starting in April, reducing the amount of Treasuries allowed to roll off from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Fed, however, will maintain the pace of mortgage-backed securities being drawn down by $35 billion per month.

Fed governor Chris Waller dissented in Wednesday decision because he would have preferred to continue the current pace of decline in letting bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet. He agreed with the decision to hold rates steady.

Waller and his Fed colleagues on Wednesday kept their median estimate first made in December for two rate cuts in 2025, even as a much-studied "dot plot" showed a large number of policymakers favored fewer or no cuts.

Nine officials see 2 cuts, while 4 officials see 1 cut and 4 see no cuts.

The biggest challenge for the Fed going forward may be how to balance both sides of their mandate — maximum employment and price stabilities — as uncertainties mount about both of those goals.

One large concern for investors is the possibility of a scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises — a dynamic known as stagflation that was last seen in the US during the 1970s.

Powell downplayed any comparisons to that time, saying in response to a question from Yahoo Finance that "I don't see any reason to think we are looking at a replay of the 70s."

On the inflation front, the next reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge of core PCE could reveal some new complications.

The metric is likely to show the gauge remained elevated in February, rising to 2.7% from 2.6% seen in January, when it is released next week.

That is still far from the Fed's eventual goal of 2%.

He acknowledged that consumer surveys show short-term worries about inflation but said that the relationship between survey data and hard data "isn't tight." Long-run inflation expectations "really haven't moved."

"We will be watching very carefully for signs of weakness in the real data."

He acknowledged that "it's going to be a challenge" for the central bank to navigate the coming period as new policies from the Trump administration are put in place.

It's “really hard to know how this will work out,” he added.

After previously collaborating with the House of Mouse, the Hundreds co-founder will now oversee merchandise and licensed products for the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations.

E-Commerce Writer


Bobby Kim, better known as Bobby Hundreds in the fashion world, is heading to the House of Mouse.


	The Hundreds co-founder has been named vp of creative for the Americas at Disney Consumer Products. The author revealed the news Tuesday on Instagram following the announcement that his apparel label closed its longtime flagship on streetwear corridor Fairfax Avenue. Kim is also stepping down as creative director of the 22-year-old company, which will continue to sell online and at other retailers. 




	Kim, who previously led The Hundreds' Disney collaborations through the years, will report to Marcus Rosie, Disney svp of global creative, and will oversee development of toys, apparel, books and more merchandise and licensed products sold at the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations, Disney theme parks and other retailers.

	“With more than 20 years of experience, Bobby's creativity and cultural influence transcends fashion,” Rosie said in a statement. “His commitment to innovation and authenticity makes him the ideal candidate to lead our Americas creative teams, as we continue to surprise and delight consumers through our licensed, theme parks and Disney Store businesses.” 


	Kim co-founded The Hundreds in 2003 with then-fellow Loyola Law School student Ben Shenassafar, and was known for his prolific blog posts under the brand, eventually landing a book deal. In 2019 he released a memoir, This Is Not a T-Shirt (MCD), about building the company — known for its “Adam Bomb” mascot — into a multi-million-dollar global brand. Kim also co-founded the fashion-meet-streetwear festival, Family Style, which was acquired in 2024 by Complex.


	At The Hundreds, Kim's handful of Disney collaborations included a 2008 collection that reimagined the Lost Boys of Peter Pan for a new audience. 


	He previously told The Hollywood Reporter, “I remember when I got my publishing deal, one of the things that I was pitching to the publishers is that I don't think they necessarily look at young teenage men, twenty-something guys, as an ideal audience. We had a lot of licensing and collaborative partners throughout the brand's history that felt the same way. I remember at that time [Disney] really only targeted children and female audiences. They said, ‘We have no inroads with men.' And I said, ‘If you work with us, I'll show you.' It opened up an entire new lane; more young guys were getting into Disney. It was the same thing with the book. I wanted to open up this world of young men really getting into literature, into books, into fiction or nonfiction.”

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was leaving interest rates unchanged — but warned of rising uncertainty about the direction of the economy, in part due to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.  

The Fed said its key federal funds rate, which serves as a benchmark for interest rates throughout the economy, would remain at approximately 4.5%.

Though it said current economic conditions were solid, the central bank lowered its forecast for gross domestic product, a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within the U.S., for the rest of the year to 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. It also warned that a key measure of inflation would now be closer to 3% than 2%.

Eighteen of 19 policymakers now say there's increased risk that GDP will fall, compared with just five in December. Meanwhile, 11 policymakers say the unemployment rate could climb to as much as 4.5% this year, up from five previously.

"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased," the Fed's statement said.

In a press conference following the release of the statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the dynamic between Trump's tariffs and stronger near-term price growth wasn't totally clear given other trends in the economy. But the tariffs are certainly a factor in rising expectations that price hikes will accelerate, he said — though for now, firmer inflation would likely be "transitory."

“Inflation has started to move up now, we think, partly in response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress in the course of this year,” Powell said.

Stocks surged on the news — but bond purchases also increased, the latter reflecting concerns about future growth prospects. Investors seek out bonds when they believe they can get a better return on them than other assets. 

“The Fed is as lost in the wilderness as the rest of us trying to decipher the continual shifts in economic policy from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” Omair Sharif, managing director of Inflation Insights consultancy, said in a note to clients following Wednesday's rate decision.

A host of indicators, not to mention comments from Trump administration officials themselves, suggest that consumer spending and employers' hiring are both slowing. After an initial burst of optimism upon Trump's election, growth now looks to be more subdued. Meanwhile, federal workforce cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have also raised concerns about pressure on local economies, not to mention the ability of newly jobless workers to receive unemployment assistance.

Sweeping White House policy changes have already unnerved investors. Last week, the S&P 500 slipped into correction territory, marking a 10% drop from its latest peak, for the first time in three years.

As surveys suggest consumer and business confidence are declining, Trump and senior officials have changed their messaging since the campaign, warning consumers to brace for potential economic pain and declining to rule out the possibility of a recession. Trump has signaled the economy may be in for a period of “transition” as his policies take effect, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the U.S. must “detox” from its reliance on public spending.

The upheaval has created new difficulties for the Fed to navigate as it sets borrowing rates. The central bank is charged by Congress with helping keep unemployment and inflation low. Right now, both are fairly subdued. Yet multiple analysts noted Wednesday that the Fed's latest outlook signals the prospect of stagflation — higher inflation despite lower overall growth — albeit far short of the 1970s' shock caused by that decade's oil crisis.

"Revisions to [policymakers'] projections had a somewhat 'stagflationary' feel with forecasts for growth and inflation moving in opposite directions," Goldman Sachs managing director Whitney Watson said in a note Wednesday afternoon. "For the time being the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious.”

That has drawn multiple interpretations among analysts looking for signs of the Fed's thinking.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the revised projections indicate the central bank may soon start paying closer attention to the labor market, wary of letting unemployment rise too high. Fed policymakers are still indicating that they expect "rate cuts will be necessary in the near future — they just need a full set of information to give them the green light," she said.

Inflation Insights' Sharif, by contrast, said the fact that the Fed still foresees no more than two rate cuts this year suggests a more "hawkish" stance, with policymakers focusing more on controlling price growth than on keeping unemployment in check.

He said the situation was reminiscent of 2022, when the Fed decided to not signal rate cuts were forthcoming because inflation remained elevated.

"The Fed saw downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment, but they continued to power ahead with rate hikes," Sharif said of policymakers' approach at the time. "They're saying now that they will err on the side of making sure inflation does not get out of hand again."

Carina Castagna founded her startup business, Pesto Joe, while participating in the
                                          Pirates LaunchPad Summer Accelerator.

Do you have a business startup idea that you are serious about pursuing and turning
                                    into a real business? Have you already launched a startup and are seeking assistance
                                    to propel your venture to the next level? Have you competed in startup contests, and
                                    seek further guidance? Are you focused on a social or community problem and are working
                                    on an innovative startup business solution?

What Pirates LaunchPad Accelerator graduates say about the program: 

"The Pirate Accelerator gave me the tools and the support to launch Pesto Joe LLC,
                                       which was barely an idea when I initially signed up. Following the program, I was
                                       able to complete a proof of concept at local farmers markets and quickly gained a
                                       following. That was when I knew I had a viable business. I took the following months
                                       to learn about the food industry, build my network and attain my food handler's certificate.
                                       It is crazy to look back and remember where I was two years ago. I simply had an idea,
                                          and I am already leaps and bounds ahead of where I was when I started the accelerator.
                                          I am currently preparing for a busy farmers market season and recently began to sell
                                          my products online. Nothing can stop a Pirate when they are on a mission, and I am
                                          grateful for the accelerator for pointing me in the right direction!" - Carina Castagna,
                                           ‘21/M.P.A. ‘22, founder & CEO, Pesto Joe.

This truly is a collaboration and a reminder that these campaigns are more than just about telling stories, we're empowering them to be seen and heard in bold and unforgettable ways!” said Lesley Leon Guerrero, senior vice president, chief experience officer, Bank of Guam.

Bank of Guam has been honored for the following campaigns:

This lighthearted yet impactful narrative underscored the convenience of digital banking, freeing customers to spend their time enjoying life rather than waiting in lines.

Gold   in   Strategic   Communications, Marketing/Promotion   Campaign (Integrated Marketing)

A complementary social media campaign spotlighted influencers showcasing the branch's innovative design, enhanced customer experience, and digital-first approach.

Honorable Mention in Strategic Communications, Communications/Public Relations (Social Media Campaign)

Morgan Stanley is preparing to reduce its 80,000-person workforce by 2,000 employees later this month, marking the bank's first significant round of layoffs since CEO Ted Pick took over in January 2024.

The workforce reduction will affect divisions across Morgan Stanley, except for its 15,000 financial advisers, per Bloomberg. The cuts are meant to keep costs down as executives face low attrition, or a low rate of employees leaving an organization through resignations, terminations, or retirements.

Some employees impacted by the layoffs will be let go due to performance issues, while others will be cut because AI and automation have replaced their roles within the bank. A source told Bloomberg that the bank expects to make more job reductions due to AI in the coming years.

Morgan Stanley isn't the only major bank planning to cut roles due to AI. A Bloomberg Intelligence report released earlier this year surveyed chief information and technology officers at 93 major banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and found that executives expect to lay off an average of 3% of their workforce within the next three to five years as AI takes over tasks. That means up to 200,000 jobs on Wall Street are at risk of being cut due to automation.

Morgan Stanley has released several internal AI tools for employees. In September 2023, the bank rolled out an AI knowledge assistant tool that quickly finds information within Morgan Stanley research for financial advisers. In June 2024, the bank released another AI tool that takes notes and finds action items for financial advisers during their video meetings with clients.

Pick told investors in June that the AI tools could save employees between 10 to 15 hours per week.

"This is potentially really game-changing," he stated at the time, per Reuters.

Morgan Stanley executives credited the new AI technology with helping the bank report record revenue and profits. Pick told CNBC in October that AI makes the bank more cost-effective and productive. In 2024, Morgan Stanley achieved record net revenues of $61.8 billion, up from $54.1 billion in 2023.

Morgan Stanley is the latest bank to plan layoffs. One of its rivals, Goldman Sachs, is aiming to cut 3% to 5% of its 46,500-person workforce in the coming months. Goldman will reportedly ask some managers located in major hubs like New York City to move to emerging locations like Salt Lake City and Dallas.

SAXONBURG, Pennsylvania — Small businesses have been the backbone of the United States since its founding. The Hotel Saxonburg, which has also been known as the Vogeley House, the Belvedere House, the Laube House and the Central Hotel, opened in 1835 and has lasted most of our nation's existence.

Yesterday, the new owners abruptly closed the hotel after purchasing it two years ago. This not only shuttered the historic restaurant and hotel that served as a cultural touchstone for nearly 200 years, but it also caused people to lose their jobs.

Because the business was small, those job losses, likely around 50 people total, were a statistic that didn't gain attention from the national press. However, when you consider that more people in the U.S. work for small businesses than any other sector, those numbers start to add up.

According to the Small Business Administration, which draws its data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 60% of U.S. businesses are small businesses. They range from employing a handful of people (think your favorite food truck) to 100 people (think a local machine shop).

Before 2020, most Americans worked for small businesses that employed under 500 people. The last four years have upended that number. Now, only 53% of Americans work for businesses with 500 or more workers.

In short, the U.S. is no longer a nation of small businesses. In February, the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau showed that shift. It also showed that the biggest change of all has been the increase in the number of people working for companies with 10,000 or more workers and the decrease in the number of people working at firms with under 100 workers.

Case in point: Last year, there was a story about a local independent grocery, Ferri's, that closed after 70 years in a snowball effect that began with the unexpected shuttering of the small independent pharmacy located inside the grocery.

The beloved family grocery posted a note on the building's large glass front windows and on Facebook, saying they were closing “with a heavy heart” after serving as “a cornerstone of our community and … fostering connections that have spanned generations.”

Ferri's general manager, Gary Silvestri, said the loss of rent and traffic from the pharmacy had a significant impact, as it was 20% of the grocer's business.

Another factor was the economic pressure of Target being located a couple of miles to the east, Walmart a few miles to the west, and Giant Eagle, a massive local grocery store chain, within a half mile of Ferri's. All three of those companies employ well over 10,000 people and have the buying-power advantage to lower prices over a mom-and-pop grocery.

Jeff Hastings of Wholesale Central, the leading publisher of content for the wholesale merchandise industry, wrote that ever since the dawn of the big-box store in 1962, the year Walmart, Kmart and Target all opened their doors, small local businesses, from hardware stores to clothing and shoe stores to pharmacies and groceries, have struggled to compete.

He cited the 2006 Walmart move into the west side of Chicago as an example. Eighty-two local stores went out of business and cost an estimated 300 retail jobs in neighboring ZIP codes.

It isn't just groceries, restaurants or hotels that are falling to larger entities with 10 to 100 employees. Small local gas stations, clothing stores and even small insurance companies that either close or merge with larger companies are also losing ground as big companies expand.

Locals in Saxonburg were sad that the hotel closed and that people lost their jobs, but they also felt confident that someone would come along and revive the historic hotel and restaurant as a gathering place for the community and visitors.

The good news for small businesses, and why many economic experts expect a turnaround, is the surge in construction, manufacturing, retail and service industries in January of this year. Optimism levels exceed the 51-year average, according to the latest Small Business Economic Trends survey from the National Federation of Independent Business Research Center.

That quarterly report revealed that the overall small business population is signaling renewed confidence despite persistent economic challenges. That just might turn around this current trend.

Wix's launch of Wix Functions represents a strategic enhancement to their SaaS website building platform, enabling customers to implement sophisticated business logic without writing code. This significant product addition addresses a critical gap in Wix's offering by allowing businesses to create customized workflows and real-time business rules through a visual interface.

The feature introduces considerable value by enabling dynamic pricing rules, conditional checkout processes, and tailored loyalty rewards across six major Wix applications (Stores, Bookings, Restaurants, Donations, Forms, and Loyalty Program). From a competitive standpoint, this capability reduces a key friction point that often forces growing businesses to migrate to more technically advanced platforms as their operational needs become more complex.

Financially, Wix has implemented a freemium monetization strategy for this feature - offering basic functionality at no cost while reserving unlimited actions and premium capabilities for paid upgrades. This approach creates new upsell opportunities within Wix's existing customer base while potentially improving customer retention by eliminating technical limitations.

This product launch strengthens Wix's position against competitors by elevating its platform beyond basic website building into more sophisticated business operations territory. By empowering non-technical users to implement complex business logic that previously required developer resources, Wix is expanding its addressable market and reducing a key pain point that drives customer churn to more technically advanced platforms.

Wix Functions empowers users to create customized business flows, automate pricing and checkout rules, and tailor app behavior

NEW YORK – Wix.com Ltd. (NASDAQ: WIX), the leading SaaS website builder platform globally1, today launched Wix Functions, a no-code interface that allows users to customize outcomes for various business scenarios, enabling businesses to operate more smoothly and effectively. With an intuitive visual function builder, businesses can define custom business logic, such as adding dynamic pricing rules, enforce checkout conditions, and tailor loyalty rewards, ensuring their operations adapt to their specific business needs.

With Wix Functions, users can define custom outcomes using conditions, variables, formulas, and dynamic values. Users can start from scratch or customize a template designed for a specific Wix app. By selecting input data from an app, such as cart and checkout details in Wix Stores, users can then apply the  logic to create conditions. The builder visually represents the logic, helping users understand how different criteria affect the function's output. For example, users can apply location-based fees, trigger a discount for returning customers in the checkout based on purchase history and implement custom form validations. The function then outputs the desired action, which the Wix app executes in real-time. This enhanced customizability of business flows is particularly beneficial as it allows users to implement more custom steps when rendering checkout or validating forms.

Wix Functions ensures that checkout, rewards, and other workflows wait for the function's output before proceeding. Users can choose from pre-built function templates or create custom rules from scratch. Functions are triggered by app activity, process the required logic, and return a result that immediately impacts the business flow—whether it's adjusting a fee, displaying a discount, or restricting a purchase.

“Wix Functions lets businesses extend and customize Wix apps to fit their unique needs—without writing a single line of code,” said Tomas Petras Rupšys, Head of Wix Functions at Wix. “Building on top of our new Automation builder, Wix Functions gives businesses even more control over their operations, enabling them to customize more workflows, further automate processes and implement advanced business rules. The function's output directly influences how the Wix app behaves in real-time, ensuring that businesses can seamlessly adapt their operations to meet unique needs, further empowering business owners to operate more efficiently and scale with ease.”

Wix Functions complements Wix Automations by enabling real-time customization, while automations manage ongoing tasks. Together, they provide a comprehensive suite of tools to help businesses automate and optimize their operations effortlessly.

Wix Functions is now available on Wix and Wix Studio for Wix Stores, Wix Bookings, Wix Restaurants, Wix Donations, Wix Forms, and Wix Loyalty Program, with free access and optional premium upgrades to access business solutions such as checkout and payments. Users can unlock unlimited actions through premium upgrades.

Golf Ireland is to launch a new campaign aimed at helping golfers and clubs fully understand the World Handicap System.

Ahead of this initiative, golfers across Ireland may already start noticing one change, as new options relating to Playing Handicap allowances become available to clubs, introducing greater flexibility to club competitions.

The measure, which gives clubs options to increase or decrease the Playing Handicap allowance in their competitions, is being rolled out following feedback from club officials and golfers, including through a tracking survey conducted by Golf Ireland in 2024.

While the options will be available from April 1, clubs will have ultimate discretion in whether they adopt a change – and may decide to retain the current Playing Handicap allowance for their club competitions. Likewise, a club may decide not to introduce a change immediately, but on another date following 1 April.

In singles counting competitions, the current 95% allowance for Playing Handicaps can be increased to 100%, or decreased to as low as 85%, at the club's discretion. In this regard, the measure responds to feedback Golf Ireland has received through its annual tracking survey which strongly suggests that golf clubs want additional options to address local issues they might have with the application of the WHS, and that in a number of cases clubs have found that lower handicappers are struggling to compete in club competitions – and in some cases playing less competitive golf at club level as a result. 

The change is being rolled out in Ireland with the agreement of the other Home Nations – England, Scotland and Wales – with a decision to follow ahead of the 2026 season on whether to roll it out across GB&I fully in 2026, potentially with additional options depending on feedback received.     

The option to amend the Playing Handicap allowance can also be applied to four-ball competitions.

Mark Wehrly, Championships & Rules Director of Golf Ireland, said: “The options which clubs will have from 1 April are being rolled out in response to two things we've heard fairly consistently – that clubs want more choice in how they apply the WHS within their club and that in a number of cases there is a concern that lower handicappers are struggling to be competitive in club competitions.

“We've looked at these concerns with an open mind and considered them in light of the data and guidance available to us, in close and detailed consultation with our colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales as well as with The R&A.”

This measure also comes during a period in which Golf Ireland has introduced a significant change to the handicap eligibility rules for inter-club competitions, which resulted in the adjustment of the Handicap Index of 159 players for eligibility purposes ahead of the 2025 season.

Wehrly continued: “We've done a considerable amount of work in sifting through the data, both in terms of club competitions but also in our own competitions, where we have acknowledged that a substantial number of rounds are played in non-counting formats and may therefore be contributing to concerns that some might raise about the fairness of handicapping in our inter-club competitions.

“We'll continue this data-driven approach, as well as kicking on with our annual handicap awareness campaign in the coming weeks, which will address a wide range of issues including player responsibilities and – in particular – addressing actions which give rise to handicap manipulation, another issue on which we've received plenty of engagement from clubs and golfers. We're also very grateful to be working with our colleagues in the other Home Nations, and with The R&A, on a joint communications campaign which will be rolled out over the coming months and which will reinforce these messages.”

The UK Golf Federation has announced that GolfBIC is returning in 2025 with two exciting events, the first of which, sponsored by inrange, takes place at the RAC Club, Pall Mall on Wednesday, 30th April

The PGA of GB&I has announced the first PGA Excel awardees of 2025, with four PGA Members achieving Advanced Fellow status and 12 others earning designations within the membership categories of Professional, Coach and Manager.

The Loop, the newly formed PR and Marcomms agency, has unveiled its initial client list of 18 social media influencers and creators which cover a wide range of content niches in the game.

Ramsey Solutions financial expert George Kamel weighs in on Americans working past retirement age and provides advice for investors.

It isn't always easy to save for retirement, in part because for many people it is so far away that there's no sense of urgency.

New research suggests a solution: Make the future feel closer.

"People struggle to save for the future, and part of the reason why is people struggle to connect with the future," says Katherine Christensen, an assistant marketing professor at Indiana University and the study's lead author. "We wondered, based on past research, if people felt more connected to their future selves, would they be more likely to save?"

After conducting and analyzing a series of 20 experiments to test this hypothesis, Christensen says the answer is yes.

The research found that when we think about the future, more than 80% of the time, we actually start off by thinking about the present. 

"What we did is essentially flip that," Christensen says. Start the thought process by imagining that future before you turn your thoughts back to the present and the savings goals you need to meet to make it happen.

THIS MIDWESTERN STATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO RETIRE, NEW STUDY SAYS: SEE THE LIST

While the difference is subtle, it has been shown to motivate people to save more. In one experiment carried out by the research team with more than 6,700 customers of a Swedish fintech company, people with low-balance savings accounts were 14% more likely to invest in a long-term savings product when they received a notification with language prompting them to think about the future first.

Hal Hershfield, professor of marketing, behavioral decision-making and psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the study's authors, says the prompts were designed with deliberately simple verbiage. "[We] had language along the lines of: ‘The year is 2034…rewind back to 2024 and consider saving for 2034 you,' " he says. 

While the research was tailored to give institutions like banks insights into how to make customers save more, Hershfield says individual savers can apply their findings using similar wording. 

"The key here is to start in the future and rewind back," Hershfield says, "rather than the traditional approach of only starting now and zooming ahead to the future."  

SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS TO INCREASE FOR PUBLIC PENSION RECIPIENTS

The authors of the new study based their hypothesis on earlier findings that people perceive trips to unfamiliar locations as lengthier than return trips of identical duration. In other words, we perceive traveling home as quicker than journeying to an unknown destination.

This cognitive quirk takes place because uncertainty creates mental distance, Christensen says. That is, people perceive the unfamiliar as being further away than the familiar. This "going home effect," as scientists call it, holds true for how we think about years as well as miles—which is where the connection to saving for future events or life stages comes in. 

POLITICS SHOULD BE DIVORCED FROM INVESTING

You're more likely to save for a future that feels imminent, Christensen says. "Since the present is more certain than the future, we're reducing the feeling of uncertainty" by anchoring subjects with a mental destination of familiar present-day reality, she says. "In our nudge, you basically move towards certainty."

Ben & Jerry's has said its chief executive, David Stever, was being removed by its parent company, Unilever, in a growing dispute over the ice cream company's political activism.

The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that says Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its "social mission".

Unilever did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. 

It comes a month after the ice cream company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump.

"Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission," the filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said. 

Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social issues since it was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.

It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

The ice cream maker was bought by Unilever in 2000 through a merger agreement that created an independent board tasked with protecting the ice cream brand's values and mission. 

But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank.

The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza.

In November, the ice cream company filed a lawsuit saying Unilever had tried to stop it from expressing support for Palestinian refugees.

Last month, in another court filing, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever had tried to ban it from publicly criticising Donald Trump.

Mr Stever has been with Ben & Jerry's since joining the firm in 1988 as a tour guide. He was appointed chief executive in 2023. 

Ben and Jerry's court filing said the decision to oust Mr Stever was made without any consultation, as required in the merger agreement between the two companies.

"Unilever...attempted to force the independent board into rubberstamping the decision," it added.

A business that sits right at the entrance of the Sunriver Business Park thinks the newly announced and unique roundabouts coming to Sunriver are a "great idea." Deschutes County Road Department says the roundabouts are needed due to the congestion and safety issues that arise, especially on…

SUNRIVER, Ore. -- Sunriver is getting three new roundabouts and some locals say it's needed at one intersection in particular. Some of the designs for that location aren't ones drivers see all that often.

All three roundabout locations are on South Century Drive. Construction is already set for one standard roundabout at Huntington Road in July, but Deschutes County is asking for public input on the designs for the two others.

The largest project is planned at the intersection of South Century Drive and Venture Lane, which is right at the entrance to the Sunriver Business Park, and it comes with some unusual design suggestions.

Fly & Fields Outfitters in the business park overlooks the intersection.

"It's a great idea," Fly & Fields guide and retail manager Jordan Romney said. "This intersection is just not very controlled with the stoplight and the confusion of which way people are turning. Who has to stop where. We constantly see people almost in accidents, if not in accidents."

The intersection is also a road many use to drop off and pick up their kids from Three Rivers School. 

"That intersection, along with an adjacent intersection, internal to the business park doesn't function that well as a signalized intersection. They're way too close together. During school, pickup, drop off, during other times when there's a lot of business activity, there's safety and congestion issues," Deschutes County Road Department Director Chris Doty said.

Those adjacent intersections are just about 100 feet away from each other and form a sort of "I" shape. The section between the two intersections is narrow and creates a blind corner for drivers turning left out of the business park to get onto South Century Drive.

"It's not a typical solution, so it's going to take an atypical solution to solve those problems," Doty said.

The designs for the planned roundabout are unique, with the road department calling one of the concepts a "peanut," and the other a "teardrop." There's also a "barbell," which is two separate roundabouts, and a roundabout plus a turn lane.

Despite the potential impacts construction could bring to the foot traffic coming into the business park, Romney says he's not concerned.

"I think the people who want to come down here to shop for fishing goods or come see the tap house are going to come anyway. I think in the long run it's just gonna help traffic move better through this intersection," Romney said.

There is also a standard roundabout going in at the intersection of South Century Drive and Spring River Road. The two projects are currently estimated to cost $7 million.

An online open house is available through April 17 at this link. Viewers can see conceptual alternatives for the improvements at Venture Lane and Spring River Road, information on how it will improve traffic flow and a chance to provide feedback.
