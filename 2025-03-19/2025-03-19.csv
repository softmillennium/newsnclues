Prices in the UK rose by 3% in the 12 months to January, well above the Bank of England's target.

The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and has cut three times since August 2024.

When it announced the February cut, the Bank warned that it expected inflation to rise again in 2025. 

Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.

For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. 

The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with virtual reality headsets and yoga mats added in 2025, and local newspaper adverts removed.

The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation.

The main inflation measure is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), external, and the latest figure is published every month.

CPI was 3% in the year to January 2025, up from 2.5% in the 12 months to December. It means that consumer prices rose at the fastest rate for 10 months.

This was largely as a result of rising food prices, VAT on private school fees and airfares failing to fall by as much as usual. 

Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.

However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.

Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. 

It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.

When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. 

The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.

In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.

But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.

For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. 

Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. 

The Bank of England cut rates to 5% in August 2024, to 4.75% in November and again to 4.5% in February.

The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. 

Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. 

This was 3.7% in January, up from 3.2% in December 2024.

After the October Budget, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - including an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers - would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices.

In February, governor Andrew Bailey warned that the Bank's approach to future cuts would be ""gradual and careful"" because of increased economic uncertainty. 

The Bank expects inflation to spike at 3.7% between July and September 2025 due to higher energy prices, water bills and bus fares.

It then thinks inflation will drop back towards the 2% target towards the end of 2027, having previously predicted this would happen earlier in the year. 

The next interest rate announcement is on Thursday 20 March. 

The following Wednesday, 26 March, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her plans for the UK economy in her spring statement. 

Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?

The latest official figures, external show that regular pay grew by more than inflation between October and December 2024.

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.9%, up from 5.6% between September and November. 

After taking CPI into account, wages grew by 3.4%. 

Private sector earnings increased by more than public sector pay.

The US and EU countries have also been trying to limit price increases. 

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.3% in February 2025, down from 2.5% in January. 

In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%, the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates a further five times, taking its key rate to 2.5%.

Inflation in the US fell to 2.8% in February, which was down from 3% the previous month but still above the US central bank's 2% target. 

After a string of cuts in the latter part of 2024, the US Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its first 2025 meeting in January.

The Fed also signalled it was not likely to change rates in the near future as it waits to see the impact of US President Donald Trump's economic policies.

Written by Emily Ford, edited by Michael Stoddard

This ends the BBC South live coverage of the truck explosion outside West Quay Shopping Centre.

Thank you for following along as we brought you the latest updates, for the highlights you can visit our story about the incident.

A spokesperson for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary has confirmed the Harbour Parade has now reopened and police are no longer at the scene.

Our reporters outside West Quay have also confirmed firefighters are no longer there as the blaze has been extinguished.

The truck fire was accidental, firefighters have confirmed.

In their latest update, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service say the scene has now been handed over to police.

In a statement, the service explained the vehicle contained ""cyclinders that exploded"".

It added: ""The fire completely destroyed the vehicle and caused heat and smoke damage to the entrance of the West Quay car park.

""Ventilation fans were deployed to clear the remaining smoke. We would like to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation during this incident.""

Acculine, a company which specialises in painting line markings on roads, has confirmed the truck belongs to them

The BBC understands the workmen were not in the vehicle at the time of this morning's fire and subsequent explosion.

It is believed they were painting road markings nearby when the incident happened.

The company they work for, Acculine, previously told us it was unsure of the cause, but were considering an issue with a gas canister.

The company that owns the truck raised the possibility of an issue with a gas canister

Acculine, a company which specialises in painting line markings on roads, has confirmed the truck which exploded belongs to them.

A spokesperson said the driver is ""okay"" after police confirmed no injuries had been reported.

The firm said it was unsure of the cause of the explosion but raised the possibility of an issue with a gas canister.

Delivery rider Sheikh Emad Uddin Billal was on his way along Harbour Parade to pick up an order when he came across the unfolding incident.

""I noticed a car (sic) on fire with a crowd of people watching. Then I
stopped my moped and made a video.

""Suddenly the explosion happened – nobody knew it
was going to happen.

""It was scary.  As I made the video, one guy went to the van and
everyone shouted for him to come back. He came back and at that time the explosion happened.""

Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service are asking members of the public to stay away from the scene. 

A spokesperson said: ""Crews from St Mary's, Redbridge and Hightown are currently in attendance at a vehicle fire following reports of smoke and flames at the back of Westquay, Southampton at just after 09:30 GMT this morning.

""People are asked to avoid the area while emergency services deal with the incident. Harbour Parade is closed in both directions.""

The incident happened outside one of the entrances to the Podium car park underneath the West Quay Shopping Centre on Harbour Parade.

Sophie CridlandBBC News, Southampton

A number of emergency services vehicles – ambulance, police and
fire - are here.

It looks like a working truck has caught fire.

Firefighters are putting the fire out with hoses at the moment. The
vehicle looks like it has been completely burnt, parts are black, there is no
top any more - you can just see the inside.

I can hear the fire alarm from inside West Quay - the whole of the shopping centre has been evacuated.

It looks like hundreds of people have been evacuated from
the shopping centre and are just waiting to see what happens next.

Police have told us a vehicle fire on Harbour Parade, Southampton, was reported at 09:37 GMT.A statement said the fire service was leading on the incident and officers were assisting with road closures.

This is the moment a delivery driver captured a fireball exploding from a truck outside West Quay Shopping Centre. 

Sheikh Emad Uddin Billal sent the BBC this footage, which shows a number of explosions coming from the vehicle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Art.com","‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth' essay contest closes submissions","https://www.rt.com/russia/614496-future-of-world-new-platform/","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:14:00 GMT","

All submissions have been received for an international essay contest on global economic development which is being held as part of the upcoming Open Dialogue ‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth'. The forum aims to envision how major global shifts will shape the way people live for decades to come.

The event, scheduled for April 28-30 at the National Centre RUSSIA in Moscow, will bring together experts, leading economists, and representatives from various sectors worldwide to discuss current economic challenges and shape strategies for future growth.

The contest has generated “tremendous interest,” and the geographical diversity of participants is “impressive,” center director Natalia Virtuozova said in a statement on Monday.

A total of 695 papers were received from 101 countries. According to Virtuozova, participants from Russia, Mexico, India, China, Oman, and Italy were among the most active. Submissions also came from Egypt, Vietnam, Türkiye, Colombia, Canada, France, and Transnistria.

The ideas were delivered in the form of a five-page essay or a 10-minute presentation in the authors' native tongues. The number of applications and the interest in the event prompted an extension of the submission deadline from March 9 to March 15.

The essays focus on four key topics: ‘Investments in Human Capital', ‘Investments in Technology', ‘Investments in the Environment', and ‘Investments in Communication'.

The ‘Human Capital' section covers issues such as the effective pursuit of demographic policy amid aging populations; migration and economic development; the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the labor market; strategies to reduce youth unemployment; the use of new technologies in learning and education; strategies for enhancing the well-being of the population; and the prospects and effects of promoting a healthy lifestyle.

The ‘Technology' section focuses on technologies being used in order to ensure food security; breakthrough technologies in industry; AI as a key end-to-end technology; the optimization of healthcare using advanced technology; the prevention and minimization of the consequences of natural disasters; water resource management in the context of climate change; technology for providing accessible and sustainable energy and the development of smart cities.

The ‘Environment' section includes green infrastructure or creating sustainable and environmentally friendly urban spaces; transport accessibility for everyone; creating a comfortable environment subject to climate change; corporate social responsibility; managing natural hazards; barrier-free and inclusive environments; conscious consumption as the basis for conscious supply; and sustainable tourism as a way to enhance the quality of the urban environment.

The ‘Communication' section covers issues such as the future of trade; new logistics routes in the Global South and East; worldwide challenges and the responses of the insurance industry; improving financial flows; digital currencies as a tool for improving the international financial network; data mobility as part of global communication; and E-commerce and logistics platforms.

“Most of the essays focus on investment in people. The authors are concerned about access to education and the preservation of national identity. Regarding investment in technology, the central topic, of course, is artificial intelligence. For investment in communication, authors mainly discuss participation in international trade, while those from smaller countries emphasize access to reliable information. As for investment in the environment, the authors are primarily concerned about the future of cities—what future cities will look like and, most importantly, how people will live, work, and feel in them,” Natalia Virtuozova has said.

Now with all submissions received, the organizers have started preparing a schedule for discussions based on the topics covered in the papers.

The selection process has also begun. The winners will be invited to Moscow to take part in the Open Dialogue event in April, where they will join case sessions and expert discussions on the future of the global economy, along with representatives from leading think tanks, development institutions, universities, government agencies, business associations, youth organizations, and the media.

The best essays will be published in English and the ideas presented in them will be considered for long-term economic planning.

From Monday, invitations are being sent to moderators and experts from around the world. Additionally, registration is now open on the website Russia.ru for all those interested in listening to and participating in the Open Dialogue.

By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.

By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.

Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defense is the flavor of the season in India. The country's defense manufacturing sector is rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of New Delhi's strategic and economic ambitions, and government policies are focusing on making sure that modern weaponry is both designed and manufactured in India, or, at the very least, is “Made-in-India.”

The Indian military has identified over 5,000 items that must be manufactured in the country rather than imported. Called the positive indigenization list (PIL), the initiative began in 2020 and aims to offer defense items to be indigenized by Indian manufacturers, including small and medium enterprises and startups. It has already yielded results, according to the Defense Ministry.

Defense production and exports are being monitored at the highest levels of the executive. Ambitious targets are being set: 75% of the defense capital budget has to be spent procuring India-made products. The private sector is being encouraged to enter defense production, which was hitherto public-dominated. Some big industrial groups have entered defense, but there are also large numbers of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups that are producing international quality components and subsystems to global manufacturers. 

It was different for the newly independent India. In the early 1950s, the country's economy was greatly influenced by the Soviet “socialist” approach, and evolved its five-year plans. Perhaps that was the best for those times.

Throughout the 1950s, there was Soviet assistance and technology transfer in multiple industrial sectors such as steel, defense, railways, construction equipment, metal, mining, petrochemicals, and much more to India. A very important part was the building of military aircraft, aero-engines and avionics factories. At one point the Indian armed forces had nearly 85% of military equipment of Soviet or Russian origin. 

Back then, India's private sector was relatively small and primarily focused on meeting the daily needs of the masses. The government utilized public funding to establish essential infrastructure, nationalizing key industries such as banking, car manufacturing, and aircraft production. This approach may have been suitable for that time.

Over the long term, both public and private sectors exhibited distinct strengths and weaknesses. The public sector benefits from government funding but operates under the bureaucratic control of government departments. Decision-making can be complex, and progress monitoring is similarly cumbersome. With taxpayers' money at stake, accountability tends to be lower. Salaries are fixed according to government scales, and once hired, employees find it difficult to be dismissed for poor performance, resulting in generally lower productivity compared to the private sector.

After the collapse of Soviet Union, Russia realized the need to compete with the rest of the world through market forces. India too realized that it had to diversify its defense sourcing. 

After the economic reforms of 1991 that deregulated markets, reduced import tariffs, and lowered taxes, India's economy began to grow. This growth enabled significant investment in the defense sector and marked the emergence of a robust private sector. Manufacturing capabilities expanded, resulting in the mass production of cars and motorcycles. Additionally, the previously protected defense sector began to open up to private players. 

The private sector attracts top talent with competitive salaries and can quickly dismiss non-performers. Its efficiency allows tasks to be completed with fewer workers, and it can easily raise funds from banks and international institutions. Unlike the public sector, which faces complex governmental approvals for joint ventures and foreign collaborations, the private sector can pursue these opportunities swiftly. Foreign corporations prefer working directly with Indian companies to avoid bureaucratic hurdles. Additionally, the private sector can acquire essential technologies and raw materials based on commercial needs, improving operational agility.

Interestingly, 41 of the top global defense companies are from the US. All are private. These companies had $317 billion in arms revenues, which was half of the total revenue of the top 100 companies. The top five arms companies were all US-based. Nine Chinese, three Indian, and two Russian companies are in the top 100. All these were public sector companies. 

New Delhi has launched a host of programs and policies in the past few years to attract private companies to participate in defense manufacturing. 

This includes Innovation for Defense Excellence (iDEX), which aims to spark innovation in defense and aerospace by creating prototypes that enhance national security; and the Defense India Startup Challenge, which supports startups and small and medium companies in building prototypes and commercializing solutions for national defense. Additionally, the 2020 Defense Acquisition Procedure reserves certain orders (worth of up to 1 billion rupees or $11.5 million) for small and medium sector companies.

The Defense Ministry has also encouraged industry bodies to create dedicated defense chapters and help connect the industry with the government and address concerns. Lastly, the government is pushing public sector banks to develop loan schemes tailored for the defense industry, with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) already offering specific options.

The government has also insisted that state-run companies and agencies in defense, including the largest one, the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), which was created in the late 1950s to support defense equipment research, should offer support to the private sector by providing their facilities. 

Setting up an independent nodal umbrella body for testing, trial, and certification requirements of defense systems should improve access to existing facilities while reducing the need for investments to recreate the capital-intensive infrastructure.

Currently, India has 16 Defense Public Sector Units (DPSUs), over 430 licensed companies, and approximately 16,000 MSMEs. Notably, 21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward defense self-reliance.

There has long been a feeling that state-owned defense companies are keeping their technology R&D cards very close to their chest and are reluctant to share with private sector. They also continue to treat them as competitors rather than partners. Meanwhile, the government has offered increased governance and control rights to foreign companies.

While major foreign defense manufacturers have chosen to partner with major Indian conglomerates like Tata, Reliance, Adani, L&T, and others to invest in defense in India, similar projects with the public sector have been few. 

The Indian government's defense procurement policies have lured several global players, such as Airbus, BAE, Boeing, Collins Aerospace, Dassault Aviation, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Pilatus, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Rafael, Safran, and Thales, to set up operations and form joint ventures in India.

For instance, Lockheed Martin and Boeing joined with Tata group manufacturing aero-structures and sub-systems for global supplies, while Adani group is making UAVs and drones with Israeli's Elbit group. 

The Airbus C295 is built by Tata group in India. This first-of-its-kind ‘Make in India' aerospace program in the private sector is expected to involve more than two dozen small and medium-sized suppliers, producing over 60% of the 30,000 detail parts, sub-assemblies, and component assemblies locally. 

The Defense Ministry issued an expression of interest (EoI) to the private sector to participate in the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program through a special-purpose vehicle. The project will include ADA, HAL and a selected private company under the PPP model. The name is expected to be announced by mid-2025. 

There are many private companies making defense electronics, large aero-structures components, advanced technology components, and sub-systems. Dynamatic Technologies makes assemblies of vertical fins for Sukhoi 30 MKI fighters. They are also supplying aero-structures to Airbus for its A320 family of aircraft and the wide-body 330 aircraft. Hyderabad's VEM Technologies manufactures centet fuselage for LCA Tejas.

The BrahMos is JV is a joint venture between the DRDO and Russian NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which together have formed BrahMos Aerospace and have had significant success in missile production and exports. The AK-203 assault rifle is being produced in India through a joint venture between Russia and India. Russia has recently offered to make the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 in India through a JV with Indian partners. Interestingly, the Russian Army wears boots crafted in India's Hajipur district in Bihar.

Overall, India's aerospace and defense sector has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, with the private sector contributing a staggering 20% to its turnover. Developing a strong research base in India and a robust supply chain for components and sub-systems, most currently sourced from abroad, will help create the market for civilian and defense systems in the aerospace sector.

Domestic defense production in India has already reached $14.5 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. The target to procure 75% of all defense capital acquisitions domestically will give a huge boost to the “Make-in-India” initiative. The target is $19 billion in the current fiscal year with aspirations to achieve $34 billion in defense production by 2029. 

Meanwhile, India's defense exports reached $2.4 billion last year, and the government set a defense export target of $5.7 billion by 2028-29. Currently, India exports to over 100 nations, with the top three destinations for defense exports in 2023-24 being the USA, France, and Armenia.  

To move beyond traditional defense manufacturing, India needs to boost public funding for investments in key future technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, autonomous vehicles, hypersonic technology, directed energy weapons, augmented and virtual reality, and blockchain. These investments will lay the groundwork for future innovations in both commercial and military applications. Developing intellectual property is vital for India to secure a prominent place in global defense manufacturing.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, have agreed to pursue negotiations to end an escalating conflict in the Central African country, according to Qatar, which is acting as a mediator.

The two leaders met in Doha on Tuesday – their first direct talks since the return of hostilities driven by the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's eastern provinces at the beginning of the year. 

More than 8,500 people are said to have been killed in attacks on the Congolese army and its allies, with the militants seizing major cities, including the North Kivu capital, Goma, and Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu.

According to a joint statement published by Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Tshisekedi and Kagame reaffirmed their commitment to an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire during the meeting led by Qatari leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

“The heads of state then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace,” the ministry stated.

The Doha meeting came after M23 rebels pulled out of direct peace talks with the DRC government due to be held in Angola on Tuesday, after the European Union announced sanctions on the group's leaders. Angola-mediated peace talks between the two African states were halted last December after Rwanda demanded that Kinshasa engage directly with the M23.

Relations between Kinshasa and Kigali have been strained due to the decades-long conflict in DR Congo's resource-rich east, where dozens of armed groups, including M23, are fighting the local authorities for power and minerals such as gold and diamonds. The Congolese government has accused the neighboring state of providing support to the M23 – a claim backed by a UN expert group. Rwanda has denied supporting the M23, insisting that its forces are only deployed on its borders with the DR Congo for security purposes.

The allegations have also sparked tensions between Kigali and some of its Western partners, including the UK, which recently suspended aid to Rwanda in response to the latest escalation of hostilities. On Monday, Rwanda severed diplomatic ties with Belgium, accusing it of calling on Western nations to impose sanctions on Kigali. Brussels responded by also expelling Rwandan diplomats and canceling cooperation agreements with the former colony.

A US federal judge has ordered the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, to suspend its dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

USAID, responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance, has faced scrutiny over its role in political influence operations abroad. Musk has accused the agency of directing billions of taxpayer dollars into projects that are either ineffective or detrimental to American interests.

In his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Theodore Chuang of the District of Maryland directed DOGE to restore USAID employees' access to the agency's computer systems and prohibited the disclosure of their personal information to the public.

Chuang characterized the ongoing disassembly overseen by DOGE as “likely” infringing on the constitutional principle of separation of powers. While he ordered a pause on the process, he refrained from reversing the terminations of former employees, a request made by the plaintiffs.

State Democracy Defenders Action, the nonprofit representing USAID employees in the case, hailed the ruling as “an important victory against Elon Musk and his DOGE attack,” asserting that Musk's team is “performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel.”

Musk has previously described court rulings obstructing DOGE as “an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges,” demanding consequences for those who make “truly terrible decisions.”

The rhetoric from Musk and members of the administration of US President Donald Trump has faced criticism from the American Bar Association (ABA), which condemned the government's “disconcerting pattern” of political attacks on the judiciary and pledged to oppose attempts to “to remake the legal profession” into a domain of compliance.

Appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014, Chuang previously ruled against the Trump administration in cases brought up during his first presidential term. That included the controversial travel ban targeting individuals from Muslim-majority countries and a requirement for women seeking abortion pills to obtain them in person. Both rulings were later overturned by the US Supreme Court.

They talked about the fighting in Ukraine, of course. But the U.S. and Russian presidents also chatted about improving relations between Washington and Moscow, peace in the Middle East, global security and even hockey games.



During the more than two-hour chat — the longest such call between the countries' leaders in years --- Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin covered a range of topics. And importantly for Putin, the conversation gave him a chance to pivot away from the war in Ukraine and engage more broadly about global issues, drawing a line under Washington's past efforts to cast him as an international pariah.

Tuesday's phone call appeared to reflect both leaders' interest in mending the U.S.-Russian ties that have plummeted to their lowest point since the Cold War amid the 3-year-old conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin and the state-controlled Russian media praised it as a long-sought launch of an equal dialogue between the two nuclear superpowers. 















While both the White House and the Kremlin cast the discussion as a key step toward peace in Ukraine, Putin's uncompromising demands are making a truce elusive.



Seeking to cultivate warm ties with Washington, Putin accepted a halt on strikes on energy infrastructure while avoiding an outright rejection of Trump's 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin leader linked it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Kyiv's mobilization effort -– conditions that Ukraine and its allies firmly reject.






Unlike Kyiv, which accepted Trump's ceasefire offer amid a series of battlefield setbacks, Putin appears to have little interest in a quick cessation of hostilities, with Russian forces firmly holding the initiative on the battlefield.



Ukraine is on the verge of completely losing its foothold in Russia's Kursk region, where its forces are clinging to a sliver of land along the border after their surprise incursion in August 2024. Russia's offensive shattered Kyiv's hopes of exchanging its gains in Kursk for some of the territory Moscow captured elsewhere in Ukraine.

Putin said Ukrainian forces that remain in Kursk are surrounded — a claim echoed by Trump — even though Kyiv denied its soldiers are encircled.



Ukrainian officials fear that Russia could try to attack the nearby Sumy region that borders Kursk. At the same time, the Russian army is pressing offensives in several sectors of the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.



By making the ceasefire conditional on a freeze of arms supplies to Ukraine and its mobilization effort, Putin is trying to cement Russian gains and force Kyiv to cave in to Moscow's demands. He wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed but never fully captured, renounce its bid to join NATO, and radically trim its military.



Putin's acceptance of a halt on strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities has allowed Trump to claim at least partial success for his peacemaking effort, but the move wasn't a major concession by Moscow, given the massive damage to Ukraine's power grid from years of attacks.

While seeking to expand his military gains in Ukraine to dictate peace terms, Putin also used the call to shift the discussion away from a ceasefire to other global issues. He appeared to win Trump's interest.



The White House said in its readout of the call that the leaders “spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts,” discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and “agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside.”



“This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved,” it said.



U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, who flew to Moscow last week to meet with Putin, praised both leaders and offered optimism the Kremlin was moving toward a broader truce.



“I would commend President Putin for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal,” Witkoff told the Fox News Channel. “And I would give all the credit to President Trump. ... I can't overstate how compelling he was on this call.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov underlined that Putin and Trump “understand each other well, trust each other and intend to move gradually toward normalization of Russian-U.S. relations.”



Russian state TV and other Kremlin-controlled media hailed the call as a move toward broad cooperation between Moscow and Washington.



The pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda noted that “normalization of relations between two nuclear superpowers” was on the agenda, and state news agency RIA Novosti pointed at the “evolving partner relations between the U.S. and Russia.”



“This format is line with new vision of a multipolar world that is apparently shared by both the White House and the Kremlin,” it said.



Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Endowment said “the most significant outcome was the implicit acceptance of U.S.-Russian cooperation on key international and bilateral issues.”



She added that “this marks an obvious victory for Putin, who seeks to decouple bilateral relations from the Ukraine war.”



“The ongoing ‘detoxification' of Russia continues,” Stanovaya said in a commentary, even noting an agreement on Putin's proposal to organize hockey matches between Russian and American players.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to the Putin-Trump call by warning that “trying to negotiate without Ukraine, in my view, will not be productive.”



Trump called Zelenskyy for about an hour Wednesday and said in a social media post the conversation was to “align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.”



The creation of U.S. and Russian working groups to ponder ceasefire specifics and a possible deal on ensuring safe shipping in the Black Sea that was mentioned in the Kremlin readout of the Trump-Putin call marked yet another move toward discussing the fate of Ukraine in its absence, upending the Biden administration's policy “of nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”



“The conversation didn't bring good news to either Kyiv or Europe, who saw themselves clearly ignored,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a Moscow-based political analyst familiar with Kremlin thinking. “Two great powers are discussing the settlement while paying little attention to others.”



Stanovaya noted Putin has shifted discussion away from the ceasefire while giving little in return.



“This is very bad news for Ukraine, which is increasingly being treated as a bargaining chip in this game,” she said.



Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, deplored Trump's “affinity or sympathy” toward Putin and his reluctance to significantly punish or constrain Russia, which allows the Kremlin leader to stick to his strategy to “grind down Ukraine militarily and outlast the West politically.”



“Russia wants to decide the fate of Ukraine and ultimately of Europe, with the United States alone, with no other negotiating partner,” he said.



“I can't think of another period in my lifetime when diplomacy has been so upended in such a brief space of time,” he said, noting the closest example was in the 1980s when Mikhail Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union.



While “it took Gorbachev four years to abandon longstanding Soviet commitments in Eastern Europe,” Gould-Davies said, “it has taken four weeks for the United States to call into question fundamental, longstanding commitments to Europe.”

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday announced a new drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment in Europe.

The EU's executive branch unveiled its “Readiness 2030” security strategy with the threat of Russian aggression at the forefront of concerns. NATO intelligence estimates suggest that Russia could be capable of launching an attack in Europe again in three to five years.

Last month, the Trump administration signaled that U.S. security priorities lay elsewhere — on its own borders and in Asia – and that Europeans would have to fend for themselves and Ukraine in the future. That was as Europe's biggest land war in decades entered its fourth year.

Under the strategy, member countries will be urged to buy much of their military equipment in Europe, working mostly with European suppliers — in some cases with EU help to cut prices and speed up orders. They should only purchase equipment from abroad when costs, performance or supply delays make it preferable.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the EU is announcing a new drive to break its security dependency on the U.S., with a focus on buying more defense equipment in Europe.

In recent years, the 27 EU nations have placed about two-thirds of their orders with U.S. defense companies. To qualify for new loans, they would have to buy at least 65% of equipment from suppliers in the EU, Norway or Ukraine.

“The security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken for granted,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.




“We must buy more European. Because that means strengthening the European defense, technological and industrial base. That means stimulating innovation. And that means creating an EU-wide market for defense equipment,” she added.

The strategy resembles the RepowerEU scheme that the commission proposed in 2022 to wean the bloc off Russian natural gas after President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine and used energy as a weapon to try to undermine EU support for Kyiv.

That strategy saw the EU's dependence on Russian gas imports fall from 45% in 2021 to 15% in 2023.

The new blueprint was unveiled on the eve of a summit of EU government leaders. At emergency talks on March 6, they signed off on proposals to ease budget restrictions and create a 150-billion-euro ($164 billion) loan plan for defense projects.

Defense firms in the U.S., U.K., and Turkey would be excluded from the loan plan unless those governments sign security agreements with the EU.

France has pushed the “buy European” approach, but countries like Poland and the Netherlands want to buy U.S. equipment.

EU nations are also encouraged to boost security ties with NATO allies that are not members of the EU, including Britain, Canada, Norway, Australia, Japan, South Korea and India.

The strategy notes that while the United States remains a key Western ally, it has been clear “that it believes it is over-committed in Europe and needs to rebalance, reducing its historical role as a primary security guarantor.”

Andrius Kubilius, the EU's recently appointed and first-ever defense commissioner, warned that “450 million European Union citizens should not have to depend on 340 million Americans to defend ourselves.”

Spending priorities for joint purchase would be air and missile defense systems, artillery, ammunition, drones, equipment for use in cyber and electronic warfare, and “strategic enablers” like air-to-air refueling and land border security installations.

To help Ukraine fend off the Russian invasion, the aim would be to provide at least two million artillery rounds each year; supply more air defense systems, missiles and drones; and continue to train tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops annually.

More money would also be funneled into Ukraine's defense industry.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Wednesday its troops retook part of a corridor that bisects Gaza, and its defense minister warned that attacks would intensify until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. 



The military said it had retaken part of the Netzarim Corridor that divides northern Gaza from the south, and from where it had previously withdrawn as part of a ceasefire that began in January. That truce was shattered Tuesday by Israeli airstrikes that killed more than 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The advances by Israel on Wednesday — which included sending more troops to southern Gaza — threatened to drag the sides into all-out war again. The ceasefire had given war-weary Palestinians some respite, allowed a much-needed surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza — and led to the release of dozens of hostages who had been held for more than 15 months.



Within Israel, the resumption of airstrikes has raised concerns about the fate of roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.



A Hamas spokesman, Abdel-Latif al-Qanou, said the advance of ground forces in Gaza was a clear sign that Israel had backed out of the truce and was reimposing a “blockade.” There have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Tuesday's bombardment.



Also Wednesday, the United Nations said one of its employees was killed in Gaza and five others were wounded in an apparent strike on a guesthouse. It was not immediately clear who was behind the strike, the U.N. said.







The military said that its “limited ground operation” in Gaza would create a “partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.” 














It wasn't immediately clear whether the move would entirely block Palestinians from traveling north or south through the Netzarim Corridor. 



Israel used the roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) corridor as a military zone during the war. It ran from the Israeli border to the coast, just south of Gaza City, severing the territory's largest metropolitan area, and the rest of the north, from the south. 



Israel continued with airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday, though at a lower intensity than Tuesday, saying it hit dozens of militants and militant sites, including the command center of a Hamas battalion. It denied Palestinian claims that it hit the U.N. guesthouse.



Fares Awad, an official in the Gaza Health Ministry, said an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners in the northern town of Beit Lahiya killed 14 and wounded 30 others. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. 



Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza for the south were prevented from returning throughout the war, until Israel withdrew from Netzarim in January. Many of them have since returned.



But Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.



Katz said Tuesday's aerial bombardment “was just the first step” in Israel's plan to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and give up control of Gaza. Until it does, Israel will attack “with an intensity that you have not known.”

Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike in the central city of Deir al-Balah. He said the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.



He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded. 



Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike. “Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said.



Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said the explosion was not caused by Israeli fire. “There were no forces around that building, no aerial attacks on that area,” he said.



After the strike Wednesday, the wounded were rushed to Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in central city of Deir al-Balah. One man was carried inside on a blanket held up by medical workers. Another lay on a hospital bed, his knee bandaged. A blue protective vest emblazoned with “UN” rested on a nearby bed.

The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the strikes early Tuesday. It said another 678 people have been wounded.



The military says it only strikes militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. 



The war has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.



The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals; 59 hostages remain, and more than half are believed to be dead.







Before this week's attacks, Israel and Hamas were set to negotiate an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which lasted six weeks. 



But those talk never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war.



The breakdown of the ceasefire was met with anger in Israel, where many support the plight of the hostage families to free their loved ones.



Israel's return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests taking place over his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At a former American air base in southern Vietnam, work abruptly stopped last month on efforts to clean up tons of soil contaminated with deadly dioxin from the military's Agent Orange defoliant.

The Trump administration's broad cuts to USAID also halted efforts to clear unexploded American munitions and landmines, a rehabilitation program for war victims, and work on a museum exhibit detailing U.S. efforts to remediate the damage of the Vietnam War.

In addition to exposing thousands of people to health hazards, the cuts risk jeopardizing hard-won diplomatic gains with Vietnam, whose strategic importance is growing as the U.S. looks for support in its efforts to counter an increasingly aggressive China.

“It doesn't help at all,” said Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has dedicated his time to humanitarian programs in the country for the last three decades. “It is just another example of what a lot of critics want to remind us of: You can't depend on the Americans. It is not a good message.”

Funding for the Agent Orange cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base was unfrozen about a week after it was stopped, but it's unclear whether funds are fully flowing or how they'll be disbursed, with no USAID employees left to administer operations, said Tim Rieser, a senior adviser to Sen. Peter Welch, who drafted a letter to administration officials signed by Welch and more than a dozen other Democratic senators urging the continued funding of the programs.

Other programs remain cut.

“They have reversed a number of these arbitrary decisions, but we're far from out of the woods and we don't know how this is going to end,” Rieser said.

Cuts to USAID and foreign assistance have ground projects to a halt, like the cleanup of dangerous chemicals used during the Vietnam War. The AP's Jennifer King has more.

The interruptions to aid come as the U.S. and Vietnam prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War and the 30th anniversary of the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi.

It was a slow road back from the war, which lasted some 20 years and saw more than 58,000 Americans, and many times that number of Vietnamese, killed before it finally ended in 1975.

Starting in the 1990s, the U.S. began helping its former enemy address wartime legacies like Agent Orange, a herbicide dropped from planes during the war to clear jungle brush, and which was later found to cause a wide range of health problems, including cancer and birth defects.

The two countries have since been increasing defense and security cooperation as China has become more assertive in the region. In 2023, Vietnam elevated relations with the U.S. to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of cooperation and the same as Russia and China.

On Inauguration Day, Trump issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad, alleging that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Feb. 7 “underscored the department's support for ongoing efforts to collaborate on the legacy of war issues,” in his introductory call with his Vietnamese counterpart, according to the Defense Department.

Twenty days later, the administration ordered all but a fraction of U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, staffers off the job and terminated at least 83% of its contracts and cut programs globally, including in Vietnam.

Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy's foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects, said the idea that money was being wasted is “factually wrong.”

“Our foreign aid advances our own national interests, and if the Trump administration doesn't understand that, it's hard to know what to say,” he said.

A U.S. project to clean up the former Da Nang Air Base was successfully completed in 2018, giving rise to the Bien Hoa cleanup effort outside Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon.

The contamination at Bien Hoa, the busiest airport in the world during the war, was nearly four times greater than in Da Nang, with some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil and sediment.

As of 2024, the province in which Bien Hoa is located had more than 8,600 people still suffering from Agent Orange-related health issues, according to local authorities.

Work began in 2020 on a 10-year project funded by USAID and the Department of Defense, with an estimated cost of $430 million overall. Soil with low levels of dioxin contamination were to be unearthed and taken to secure landfills, while highly contaminated soil was to be taken to short-term storage for treatment.

Workers have already excavated more than 100,000 cubic meters of dioxin-contaminated soil, with 13 hectares treated. Ground was to be broken next month on the construction of a system to treat the most severely contaminated soil.

“You have to wonder if the people who made the decision to freeze these funds know anything about the tragic history of the U.S. and Vietnam ... and they must not care about the many thousands of tons of severely contaminated soil that is exposing tens of thousands of people to a very serious health risk,” Rieser said.

The sign reads; “Dioxin contamination zone - livestock, poultry and fishery operations not permitted.” (AP Photo/Maika Elan, File)



The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and USAID referred all questions on the war legacy projects to the State Department in Washington.

In a one-line email, the State Department said that “USAID has three contracts conducting dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa in Vietnam that are active and running.”

Asked to elaborate on how long the Bien Hoa project was shut down and what operations had resumed, as well as the status of other war legacy programs, the State Department said “we have nothing to share on the details of these programs at this time.”

Vietnam's Defense Ministry referred questions to the Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment.

But in a Feb. 13 press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang expressed concern about what could happen if American funding for war legacy projects, which amounts to some $200 million per year, were to end.

“The suspension of USAID-supported projects, especially those on clearing bombs and explosives left over from the war, as well as the Bien Hoa airport detoxification project, will have a strong impact on human safety as well as the environment in the project areas,” she said.

On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge ruled that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the U.S. Constitution and blocked further cuts, but stopped short of reversing firings or fully resurrecting the agency.

Leahy, who retired in 2023, told The Associated Press that it had been a lengthy process over the last 35 years to build the relationship by working with the Vietnamese to address the problems left behind.

“It is through these efforts that two former enemies are now partners. If we pack up and leave without finishing what we started, it will send a message that the Americans can't be trusted,” he wrote in an email.

“People in the Trump administration who know nothing and care less about these programs are arbitrarily jeopardizing relations with a strategic partner in one of the most challenging regions of the world.”

It's too early to say exactly how the abrupt decision will affect relations, but it is likely to call into question whether Washington is still a reliable partner in other dealings, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a political scientist who is a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.

“The level of trust gradually increased and it is very easy to dismantle,” he said, adding that Vietnam may now think twice before deepening military cooperation ties or purchasing American weapons.

“There is good reason for Hanoi to be very cautious.”

One joint program not affected by the USAID cuts is ongoing efforts to find and identify missing American troops, the Hawaii-based Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in Hawaii told the AP. Funding for the effort falls under the U.S. defense budget rather than foreign aid.

But funding for the effort to find and identify hundreds of thousands of missing Vietnamese war victims was cut, then reinstated, and it's still unclear whether money is again flowing, Rieser said.

And, he said, funds remain frozen for a new U.S. exhibit at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's main museum on the war, which is currently focused on documenting American atrocities like the My Lai massacre and the devastating impact of Agent Orange.

The exhibit, which was to open this year to coincide with the two anniversaries, highlights U.S. efforts to address the worst legacies of the war, Rieser said.

“Right now it's a museum of American war crimes, and the whole point of this is to show that we didn't just walk away from what happened, we decided to do something about it,” he said.

“We want that to be part of the story for the hundreds of thousands of visitors to that museum, to show that the United States didn't just walk away.”

Mourners held Muslim funeral prayers on Wednesday for four people killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza.

An international United Nations staffer was killed and five others were wounded in a strike Wednesday on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip, as Israel pressed on with a new offensive in the territory that shattered a fragile ceasefire with Hamas.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday that Israel will start urging Palestinians to evacuate from Gaza combat zones soon, as he warned that Israel was preparing to step up its new offensive.

The Israeli military recaptured part of a key corridor that cuts off northern Gaza from the south, deepening Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza. Israel shattered the ceasefire with Hamas on Tuesday in a wave of heavy strikes across the Gaza Strip. The bombardments have continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.



More than 400 Palestinians were killed, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, making Tuesday the deadliest day in Gaza after 17 months of war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Israel's defense minister warned Wednesday that attacks would increase “with an intensity that you have not known” until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. Hamas has yet to respond militarily, but Israel's advances threaten to drag the sides into all-out war again.



Here's the latest:

A Israeli airstrike in far northern Gaza killed at least 14 people and wounded 30 others, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.



The strike Wednesday evening hit a condolence gathering in the Salateen area of Beit Lahiya, according to Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's emergency service in northern Gaza.



An earlier airstrike killed at least five people in the southernmost city of Rafah, Palestinian first responders said. 



The strike hit a vehicle in the Musbah area on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Civil Defense agency, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The casualties were taken to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis, which confirmed the deaths.

Israel's military said the strike in Rafah targeted two Hamas militants and that its forces were “continuing extensive strikes throughout the Gaza Strip.”







Strikes hit Sanaa, Yemen's rebel-held capital, as well as their stronghold of Saada in the country's northwest on Wednesday night, the Houthi's al-Maisrah satellite news channel reported. 



At least seven women and two children were injured Wednesday in a U.S. airstrike in the Thurah district in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, said Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesman for the Houthi-run Health Ministry. The strike hit an under-construction public event hall, setting fire in the facility, he said, adding that many neighboring houses were damaged.



The Houthi news channel also said strikes happened overnight Tuesday, though the U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of places targeted since the airstrike campaign began. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others.







U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday stepped up his rhetoric regarding Yemen's Houthi rebels as the American military launched more airstrikes against the group, warning they “will be completely be annihilated.”



Trump made the comment on his website Truth Social. He claimed, without offering evidence, Iranian military support to the rebels “has lessened” but said it needed to entirely stop.



“Let the Houthis fight it out themselves,” he wrote. “Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse — It's not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!”



The Houthis said strikes against them continued overnight. The U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of the strikes.



Despite more than a year of U.S. strikes and naval patrols, experts say commercial shipping will likely continue to stay out of the region because of the Houthi threat.







Without naming Israel, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the deadly strike on a U.N. guesthouse in Gaza and called for an investigation.



Israel denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. But there have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Israel broke the ceasefire on Tuesday.



“The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them,” Guterres said in a statement via U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq.



The U.N. has not yet said which country the international staff member working in Gaza was from.







The new Syrian government wants to bring Syria's breakaway Kurdish militias back under government control, but the details of their recent breakthrough agreement are still being worked out and negotiators will have overcome a decade of civil war.



Government officials met Wednesday in the northeastern province of Hassakeh with the commander of the main Kurdish-led group in the country, the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by the U.S.



The meeting comes a week after Syria's interim government signed a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the SDF into the Syrian army.



The deal should be implemented by the end of the year. It would bring northeast Syria's borders and lucrative oil fields under the central government's control.







Palestinians living close to a U.N. building in Gaza that was hit by a deadly strike on Wednesday say the facility had been struck multiple times by tank shelling in recent days.



Naief al-Lahham said the building was hit by tank shelling Tuesday evening, but it didn't result in casualties.



On Wednesday morning, he heard two explosions minutes apart, he told the AP, adding that the attack came from an Israeli position just east of the building. A U.N. staffer was killed and at least five others wounded.



The explosion shook al-Lahham's house, damaging its windows. He said he was lightly injured by pieces of glass.



The U.N. says it had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility's location. Israel denies targeting the U.N. compound.







A spokesman for Hamas said Israel's closure of the main north-south route in Gaza, the Salahuddin road, is part of Israel's “blockade on Gaza.” 



“The Zionist occupation, under American cover and international silence, is destroying life in Gaza and reneging on the signed agreement,” Abdel-Latif al-Qanou said in a statement Wednesday.



Israel has closed all Gaza's border crossings since the beginning of the month and banned the entry of food and other supplies. There had been a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the ceasefire.



Al-Qanoua said Hamas is willing to engage with any proposal leading to starting negotiations on implementing the ceasefire's second phase.



He said the only person who benefits from resuming the war is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while it “threatens the life of the hostages in Gaza.”



Both Israel and the United States blame the renewed hostilities on Hamas' refusal to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war proceed — which was not part of the ceasefire agreement.







As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which it had used as a military zone and which bisected northern Gaza from the south.



The move appeared to deepen the renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza, which shattered the two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas.







In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Israel was preparing to step up its new offensive.



Katz said that if the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are not freed, “Israel will act with an intensity that you have not seen.”



Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remained of their homes and Israeli forces had pulled back to a buffer zone during the ceasefire in Gaza, which began in late January.







The clashes along the Lebanon-Syria border, where smuggling is widespread, was the worst fighting there since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government in December.



The fighting happened after Syria's interim government accused militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting and killing three soldiers. Hezbollah denied involvement and some other reports pointed to local clans in the border region that are not directly affiliated with Hezbollah but have been involved in cross-border smuggling. The Lebanese government said the three Syrians killed were smugglers.



The Lebanese Health Ministry said seven people in Lebanon were killed in the fighting, and 52 others were wounded. Four Syrian journalists embedded with the Syrian army were lightly wounded after an artillery shell fired from the Lebanese side of the border hit their position.







An international United Nations staffer was killed and at least five others were wounded in a strike on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip, a U.N. official said Wednesday.



Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike but said the explosive ordnance was “dropped or fired” and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. UNOPS operates the mechanism tracking aid trucks into Gaza, does demining and helps bring fuel in.



He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded.



The Israeli military, which has carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes since early Tuesday, denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. There have been no reports of rocket fire or other Palestinian militant attacks.



Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the staffer was killed. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility's location.



“Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said.







The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 436 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel launched a wave of heavy airstrikes early Tuesday.



The ministry said another 678 people have been wounded in the strikes, which continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.



The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.



The ministry said at least 183 children and 94 women have been killed since the strikes began early Tuesday. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

The Israeli military has denied striking a United Nations compound in central Gaza.



Gaza's Health Ministry said an Israeli strike on a U.N. building in Gaza on Wednesday wounded five international staffers.



There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials.



“Contrary to reports, the (Israeli military) did not strike a U.N. compound” in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the army said in a statement.







French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel's airstrikes are “tragic step backwards” for the Palestinian people and for Gaza, and for Israeli hostages and their families.



Macron, speaking alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II on a visit to France, called for an immediate end to hostilities and resumption of negotiations including with the U.S. administration toward a permanent ceasefire and the release of all hostages.



The two leaders were also expected to discuss the need to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and restoring access to water and electricity in the Palestinian territory, Macron's office said.

Malaysia said it will accept 15 Palestinians who were released from Israeli jails and exiled as part of the January ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.



Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said in remarks published Wednesday in The Star newspaper that the move was a small contribution from Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, to ensure peace in Gaza.



Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told local media that security agencies would strictly monitor the Palestinians' movement once they arrive.







Lebanon's state news agency said a U.N. peacekeeper was wounded when a mine exploded in the country's south. 



National News Agency did not give further details about the blast between the villages of Zibqine and Yater, near the border with Israel.



Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, confirmed that a peacekeeper was wounded during an operational activity and was taken to a Beirut hospital for surgery.

The Gaza Health Ministry says an Israeli strike has wounded five international U.N. workers.



It says they were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in central Gaza after their headquarters was struck on Wednesday.



It was not clear which U.N. body they were affiliated with. There was no immediate comment from U.N. spokespeople or the Israeli military.



Israel launched a wave of airstrike across Gaza on Tuesday, killing over 400 Palestinians, according to the ministry. Israel says it targeted Hamas militants.







Thousands of Israelis marched in Jerusalem on Wednesday to protest a resumption of the war in the Gaza Strip, fearing it could further endanger some two dozen hostages held by Hamas.



A sea of Israeli flags could be seen outside the Israeli parliament a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shattered a fragile ceasefire by launching heavy strikes on Gaza. 



Families and supporters of the hostages fear renewed fighting could be a death sentence for their loved ones in captivity. The hostages “are waiting for us to take them out and to bring them home, but war will not do it. Only negotiations will do it,” protester Alon Shirizly said.



Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, including 24 who are believed to be alive.



The demonstrators are also protesting Netanyahu's plan to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency, the latest in a series of moves that his critics view as an assault on Israeli democracy.

A government statement on Wednesday said Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, regained his portfolio as national security minister. He had left the coalition in January to protest the ceasefire with Hamas.



His return strengthens Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition ahead of a crucial budget vote this month and improves its chances of surviving until the next scheduled elections in October 2026.



Ben-Gvir supports the full resumption of the war with the aim of annihilating Hamas, depopulating Gaza through what he refers to as the voluntary migration of Palestinians and rebuilding Jewish settlements there.

Live view from outside Istanbul's City Hall after Turkish police arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a popular opposition leader and a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor — a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  — and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. The detention of Ekrem Imamoglu was a dramatic escalation in a crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.

The state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued warrants for Imamoglu and some 100 other people. Police raided his residence near dawn and detained the mayor at around 7:30 a.m., his wife said. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun and two district mayors.

Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Turkish police have arrested Istanbul's mayor, part of a series of probes into alleged corruption and terror links.

“We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,” Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video post on social media.

Authorities closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.

Despite the ban, people gathered at Istanbul's police headquarters, carrying posters of the mayor and banners with his photo around their shoulders. Others chanted slogans and raised their fists in the air as riot police cordoned off the facility.




Thousands of people later joined a rally outside the city hall, where the leader of the mayor's party, the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, accused the government of carrying out a “coup.”

“Let's call it what it is: a coup attempt,” Ozgur Ozel told the crowd. “Today, the will of the people is being seized and usurped through a judicial coup targeting the people of Istanbul.”

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters the arrests had nothing to do with the government. “Linking investigations and cases initiated by the judiciary to our President is, at best, presumptuous and inappropriate,” he said.

Erdogan, a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. His current term runs until 2028 but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer — something he could achieve with a constitutional change or if early elections are called.

The Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over the news, triggering a temporary halt in trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. Trading later resumed but was again halted in the afternoon. The Turkish lira lost some 3.5% of its value against the dollar.

Anadolu, the news agency, said that Imamoglu and several others are suspected of a multitude of financial irregularities. 

Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the agency said. The PKK, behind a decadeslong insurgency in Turkey, is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies. 

The Istanbul chief public prosecutor's office later obtained a court order for authorities to seize a construction company partly owned by Imamoglu, based on reports from the the country's Financial Crimes Investigation Board, HaberTurk and other media reports said.

A day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from the next presidential race — a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.

The mayor's party was to hold a primary on Sunday where he was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. With all the arrests Wednesday, that vote was in doubt but Ozel, the party's chairman, said it would go ahead as planned.

In a message conveyed through his lawyer, Imamoglu said his morale was high and encouraged his supporters to “keep their spirits high.”

“We will emerge stronger from this process,” his lawyer Mehmet Pehlivan quoted him as saying.

Earlier, hundreds also gathered outside CHP's headquarters in Ankara as the party's lawmakers protested inside the parliament, disrupting proceedings before marching out.

Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody. 

Imamoglu's arrest was a “disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,” Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.

Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock describing the arrests as a “blow to democracy in Turkey.”

“We are seeing clearly that the space for opposition politicians is getting smaller and smaller,” she said.

Turkey has been trying for decades to join the European Union, but its accession process is held up over concerns about its commitment to democracy and other values like respect for the rule of law.

“The arrest of the mayor is deeply concerning,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Brussels. “Turkey must uphold the democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials.”

Amnesty International said Imamoglu's detention marked an escalation in Turkey's crackdown on the opposition.

“While the weaponization of vague anti-terrorism allegations to detain and prosecute opponents is not new, these latest detentions and associated restrictions represent an alarming intensification of the targeting of real or perceived critics,” said Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty's deputy director for Europe.

Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X even as he himself was being arrested, though at the time he apparently didn't know that Imamoglu was also being taken into custody.

“I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation,” Ongun said.

Separately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.

Meanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.

In nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its business faculty, a decision Imamoglu said he would challenge.

Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.

He is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Tesla has been removed from participating in this week's Vancouver International Auto Show over safety concerns, the event's executive director said Tuesday. 

Eric Nicholl said in a statement that the show asked the electric carmaker to withdraw because of a “primary concern” for the safety of workers, attendees and exhibitors.

Nicholl said Tesla was provided “multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw.”

“This decision will ensure all attendees can be solely focused on enjoying the many positive elements of the event,” the statement said.

The show at the Vancouver Convention Centre begins Wednesday and will end Sunday.

The automaker's removal comes after so-called “Tesla Takedown” protests over the weekend, including in Ottawa and Vancouver, that denounced Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump, who has infuriated Canadians with talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state. 

About two dozen protesters had gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Surrey, British Columbia, on Sunday, the day after a similar protest in Vancouver, holding signs with messages including “elbows up,” “Elon be-gone” and “democracy dies in apathy.”

Pat McCutcheon, who attended the Surrey protest, said in an interview on Tuesday that the organizers of the auto show did the right thing by removing Tesla.

“Given the temperature of the situation, there are people, unfortunately, out there that are very annoyed with the Tesla situation and the Elon Musk situation,” said McCutcheon.




He said he had heard nothing about any protests at the auto show, but said there was a “fair amount of emotion” surrounding Tesla.

“The last thing you want (for) one of your organizations is for there to be some vandalism or some physical confrontation. So, I think they made the right decision,” he said.

McCutcheon said he is organizing a protest outside a Langley, British Columbia Tesla dealership this weekend.

“Elon Musk is using his extraordinary wealth to basically corrupt democracy and do what he wants to do, and citizens, both in the United States, Canada, globally, need to push back on this,” said McCutcheon.

Last week, British Columbia Hydro banned Tesla products from its electric vehicle rebate program as part of the provincial government's move to give preference to Canadian goods and exclude U.S. ones from rebates if practical amid the ongoing Canada-U.S. trade war.

IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region. 

The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic. 

Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.

“Arctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,” Carney said. ““Canada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.”

The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.

“This will be a significant export if this deal is finalized,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. 

 Albanese had a phone call with Carney the prior night. 

“Obviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn't have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,” Albanese said. 

Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries. 




But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. 

Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada's Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a “greater sustained year-round presence.”

The prime minister's flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump's interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively “America First” foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.

“The United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,” Carney said. 

Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week. 

The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum. 

Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the “appropriate time” he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as “two sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.”

But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that “Canada was meant to be the 51st state.”

He said that's why he's he's tougher on his neighbor than America's biggest adversaries.

Trump also repeated several times that he didn't care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now. 

“The Conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don't know, but he said negative things,” Trump said. “So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less. I think it's easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all.”

Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.

For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada's central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.

It is a distinctive destination — home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light — with no road or rail links to the outside world.

Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.

Drones whined overhead and explosions rattled the night as Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.

DEIR EL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli bombs began falling before dawn, lighting the sky with orange flares and shattering the stillness.



The surprise wave of airstrikes plunged Palestinians back into a nightmare they had hoped might be behind them.

The bombs crashed across Gaza early Tuesday, setting fire to a sprawling tent camp in the southern city of Khan Younis and flattening a Hamas-run prison. They hit the Al-Tabaeen shelter in Gaza City, where Majid Nasser was sleeping with his family.



“I went out to see where the bombing was. Suddenly the second strike happened in the room next to us,” he said. “I heard screaming, my mother and sister screaming, calling for help. I came and entered the room and found the children under the rubble.” Everyone was injured, but alive.



Palestinians tried to claw bodies from the wreckage with their bare hands. Parents arrived at hospitals, barefoot, carrying children who were limp and covered in ash. Streets and hospitals filled with bodies.



By midday, over 400 people had been killed. It was one of the deadliest days of the 17-month war, following two months of ceasefire.

During the truce that began on Jan. 19, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza had returned to their homes, many of them destroyed. A surge of aid brought food and medicines — until Israel cut off aid two weeks ago to pressure the Hamas militant group into accepting a new proposal instead of continuing with the truce.



The Muslim holy month of Ramadan had even provided moments of joy as families held communal sunset meals ending each day's fast without the fear of bombardment.



Instead, the war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction was back with full force.



“What is happening to us is hell. Hell in every sense of the word,” said Zeyad Abed, as he stood among the blackened remains of tents in Khan Younis.

Fedaa Heriz, a displaced woman in Gaza City, said victims were killed in their sleep just before the predawn meal ahead of the daily Ramadan fast.



“They set the alarm to wake up for suhoor, and they wake up to death? They don't wake up?” she screamed.



Fedaa Hamdan lost her husband and their two children in the strikes in Khan Younis.



“My children died while they were hungry,” she said, as funeral prayers were held over their bodies.

Scenes at hospitals recalled the early days of the war, when Israel launched a massive bombardment of Gaza in response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.



Survivors on Tuesday held rushed funeral rites over dozens of body bags lining the yard of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Mothers sobbed over the bloodied bodies of children, as warplanes hummed overhead. Doctors struggled to treat the flow of wounded.



“A level of horror and evil that is really hard to articulate. It felt like Armageddon,” said Dr. Tanya-Haj Hassan, a volunteer with the Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.



She described the Nasser Hospital emergency room in Khan Younis as chaos, with patients, including children, spread across the floor. Some were still wrapped in the blankets they had slept in.



Dr. Ismail Awad with the Doctors Without Borders aid group said the clinic received about 26 wounded people, including a woman seven months pregnant with shrapnel in her neck. She later died.



“It was overwhelming, the number of patients,” Awad said.



At the Al-Attar clinic in Muwasi in southern Gaza, medical staff said they were forced to operate without light bulbs and emergency ventilation devices.



Israel not only blocked all supplies from entering Gaza two weeks ago but also cut off electricity to the territory's main desalination plant last week. That has again created scarcities in medicine, food, fuel and fresh water for Gaza's over 2 million people.

New Israeli evacuation orders covering Gaza's eastern flank next to Israel and stretching into a key corridor dividing Gaza's north and south sent Palestinians fleeing again.



Israel's Arabic-language military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, published a map on X telling Palestinians in those areas, including highly populated neighborhoods, to leave immediately and head for shelters.



“Continuing to remain in the designated areas puts your life and the lives of your family members at risk,” he said.



The evacuation zone appeared to include parts of Gaza's main north-south road, raising questions about how people might travel. Palestinians nevertheless gathered their belongings and set out, hardly knowing where to go.






UNICEF spokesperson Rosalia Bollen recalled that the days before the bombardment felt uneasy. She could sense fear. Children would ask if she believed the war would start again.



“This nightmare scenario has been on everyone's mind,” she said. “It's just heartbreaking that it is materializing right now and that it is shattering the last piece of hope that people had.”

Russia's illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine exactly 11 years ago on March 18, 2014, was quick and bloodless, but it sent Moscow's relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War.



It also paved the way for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, during which Moscow annexed more land from the war-torn country. 



A look at the diamond-shaped peninsula in the Black Sea, coveted by both Russia and Ukraine for its naval bases and beaches:

Crimea's unique location makes it a strategically important asset, and Russia has spent centuries fighting for it.



Crimea was home to Turkic-speaking Tatars when the Russian empire first annexed it in the 18th century. It briefly regained independence two centuries later before being swallowed by the Soviet Union.



In 1944, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported nearly 200,000 Tatars, or about a third of Crimea's population, to Central Asia, 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) to the east. Stalin had accused them of collaborating with Nazi Germany — a claim widely dismissed by historians. An estimated half of them died in the next 18 months of hunger and harsh conditions.







Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the peninsula became part of newly independent Ukraine.



Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it.






Sevastopol also was a preferred holiday destination for Nicholas II, the last Russian czar. The southern town of Yalta was a prime holiday destination in Soviet times, with many sanatoriums there. It drew worldwide renown when Stalin, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met there in 1945 to discuss the fate of Germany and Europe after World War II.

For Kyiv, Crimea had been a strategic asset, too. By the time Russia annexed it in 2014, it had been a part of Ukraine for 60 years and had become part of the country's identity. 



Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine, said Kyiv had invested some $100 billion into the peninsula between 1991 and 2014.



From a security perspective, Ukraine needs Crimea in order to have control over activities in the Black Sea.

In 2014, a massive popular uprising in Ukraine forced pro-Moscow President Victor Yanukovich from office. 



Putin responded by sending troops to overrun Crimea — they appeared on the peninsula in uniforms without insignia — and calling a plebiscite on joining Russia that Ukraine and the West dismissed as illegal.



Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea was recognized internationally only by countries such as North Korea and Sudan. In Russia, it touched off a wave of patriotism, and “Krym nash!” — or “Crimea is ours!” — became a rallying cry. 



This move sent Putin's popularity soaring. His approval rating, which had declined to 65% in January 2014, shot to 86% in June, according to the Levada Center, an independent Russian pollster.

Putin has called Crimea “a sacred place,” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine. Repressions against the Crimean Tatars continued under Putin, despite Moscow's denials of discrimination. They strongly opposed the annexation, and an estimated 30,000 of them fled the peninsula between 2014 and 2021. 



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retake it and said that Russia “won't be able to steal” the peninsula. 



Russia's relations with the West plummeted to new lows. The United States, the European Union and other countries imposed sanctions on Moscow and its officials. 



Weeks after the annexation, fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine between pro-Kremlin militias and Kyiv's forces. Moscow threw its weight behind the insurgents, even though the Kremlin denied supporting them with troops and weapons. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court's finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.



Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles.



The fighting in eastern Ukraine continued, on and off, until February 2022, when Putin recognized the two war-torn Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states and several days later launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In its assault on Ukraine, Moscow deployed troops and weapons to Crimea, allowing Russian forces to quickly seize large parts of southern Ukraine in the first weeks of the war.



A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin insisted on calling its “special military operation” in Ukraine. 



Before the invasion, Zelenskyy focused on diplomatic efforts to get Crimea back, but after Russian troops rolled across the border, Kyiv started publicly contemplating retaking the peninsula by force.



The peninsula soon became a battleground, with Ukraine launching drone attacks and bombing it to try to dislodge Moscow's hold on the territory. 



The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin's prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022 and again in July 2023.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A new anti-LGBTQ+ law banning Pride events and allowing authorities to use facial recognition software to identify those attending the festivities was passed in Hungary on Tuesday, leading to a large demonstration on the streets of Budapest.



Several thousand protesters chanting anti-government slogans gathered after the vote outside Hungary's parliament. They later staged a blockade of the Margaret Bridge over the Danube, blocking traffic and disregarding police instructions to leave the area. 



The move by Hungarian lawmakers is part of a crackdown on the country's LGBTQ+ community by the nationalist-populist party of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.



The measure, which is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia, was passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orbán's Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted on Monday.



Opposing legislators led a vivid protest in the legislature involving rainbow-colored smoke bombs. 



At the protest outside parliament, Evgeny Belyakov, a Russian citizen who immigrated to Hungary after facing repression in Russia, said the legislation went at the heart of people's rights to peacefully assemble.

“It's quite terrifying to be honest, because we had the same in Russia. It was building up step by step, and I feel like this is what is going on here,” he said. “I just only hope that there will be more resistance like this in Hungary, because in Russia we didn't resist on time and now it's too late.”



The bill amends Hungary's law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18.



Attending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to “child protection,” according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event.



In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organizers said the aim of the law was to “scapegoat” the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán's government.



“This is not child protection, this is fascism,” wrote the organizers of the event, which attracts thousands each year and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.



Following the law's passage Tuesday, Budapest Pride spokesperson Jojó Majercsik told The Associated Press that despite Orbán's yearslong effort to stigmatize LGBTQ+ people, the organization had received an outpouring of support since the Hungarian leader hinted in February that his government would take steps to ban the event.



“Many, many people have been mobilized,” Majercsik said. “It's a new thing, compared to the attacks of the last years, that we've received many messages and comments from people saying, ‘Until now I haven't gone to Pride, I didn't care about it, but this year I'll be there and I'll bring my family.'” 







The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.



In 2022, the European Union's executive commission filed a case with the EU's highest court against Hungary's 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law “discriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.”



Hungary's “child protection” law — aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature — also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”



Booksellers in Hungary have faced hefty fines for failing to wrap books that contain LGBTQ+ themes in closed packaging. Critics have argued Orbán's campaign amounts to an attempt to cut LGBTQ+ visibility, and that by tying it to child protection, it falsely conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. 



Hungary's government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.”







Hungary's methods resemble tactics by Putin, who in December 2022 expanded Russia's ban on “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations” from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities.



Orbán, in power since 2010, faces an unprecedented challenge from a rising opposition party as Hungary's economy struggles to emerge from an inflation and cost of living crisis and an election approaches in 2026. 



Tamás Dombos, a project coordinator at Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, said that Orbán's assault on minorities was a tactic to distract voters from more important issues facing the country. He said allowing the use of facial recognition software at prohibited demonstrations could be used against other protests the government chooses to deem unlawful. 



“It's a very common strategy of authoritarian governments not to talk about the real issues that people are affected by: the inflation, the economy, the terrible condition of education and health care,” Dombos said.



Orbán, he continued, “has been here with us for 15 years lying into people's faces, letting the country rot basically, and then coming up with these hate campaigns.”

The strikes have killed more than 400 people and wounded hundreds more, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which says over half the dead are women and children.

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, saying it was striking dozens of Hamas targets in its heaviest assault in the territory since a ceasefire took effect in January. Palestinian officials reported at least 235 deaths.

Israel launched new strikes against Hamas early on Tuesday and promised ‘increasing military force' after talks on on further hostage releases stalled.

Drones whined overhead and explosions rattled the night as Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that killed more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, shattering a ceasefire in place since January as it vowed to force Hamas to release more hostages and relinquish control of the territory.



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to free half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for extending the ceasefire. Israel's deadliest bombardment of the territory in the 17-month war killed mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.



Netanyahu said the attack was “only the beginning” and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.

Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday's strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas' civilian government, a justice ministry official and two security agency chiefs.



All further ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire,” he said in a statement aired on national television. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions.



The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians.

The pre-dawn barrage across Gaza struck homes and shelters and set a tent camp ablaze as families slept or prepared the “sohour,” the meal Muslims eat before they start the daily fast in the holy month of Ramadan. In Gaza City, Omar Greygaa said that after the strikes, he ran out to help survivors in a nearby stricken building. 



“In every room I found the dead. ... I finish in one place and go to another, and I find more dead,” he said. “I don't know if we're in a state of war or truce.”



The attack could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.



A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu's decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.

There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.



But Yemen's Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel's southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country's territory, the military said. The U.S. over the weekend launched deadly strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis.



Israel's return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial  was canceled after the strikes. 



The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.



The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of “deliberately dismantling” the ceasefire. Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square Tuesday evening to protest Netanyahu's intention to fire the country's domestic security chief and demand the government to resume negotiations for a hostage deal.



“Today Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the hostages.

After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.



“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”



A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.



By noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.



At Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group. 



She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don't know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.



Gaza's Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry's records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.



In his statement Tuesday, Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian casualties, saying it operates among the population.

The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children. 



The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.







The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”



The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.



An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.



The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.

Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.



But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives. 



Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.



Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.



A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. 



It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The presidents of Congo and neighboring Rwanda met Tuesday in Qatar for their first direct talks since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this year.

The meeting between Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame to discuss the insurgency was mediated by Qatar, the three governments said in a statement. The state-run Qatar News Agency published an image of the two African leaders meeting with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the energy-rich nation's ruling emir. 

Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed their commitment to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, but the joint statement offered no specifics on how that ceasefire would be implemented or monitored.

The summit came as a previous attempt to bring Congo's government and M23 leaders together for ceasefire negotiations failed. The rebels pulled out Monday after the European Union announced sanctions on rebel leaders. 

Qatar has hosted peace talks between Afghanistan's Taliban and the United States, Chad and rebel forces and over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

A diplomat briefed on the meeting said both Tshisekedi and Kagame had formally requested Qatar's mediation for the talks, which the diplomat said were informal and aimed at building trust rather than resolving all outstanding issues. The diplomat spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.




Peace talks between Congo and Rwanda were unexpectedly canceled in December after Rwanda made the signing of a peace agreement conditional on a direct dialogue between Congo and the M23 rebels, which Congo refused at the time.

The conflict in eastern Congo escalated in January when the Rwanda-backed rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world's most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo's capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.

The U.N. Human Rights Council last month launched a commission to investigate atrocities, including allegations of rape and killing akin to “summary executions” by both sides.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — When a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began two months ago, Herut Nimrodi knew it would take time before her son was released from captivity in Gaza. The 20-year-old soldier was meant to be part of the second phase of the deal winding down the war.



But with Israel's surprise bombardment of Gaza, she fears he might not come home at all.



“I really wanted to believe that there is still a chance to reach a second stage without renewing this war. But it feels like my building of hope has collapsed, and I have no idea what to do next,” Nimrodi said Tuesday.

Herut Nimrodi poses for a portrait with a poster of her son, Tamir Nimrodi, an Israeli soldier who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, at a rally in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Jan. 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo, File)





Nearly 60 families have relatives still held in Gaza. About two dozen hostages are believed to be alive.



During the ceasefire's first phase, which began in January, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. But since that phase ended early this month, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward.



Israel's renewed airstrikes threaten to end the fragile deal.



Nimrodi's son, Tamir, was abducted from his army base when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. She's had no sign of life. He hasn't been declared dead by Israel.



“It's so sad that this is the only solution that they could find,” she said, lamenting the government's decision.










The strikes early Tuesday killed more than 400 people and shattered a relative calm — along with hopes of ending the war that has killed over 48,000 Palestinians.



Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the airstrikes because of lack of progress in talks to extend the ceasefire. Officials called the operation open-ended.



The return to fighting could deepen the painful debate in Israel over the fate of the remaining hostages.



Netanyahu and his hardline governing partners believe renewing the war will put pressure on Hamas to free them and move Israel closer to its goal of destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities.

But most hostage families, and large parts of the Israeli public, believe such goals are unrealistic. They say time is running out, particularly after the recent releases of emaciated-looking hostages who later described harsh conditions in captivity.



Hamas accused Netanyahu of upending the ceasefire and exposing the hostages ”to an unknown fate.”



Families of hostages called on supporters to protest with them outside Israel's parliament Tuesday.



Some families who already know their relatives in Gaza are dead called the government's decision unacceptable. 



“This is not only a disaster in every way, shape or form on how the hostages keep suffering, being chained to walls, starved, abused, but also the death toll that keeps rising on the Gazan side,” Udi Goren said.



His cousin Tal Haimi was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken into Gaza. Goren said the international community must pressure Hamas, Israel and the mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — to end the war.



“Returning to fighting? Did you listen to a word of what we, the returnees released in the last deal, have been saying to you?” former hostage Omer Wenkert wrote on Instagram.



Romi Gonen, among the first hostages to be freed in the ceasefire's first phase, said she would never forget what it felt like in captivity to hear the bombs after previous ceasefire talks collapsed and realize she wouldn't be freed any time soon.



“I beg you, the people of Israel, we must continue to fight for them,” she said on Instagram.



Sylvia Cunio, whose two sons are held hostage, accused Israel's leaders of not having a heart.



“It isn't right to continue the fighting. I want my children back home already. If he wants to kill me, the prime minister, let him do that already because I won't get through this,” she said on local radio.



Nimrodi said she's worried the airstrikes might not only harm her son and the other hostages but also make their living conditions worse.



The last time she saw Tamir, he was a funny teenager who rode horses and loved learning about geology and astronomy, she said. The two had a similar humor and used to talk about everything.



While she's terrified of what's to come, she said she won't stop fighting to see him again.



“Please, keep strong, survive,” she said, addressing him. “So there's a chance for us to meet once more.”

Authorities in North Macedonia are appealing for calm as protests have again been held across the country over the nightclub fire in the eastern town of Kocani that killed 59 people over the weekend.

KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — Municipal workers in Kocani dug graves Tuesday for the dozens of young people killed in a nightclub fire as protests were held in cities across North Macedonia.

Authorities said the nightclub blaze in the eastern town early Sunday was caused by indoor use of pyrotechnics and numerous safety violations at the venue, killing 59 people and injuring more than 150 during a live concert.

The fire has sparked outrage over alleged bribery and corruption linked to the safety violations at the nightclub.

Crews used excavators to dig rows of graves in Kocani as the town awaits the burial of young residents whose remains are still being processed for identification.

”It's very bad, very bad. I have been crying for three days,” resident Dragi Ignjatov said. “Children of our friends are gone. It can't be worse than this, for Macedonia and for our city.”

Late Tuesday, rallies were held in solidarity with the victims' families, with thousands gathering in the capital, Skopje, holding up candles and cell phone flashlights during the nighttime event.

Pensioner Zoran Jovanovski said he hoped the tragedy would trigger reforms to fight corruption. “The solution is very hard. There needs to be a change in mentality ... a different way to run this country,” he said.

Government officials appealed for calm after some demonstrations a day earlier had turned violent. Protesters in Kocani overturned a van, hurled rocks at a municipal building, and smashed a cafeteria believed to have shared ownership with the nightclub.

Investigations have so far revealed that the club was operating at least double its 250-person capacity without proper licensing. Officials say the numerous safety violations included no emergency exits, insufficient fire equipment, the use of flammable cladding and no sprinkler system. Many victims were trampled as panicked concertgoers rushed toward a single exit.

Neighboring Serbia and Bulgaria, which immediately offered assistance following the tragedy, are observing a day of national mourning Tuesday in solidarity with North Macedonia.

Medical specialists from the Czech Republic, Serbia and Israel have arrived to support treatment efforts for the injured, Health Ministry officials said. The European Union is helping transport burn victims to nearby countries.

Around 50 patients are being treated in mostly neighboring and nearby countries, the majority of them with serious burns.

The disaster has intensified scrutiny of corruption in North Macedonia, which the EU has previously identified as a major obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc. Authorities are investigating allegations that club owners bribed officials to bypass safety regulations.

The government has ordered nationwide inspections of all nightclubs and other entertainment venues.

In neighboring Greece, North Macedonia's foreign affairs and health ministers visited a hospital where three burn victims, aged 19, 25 and 26, are being treated in intensive care. 

Foreign Minister Timco Mucunski described the fire as “the most tragic moment in the history of my nation.”

Speaking to reporters in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, he added: “This is a moment that will most likely remain in our collective memory for our lifetimes. But what will also remain in our collective memory – and we must never forget – is the solidarity that we have received.”

LONDON (AP) — Britain's Labour Party government on Tuesday announced an overhaul of the welfare system that it says will save the cash-strapped administration 5 billion pounds ($6.5 billion). Critics claim it will harm some of the U.K.'s most vulnerable people.

The government says the shakeup will help people who are currently “written off” find jobs. It's a risky strategy for a party founded more than a century ago to fight for the rights of working people, and it has made trade unions and party supporters uneasy.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the government had inherited a broken social security system that is “failing the very people it is supposed to help and holding our country back.”

She said Britain's statistics are stark, with one in 10 working-age people claiming a sickness or disability benefit, and “millions of people who could work trapped on benefits.”

Blaming the Conservatives, who lost power in July after 14 years, for damaging the economy and health system, Kendall said “the social security system will always be there for people in genuine need.”

But she announced changes to the way disabilities are assessed. Campaigners say that will make it harder for people to get and keep benefits.

The changes, which will have to be approved by Parliament, are expected to save more than 5 billion pounds by 2030.




Not everything is being cut. The overhaul also includes an above-inflation increase to universal credit, one of the most common welfare benefits. Kendall said 1 billion pounds will be spent to “tear down barriers to work,” including new rules allowing welfare recipients to try out paid jobs without losing their benefits.

The government claims a lack of support towards employment is trapping sick and disabled people in economic inactivity. Kendall said that “in most comparable countries” spending on sickness and disability benefits “is either stable or falling – whilst ours continues to inexorably rise.”

The Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organizations, said the “cruel” changes “will largely hit those who are unable to work and rely on these benefits to survive.”

Sarah Hughes, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said the cuts would make it harder for people to get support and “will only serve to deepen the nation's mental health crisis.”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's center-left government has seen its popularity plummet as it grapples with a sluggish economy and creaking public services.

Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is due to make a spring budget statement on March 26, and is expected to trim public spending to make up for lower-than-expected tax takings and high borrowing costs.

Tuesday's welfare announcement followed weeks of speculation about how deep the cuts would be.

Labour lawmaker Imran Hussain said that “thousands of the most severely disabled people in my constituency, and millions across the U.K., have watched in disbelief as politicians debate cuts to the support that enables their very survival, leaving many at breaking point.”

Kendall said she understood “the worry and anxiety.”

“And I hope I've made it clear to the House today, I don't start from a position of being tough,” she said. “I start by precisely from a position of compassion.”

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The parents of a U.S. college student who vanished almost two weeks ago in the resort town of Punta Cana have asked authorities to declare her legally dead.

In a letter to Dominican police dated Monday, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki state that after an extensive search, local authorities believe that Sudiksha, a 20-year-old student at the University of Pittsburgh, drowned.

“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”

A police official not authorized to speak about the case confirmed Tuesday that authorities received the letter.

Michael Chapman, sheriff of Loudoun County in Virginia, where the Konankis live, said in a statement Tuesday that officials have been working with Dominican authorities and continue to review evidence in the case. 

“The disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki is tragic, and we cannot imagine the grief her family has been feeling,” he said. “Sudiksha's family has expressed their belief that she drowned. While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible.”

Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break. Police said she disappeared at a beach by her hotel before dawn on March 6.




Authorities have interviewed people who were with Konanki before she vanished, including Joshua Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud University in Minnesota.

Riibe has been detained by Dominican police and is believed to be the last person to see Konanki. He has not been named as a suspect.

On Tuesday, a judge ordered Riibe's release, saying he can cooperate with authorities without being detained.

“All parties say that he has cooperated in everything that has been asked of him,” Judge Edwin Rijo said, adding that Riibe is a witness and as such, cannot be detained.

Riibe had appeared in court Tuesday afternoon following a request from his attorney that he be released. So many journalists showed up to cover the hours-long hearing that it was moved to a bigger courtroom.

Before the ruling, prosecutors told the judge that Riibe was not under arrest and that he was free to move around the hotel where he is staying. They said Riibe told them he lost his passport, although Riibe said in court that officials seized his passport and cell phone.

“I really want to be able to go home and talk to my family, give them hugs,” Riibe told the judge via a translator. “I understand that I'm here to help. I've done that. It's been 10 days.”

According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in the ocean when they got caught in a current. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and helped bring her ashore.

He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance.

In their letter, the Konankis wrote that “the individual” last seen with their daughter is cooperating and that no evidence of foul play has been found.

Sudiksha Konanki was born in India and later became a U.S. permanent resident.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul and a popular figure, had basked in the glow of what he often jokingly dubbed his political miracle — the only person to have beaten Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party in not one, but three local elections.

On Wednesday, dozens of police officers raided his residence around dawn and detained him for questioning as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links.

Many see the arrest as part of a broader campaign to undermine the mayor and eliminate a key challenger to Erdogan before the next presidential elections. The move has raised concerns about the fairness of future elections under Erdogan who has grown increasingly authoritarian during his more than two-decade rule as prime minister and president.

It is also the latest in a string of crackdowns on opponents and dissenters in Turkey in recent years.

When the 53-year-old businessman and former district mayor was chosen to run as mayor for Turkey's largest city and economic hub in 2019, he was largely an unknown figure and many skeptics questioned the decision. The former leader of his pro-secular Republican People's Party, or CHP, reassured critics that once the people got to know him, his charm would resonate with voters.

Imamoglu went on to win the election, delivering a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The loss of Istanbul was a significant setback to Erdogan who himself had launched his political career as the mayor of the metropolis of 16 million.




Imamoglu was able to serve as mayor for just 18 days before the election result was annulled and his mandate was revoked over alleged vote irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won - with a larger margin.

In an interview with The Associated Press at the time, Imamoglu said: “I believe the people of Istanbul will give the necessary response to this injustice at the polls as a result of their belief in democracy. And God willing, the victors will be Istanbul and democracy.”

The mayor went on to win last year's local elections when the CHP made significant gains amid a sharp economic decline.

On Sunday, the CHP was scheduled to hold a primary election where Imamoglu is to be nominated its candidate for the presidency. The party's leader has said the primary will go ahead despite Imamoglu's detention.

“Imamoglu is very relatable, very likeable for the common voter,” said Soner Cagaptay, an expert on Turkey at the Washington Institute, adding that no CHP leader has managed to build a “base of adoring supporters until Imamoglu entered the stage.”

The raid on Imamoglu's residence and his arrest came after Istanbul prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the mayor and more than 100 other people as part of investigations into alleged corruption, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency.

The suspects are accused of alleged racketeering and a multitude of other financial crimes. 

The mayor is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections. The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.

The CHP and other opposition critics see a politically motivated plot against one of Turkey's most popular politicians and accuse Erdogan's government of carrying out a “coup” to prevent his political rise. The justice minister has rejected the claims of alleged government pressure over the courts, insisting the judiciary was acting impartially.

Opinion polls have indicated that Imamoglu could defeat Erdogan if he ran for president.

Cagaptay said Erdogan had numerous ways to undermine Imamoglu's candidacy, such as leveraging his control over media, institutions and the judiciary, as well as exploiting an uneven political landscape.

“But for him to go for the nuclear option of arresting him tells me that it is not Imamoglu but Erdogan who seems to be in trouble,” Cagaptay said. 

“Just as Imamoglu was about to anointed as the CHP presidential candidate ... Erdogan decided to nip him in bud,” he said.

A day before his arrest, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration.

The unprecedented decision effectively disqualifies the politician from running for president. Under Turkish laws, only university graduates can hold presidential office. Imamoglu has said he will legally challenge the decision. 

Even before his arrest, Imamoglu faced a barrage of legal challenges, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities and allegedly threatening a prosecutor. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.

In 2022, he was convicted of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council following the annulment of the 2019 mayoral race and sentenced to more than two years in prison. He appealed his conviction, which could also bar him from holding public office, and has remained free during the ongoing process. 

Recent months in Turkey have seen a wave of arrests and crackdowns targeting political figures and activists, including journalists and elected mayors who have been removed from office and replaced with government-appointed officials. 

Two business leaders were briefly detained and are now facing prosecution for criticizing the government's policies. A talent manager representing several Turkish actors was arrested in January and charged with attempting to overthrow the government for her alleged involvement in anti-government protests in 2013.

Umit Ozdag, the leader of a small far-right party and outspoken Erdogan critic was also arrested in January on charges of inciting hatred and hostility, through a series of anti-refugee posts on social media.

Among other high-profile detainees are Selahattin Demirtas, the popular former leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish political party who was arrested in 2016 on terrorism-related charges and Osman Kavala, a businessman and rights activist who was imprisoned in 2017 for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government. Their continued detention despite European Court of Human Rights decisions toward their release has drawn international condemnation.

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's leader declared an emergency in oil-rich Rivers state and suspended its governor and lawmakers Tuesday over a political crisis and vandalism to pipelines that contribute to the country's status as Africa's top oil producer.

A crisis in Rivers has brewed for months between incumbent Gov. Siminalayi Fubara and state lawmakers, many of whom are backed by his predecessor. This week, some lawmakers initiated an impeachment process against the governor, accusing him of various illegalities regarding the presentation of the state budget and the composition of the legislative chamber.

President Bola Tinubu said in a state broadcast he was suspending the governor and other elected officials, including the state lawmakers, for six months.

The Nigerian president criticized the governor for not “taking any action to curtail” fresh incidents of pipeline vandalism reported in the last 24 hours, including a blast that resulted in a fire on the Trans Niger Pipeline.

“With all these and many more, no good and responsible president will stand by and allow the grave situation to continue without taking remedial steps prescribed by the constitution to address the situation in the state,” Tinubu said.

Nigeria's former navy chief Vice Admiral Ibokette Ibas, who is retired, will become the military administrator of Rivers state and the judiciary will continue to function, Tinubu said.




Military trucks were quickly deployed to the Rivers State Government House following Tinubu's announcement.

The Nigerian Constitution allows emergency rule to maintain law and order in rare circumstances. This is the first such emergency declared in more than a decade in the country of more than 210 million people whose democracy has been tested by many years of military rule and instability.

The Nigerian Bar Association criticized the suspensions of the governor and other elected officials as illegal. “A declaration of emergency does not automatically dissolve or suspend elected state governments,” Afam Osigwe, the association's president, said in a statement.

The last such emergency in Nigeria was declared under President Goodluck Jonathan in 2013, in the northeastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe during the height of the Boko Haram insurgency. However, the state governors were not suspended at the time.

PARIS (AP) — Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France. 

So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument, which was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.

Raphaël Glucksmann, as a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, can't claim to speak for all of his compatriots. 

But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants” reflects the broad shockwaves that U.S. President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe. 

“Give us back the Statue of Liberty,” Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled, on Sunday.

“It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us,” Glucksmann said.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the fight over the Statue of Liberty after a French lawmaker demands its return.

The White House brushed back on the comments Monday, saying France instead should still be “grateful” for U.S. support during World War I and World War II. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is “eternal,” but added: “If the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.” 

“No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty,” he wrote in X posts. “The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone.” 




Dream on. 

UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is U.S. government property.

It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.

But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi.

The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision made that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.

Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled on Oct. 28, 1886.

No. French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.

For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line — trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand, but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.

Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the “brutality” that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine. 

Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an “authoritarian” manner and is “preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter” to Russia.

In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the “mighty woman with a torch” who promised a home for the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” 

“Today, this land is ceasing to be what it was,” Glucksmann said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about Glucksmann's comments, responded that the U.S. would “absolutely not” be parting with the landmark in New York Harbor.

Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in a lawsuit by The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,” Leavitt said Monday, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I. “They should be very grateful.”

During a news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says the U.S. will not heed a French lawmaker's call to hand back the Statue of Liberty.

But the debt of gratitude runs both ways. Leavitt skipped past France's key role in supporting the future United States during its war for independence from the United Kingdom.

In his subsequent follow-up, Glucksmann said that his call for Lady Liberty to travel back across the Atlantic to France had been intended as “a wake-up call.”

“We all in Europe love this nation to which we know we owe so much,” he posted. “It will rise again. You will rise again. We are counting on you.”

Russia struck a medical facility in the Ukrainian city of Sumy late Tuesday, damaging the building and a nearby children's hospital. 

At least 147 patients, including those with restricted mobility, were evacuated, with no injuries reported. 

The attack came as Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

        The government's move to detain Ekrem İmamoğlu comes 24 hours after his university diploma was revoked.
    

Turkish police on Wednesday arrested one of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's key rivals and Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, amid a larger crackdown on the opposition.

A statement from the Istanbul Public Prosecutor's Office called İmamoğlu a ""criminal enterprise ringleader."" He was detained among 100 others, including his close aide Murat Ongun and election campaign manager Necati Özkan.

In a video posted on social media following the allegations against him, İmamoğlu declared ""I love you all very much, I entrust myself to my nation. Let everyone know that I will stand tall.""

The move comes days before İmamoğlu's Republican People's Party (CHP) is set to hold presidential candidate elections on Sunday, in which İmamoğlu is the only candidate. 

It also comes a day after Istanbul University annulled his degree, a decision which would disqualify him from running in presidential elections if upheld.

The wider crackdown by Turkish authorities targeted Medya A.Ş., a subsidiary of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, and those involved in the so-called ""city consensus"" between opposition parties. 

The ""city consensus"" is an agreement between İmamoğlu's opposition CHP and the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Freedom and Democracy Party (DEM Party) to support the same candidate in several Istanbul districts in municipal elections. 

İmamoğlu is suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) by allying with the DEM. The PKK has waged a decades long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other Turkish allies.

Istanbul's Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said İmamoğlu aided the work of the PKK ""by knowingly participating in the urban consensus activity, which aimed to increase the effectiveness of the terrorist organisation in metropolitan areas, as stated by the management."" 

İmamoğlu and his aides are also accused of corruption, including requesting bribes, extorting money and using the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's subsidiaries for financial gain.

Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections.

Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and have rejected claims that the arrests are politically motivated.

        The audacious heist of a unique and functioning artwork by conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan has ended with the conviction of three men.
    

A thief who stole a golden toilet from Blenheim Palace - the country mansion where Winston Churchill was born - has been convicted along with an accomplice who helped cash in on the spoils of the 18-carat work of art insured for nearly £5 million (€5.9m).

Michael Jones, 39, was found guilty of burglary in Oxford Crown Court. He had used the fully functioning one-of-a-kind latrine - a satirical work titled “America” by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan - as he did reconnaissance at Blenheim Palace the day before the theft, prosecutors said. He described the experience as “splendid.”

He returned before dawn on 14 September 2019, with at least two other men armed with sledgehammers and crowbars. They smashed a window and pried the toilet from its plumbing within five minutes, leaving a damaging flood in their wake as they escaped in stolen vehicles.

“This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed,"" prosecutor Shan Saunders said. “But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.""

Cattelan's artwork poked fun at excessive wealth and weighed just over 98kg. The value of the gold at the time was £2.8 million (€3.3m).

The piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum in New York. The museum had offered the work to Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.

The gold toilet has never been recovered but is believed to have been cut up and sold.

The theft was planned by James Sheen, 40, who previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property.

Sheen then worked to broker a deal with Fred Doe to cash in on the haul, prosecutors said. In a series of text messages, Sheen referred to the loot as a “car,” but he was actually talking about the gold.

“I'll link up with ya, I got something right up your path,” Sheen told Doe in one message. 

“I can sell that car for you in two seconds ... so come and see me tomorrow,” Doe said in a reply.

Doe, 36, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property.

A fourth man charged in the conspiracy, Bora Guccuk, 41, was acquitted by jurors.

        Zelenskyy said Putin had effectively ""rejected"" an partial ceasefire proposal hours after it was agreed.
    

Russia and Ukraine launched drone attacks on each other's territory, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to stop targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. 

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched around 40 drones at Ukraine overnight, hitting civilian infrastructure including a hospital. 

Zelenskyy said Russia had effectively ""rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire"" agreed between Putin and US President Donald Trump after a lengthy phone call on Tuesday. 

Putin declined to back a full 30-day ceasefire originally proposed by the US, demanding that the West halt all military aid to Kyiv before Moscow could fully implement such a deal. 

Within hours of the call, Zelenskyy said there were ""hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure.""

""It is these types of night-time attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians,"" Zelensky said, calling for the West to continue to supply weapons to Kyiv.

On Wednesday morning, Ukrainian state railway company Ukrzaliznytsya said parts of the railway had been left without electricity after a Russian drone attack in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region.

Meanwhile, officials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar Krai said a Ukrainian drone sparked a small fire when it hit an oil depot.

The Russian Defence Ministry announced it destroyed 57 Ukrainian drones overnight, the majority over the Kursk border region. 

Despite the attacks, Moscow and Kyiv will exchange 175 prisoners on Wednesday as agreed following the phone call between Putin and Trump. 

Trump put a positive spin on the call, with the White House describing it as a first step in a ""movement to peace"". The original deal — which Putin declined to back fully — included a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a halt to fighting across the entire frontline. 

Trump denied the Kremlin's claim that Putin demanded an end to foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, telling Fox News on Tuesday that the pair ""didn't talk about aid.""

Zelenskyy said after the call that Ukraine is open to any proposals that lead to sustainable and just peace, adding he was seeking more details about what Putin and Trump agreed on. 

He rejected Putin's demand to halt military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine. 

The Kremlin said after the call that Moscow was prepared to work with the US for a ""long-term"" solution. Putin added, however, that the way out of the conflict was addressing the ""root causes of the crisis, and legitimate Russian security interests.""

Russia has previously demanded Ukraine pull back its troops from four regions Moscow claims it annexed, renounce any prospect of joining NATO, and sharply demilitarise — proposals that are at odds with Kyiv's ambitions for peace. 

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that discussions between Moscow and Washington would continue, with fresh talks slated to begin in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will lead the US delegation.

        Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed their commitment to an immediate ceasefire, but the joint statement does not specify on how it would be implemented.
    

DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi met with his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame in Qatar on Tuesday to discuss the insurgency in eastern DRC, a region rich in minerals. 

The meeting, which was mediated by Qatar, marked the first time the leaders sat together since the conflict in DRC's mineral-rich east escalated after Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in January. 

Both DR Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed their commitment to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. However, the joint statement does not specify how the ceasefire would be implemented or monitored. 

Prior to January, the two nations had also made an attempt to come together for peace negotations. 

The meeting planned in December, however, had been unexpectedly cancelled after Rwanda made the signing of the agreement conditional on direct dialogue between rebels and DRC, which the latter refused. 

The talks come as DR Congo's government was set to meet with M23 leaders in Angola for ceasefire negotiations. However, the rebels pulled out unexpectedly after the European Union imposed sanctions on rebel leaders on Monday. 

M23 is one of nearly 100 armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo. The ongoing conflict has resulted in one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced.

        The Ottawa Convention prohibits the production, possession, and transfer of anti-personnel mines.
    

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland agreed to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty banning anti-personnel mines, in response to growing concerns over Russia's growing military threat to its bordering NATO member states.

It comes shortly after defence ministers of the Baltic states and Poland unanimously recommended withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention. 

In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the defence ministers said they ""believe that in the current security environment it is paramount to provide our defence forces flexibility and freedom of choice to potentially use new weapons systems and solutions to bolster the defence of the alliance's vulnerable eastern flank.""

Latvia's Prime Minister Evika Silina said a draft would be submitted to the parliament, who have to make the final decision, by next week.

""This decision will give our National Armed Forces additional capabilities, when they can buy and what,"" Silina said. 

The Prime Minister added that ""Latvia has also considered the possibility that we could produce, as this also correlates with our military industrial strategy adopted today.""

Latvia's Minister of Defence, Andris Spruds, said the move would be a crucial step towards building the ""Baltic defence line together."" 

""We must be given the opportunity to strengthen our security defence capabilities by withdrawing from this Convention,"" he added.

Also Lithaunia emphasised its willingness to step up its production of the explosives. 

""Talks and discussions have been going on since the very beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine—about having the means, especially for the production of explosives, at home,"" Chief of Defence Raimundas Vaiksnoras said. 

Lithuania's defence minister Dovile Sakaliene said the joint decision sent a strong signal to others indicating that the states ""are serious about deterrence and border defence.""

The decision could result in a ripple effect, with more countries following suit. ""We will not be the first or the last country to leave the Convention,"" Latvia's Prime Minister said. 

Finland could be the next to withdraw from the treaty, having previously said they were also considering leaving the treaty due to Russia's use of anti-personnel mines in Ukraine.

More than 160 countries and territories are signatories to the Ottawa Convention, including Ukraine, but excluding Russia and the US.

The 1997 treaty prohibits the production, possession, and transfer of anti-personnel mines, which are designed to be hidden under the ground and have killed or maimed thousands of civilians globally, often long after a conflict has come to an end.

Turkey has arrested the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, a member of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). It's not the first time there were rumors he might be arrested, but now Turkey's AKP rulers have seemingly decided to remove him from the political playing field.Prosecutors accused him of corruption and aiding a terrorist group. Ankara often accuses political opposition members of being “terrorists,” removing numerous left-leaning mayors and regional politicians based on these claims.  The AKP doesn't have an iron grip on power because it still only barely gets a majority of votes in elections. However, it has been able to exert increasing control over every aspect of society, from the police to courts, media, and colleges.There are very few parts of Turkish society where people can critique the ruling party without being arrested for “insulting” political leaders or jailed on “terrorism” charges. AdvertisementThese accusations generally target minority groups, such as Kurds, women's rights activists, and students, and have even been aimed at foreigners visiting or living in Turkey. Infamously, Ankara arrested an American pastor back in 2016, only freeing him after pressure from the previous Trump administration. 20 June 2024, North Rhine-Westphalia, Duesseldorf: Ekrem Imamoglu, Mayor of Istanbul, stands in front of a Turkish flag at a reception in the city hall.

It also positions itself as sitting between Europe and Russia, pretending to confront Moscow while working with it. The country also works closely with Iran. Ankara has threatened Israel and Greece in the past and has also tried to prevent Sweden from joining NATO. Ankara even tried to use migrants against Europe to secure profitable deals, leading many Western countries to look the other way instead of critiquing Ankara.For instance, when France confronted it in the past, Turkey attempted to radicalize Muslims in France. Many countries fear Ankara could radicalize migrant populations, including Turkish migrants. European countries have so many problems that they feel they can't afford a new problem with the NATO member.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Even if he is eventually released, he may be kept from challenging Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The ruling party in Ankara has been in power for 20 years and wants it to stay that way.

It has coopted most media in Turkey and weakened the former secular grip on various institutions. The war against the “deep state” is a motto that has been picked up abroad in the US and Israel.  Ankara's concept of fighting secular and leftist organizations is not only something happening in Turkey; it's a worldwide concept that is part of the new world order emerging within more authoritarian states.The detention of the mayor of Istanbul will be closely watched in the West and the region.He is not the only opposition member jailed now. Selahattin Demirtas, the leader of another opposition party, was jailed a decade ago, and other leaders of various parties have received long sentences for various infractions. In January, prosecutors also charged right-wing Victory Party leader Umit Ozdag with fomenting the anti-migrant protests.In essence, no one is safe from the AKP's prosecutions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Ajpost.com","Baby boom: Birth rates in Israel are on the rise, primarily in Jewish families","https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-846688","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:51:00 GMT","

Israel is witnessing an increase in birth rates, particularly among Jewish families, according to the latest birth statistics for 2024, after a prolonged decline in the number of children per family.Birth rates in the Arab sector, however, have continued to decline.  The 2024 data present a fascinating picture: approximately 134,000 births, compared to 131,000 in 2023 and 132,000 in 2022.The decision to bring a child into the world is a clear expression of optimism. Despite difficulties and challenges, the number of births has increased, proving that society is more resilient and hopeful than we tend to think. AdvertisementThe full trends in birth rates are still unclear, as comprehensive demographic data has yet to be released. To gain a complete picture, factors such as the age distribution within the population, particularly among women of childbearing age, must be examined; such data are still missing.Despite the war, reserve duty, societal divisions, and the rising cost of living, people have not been deterred from having children – quite the opposite is true. The difficult reality has strengthened the desire among many to expand their families or at least maintain their size.  Babies born amid Israel's next baby boom. (credit: MAARIV)A baby boom is one possible explanation. Historically, post-war periods have been marked by increased birth rates, and even now – though the war is still ongoing – it seems that people are choosing to have more children.However, this explanation alone is insufficient. Even before the war, the birth rate was exceptional by all measures. While in most Western nations, the birth rate is below the minimum threshold needed to sustain the population, the opposite trend is occurring here.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The country surpasses not only Western nations but also non-Western ones. AdvertisementGrowing families are more than just ultra-Orthodox In Iran (1.7) and Turkey (1.9), birth rates are low, whereas in Israel, the average number of children per family is close to three. Contrary to common perception, this phenomenon is not exclusive to the ultra-Orthodox community. Secular and traditional families also have more children compared to families in Western countries.Children are not just statistics, and bringing them into the world is not solely about economic and demographic growth. The belief in having children reflects the strength of the family unit, which contributes to individual stability, joy, and happiness. Indeed, in every international comparison, Israel stands out as a family-oriented country with a high percentage of families and a low rate of children born outside a stable family framework.Looking at these figures, it becomes clear why the country consistently ranks among the happiest countries in the world. After all, happiness is not just a fleeting emotion; it stems from family life, social engagement, and solidarity, which provide a sense of purpose and security in difficult times.  A society with stable families and children is a stronger, more cohesive society.The story of US Vice President JD Vance illustrates this well.

The past 24 hours have seen a dramatic escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. On Monday night, the IDF launched a new wave of airstrikes targeting Hamas positions across the Gaza Strip. The operation, according to the Prime Minister's Office, was “a response to Hamas's refusal to release the hostages still held in Gaza.”In a series of precise strikes, four senior Hamas officials were eliminated: Mahmoud Abu Watfa, the director-general of Hamas's Interior Ministry; Issam al-Da'alis, a member of Hamas's political bureau; Ahmed Omar al-Hatta, a senior leader; and Bahjat Abu Sultan, responsible for Hamas's internal security apparatus. Meanwhile, Hamas says that over 300 people have been killed, including civilians caught in the crossfire.  Defense Minister Israel Katz has made it clear that the IDF will continue its operations until “Hamas understands that the rules of the game have changed” and that it must release all hostages or face “the opening of the gates of hell.” These words reflect the shift in Israel's strategic approach – no longer allowing Hamas to use ceasefires as a means to regroup and rearm.For weeks, Hamas stalled negotiations in Doha, rejecting opportunities to release hostages and de-escalate the conflict. It refused to release captives on March 1, March 8, and March 15, while simultaneously pretending to engage in good-faith discussions. This pattern is familiar: Hamas consistently seeks international sympathy through ceasefires it never intends to honor while using the lull to strengthen its forces. Reports indicate that despite suffering significant losses since October 7, Hamas has managed to reconstitute a force of up to 25,000 fighters, even recruiting minors.

Just as Joshua led the fight against Amalek, so too do our brave soldiers fight today, says the writer. (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)The notion of a “Ramadan ceasefire” was nothing more than a ploy. Hamas believed it could exploit the holy month to pause hostilities and reinforce its ranks, assuming that Israel would succumb to international pressure. It miscalculated. Israel understands the cost of waiting; every delay emboldens the terrorist organization and prolongs the suffering of the hostages it continues to hold. Israel's response – targeted strikes on Hamas infrastructure – is a necessary step to ensure that Hamas does not use a ceasefire as a smokescreen for its next attack.Hamas has no legitimacy to cry foul. It was Hamas that provoked this latest round of violence, just as it did on October 7, when it launched its brutal attack on Israeli civilians. Since then, the terror group has sought to dictate the terms of engagement, weaponizing human shields and international media narratives while keeping the people of Gaza under its oppressive rule.

It was an American morning for President Isaac Herzog and his wife, Michal, on Wednesday when they met with the board of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, followed by a meeting with a joint delegation of the Jewish Federation of Orange County and two groups representing the American Friends of Magen David Adom.Herzog was told at both meetings that he was an inspiration and was warmly praised for his dedication to the return of the hostages and the attention he paid to their families. The president responded that they had become like his own family.  He applauded his guests for their advocacy on behalf of Israel and said that what they are doing is very important. His wife added that such organizations on the ground are life-saving.Voices at both meetings were raised in concern at the virulent outbreak of antisemitism across America – and not just on university campuses.

Whereas it is more or less taken for granted that Diaspora Jews represent Israel, the opposite is now true in his opinion.“Israel is the Jewish state, and in the eyes of non-Jews, you are representing us,” said the man. “You have to go out and express the interests of Jews in the world in the general media.” The AIPAC board was led by former president Michael Tuchin and current president Bernie Kaminetsky. Tuchin is now chairman of the board.At both meetings, Herzog urged his guests to fight back.

Tuchin said he admired Herzog's ability to work with all nations and all sectors of society. Tuchin also underscored Michal's work on social issues and mental health.She, in turn, stressed at both meetings how mental health contributes to a calmer and more productive society and how the mental health of Israelis has been affected by events of the past year and a half.  She also emphasized the importance of not using violence against women – and sexual violence in particular – as a weapon of war, not only for women victims who have suffered at the hands of Hamas but for all women.Erik Ludwig, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Orange County, said many challenges require advocacy and asked Herzog to suggest the most important issues.First and foremost, in the president's opinion, is the immediate return of the hostages. After that is “Iran, the empire of evil,” which Herzog termed “a No. 1 priority,” saying Israel was blocking Tehran from implementing its ambitions.

Jared Kushner, special envoy Steve Witkoff, conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump Jr. have been in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's political opposition, Politico reported on Wednesday.The high-ranking Trump allies have been speaking with Ukrainian opposition leader and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko as well as senior members of ex-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's party, Politico reported, citing three Ukrainian parliamentarians and a Republican foreign policy expert.The talks centered around potentially triggering a presidential election in Ukraine. The country has delayed elections in accordance with its constitution because Kyiv has instated martial law due to the ongoing conflict within its borders.   The Trump administration believes that Zelensky would lose in a potential election because of war fatigue in the country. The US president previously called the Ukrainian president a “dictator without elections” who “has done a terrible job,"" echoing Kremlin talking points. FOLLOWING THE exchange involving US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week in the Oval Office, European leaders came out of the woodwork to give words of encouragement to Ukraine even as they still fund Russia through energy purchases. (credit: BRIAN SNYDER/REUTERS)Trump calls Zelensky a dictatorWhile Zelensky's ratings have gone down over the course of his presidency, his recent spat with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance bolstered his approval ratings, the New York Times reported. British independent pollster Survation reported that nearly 44% of those polled intend to vote for Zelensky in the next election, which would put him comfortably above any other candidates.

The high-ranking Trump allies have been speaking with Ukrainian opposition leader and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko as well as senior members of ex-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's party, Politico reported, citing three Ukrainian parliamentarians and a Republican foreign policy expert.The talks centered around potentially triggering a presidential election in Ukraine. The country has delayed elections in accordance with its constitution because Kyiv has instated martial law due to the ongoing conflict within its borders.   The Trump administration believes that Zelensky would lose in a potential election because of war fatigue in the country. The US president previously called the Ukrainian president a “dictator without elections” who “has done a terrible job,"" echoing Kremlin talking points. FOLLOWING THE exchange involving US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week in the Oval Office, European leaders came out of the woodwork to give words of encouragement to Ukraine even as they still fund Russia through energy purchases.

US President Donald Trump released material related to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday, seeking to honor his campaign promise to provide more transparency about the shocking event in Texas.An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website with a total of more than 80,000 expected to be published after Justice Department lawyers spent hours scouring them.  The digital documents included PDFs of memos, including one with the heading ""secret"" that was a typed account with handwritten notes of a 1964 interview by a Warren Commission researcher who questioned Lee Wigren, a CIA employee, about inconsistencies in material provided to the commission by the State Department and the CIA about marriages between Soviet women and American men.The documents also included references to various conspiracy theories suggesting that Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald left the Soviet Union in 1962 intent on assassinating the popular young president.

But polls show many Americans believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.Experts doubted the new trove of information will change the underlying facts of the case, that Lee Harvey Oswald opened fire at Kennedy from a window at a school book deposit warehouse as the presidential motorcade passed by Dealey Plaza in Dallas.  ""People expecting big things are almost certain to be disappointed,"" said Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, who authored a book about the assassination.He said some of the pages could simply be the release of previously published material that had a few words redacted.Additional files to be releasedTrump has also promised to release documents on the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were killed in 1968.Trump has allowed more time to come up with a plan for those releases.Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, has said he believes the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in his uncle's death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless.Kennedy Jr. has also said he believes his father was killed by multiple gunmen, an assertion that contradicts official accounts.One revelation the documents could contain is that the CIA was more aware of Oswald than it has previously disclosed. Questions have remained about what the CIA knew about Oswald's visits to Mexico City six weeks before the assassination.

Oh, I can't deal with these Argentinians anymore, they who love us more than we love ourselves. And we must admit: we're really not used to this. We're used to being hated. Love takes us out of our comfort zone. And we're not talking about Micronesia, or some undeclared island between the Philippines and Mars. This is Argentina: the ninth largest country in the world, 120 times larger than Israel, with a team that won the last World Cup (on penalties admittedly, but let's not be petty).One of them is Javier Milei, our uncle from Argentina who doesn't stop sending gifts. A Zionist who studies Torah, he hangs out with Chabad followers, and even considered converting to Judaism. His becoming president of Argentina more than a year ago unexpectedly created for us a Zionist brotherhood front in blue and white, which recently earned Milei the Genesis Prize – “the Jewish Nobel” – for his uncompromising support of Israel.  Israel's gifts from ArgentinaWith the return of the bodies of the Bibas family to Israel, Milei declared a national day of mourning in Argentina – and why just one day of mourning if it can be rounded up to two? This gesture was accompanied by a mass rally in Buenos Aires with tens of thousands of Argentinians who came to support Israel, and with a city initiative, a kind of spin-off of the first idea, to change the name of “Palestine Street” in the city to “Bibas Street”! You've got to see it to believe it.For Milei, this is nothing unusual. One of his most consistent activities is to move us emotionally time after time. He stood at the UN and attacked the antisemitic organization for its one-sided policies, and for the fact that non-democratic countries give scores to others on human rights issues. He waves Israeli flags at demonstrations against Hamas, dances with Jews to the tune of “Am Yisrael Chai” (The People of Israel Live), and schemes about moving the Argentinian embassy to Jerusalem. “We are with you in your war against the forces of darkness,” he told Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, the simple and natural truth that French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, would never utter. Stan Polovets, left, Co-founder and Chairman of The Genesis Prize Foundation, with Argentine President Javier Milei. (credit: GENESIS PRIZE FOUNDATION)And yes, I know what you'll say, there are always skeptics. Some will say he's an eccentric president, unpredictable; in his country, some call him “El Loco” – the crazy one. He appointed his sister as “First Lady,” cloned his deceased dog into six new dogs – which he claims are his political cabinet – went wild on television panels he participated in, appeared at rock concerts, and was a soccer goalkeeper. But you know what? That's exactly how I want them, the world's shapers and builders of the future – colorful, brave, original, convention-breakers, uninhibited in the race for good. That's how I like them: lovers of Israel, honest and direct, and also unpredictable. Because hey: are we predictable? Is the world predictable? We just celebrated Purim, the time to dress up as someone else, and this column has also taken a different direction for the occasion. So, let's raise a cup of maté (Argentina's national drink), say “L'chaim,” and wish us all happy times like on Purim – with lots of love for Israel, love for Argentina, and goodness in our hearts.The writer is president of WIZO.

The Knesset on Wednesday approved the return of MK Itamar Ben-Gvir's party to the governing coalition, and the reappointment of Ben-Gvir as National Security Ministry.The Knesset also approved Ben-Gvir's fellow party members, Yizhak Wasserlauf and Amichai Eliyahu, as Negev and Galilee Minister and Heritage Minister, respectively.  Otzma Yehudit left the government in January over its decision to approve the hostage deal. All three positions were given to Tourism Minister Haim Katz for “safeguarding” in case Otzma Yehudit returned to the government. Ben-Gvir said at the time that he would return to the government if the war resumed. He announced his return the day after IDF launched widespread strikes in Gaza.Otmza Yehudit's six MKs returning to the governing coalition means that the government now has a sizable majority to pass the 2025 state budget, without which the government would have fallen. The government previously had a narrow majority since some haredi MKs pledged to vote against the budget due to the government's failure to enact legislation to exempt a large number of yeshiva students from military service. AdvertisementAlready on Monday, the government reached agreements with Ben-Gvir, according to which the latter's party will abstain on the Economics Arrangements Bill, which is set to reach the Knesset plenum on Wednesday. The Economics Arrangements Bill accompanies the national budget every year, and includes related legal amendments that are necessary for the budget to be carried out in full.Ben-Gvir agreed to abstain as a “goodwill gesture” over the prime minister's decisions to fire Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and Attorney-General Gali Baharav Miara. It remains to be seen whether he conditioned his return to the government on the final removal of both figures. The government in its decision to reappoint Ben-Gvir ignored the directive of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, who wrote to Netanyahu on Tuesday that Ben-Gvir could not be reappointed to the position due to an ongoing High Court petition against his conduct, which allegedly included illegal involvement in operational matters.High Court refuses injunction The High Court refused on Tuesday to issue an injunction against the appointment. The court noted that the state's response on the matter was due in the coming days in any case, ahead of a scheduled hearing on April 7.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  One of the petitioners, the NGO “Ima Era” (Hebrew for “Moms Up”) said in a statement on Wednesday, ""We petitioned the Supreme Court about six months ago against Ben Gvir because his conduct exposed our children to danger and to international legal proceedings. Its [the government's] unanimous approval, without substantive discussion and during wartime, resembles the conduct of dark regimes rather than a democracy. The hearing on the petition will take place on 7.4.25, and we expect the court to do the right thing: to protect our children and the rule of law."" Advertisement

It remains to be seen whether he conditioned his return to the government on the final removal of both figures. The government in its decision to reappoint Ben-Gvir ignored the directive of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, who wrote to Netanyahu on Tuesday that Ben-Gvir could not be reappointed to the position due to an ongoing High Court petition against his conduct, which allegedly included illegal involvement in operational matters.High Court refuses injunction The High Court refused on Tuesday to issue an injunction against the appointment.

After World War II, women's indispensable contributions on the home front in places like the United States and United Kingdom fundamentally reshaped societal expectations, signaling a shift that paved the way for greater leadership opportunities in those countries.As they took on critical roles in a variety of industries and arenas while men were away fighting the war, women demonstrated their resilience, capability, and leadership potential.  This societal transformation was not just a response to a complex and lengthy conflict; it was a recognition of women's ability to step up in times of crisis and to lead in their own right.There is much Israeli society can learn from the opportunity that emanated from that particular crisis in the middle of the last century.

INBAL RABIN-LIBERMAN. (credit: COURTESY OF THE FAMILY)Women take on leadership roles during the warAs an example, a group of women became the first female armored crews in Israel, and perhaps the world, to participate in active battle when they grabbed their tank, sped down to the Gaza border, and took out dozens of terrorist infiltrators, saving countless lives. This was a story of quick thinking, heroism, and bravery that proved women can serve and fight in battle.This is certainly no exception or aberration.Since October 7, women have been taking leading positions in the war effort, demonstrating bravery and resilience, whether with social or national efforts, leaders in the Hostages and Missing Families' Forum, taking charge on the home front, or demonstrating grit and determination in the face of the military and security challenges.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  This resurgence of female leadership is a testament to the strength and resilience of women in Israel. Yet, as we witness their active involvement in multiple arenas, we must ask ourselves: are we doing enough to foster their continued growth in roles across and at all levels of Israeli society? AdvertisementNow is the time to seize this moment, to turn crisis into opportunity by empowering Israeli women and expanding their reach into political, economic, and societal leadership. The impact of women in leadership has been demonstrated time and again.When women are in leadership roles in different arenas, societies thrive.They bring diverse perspectives, innovative solutions, and a deeply rooted sense of empathy and collaboration. This is especially crucial in times of national strife when the strength of community and collective problem-solving is paramount.  However, this potential cannot be realized without deliberate action.Empowering womenTo ensure women's contributions are sustained and amplified, we must create and support targeted initiatives that equip them with the resources, training, and opportunities necessary to excel.Whether it's through mentorship programs, leadership training, or increased representation in government, these programs can ensure that women not only occupy spaces of influence but also have the power and support to lead effectively.That is why the Merit Spread Foundation is supporting such important and empowering initiatives, like the WoMed Mentorship Program, a program that advances outstanding early-career female physicians into key roles in clinical, academic, and administrative fields through personal mentoring; Seeing You, a unique initiative offering a range of emotional support services for wives of reservist combat soldiers; and Women in Tech Israel, an organization that strengthens the Israeli female technology ecosystem in national and international industries.Nevertheless, we must also consider the social barriers that still exist.

The IDF on Wednesday afternoon announced that it has carried out air strikes against dozens of Hamas terrorists across Gaza since Tuesday evening.The announcement, on the one hand, showed the IDF keeping the newly increased pressure on Hamas since Israel renewed hostilities at 2:10 a.m. Tuesday morning, with massive strikes against 80 targets, killing between four to six senior Hamas officials, many mid-level Hamas commanders, and, according to Hamas - up to 400 Gazans.  On the other hand, the attacks since Tuesday night and, in fact, since Tuesday afternoon have been at a much lower level than the attacks that took place Tuesday morning.Further, there still are no signs whatsoever of a ground forces invasion of Gaza, and the IDF has not even started the process of a wide reservist call-up, which would be necessary for anything but a very limited invasion.

The Israel Police's Lahav 433 Unit of International Crime Investigations arrested two suspects in the ‘Qatargate' affair, in which close aides of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allegedly received funding from Qatar in order to promote its image while serving in the prime minister's office.The identity of the two suspects was not made public due to a gag order.  Israeli Businessman Gil Birger admitted in recordings published by KAN's Reshet Bet on Wednesday that he had transferred funds from a Qatari lobbyist to a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media team, Eli Feldstein.According to the recordings, the lobbyist, Jay Footlik, requested that Briger assist in transferring the funds to Feldstein for VAT purposes. The recordings confirm a report on Tuesday evening by Channel 13's Baruch Kara. AdvertisementAccording to Kara, Feldstein ceased receiving his salary from the prime minister's office in April 2024 after failing a security background check. However, he continued working for the prime minister until October 2024, when he was arrested on charges of leaking a classified document to the German newspaper Bild on behalf of Netanyahu, in order to relieve public outcry over the Hamas killing of six hostages in Rafah due to IDF proximity.According to Kara, Feldstein's salary was effectively paid by the Qatari government during that period, while at the same time working alongside the prime minister, serving primarily as his liaison to military reporters. The recordings and report regarding Feldstein's salary could not be independently confirmed by The Jerusalem Post.

AdvertisementFeldstein's attorneys claimed that he did not know it was a service for Qatar. “As we have claimed from the moment the allegations were first raised, Feldstein has never worked for Qatar, and on political and security matters, he worked solely for the Prime Minister and his office. He did not transfer information to Qatar and never received money from them. If there is any connection between the businessman in question and other parties, including Qatar, this was not presented to Feldstein and was unknown to him,” the attorneys said.Feldstein's lawyers added that he was unaware of any work done by fellow Netanyahu media advisor Yonatan Urich for the Qataris. Haaretz reported in November that Urich had provided public relations services to Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup.Urich's lawyers, Amit Hadad and Noa Milstein said in response, ""Urich has no idea who Gil Briger is—he has never spoken to him or met him.  “Urich is a private consultant who is not a state employee and is not employed by the Prime Minister's Office. Therefore, he is neither appointed nor responsible for employment or personnel matters in the office, meaning he does not 'arrange' jobs or transfer funds to anyone. This is a false and fabricated affair with motives that are transparent and known to all. There is no offense involved, and the false leaks regarding it have tainted it from day one,” the lawyers said.“The attempt to create an artificial conflict between Urich and Feldstein while amplifying media reports amounts to obstruction and contamination of the investigation.

According to a report, the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Division in the police clarified to the Attorney General, 'I don't understand what offense is being investigated (regarding Qatar). This case is not progressing,'” the PMO said, referring to reports earlier this week that the police had questioned the purpose of the investigation. The Attorney-General's Office responded at the time that the police were fully partners in the investigation and supported it.The PMO continued, “The new fake news is a desperate attempt to invent a baseless justification for an offense that does not exist. The Prime Minister's Office does not 'arrange' payments for anyone. Every payment in a government office is made in accordance with the law and through authorized officials only. Any other claim is unfounded, aiming to breathe life into yet another fabricated affair,"" it concluded.Following Feldstein's arrest in October, the prime minister's office initially claimed it had had no connection to him. The prime minister, however, later admitted that Feldstein had worked closely alongside him and even argued that the investigation of Feldstein was part of an attempt to remove him from power.

The March 26-27 conference was intended to gather experts, government officials, civil society groups, Jewish community leaders, and academics in Jerusalem to address the challenges of post-October 7 antisemitism, but the inclusion of right-wing European politicians such as Jordan Bardella, president of France's National Rally, and Hermann Tertsch, vice president of the European Parliament's Patriots for Europe group, has led to disconcertion among other participants.Former ADL head Abe Foxman said the invitation of “authoritarian neo-fascist political parties” legitimized them and made the conference about the participants rather than antisemitism.

US President Donald Trump's assault on Columbia University and the Jew-hatred threatening America's education system has thrilled some Jews – but appalled too many others. As with Trump's decision to move America's embassy to Jerusalem, I wonder why people don't realize that applauding some policies gains credibility when objecting to others.Now, I go even further. All Trump-a-phobes who have called him “antisemitic” without reading Executive Order 14188 – Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism, of January 29, 2025 – should be ashamed of themselves. And American Jewish leaders who haven't bothered reading it should resign.  For the embarrassingly vast Jewish – and pro-democracy, anti-bigotry – majority that ignored the text, Trump's order vows “to fight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world... vigorously,” particularly “in schools.” It repudiates the “unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens” following “the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023.” The president directs the “head of each executive department” to submit detailed action plans.And yes, the president directs “the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security” to familiarize “institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3).” That statute bars aliens who, among other threats to Americans, spread “communicable diseases,” incite terrorism, and intend to engage, even “incidentally,” in “any unlawful activity,” especially activities involving “the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means.” AdvertisementNow, test Trump's plan to combat Jew-hatred for consistency: meaning yours. US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, February 2025.  (credit: Nathan Howard/Reuters)First, the Biden test: Had president Joe Biden issued this executive order, would you object to any word? Second, the Harris test: If vice president Kamala Harris had won, would she fight Jew-hatred as vigorously, and would America's universities be scrambling to punish lawbreakers, dismantle DEI, rebalance campus politics, and tone down the demonizing of Jews, Israel, Zionism – along with Americanism and liberalism?Finally, the Right-Left test: Immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia agitator with a Green Card issued in 2024. Media reports romanticize him as the protesters' “lead negotiator.” That means he led the goons who harassed pro-Israel students and then invaded Hamilton Hall, injuring custodians, to occupy the building illegally. What if a German-born “lead negotiator” for neo-Nazis called “Hans Himmlerish” misleadingly secured a Green Card, then supported violent Nazi encampments in “Jew York City”? Would Jews and civil libertarians defend him?   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  THREE PRINCIPLES should guide this debate: AdvertisementAmerica and its universities must fight Jew-hatred and educational malpractice;America may protect its borders by barring hostile aliens – and not treating them like citizens;America must preserve free speech while punishing illegal acts.Admittedly, the administration is inexcusably sloppy. It should have launched this long-overdue counterattack against activists on more probationary student visas who brazenly broke university rules and American law. Or it should have punished a Green Card-holder convicted of crimes. That would have highlighted the problem: students enjoying America's hospitality yet menacing citizens and violating American laws.The complicated feelings around Donald Trump's crackdown on campus antisemitism, Hamas sympathizingIt's complicated. Even for many of us disgusted by Columbia's decades-long epidemic of educational malpractice, Trump's sledgehammer governance again goes too far – yet yields results. Moreover, cutting funding from the less “woke,” less politicized hard sciences is counterproductive. And while America may deport law-breaking alien agitators, presidents should handle these cases responsibly, without tweets sneering “Shalom Mahmoud” or “Shalom Columbia.”On November 9, 2023, MIT's President Sally Kornbluth reported that although pro-Palestinian protesters violated university rules by “disrupt[ing] the work of the institute,” she would not suspend students as mandated. Fearing that these hoodlums might have “visa issues,” she issued lighter punishments, protecting them from “collateral consequences.”  Five months later, dozens of Columbia University professors donned safety vests to “protect” their students at the encampments. Because none of those teachers escorted even one harassed Jewish student across campus, they selected between their “good” students worth protecting and the unworthy Jews, just as MIT showed that rules don't apply to anti-Jewish protesters whom they chose to protect from the consequences of their actions.Clearly, too many universities have abdicated their educational values, moral responsibilities, and legal obligations to protect all students, including Jews. That's why we should welcome headlines proclaiming “After Columbia arrests, international college students fall silent.” Punishments, applied justly, wisely, appropriately, inhibit bad behavior and protect good people.If students on special visas respect the law, their privileges to speak freely won't be assailed. But, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained, America should penalize aliens who cross the line from legitimate protest to law-breaking, or who call, as Khalil's organization CUAD does, for Hamas's success, seek “instruction from militants in the Global South,” and “fight... for the total eradication of Western civilization.” “If you told us that's what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in,” Rubio explained. “And if you do it once you get in, we're going to revoke [your visa] and kick you out.”In short, you can criticize Trump and protect free speech, yet still thank President Trump for saying: “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”That's not about squelching speech. It's about respecting the law – and keeping America from becoming like Canada or Europe.The writer, a senior fellow in Zionist thought at the Jewish People Policy Institute, is an American presidential historian. His latest books, To Resist the Academic Intifada: Letters to My Students on Defending the Zionist Dream and The Essential Guide to October 7th and its Aftermath, were just published.

And yes, the president directs “the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security” to familiarize “institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3).” That statute bars aliens who, among other threats to Americans, spread “communicable diseases,” incite terrorism, and intend to engage, even “incidentally,” in “any unlawful activity,” especially activities involving “the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means.” AdvertisementNow, test Trump's plan to combat Jew-hatred for consistency: meaning yours.

Five months later, dozens of Columbia University professors donned safety vests to “protect” their students at the encampments. Because none of those teachers escorted even one harassed Jewish student across campus, they selected between their “good” students worth protecting and the unworthy Jews, just as MIT showed that rules don't apply to anti-Jewish protesters whom they chose to protect from the consequences of their actions.Clearly, too many universities have abdicated their educational values, moral responsibilities, and legal obligations to protect all students, including Jews. That's why we should welcome headlines proclaiming “After Columbia arrests, international college students fall silent.” Punishments, applied justly, wisely, appropriately, inhibit bad behavior and protect good people.If students on special visas respect the law, their privileges to speak freely won't be assailed. But, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained, America should penalize aliens who cross the line from legitimate protest to law-breaking, or who call, as Khalil's organization CUAD does, for Hamas's success, seek “instruction from militants in the Global South,” and “fight... for the total eradication of Western civilization.” “If you told us that's what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in,” Rubio explained. “And if you do it once you get in, we're going to revoke [your visa] and kick you out.”In short, you can criticize Trump and protect free speech, yet still thank President Trump for saying: “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”That's not about squelching speech.

Just over four years ago, Congress achieved a major breakthrough when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: It allocated up to $250 million for people-to-people peace-building efforts.Named after a longtime Jewish lawmaker who championed peace, the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act had bipartisan support. It immediately became the largest investment of any single country in Israeli-Palestinian civil society initiatives, by a wide margin.Since then, the MEPPA fund, as it is known, has engaged more than 10,000 people, sustaining its work even as the Israel-Hamas war has undone or strained other peace efforts. And when Lowey died on Sunday at 87, U.S. Jewish groups praised the act as her lasting legacy.  But that legacy is in jeopardy. All of the peace-building groups supported through the MEPPA fund have had their grants canceled amid the Trump administration's slashing of USAID, the United States' civilian foreign aid agency, and it's unclear whether restoring them is possible.“It took years to get MEPPA passed, and when it was passed, it never occurred to anyone that it could be terminated by the president,” said Dan McDonald, a career civil servant who has overseen MEPPA's implementation at USAID since its launch. “After years of carefully building these structures to see them all smashed to pieces in just moments is just one of many global tragedies that are playing out right now.” Members of the Jerusalem Youth Chorus, a MEPPA grantee, perform on ''America's Got Talent'' in an episode that aired July 16, 2024. (credit: screenshot)Donald Trump targeted USAID from his first day in office as profligate and out of sync with the values he wants to promote. His administration has gutted the agency, cutting off funds for health care, poverty relief and education around the world.Like most agency employees, MEPPA staff were placed on administrative leave shortly after Trump took office in January. And earlier this month, the fund's beneficiaries were informed that their contracts were being terminated. Among the 27 civil society organizations to have their funds slashed: the Parents Circle, which had been promised $540,000 to amplify young Israelis and Palestinians calling for nonviolence; Women Wage Peace, one of whose prominent volunteers was murdered when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023; and the Jerusalem Youth Chorus, which appeared on “America's Got Talent” last July and announced in December that it had been allocated $500,000.Some of the grantees received much larger gifts — including $3.3 million to EcoPeace, which uses sustainability as a centerpiece for relationship-building, and $5 million to Middle East Education Through Technology, which teaches coding and design to Israeli and Palestinian teens. For some of the groups, the MEPPA funds allowed for unprecedented expansion.Each of the groups learned that their funds had been cut off via an email this month that attributed the decision to the “convenience and the interests of the U.S. government,” according to McDonald, who himself is set to lose his job next month. He said the email — which he learned about only through the grantees — was likely written by “folks in Washington who had never heard of MEPPA.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  For the organizations that had been receiving MEPPA funds, the abrupt cuts are especially painful because they thought they had already weathered the biggest crisis they could imagine: Oct. 7.The Interfaith Encounter Alliance had just signed for a $500,000 MEPPA grant when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023. Immediately, nearly all 40 chapters of the group, founded during the second intifada to bring Jews and Muslims together, shut down across Israel and the West Bank.But within months, most of the chapters had resumed full operations and many had expanded their efforts. Using the USAID funds, the groups held Jewish-Muslim Ramadan Iftar meals and launched a large-scale social media campaign to recruit new participants, bringing in several hundred people who had not previously engaged in interfaith activities. “When a cycle of violence happens, it shakes everybody. Some of those who are shaken become more afraid, more closed off. But others are moved to become more active in trying to create a different future, a better future. And they find us,” said CEO Yehuda Stolov. His group had $300,000 of its grant rescinded this month.The Alliance for Middle East Peace, a coalition of peace-building groups, says a quarter of its 160 member groups have expanded significantly since Oct. 7, while only a handful have contracted. Now, the MEPPA and broader USAID cuts are undercutting that growth, said John Lyndon, ALLMEP's executive director.“This is a very consequential and high-stakes moment for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the region, and to take the civil society actors who are working for peace and equality and coexistence off the playing field at this moment is a mistake,” Lyndon said.He argued that bottom-up efforts like those undertaken by USAID recipients aligns with Trump's stated goal of regional stabilization — and dream of brokering more peace deals between Israel and Arab nations.“If you want to hear more ideas about diplomacy rather than further violence, peace-builders are the ones that essentially socialize those ideas, de-risk them, so that politicians then pick them up,” Lyndon said.The appetite for such efforts appears suppressed on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Israel, the governing coalition hinges on hardliners skeptical of diplomacy — and who have advanced their own legislation designed to hobble nonprofits. A proposed Knesset bill seeks to heavily tax foreign government funding for Israeli NGOs, threatening support not only from the United States but from other key backers like the EU, Germany and various embassies.Among Palestinians, leadership is split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and the Hamas terror group in Gaza that is committed to Israel's destruction. Some Palestinian activists, meanwhile, dismiss coexistence efforts as efforts to “normalize” Israel.And the United States under Trump has officially abandoned a commitment to a two-state solution, while also retreating from the historic role America has played in intervening abroad. Among the many overseas expenditures that officials have assailed are funding for Tomorrow's Youth Organization, a Palestinian NGO that Rep. Mike Lawler charged was headed by a “vicious anti-Israel rapper who advocates for Jew hatred” and, by Trump himself, support for an Arabic-language version of “Sesame Street.”But even some advocates of funding peace-building efforts see in the moment of crisis an opportunity to make improvements on flawed programs in the Middle East.Some critics of peace-building initiatives note that while many can count small-scale, individual successes, the field has failed to bring the region closer to peace.The MEPPA fund specifically has drawn criticism for favoring recipients who were inoffensive — and also potentially less effective. Samer Sinijlawi, a Palestinian activist and former Fatah member who spent five years in an Israeli prison during the first intifada, recalled that his bid for funds in partnership with Yishai Fleisher, a settler leader from Hebron, was rejected.'It was just cosmetic'“MEPPA didn't want to do something serious — it was just cosmetic,” said Sinijlawi. He added, “It needs to get complicated, messy, because that's where we live. You can't get anything done around here if you're scared of getting into trouble.”Meanwhile, some in the field are receptive to the argument that the fund and other international aid programs may include waste or are larger than needed.“Clean up shop, that's fine. Trim the fat,” said Meredith Rothbart, co-founder and CEO of Amal-Tikva, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit that seeks to expand capacity in the peace-building field. “But don't exclude societal leaders who have the deepest understanding, because then you leave a vacuum with no societal buy-in, creating a reality in which any agreement or desired future is essentially a house of cards.”Rothbart and Amal-Tikva's chief strategy officer, Ariel Markose, are soon heading to the United States to try to chart a path forward. Initially, they had planned to go to Washington to lobby for MEPPA's reinstatement, but with that seemingly off the table, their focus has shifted to understanding where the administration now stands on civil society peace-building.In New York, the pair will turn to private philanthropy to explore ways to secure more stable, flexible funding to insulate the field from political shifts. Stolov, too, said he aimed to make up the lost MEPPA grant with private fundraising.Lyndon is also looking to diversify ALLMEP's support. In December, the group met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advocate for an independent fund seeded by an array of entities that would not be vulnerable to shifting political winds in any particular country.“We want private donors, individual governments, independent entities all investing and leveraging their relative strengths to really engage Israeli and Palestinian society and build support for peace from the bottom up,” Lyndon said.Some in the United States remain hopeful that the MEPPA funds can be distributed through another government agency, such as the State Department or the International Development Finance Corporation, which has distributed some of the act's funds and so far has escaped the hatchet wielded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.But with the Trump administration still in slash-and-burn mode — literally, in the case of USAID, as workers have reportedly been told to burn documents — it's unclear whether U.S. support for any of the efforts has a future.Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, cited MEPPA in his statement mourning Lowey on Sunday. In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”

Now, the MEPPA and broader USAID cuts are undercutting that growth, said John Lyndon, ALLMEP's executive director.“This is a very consequential and high-stakes moment for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the region, and to take the civil society actors who are working for peace and equality and coexistence off the playing field at this moment is a mistake,” Lyndon said.He argued that bottom-up efforts like those undertaken by USAID recipients aligns with Trump's stated goal of regional stabilization — and dream of brokering more peace deals between Israel and Arab nations.“If you want to hear more ideas about diplomacy rather than further violence, peace-builders are the ones that essentially socialize those ideas, de-risk them, so that politicians then pick them up,” Lyndon said.The appetite for such efforts appears suppressed on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Israel, the governing coalition hinges on hardliners skeptical of diplomacy — and who have advanced their own legislation designed to hobble nonprofits. A proposed Knesset bill seeks to heavily tax foreign government funding for Israeli NGOs, threatening support not only from the United States but from other key backers like the EU, Germany and various embassies.Among Palestinians, leadership is split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and the Hamas terror group in Gaza that is committed to Israel's destruction. Some Palestinian activists, meanwhile, dismiss coexistence efforts as efforts to “normalize” Israel.And the United States under Trump has officially abandoned a commitment to a two-state solution, while also retreating from the historic role America has played in intervening abroad. Among the many overseas expenditures that officials have assailed are funding for Tomorrow's Youth Organization, a Palestinian NGO that Rep. Mike Lawler charged was headed by a “vicious anti-Israel rapper who advocates for Jew hatred” and, by Trump himself, support for an Arabic-language version of “Sesame Street.”But even some advocates of funding peace-building efforts see in the moment of crisis an opportunity to make improvements on flawed programs in the Middle East.Some critics of peace-building initiatives note that while many can count small-scale, individual successes, the field has failed to bring the region closer to peace.The MEPPA fund specifically has drawn criticism for favoring recipients who were inoffensive — and also potentially less effective. Samer Sinijlawi, a Palestinian activist and former Fatah member who spent five years in an Israeli prison during the first intifada, recalled that his bid for funds in partnership with Yishai Fleisher, a settler leader from Hebron, was rejected.'It was just cosmetic'“MEPPA didn't want to do something serious — it was just cosmetic,” said Sinijlawi. He added, “It needs to get complicated, messy, because that's where we live. You can't get anything done around here if you're scared of getting into trouble.”Meanwhile, some in the field are receptive to the argument that the fund and other international aid programs may include waste or are larger than needed.“Clean up shop, that's fine. Trim the fat,” said Meredith Rothbart, co-founder and CEO of Amal-Tikva, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit that seeks to expand capacity in the peace-building field. “But don't exclude societal leaders who have the deepest understanding, because then you leave a vacuum with no societal buy-in, creating a reality in which any agreement or desired future is essentially a house of cards.”Rothbart and Amal-Tikva's chief strategy officer, Ariel Markose, are soon heading to the United States to try to chart a path forward. Initially, they had planned to go to Washington to lobby for MEPPA's reinstatement, but with that seemingly off the table, their focus has shifted to understanding where the administration now stands on civil society peace-building.In New York, the pair will turn to private philanthropy to explore ways to secure more stable, flexible funding to insulate the field from political shifts. Stolov, too, said he aimed to make up the lost MEPPA grant with private fundraising.Lyndon is also looking to diversify ALLMEP's support. In December, the group met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advocate for an independent fund seeded by an array of entities that would not be vulnerable to shifting political winds in any particular country.“We want private donors, individual governments, independent entities all investing and leveraging their relative strengths to really engage Israeli and Palestinian society and build support for peace from the bottom up,” Lyndon said.Some in the United States remain hopeful that the MEPPA funds can be distributed through another government agency, such as the State Department or the International Development Finance Corporation, which has distributed some of the act's funds and so far has escaped the hatchet wielded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.But with the Trump administration still in slash-and-burn mode — literally, in the case of USAID, as workers have reportedly been told to burn documents — it's unclear whether U.S. support for any of the efforts has a future.Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, cited MEPPA in his statement mourning Lowey on Sunday. In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”
				



But that legacy is in jeopardy. All of the peace-building groups supported through the MEPPA fund have had their grants canceled amid the Trump administration's slashing of USAID, the United States' civilian foreign aid agency, and it's unclear whether restoring them is possible.“It took years to get MEPPA passed, and when it was passed, it never occurred to anyone that it could be terminated by the president,” said Dan McDonald, a career civil servant who has overseen MEPPA's implementation at USAID since its launch. “After years of carefully building these structures to see them all smashed to pieces in just moments is just one of many global tragedies that are playing out right now.” Members of the Jerusalem Youth Chorus, a MEPPA grantee, perform on ''America's Got Talent'' in an episode that aired July 16, 2024.

For some of the groups, the MEPPA funds allowed for unprecedented expansion.Each of the groups learned that their funds had been cut off via an email this month that attributed the decision to the “convenience and the interests of the U.S. government,” according to McDonald, who himself is set to lose his job next month.

Trim the fat,” said Meredith Rothbart, co-founder and CEO of Amal-Tikva, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit that seeks to expand capacity in the peace-building field. “But don't exclude societal leaders who have the deepest understanding, because then you leave a vacuum with no societal buy-in, creating a reality in which any agreement or desired future is essentially a house of cards.”Rothbart and Amal-Tikva's chief strategy officer, Ariel Markose, are soon heading to the United States to try to chart a path forward. Initially, they had planned to go to Washington to lobby for MEPPA's reinstatement, but with that seemingly off the table, their focus has shifted to understanding where the administration now stands on civil society peace-building.In New York, the pair will turn to private philanthropy to explore ways to secure more stable, flexible funding to insulate the field from political shifts. Stolov, too, said he aimed to make up the lost MEPPA grant with private fundraising.Lyndon is also looking to diversify ALLMEP's support. In December, the group met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advocate for an independent fund seeded by an array of entities that would not be vulnerable to shifting political winds in any particular country.“We want private donors, individual governments, independent entities all investing and leveraging their relative strengths to really engage Israeli and Palestinian society and build support for peace from the bottom up,” Lyndon said.Some in the United States remain hopeful that the MEPPA funds can be distributed through another government agency, such as the State Department or the International Development Finance Corporation, which has distributed some of the act's funds and so far has escaped the hatchet wielded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.But with the Trump administration still in slash-and-burn mode — literally, in the case of USAID, as workers have reportedly been told to burn documents — it's unclear whether U.S. support for any of the efforts has a future.Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, cited MEPPA in his statement mourning Lowey on Sunday. In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”
				



Like most agency employees, MEPPA staff were placed on administrative leave shortly after Trump took office in January. And earlier this month, the fund's beneficiaries were informed that their contracts were being terminated. Among the 27 civil society organizations to have their funds slashed: the Parents Circle, which had been promised $540,000 to amplify young Israelis and Palestinians calling for nonviolence; Women Wage Peace, one of whose prominent volunteers was murdered when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023; and the Jerusalem Youth Chorus, which appeared on “America's Got Talent” last July and announced in December that it had been allocated $500,000.Some of the grantees received much larger gifts — including $3.3 million to EcoPeace, which uses sustainability as a centerpiece for relationship-building, and $5 million to Middle East Education Through Technology, which teaches coding and design to Israeli and Palestinian teens. For some of the groups, the MEPPA funds allowed for unprecedented expansion.Each of the groups learned that their funds had been cut off via an email this month that attributed the decision to the “convenience and the interests of the U.S. government,” according to McDonald, who himself is set to lose his job next month. He said the email — which he learned about only through the grantees — was likely written by “folks in Washington who had never heard of MEPPA.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

Immediately, nearly all 40 chapters of the group, founded during the second intifada to bring Jews and Muslims together, shut down across Israel and the West Bank.But within months, most of the chapters had resumed full operations and many had expanded their efforts. Using the USAID funds, the groups held Jewish-Muslim Ramadan Iftar meals and launched a large-scale social media campaign to recruit new participants, bringing in several hundred people who had not previously engaged in interfaith activities. “When a cycle of violence happens, it shakes everybody. Some of those who are shaken become more afraid, more closed off. But others are moved to become more active in trying to create a different future, a better future. And they find us,” said CEO Yehuda Stolov. His group had $300,000 of its grant rescinded this month.The Alliance for Middle East Peace, a coalition of peace-building groups, says a quarter of its 160 member groups have expanded significantly since Oct. 7, while only a handful have contracted. Now, the MEPPA and broader USAID cuts are undercutting that growth, said John Lyndon, ALLMEP's executive director.“This is a very consequential and high-stakes moment for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the region, and to take the civil society actors who are working for peace and equality and coexistence off the playing field at this moment is a mistake,” Lyndon said.He argued that bottom-up efforts like those undertaken by USAID recipients aligns with Trump's stated goal of regional stabilization — and dream of brokering more peace deals between Israel and Arab nations.“If you want to hear more ideas about diplomacy rather than further violence, peace-builders are the ones that essentially socialize those ideas, de-risk them, so that politicians then pick them up,” Lyndon said.The appetite for such efforts appears suppressed on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Israel, the governing coalition hinges on hardliners skeptical of diplomacy — and who have advanced their own legislation designed to hobble nonprofits. A proposed Knesset bill seeks to heavily tax foreign government funding for Israeli NGOs, threatening support not only from the United States but from other key backers like the EU, Germany and various embassies.Among Palestinians, leadership is split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and the Hamas terror group in Gaza that is committed to Israel's destruction. Some Palestinian activists, meanwhile, dismiss coexistence efforts as efforts to “normalize” Israel.And the United States under Trump has officially abandoned a commitment to a two-state solution, while also retreating from the historic role America has played in intervening abroad. Among the many overseas expenditures that officials have assailed are funding for Tomorrow's Youth Organization, a Palestinian NGO that Rep. Mike Lawler charged was headed by a “vicious anti-Israel rapper who advocates for Jew hatred” and, by Trump himself, support for an Arabic-language version of “Sesame Street.”But even some advocates of funding peace-building efforts see in the moment of crisis an opportunity to make improvements on flawed programs in the Middle East.Some critics of peace-building initiatives note that while many can count small-scale, individual successes, the field has failed to bring the region closer to peace.The MEPPA fund specifically has drawn criticism for favoring recipients who were inoffensive — and also potentially less effective. Samer Sinijlawi, a Palestinian activist and former Fatah member who spent five years in an Israeli prison during the first intifada, recalled that his bid for funds in partnership with Yishai Fleisher, a settler leader from Hebron, was rejected.'It was just cosmetic'“MEPPA didn't want to do something serious — it was just cosmetic,” said Sinijlawi. He added, “It needs to get complicated, messy, because that's where we live.

He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”

For the organizations that had been receiving MEPPA funds, the abrupt cuts are especially painful because they thought they had already weathered the biggest crisis they could imagine: Oct. 7.The Interfaith Encounter Alliance had just signed for a $500,000 MEPPA grant when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023. Immediately, nearly all 40 chapters of the group, founded during the second intifada to bring Jews and Muslims together, shut down across Israel and the West Bank.But within months, most of the chapters had resumed full operations and many had expanded their efforts. Using the USAID funds, the groups held Jewish-Muslim Ramadan Iftar meals and launched a large-scale social media campaign to recruit new participants, bringing in several hundred people who had not previously engaged in interfaith activities. “When a cycle of violence happens, it shakes everybody. Some of those who are shaken become more afraid, more closed off. But others are moved to become more active in trying to create a different future, a better future.

Mike Lawler charged was headed by a “vicious anti-Israel rapper who advocates for Jew hatred” and, by Trump himself, support for an Arabic-language version of “Sesame Street.”But even some advocates of funding peace-building efforts see in the moment of crisis an opportunity to make improvements on flawed programs in the Middle East.Some critics of peace-building initiatives note that while many can count small-scale, individual successes, the field has failed to bring the region closer to peace.The MEPPA fund specifically has drawn criticism for favoring recipients who were inoffensive — and also potentially less effective. Samer Sinijlawi, a Palestinian activist and former Fatah member who spent five years in an Israeli prison during the first intifada, recalled that his bid for funds in partnership with Yishai Fleisher, a settler leader from Hebron, was rejected.'It was just cosmetic'“MEPPA didn't want to do something serious — it was just cosmetic,” said Sinijlawi. He added, “It needs to get complicated, messy, because that's where we live. You can't get anything done around here if you're scared of getting into trouble.”Meanwhile, some in the field are receptive to the argument that the fund and other international aid programs may include waste or are larger than needed.“Clean up shop, that's fine. Trim the fat,” said Meredith Rothbart, co-founder and CEO of Amal-Tikva, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit that seeks to expand capacity in the peace-building field. “But don't exclude societal leaders who have the deepest understanding, because then you leave a vacuum with no societal buy-in, creating a reality in which any agreement or desired future is essentially a house of cards.”Rothbart and Amal-Tikva's chief strategy officer, Ariel Markose, are soon heading to the United States to try to chart a path forward. Initially, they had planned to go to Washington to lobby for MEPPA's reinstatement, but with that seemingly off the table, their focus has shifted to understanding where the administration now stands on civil society peace-building.In New York, the pair will turn to private philanthropy to explore ways to secure more stable, flexible funding to insulate the field from political shifts. Stolov, too, said he aimed to make up the lost MEPPA grant with private fundraising.Lyndon is also looking to diversify ALLMEP's support. In December, the group met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advocate for an independent fund seeded by an array of entities that would not be vulnerable to shifting political winds in any particular country.“We want private donors, individual governments, independent entities all investing and leveraging their relative strengths to really engage Israeli and Palestinian society and build support for peace from the bottom up,” Lyndon said.Some in the United States remain hopeful that the MEPPA funds can be distributed through another government agency, such as the State Department or the International Development Finance Corporation, which has distributed some of the act's funds and so far has escaped the hatchet wielded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.But with the Trump administration still in slash-and-burn mode — literally, in the case of USAID, as workers have reportedly been told to burn documents — it's unclear whether U.S. support for any of the efforts has a future.Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, cited MEPPA in his statement mourning Lowey on Sunday. In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”
				



The Alliance for Middle East Peace, a coalition of peace-building groups, says a quarter of its 160 member groups have expanded significantly since Oct. 7, while only a handful have contracted. Now, the MEPPA and broader USAID cuts are undercutting that growth, said John Lyndon, ALLMEP's executive director.“This is a very consequential and high-stakes moment for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the region, and to take the civil society actors who are working for peace and equality and coexistence off the playing field at this moment is a mistake,” Lyndon said.He argued that bottom-up efforts like those undertaken by USAID recipients aligns with Trump's stated goal of regional stabilization — and dream of brokering more peace deals between Israel and Arab nations.“If you want to hear more ideas about diplomacy rather than further violence, peace-builders are the ones that essentially socialize those ideas, de-risk them, so that politicians then pick them up,” Lyndon said.The appetite for such efforts appears suppressed on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Israel, the governing coalition hinges on hardliners skeptical of diplomacy — and who have advanced their own legislation designed to hobble nonprofits. A proposed Knesset bill seeks to heavily tax foreign government funding for Israeli NGOs, threatening support not only from the United States but from other key backers like the EU, Germany and various embassies.Among Palestinians, leadership is split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and the Hamas terror group in Gaza that is committed to Israel's destruction.

Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable.

Among Palestinians, leadership is split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and the Hamas terror group in Gaza that is committed to Israel's destruction.

Trim the fat,” said Meredith Rothbart, co-founder and CEO of Amal-Tikva, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit that seeks to expand capacity in the peace-building field. “But don't exclude societal leaders who have the deepest understanding, because then you leave a vacuum with no societal buy-in, creating a reality in which any agreement or desired future is essentially a house of cards.”Rothbart and Amal-Tikva's chief strategy officer, Ariel Markose, are soon heading to the United States to try to chart a path forward. Initially, they had planned to go to Washington to lobby for MEPPA's reinstatement, but with that seemingly off the table, their focus has shifted to understanding where the administration now stands on civil society peace-building.In New York, the pair will turn to private philanthropy to explore ways to secure more stable, flexible funding to insulate the field from political shifts. Stolov, too, said he aimed to make up the lost MEPPA grant with private fundraising.Lyndon is also looking to diversify ALLMEP's support. In December, the group met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advocate for an independent fund seeded by an array of entities that would not be vulnerable to shifting political winds in any particular country.“We want private donors, individual governments, independent entities all investing and leveraging their relative strengths to really engage Israeli and Palestinian society and build support for peace from the bottom up,” Lyndon said.Some in the United States remain hopeful that the MEPPA funds can be distributed through another government agency, such as the State Department or the International Development Finance Corporation, which has distributed some of the act's funds and so far has escaped the hatchet wielded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.But with the Trump administration still in slash-and-burn mode — literally, in the case of USAID, as workers have reportedly been told to burn documents — it's unclear whether U.S. support for any of the efforts has a future.Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, cited MEPPA in his statement mourning Lowey on Sunday. In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”

In a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he decried cuts to the program.“My friend Nita Lowey championed the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act because she understood that fostering grassroots engagement between Israelis and Palestinians is vital to the security of both peoples and the region,” Hoyer said. “DOGE's unconstitutional effort to defund the program is part of the Trump Administration's disastrous strategy to force America to retreat from the world. Trump has sabotaged America's reputation and credibility, leaving our country, our allies, and our world less safe.”The White House did not return a request for comment.As U.S. Jewish groups such as the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC praised MEPPA in encomiums to Lowey, they did not mention its current turmoil. The American Jewish Committee, for example, said in a statement that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.”But behind the scenes, some of the organizations have been actively engaging with the Trump administration, Congress and external partners to push for MEPPA's continuation and gain clarity on its fate, according to Benjamin Rogers, the AJC's director of Middle East and North Africa Initiatives. He called the fund vital for Israeli-Arab cooperation at a time of “heartbreak, mistrust and trauma.”One key question, Rogers said, is whether any part of MEPPA can be salvaged and in what form, citing the possibility of shifting it from USAID to the State Department, which would entail different oversight and legislative priorities.“We've heard people saying MEPPA is dead, while others are saying it's not. We're just trying to get clarity right now,” he said. “Will there be any exceptions made? Will it be for the entire MEPPA program or just for certain individual contracts?”Rogers said that no decisions had been made and expressed concern over the lack of a clear timeframe, noting that many organizations were “fervently reliant on MEPPA for their survival.”It's not just the groups that are fighting to survive, said Markose, and it's not just idealism that keeps her and others trying to do difficult work at a fraught time.“I'm not doing it for the Palestinians. I'm not doing it because I assume that I have Palestinian partners — even though I believe that I do,” she said. “I'm doing it for my own family, for my own kids. This is something that I think hasn't been given a chance. We have five men in my family serving in the IDF at the same time, my brother-in-law was injured — it's unsustainable. For me, this is personal.”

US attorney general Pam Bondi on Tuesday issued a statement calling the attacks on Tesla vehicles “nothing short of domestic terrorism” and vowed to impose severe consequences for those involved in the crime, reported ABC News.

Pam Bondi said, ""The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences.""

She added, “We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.""

The attorney's general's statement comes in the aftermath of a fire at a Tesla Collision Centre in Las Vegas early on Tuesday morning. Five Tesla vehicles were damaged according to police officials quoted by ABC News, in this latest attack on the electric vehicle company owned by Elon Musk.

Officials stated that not only were the vehicles burnt, but the word “RESIST” was spray-painted across the doors of the facility. Three rounds of bullets were also shot at the rest of the Tesla vehicles.

The assistant sheriff of the Las Vegas metropolitan police stated that this was a targeted attack against the Tesla facility. The perpetrator of the crime is suspected to have approached the place wearing black clothes and is believed to have used a gun and Molotov cocktails to carry out the attack.

The local police and the FBI's joint terrorism task force have been conducting an investigation into the incident and searching for the suspect.

This is not the first such event targeting Tesla cars. In Kansas on Monday, two Tesla Cybertrucks were damaged after a fire erupted at a dealership. Such attacks on dealerships with Tesla cars or charging stations have been increasing since CEO Elon Musk took over the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration.

In a post on X on March 17, Elon Musk said, “My companies make great products that people love and I've never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me? Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls.”

Sunita Williams Return: Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returned to Earth after spending over nine months at the International Space Station (ISS) due to unexpected delays. Their spacecraft, SpaceX's Dragon Freedom capsule, successfully splashed down off the Florida coast near Tallahassee, at 5.57 pm ET on Tuesday (3:27 am IST, Wednesday)....Read More

‘Butch and Suni' were accompanied by astronauts Nick Hague and Aleksandr Grebyonkin who reached the ISS in December as part of a rescue mission planned by NASA and SpaceX. “On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” radioed SpaceX Mission Control in California. An hour after their 17-hour-long journey, the astronauts were out of their scorched capsule, waving and smiling at the cameras while being hustled away in reclining stretchers for routine medical checks. Political undertones of the successful rescue were hard to miss as The White House claimed that the rescue mission was due to President Trump's efforts. “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!” it wrote on X. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore travelled to the ISS in June last year for a scheduled eight-day mission. They were forced to stay as the Boeing Starliner capsule developed issues with its propulsion system. The duo was the first crew to fly Boeing's Starliner in a test flight.

Sunita Williams live updates: NASA's 45-day post-mission rehabilitation program is designed to help astronauts recover from the physical effects of spaceflight, particularly those experienced after long-duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS) or other space environments.

While the program lasts 45 days, full recovery may take longer, especially after extended space missions. Some astronauts report lingering effects even months or years later, particularly in bone density and cardiovascular health.

Sunita Williams live updates: Another physical challenge faced by astronauts during their space stays is ""fluid shift""—the redistribution of bodily fluids toward the head in microgravity. This can increase calcium levels in urine, raising the risk of kidney stones.

Fluid shifts might also contribute to increased intracranial pressure, altering the shape of the eyeball and causing spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), causing mild-to-moderate vision impairment. Another theory suggests raised carbon dioxide levels are the cause. (AFP)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday accused Russia of ""effectively rejecting"" US-backed ceasefire proposals after fresh strikes targeted civilian infrastructure.

During a 90-minute call with US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to pause attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities but refused a full ceasefire unless the West halted all military aid.

Shortly after the call, air raid sirens sounded, and explosions were reported across Ukraine. Zelensky later confirmed strikes on civilian areas, stating in a post on X that a hospital in Sumy was hit. ""Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire,"" he wrote.

According to the Kremlin, Putin has ordered a 30-day suspension of strikes on Ukrainian energy sites. However, he maintained that the ""key condition"" for peace remains the ""complete cessation"" of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's forces.

Washington has been advocating for a full 30-day ceasefire as an initial step toward resolving the ongoing three-year war. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has been working to secure a breakthrough in the Ukraine conflict, claiming to have an ""understanding"" with Putin.

His announcement of direct negotiations with Russia to end the war surprised the world and raised concerns among allies about a potential shift in US policy toward Moscow.

Trump described his recent call with Putin as ""good and productive,"" while the White House stated that the Russian leader had agreed to a temporary 30-day pause on strikes targeting energy infrastructure.

However, Moscow maintained that a broader ceasefire would only be possible if the West stopped supporting Ukraine's military or intelligence.

The Kremlin also stressed that Kyiv must not rearm or mobilize during the ceasefire period. Zelensky, who had previously accepted a full ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia, criticised Russia's reluctance to commit to an agreement. ""They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that.""

He also said that Ukrainian forces would continue operations in Russia's Kursk region ""as long as we need,"" despite Russia's recent advances in the area that Ukraine had partially captured last year.

Moscow claimed that Ukrainian forces attempted a ground assault on the Belgorod region earlier but were repelled, framing it as an effort to derail the Trump-Putin negotiations.

Trump remains determined to fulfil his campaign promise to end the Ukraine war, blaming Joe Biden's previous policies on Russia for escalating the conflict.

His approach represents a stark departure from past US policy, as seen in his highly publicised Oval Office confrontation with Zelensky.

Western allies remain sceptical about Putin's intentions. Following the Kremlin's statement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine with military aid. ""Ukraine can count on us,"" Scholz said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines also expressed doubts. ""How can you trust people who attack you and kill civilians, including children?"" said Oleksandr, 35, who had returned to military training in Donetsk after recovering from combat injuries.

A Bengaluru-based breeder has shelled out a staggering sum to acquire a cross between a wolf and a dog. S Satish spent 4.4 million pounds (or ₹50 crore approximately) to buy an extremely rare “wolfdog,” The Sun has reported.

The wolfdog – believed to be the first of its kind – is a cross between an actual wolf and a Caucasian Shepherd. Named Cadaboms Okami, it was sold to Sathish in February.

Cadaboms Okami was born in the United States. At just eight months old, he already weighs more than 75 kilograms and eats 3 kg of raw meat every day.

The pooch is a cross between a wolf and a Caucasian Shepherd. Caucasian Shepherds are massive, powerful guard dogs known for their protective nature, thick fur, and origins in the Caucasus Mountains, where they were bred to defend livestock from predators.

“He is an extremely rare breed of dog and looks exactly like a wolf. This breed has not been sold in the world before,” Satish was quoted as saying by The Sun.

“The dog was bred in the US and is extraordinary. I spent 50 million rupees on buying this pup because I am fond of dogs and like to own unique dogs and introduce them to India,” said the 51-year-old president of the Indian Dog Breeders Association.

Already, the wolfdog has become a sensation in Karnataka, where he has attended several high-profile events with Satish.

 

A post shared by Satish S (@satishcadaboms)

Satish stopped breeding dogs about a decade ago but now makes a substantial income simply by showcasing his rare breeds to eager audiences. He claims he can make around ₹25,000 for just a 30-minute appearance.

“I spent money on these dogs because they are rare. Besides, I get enough money because people are always curious to see them,” he says. “They take selfies and pictures. My dog and I get more attention than an actor at a movie screening, we both are crowd-pullers.”

Cadaboms Okami, the famous wolfdog, lives on a 7-acre farm with Satish's other dogs. Each dog has a 20ft by 20ft room and plenty of space to run around, says the Bengaluru breeder.

“There is enough space for them to walk and run. There are six people to look after them. They don't need air conditioner as the weather in the city is cool but they are well taken care of

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are returning to the Earth after a nine-month-long overstay at the International Space Station (ISS).

As Sunita ‘Suni' Williams and Butch Wilmore return home, some of the health risks they have encountered are well-understood and managed, while others continue to remain unknown.

The American astronauts are accompanied by astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, who reached the ISS in December on a rescue mission to bring the stranded duo back.

NASA said the Crew-9 members successfully undocked from the ISS as scheduled. “Sunni and Butch successfully begin their belated journey back home,” the agency said in its commentary.

The four-member crew undocked from the ISS at 1:05 am ET (10:35 am IST) and began a 17-hour trip back to Earth. The replacement crew was handed over the responsibilities of the mission to Crew-10 before Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returned to Earth.

The four astronauts from Crew-9 expected to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico at 5:57 pm ET on Tuesday (3:27 am IST, Wednesday). The exact location of the landing will depend on local weather conditions.

The focus will now shift to their scientific discoveries and also their physical recovery after enduring challenging conditions in space.

Humans' basic physical movements on Earth resist gravity, an element missing in space. Such challenging conditions lead to bone and muscle deterioration, radiation exposure, vision impairment, and loneliness due to physical isolation.

To counteract physical degradation, astronauts use three exercise machines on the ISS, including a 2009-installed resistance device that simulates free weights using vacuum tubes and flywheel cables.

Rihana Bokhari, an assistant professor at the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College, told AFP that a two-hour daily workout keeps them in shape. “The best results that we have to show that we're being very effective is that we don't really have a fracture problem in astronauts when they return to the ground, though the bone loss is still detectable on scans,” she said.

Emmanuel Urquieta, vice chair of Aerospace Medicine at the University of Central Florida, said astronauts tend to lose balance after landing on Earth and must train their ears again. “This happens to every single astronaut, even those who go into space just for a few days,” he said.

Microgravity conditions also cause bodily fluids to be redistributed toward the head. This increases calcium levels in the blood, raising the risk of kidney stones.

Fluid shifts might also lead to increased intracranial pressure, altering the shape of the eyeball and causing spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), causing mild-to-moderate vision impairment, the AFP report mentioned. Another theory suggests raised carbon dioxide levels are the cause.

Radiation levels inside the ISS are higher as it passes through the Van Allen radiation belt, which safeguards the Earth's own magnetic field from being ripped off by cosmic events.

Though the Earth's magnetic field offers significant protection, astrophysicist Siegfried Eggl noted that missions to Mars and the Moon will increase exposure to cosmic radiation from the Sun.

NASA aims to limit astronauts' increased lifetime cancer risk to within three per cent. The agency's 45-day post-mission rehabilitation program is designed to help astronauts recover from the physical effects of spaceflight, particularly those experienced after long-duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS) or other space environments.

While the program lasts 45 days, full recovery may take longer, especially after extended space missions. Some astronauts report lingering effects even months or years later, particularly in bone density and cardiovascular health.

Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore have returned to Earth after spending 286 days in space. However, their troubles may not be over as readjusting to Earth can be difficult due to the damage caused to the human body during space travel.

Sunita Williams' and Barry Wilmore returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, along with astronauts Nick Hague and Alexander Gorbunov. After their capsule splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, they were both immediately taken for medical tests on reclining stretchers.

After experiencing microgravity for more than nine months, the rescued astronauts will face some changes to their body as well as added health risks, which could become permanent without proper care and treatment.

Here are a few bodily changes that astronauts are likely to face after an extended stay in space.

An astronaut's bones and muscles operate differently in microgravity, and after returning to Earth, it can make it difficult for one to stand, walk or hold things.

In space, without the weight of the gravity experienced on Earth, the spine elongates, causing a temporary height gain. However, on the flip side, cells that build bone tissue become slower and those which damage bones continue to grow at a normal pace, making bone deterioration faster. Muscles also begin to weaken due to the lack of pull from gravity.

Every month in space, an astronaut's weight-bearing bones lose one per cent of their density, making them weaker and more brittle. As calluses decrease, and the body become less used to the use of muscles and bone in the legs, astronauts end up developing “baby feet”, a condition that causes you to lose the thick part under your feet, hindering the ability to walk.

The human heart, brain and circulatory system are also affected due to a prolonged stay in space. In microgravity, fluids from the rest of the body tend to shift upward toward the head.

This fluid redistribution results in facial puffiness, nasal congestion, and increased pressure inside the skull, while the legs experience a loss of fluids. This makes the head appear bigger, while the legs appear smaller and weaker. This phenomenon is called ""puffy-head bird-legs syndrome”.

The increase of fluid in the brain can also lead to hearing loss, vision loss and a disorder known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) caused by added pressure to the brain.

The heart in space changes from an oval shape to a round shape, and muscle atrophy constricts blood vessels, which causes damage to the circulatory system. The loss of blood volume upon an astronaut's return to Earth, can make it difficult to regulate blood pressure, and cause dizziness, nausea and fainting spells.

While baby feet, facial puffiness, bone density loss etc can be painful and debilitating, recovery is possible with the help of exercise, and medication over time. However, a few permanent changes to an astronauts body pose more serious health risks.

In space, astronauts are exposed to high levels of radiation from the Sun, which can can cause significant long-term health issues for astronauts, putting them at risk for cancer, degenerative diseases and issues with the central nervous system. In nine months, Sunita Williams would have been exposed to radiation levels equal to almost 270 chest X-rays.

This coupled with bone density loss and lowered immune levels can increase risks of osteoporosis and make recovery difficult as well.

According to a 2019 research case, named the Twins Study, NASA stated that while most genes in the human body reset after returning to Earth, about 7 per cent of them remain disrupted by the experience.

Space travel can also permanently alter many aspects of an astronauts mental health. Due to disturbed sleep cycles and circadian rhythms (internal body clock), isolation and stress, astronauts have an increased risk for mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety as well as cognitive decline.

The Trump administration released 80,000 files related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination Tuesday evening, March 18. The files' release was ordered by President Donald Trump as part of a campaign promise to declassify all remaining records. With the release of the documents, layers of secrecy surrounding the events of November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, are expected to be peeled back.

Conspiracy theories about the assassination have been swirling around for decades now. While the official narrative was that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, fresh evidence suggests that the truth may be different.

CIA involvement: One of the most shocking revelations is the suggestion of CIA involvement in the lead-up to Kennedy's assassination. A newly declassified memo from November 1963 reveals how a CIA officer expressed alarm over Oswald's activities, including the fact that he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City weeks before killing Kennedy. However, higher-ups shockingly dismissed the concerns. While the files do not confirm a CIA-orchestrated hit, they do indicate the agency was either complicit or incompetent.

A second shooter: One of the explosive finds in the files in the evidence supporting the theory that there was a second shooter – something that has long been debated. The Warren Commission insisted that Oswald acted alone, and that he fired three shots in 8.6 seconds. However, ballistic reports and witness testimonies in the newly-released files say that does not add up. According to the documents, a shot may have come from the grassy knoll, which was an elevated area ahead of Kennedy's motorcade. The new suggestion seems to contradict the lone-gunman theory. Back in 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that there was a “high probability” of a second shooter based on acoustic evidence. The new files support the theory with witness accounts. There is one suppressed statement from a Dallas bystander who was forced to remain silent by government agents, The Guardian reported.

Mafia connections: Transcripts of wiretaps suggest that there could have been an involvement of organised crime in the assassination plot, with mob bosses discussing the need to “take care of Kennedy.” One of the bombshell documents even links Chicago mob bosses to training Cuban militiamen, as uncovered by ABC7 Chicago. The files suggest there could have been a coalition of mobsters, anti-Castro Cubans, as well as rogue CIA elements. The motive could have been revenge, taking into account that the president's perceived betrayal during the Bay of Pigs alienated mafia figures who had lost Cuban casino operations to Fidel Castro's revolution.

Additional bombshells: Some other explosive revelations were also made in the files, including the fact that a CIA memo details officer George Joannides funneling $25,000 to an anti-Castro group that was linked to Oswald. This raised questions about the CIA's relationship with the killer. Another file revealed that there was intensified CIA surveillance of Oswald's Cuban intelligence contacts, but no action was taken. Further, an FBI record of a phone call received before Oswald's death predicted his murder by Jack Ruby, suggesting someone may have been aware of more than they let on.

On Tuesday, 1,123 pages strong documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination were released, adding to the over 5 million pages already disclosed. The files include details about Lee Harvey Oswald's travels, including a trip to Finland before the assassination. 

Among the records is the FBI memo written by Director J. Edgar Hoover just hours after Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby that implores the government to assure the public that Oswald was the one who killed Kennedy.

These files, released under an order by President Donald Trump, have been made available on the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration website.

Trump had stated, “We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,” while visiting the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Approximately 3,000 records had not been fully released, and the FBI recently discovered about 2,400 new records, per report.

Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, was arrested for assassinating Kennedy on November 22, 1963, while the president's motorcade moved through Dallas. The Warren Commission, which was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, reported Oswald acted alone.

The newly released files contain information about Oswald's connections to foreign entities and his activities leading up to the assassination. Some documents suggest he had interactions with Soviet and Cuban officials while living abroad and during his return to the United States.

Oswald was known to have visited both the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City weeks before the assassination, where witnesses say he inquired about a visa to Cuba. Speculation about foreign involvement has been fueled by this, with no evidence to prove he was ever involved in an international conspiracy.

Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner who fatally shot Oswald, at point-blank range on live television just two days after his arrest.

The files reveal that Ruby had deeper connections to organized crime than previously understood.

Born around sometime in 1911, somewhere in Chicago, Jacob Leon Rubenstein, as he was originally known, survived the traumatic and violent upbringing he lived through, in which he tangled at least with the police on a number of occasions, and spent much of his time in or around that underworld in the Windy City.

By 1963, Ruby has tried a string of business ventures without much success. His first failure, though, was that of an ""upscale"" place: the Sovereign Club, which did not succeed, so he renamed it the Carousel Club (buying it out with a joint offer of champagne, beer, pizza, a band and a couple of strippers).

Some documents suggest he had associations with figures involved in illegal activities, including gambling and racketeering, raising questions about whether he acted independently or was instructed to kill Oswald to silence him.

“Ruby is, for some people, the Rosetta Stone that you can use to unwrap the entire Kennedy conspiracy theory. But for others, he's just a guy who took matters into his own hands because he loved Kennedy and wanted to spare Jackie [the president's wife] the pain of possibly coming back to Dallas to testify in a trial,” Stephen Fagin, the curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza said.

The White House on Wednesday said President Donald Trump's promise to rescue astronauts stranded in space for nine months has been fulfilled, with the crew safely splashing down in the Gulf of America, thanking SpaceX, NASA, and Elon Musk.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore spent 286 days in space, far exceeding their original plan by 278 days. Throughout their journey, they orbited Earth 4,576 times and covered a distance of 121 million miles (195 million kilometers) before returning home.

“PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!” White House said in a post on X. 

On January 28, 2025, President Donald Trump said he told Elon Musk and SpaceX to retrieve two astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS). 

In a Truth Social post, he wrote, “I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to ‘go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!” 

This was about Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who had been there since June 2024, with a SpaceX return already set for late March 2025. 

The two NASA astronauts, along with American astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, made a successful splashdown off the coast of Florida at 5:57 pm ET on Tuesday (3:27 am IST, Wednesday).

The four-member Crew-10 aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) early on Sunday, where they replaced Wilmore and Williams. 

“On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” SpaceX Mission Control in California communicated.

“What a ride,” replied NASA astronaut Nick Hague, commander of the capsule.

The astronauts will be taken to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for a few days of health assessments, as part of the standard procedure for astronaut returns. 

They will be cleared by NASA flight surgeons before being allowed to reunite with their families.

President John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, blasted CNN for covering the 80,000 files related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination that were released by President Donald Trump Tuesday evening, March 18. He also accused the Trump administration of not giving a “heads up” to the slain president's family about the release.

The files' release was ordered by Trump as part of a campaign promise to declassify all remaining records. With the release of the files, layers of secrecy surrounding the events of November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, could be peeled back.

In a video Schlossberg shared on X after the files were released, the 32-year-old appeared sweaty and breathless as he freaked out over CNN's reporting, seen playing on a TV behind him. “You're better than this. This is so f–king stupid. There's so much actual news going on. Why are you covering this?” Schlossberg said.

“At least report that something happened. I love you Harry Enten, you're really smart. Why are you guys covering this? I love you Erin Burnett, you're really smart, why are you covering this?” Schlossberg, the son of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, added.

‘The Trump administration did not give anyone in president Kennedy's family “a heads up”'Schlossberg followed up the video with more angry posts.  “No — THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DID NOT GIVE ANYONE IN PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S FAMILY “A HEADS UP”ABOUT THE RELEASE. a total surprise, and not shocker !!

In another post, Schlossberg wrote, “WHAT THE JFK FILES SAY ABOUT ME IS NOT TRUE. IM STRAIGHT”.

Schlossberg also slammed Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah for a post saying, “Why did it take so long to release the JFK files?” Sharing Lee's post, Schlossberg wrote, ""You really care about JFK's legacy ? You're dismantling it. Go ask Bobby for a retweet"".

Tesla owners around the United States have lost their personal information, apparently under a controversial website called ‘Dogequest' that hopes to shame and intimidate them as CEO Elon Musk further strengthen his ties to the Trump administration.

The website features an interactive map that reportedly displays the names, addresses, and phone numbers of Tesla owners, as well as the locations of Tesla dealerships. The site also uses a Molotov cocktail as a cursor, per 404 Media.

The outlet also reported that the site operators would only remove Tesla owners' personal data if they provided proof that they had sold their vehicles.

“If you're on the hunt for a Tesla to unleash your artistic flair with a spray can, just step outside — no map needed! At DOGEQUEST, we believe in empowering creative expressions of protest that you can execute from the comfort of your own home.”

Under the section titled “I want my information removed,” the site says, “Absolutely! Just provide us with proof that you've sold your Tesla.”

Earlier this month, a woman in Loveland, Colorado, was arrested after allegedly attacking a Tesla dealership with an incendiary device.

Two Tesla dealerships in Oregon were also reportedly targeted by gunfire in recent weeks, though no injuries were reported.

Owners of the Cybertruck, Tesla's recently released electric pickup, have also reported frequent harassment, including obscene gestures and verbal abuse from passersby.

Dogequest reportedly displays personal details of individuals associated with Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), though 404 Media has not confirmed the authenticity of this information.

While doxing itself is not explicitly illegal under U.S. federal law, it can violate existing statutes related to harassment, stalking, threats, and invasion of privacy. In certain cases, individuals responsible for doxing can face criminal charges or civil lawsuits.

404 Media has verified that some of the individuals listed on the site are indeed Tesla owners or have publicly supported Musk and his company.

Meanwhile, following the huge backlash, on Tuesday, Tesla shares declined by 6% in morning trading, with shares hovering around $230 at noon.

Democratic content creator and TikTok influencer Harry Sisson was reportedly embroiled in a shocking Snapchat scandal. According to conversation threads going viral on X, the Gen Z political commentator allegedly convinced nearly a dozen women to share explicit photos of themselves via Snapchat. One of the purported victims is believed to have been a domestic abuse survivor, per @ExxAlerts' tweet.

Sarah Fields, who goes by @SarahisCensored and is a Republican State Delegate according to her X bio, also appeared to have exposed Sisson on the Elon Musk-led microblogging platform. She further claimed, “When the women discovered each other one by one, he called them all insane and attempted to coerce one of them into telling the public that the photos were 'fake.'”

She plugged several “receipts,” including public TikTok videos of women claiming to be victims of Harry Sisson's alleged inappropriate Snapchat streak. Field slammed the liberal influencer, pointing out that videos of women speaking out about the situation were not gaining much traction on social media while Sisson continued to “collect millions of views for his videos claiming that he is a supporter of women and a champion for women's rights.”

Sisson, who is in his early 20s, currently has over 1.8 million followers on TikTok. According to the pinned videos on his TikTok profile, he's previously met with former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Netizens couldn't help but call out the hypocrisy in light of allegations against Harry surfacing online. “The same guy who lectures everyone on “morals” and “decency” behind a camera… and this is what he's doing in private. Can't make this stuff up,” a user commented under the ExxAlerts thread.

Check out Sarah Fields' thread exposing Harry Sisson:

Harry Sisson's alleged victims speak outAs per Carlee (@carleehosch on TikTok), one of Harry's alleged victims, the top Democratic influencer “wooed” her from the beginning. He reportedly had her convinced that he respected her and had no plans of objectifying her. Sarah Fields explained that even though Carlee is admittedly embarrassed, “she created a private chat to chat with Harry that was meant for his eyes only.” She's then believed to have shared explicit photos of herself with him via this channel. “He loved it. He loved that I was not entertaining anyone else the way I was entertaining him,” Carlee alleges in a video. Harry, on the other hand, reportedly declared her “wifey material” and that he was “sold” on her wife applications. According to Carlee's revelations, Sisson continued to interact the same way with her for six months until he told her that he wasn't looking for a commitment. When she confronted him about leading her on, he admitted to it, saying “he should have made his intentions clear.” Carlee accused Harry of posting a “thirst trap,” i.e. a photo of himself and his new girlfriend on TikTok shortly after their argument. She also blamed Sisson for taking advantage of her vulnerability as she had been battling depression at the time in the aftermath of a traumatic car accident. When she finally went live with her side of the story, Carlee found out that during the nine months of interaction with Sisson, the influencer was similarly leading other women simultaneously. He is believed to have manipulated all alleged victims in the same way, finally convincing them to send him explicit messages via Snapchat. Fields supported her expose of Sisson with screenshots of snaps and text chains exchanged between him and Carlee. One of these messages from Harry to her reads, “I never lied to you We were not exclusive and I made it abundantly clear I didn't want that and you said that was fine I haven't done anything that wasn't allowed within the parameters we set What and why are you screenshotting.” The receipts in question also shed light on Harry telling Carlee “I'd f*ck you raw after the wine tasting” via Snapchat.

A 36-second video shared by SpaceX captured the moment SpaceX's Crew-9 capsule splashed down on Earth, carrying NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who had been stranded in space for nine months.

The two NASA astronauts spent 286 days in orbit before finally returning to Earth aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, marking the end of a prolonged mission that drew global attention and highlighted a setback for Boeing Co.'s space program.

Williams and Wilmore, along with NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, descended under parachutes before safely landing off the Florida coast around 6pm New York time on Tuesday (3:30 am IST on Wednesday).

President Donald Trump gave a huge shoutout to Elon Musk after the SpaceX Crew Dragon brought astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore back home. The astronauts returned home after being stuck in space for nine months.

Reiterating the claim that Joe Biden abandoned the astronauts, Trump said in an interview with Fox News, hailing Musk as a “patriot,” “When I got into office, I said ‘Elon, we gotta get them out of there…Elon is able to do that with his genius, yet there are people who hate it, and I really believe these are people who hate our country.”

Meanwhile, Musk thanked Trump for giving importance to the mission, and congratulated SpaceX and NASA. “Congratulations to the @SpaceX and @NASA teams for another safe astronaut return!” he posted on X. “Thank you to @POTUS for prioritizing this mission!”

‘PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT'NASA astronauts Williams and Wilmore splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule just before 6 pm EST Tuesday, March 18. “Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” a mission-control dispatcher radioed the crew shortly after the capsule Dragon Freedom splashed down. The White House took to X to remind the world that Trump kept his promise to bring the astronauts back safely. “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months,” the White House wrote. “Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!”

“They have to get, they have to get better. It's going to be a little bit tough for them. It's not easy. They were up there a long time, and when they do, they'll come to the Oval Office,” he added.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will visit the White House after they “get better”. 

In an interview with Fox News, Trump was asked when will the two astronauts visit the Oval Office. 

“They have to get better. When you are up there (in space), you have no pull in your muscle and gravity. You can lift a thousand pounds like this,” the US President said.

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams returned to Earth on Wednesday, after being stuck for nine months in space.

Wilmore and Williams ended up spending 286 days in space — 278 days longer than anticipated when they launched. They circled Earth 4,576 times and traveled 121 million miles (195 million kilometers) by the time of splashdown.

Both had lived on the orbiting lab before and knew the ropes, and brushed up on their station training before rocketing away. Williams became the station's commander three months into their stay and held the post until earlier this month, AP reported.

NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing after the shuttle programme ended, to have two competing US companies for transporting astronauts to and from the space station until it was abandoned in 2030 and steered to a fiery reentry. 

By then, it will have been up there for more than three decades; the plan is to replace it with privately run stations so NASA can focus on moon and Mars expeditions.

Gary Underhill was a former CIA agent whose death remains shrouded in mystery after he alleged that the “agency was responsible for President John F. Kennedy's assassination”.

On Tuesday, 1,123 pages of documents related to Kennedy's assassination were released, adding to the over 5 million pages already disclosed. These newly released JFK files have renewed interest in Underhill's story, as they suggest he feared for his life after making these claims.

Underhill, who had intelligence connections, reportedly fled Washington, D.C., immediately after the assassination. He sought refuge with friends in New Jersey, where he expressed deep fear and urgency.

“The day after the assassination, Gary Underhill left Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he showed up at the home of friends in New Jersey. He was very agitated,” the classified FBI memo read.

ALSO READ| What do the JFK files reveal about Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby?

Underhill confided in his friend Charlene Fitsimmons that he believed Kennedy had been killed by a faction within the CIA.

“A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and probably would have to leave the country.”

Less than six months later, on May 8, 1964, Underhill was found dead in his Washington apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. “Less than six months later Underhill was found shot to death in his Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide,” the memo noted.

Before his death, Underhill insisted that Lee Harvey Oswald had been framed for Kennedy's murder. “Oswald is a patsy. They set him up. It's too much. The ba****ds have done something outrageous. They've killed the President! I've been listening and hearing things. I couldn't believe they'd get away with it, but they did!” he told Fitsimmons.

He also voiced fears about his own safety, telling friends, “I know who they are. That's the problem. They know I know. That's why I'm here. I can't stay in New York.”

Notably, at the time, the CIA was deeply involved in covert operations aimed at overthrowing Cuba's government, including the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and assassination attempts on Fidel Castro.

Kennedy's reluctance to fully support these actions, along with his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis, created tensions between him and elements within the intelligence community.

Prince Harry's U.S. visa documents have finally been released under Freedom of Information, though they have been heavily redacted.

The U.S. government was given until the end of Tuesday to disclose the documents related to Prince Harry's immigration status.

“Plaintiffs allege that the records should be disclosed as public confidence in the government would suffer or to establish whether the Duke was granted preferential treatment,” the released court documents state.

“This speculation by Plaintiffs does not point to any evidence of government misconduct.”

The documents further clarify that “the records, as explained above, do not support such an allegation but show the regulatory process involved in reviewing and granting immigration benefits which was done in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1103 and applicable rules and regulation,” per The Sun.

Judge Carl Nichols ruled in favour of the Heritage Foundation's request to release the documents, but many of the requested pages were redacted. The foundation pushed for their disclosure after Prince Harry publicly admitted to using illegal substances in his memoir Spare and his Netflix series.

One of the main concerns was whether Harry had received special treatment under the previous U.S. administration or if he had misrepresented his drug use history. However, the redacted documents appear to indicate that no such favouritism took place.

The legal battle over Harry's immigration records began after the Heritage Foundation argued that the Duke should not have been allowed into the U.S. after publicly admitting to drug use. 

In Spare, Harry wrote about his experiences with narcotics, stating that cocaine “didn't do anything for me” but that “marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.”

ALSO READ| Royal journalist speculates only Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's ‘divorce' can now save their Netflix deal

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services states, “Applicants who are found to be drug abusers or addicts are inadmissible,” and the think-tank argued all this time that Harry voided that part and received favour from the Biden administration.

Last month, former U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed any idea of seeking Prince Harry's deportation. However, he did not hesitate to take a dig at Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, whom he called “terrible.”

A pod of dolphins gathered curiously around SpaceX's Dragon Freedom capsule as it landed off the Florida coast with NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, whose nine-month-long space overstay at the International Space Station (ISS) finally came to an end.

‘Butch and Suni' were accompanied by astronauts Nick Hague and Aleksandr Grebyonkin, who reached the ISS in December as part of a rescue mission planned by NASA and SpaceX.

NASA's commentary did not fail to describe the moment dolphins approached the SpaceX capsule in curiosity as the recovery team members approached the astronauts in a speed boat.

A viral video shared on X shows a pod of dolphins surrounding the SpaceX Crew Dragon as astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returned to Earth after being stranded in space for nine months. The astronauts splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule just before 6 pm EST Tuesday, March 18. They happily emerged from their rescue capsule after being stranded on the International Space Station for months.

“Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” a mission-control dispatcher radioed the crew shortly after the capsule Dragon Freedom splashed down.

A video surfacing on X appears to show dolphins surrounding the capsule, almost as if to welcome the astronauts home. It was shared by an X user with the caption, “A pod of DOLPHINS have surrounded the SpaceX Dragon, welcoming the astronauts back to Earth. Love to see this. God's creatures and the Gulf of America are amazing.”

‘It's literally a movie scene'Many X users rejoiced in the comment section, with one saying, “Dolphins are the humans of the sea”. “Absolutely incredible creatures,” one user said, while another wrote, “Even the dolphins know America is back.” A user exclaimed, “It's literally a movie scene”. Another said, “I'm not sure this could get any better. It's like a fairy tale ending to a great movie.” “Even the dolphins celebrate a MAGA victory! Trump, Elon, and SpaceX rescue our heroes while the left cries. America First. land, sea, and space!” one user wrote, while another said, “The pod of dolphins added extra poignancy.” “God was watching over the Capsule and saw them safely home,” wrote one user. Another said, “When we're out fishing they come and swim with the boat. They're incredible”. During their extra time in space, the stranded astronauts conducted around 150 experiments, which were about 900 hours worth. Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy associate administrator for space operations, told reporters that this will be instrumental in the future of human space travel, according to the New York Post.

Every year, thousands of travellers flock to India to join the Holi festivities filled with vibrant colours and centuries-old traditions. While it can be an enriching experience for most, the Holi celebration in India could be an uncomfortable experience particularly for women.

For Danielle, a foreign solo traveller, Holi 2025 in India was marred by an unsettling reality faced by many women during the festivities -harassment and groping.

In a post shared on Instagram, Danielle, who makes videos about budget trips to various countries across the world, began to express how much she loved her time in India, emphasizing the incredible warmth and hospitality of the people.

However, she couldn't stop herself from sharing her Holi experience, one that was far from the joyous occasion many would expect.

""For me (and a lot of other women it seems) Holi was ruined by the fact that SOME men clearly see it as a prime opportunity to harass women and grope them WHICH IS NOT ON,"" Danielle wrote in the caption alongside a video of her Holi celebration.

A post shared by danielle // solo budget traveller (@daniellestravel.s)

She further explained that some men used the celebration as an opportunity to grope women turning a fun event into an uncomfortable and distressing one for many.

""It's a massive shame that such a beautiful festival leads to a negative experience for a lot of women,"" she further wrote underscoring the unfortunate reality some women face during Holi.

However, her message was not one of complete bitterness or anger.

An apparently optimistic Danielle made it a point that she wouldn't let that experience define her time in India.

""HOWEVER, I am not letting the actions of a few ruin the amazing memories i've already made here and the ones that are gonna come in the next few weeks too,"" she wrote.

Her message also included a call to avoid generalizing an entire country based on the actions of a few. ""I've met so many lovely people in India, and I beg people not to generalize the whole country,” she emphasized. Holi was celebrated across the country on March 14.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Canada is “one of the nastiest countries to deal with” as trade tensions between the two historically friendly countries continue to escalate. The trade war started with the US imposing tariffs on Canada, which in turn slapped retaliatory tariffs, with Canadians even boycotting US products. 

Speaking to Fox News, answering why he is tougher with Canada than other big adversaries, he said, ""I deal with every country, indirectly or directly. One of the nastiest countries to deal with is Canada”.

.@POTUS: ""One of the nastiest countries to deal with is Canada. Now, this was Trudeau — good old Justin. I call him 'Governor Trudeau.' His people were nasty and they weren't telling the truth."" pic.twitter.com/Sf7cyaVfSU

He continued: ""Canada was meant to be the 51st state because we subsidise Canada by $200 billion a year,"" exaggerating the estimate of the US trade deficit with Canada, which is actually placed at $63.3 billion for 2024, by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.

Apart from the ongoing trade war, Trump has continuously referred to Canada as the 51st state and even called Canada's former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “Governor Trudeau”.

Speaking about the USA's reliance on Canadian imports, Trump said, ""We don't need their lumber, we don't need their energy, we don't need anything. We certainly don't want their automobiles,"" he said.

""We don't need their lumber, we don't need their energy, we don't need anything. We certainly don't want their automobiles,"" he said.

When asked by Fox News host Laura Ingraham on why Trump was “tougher” on Canada than their other “adversaries”, he said, ""Only because it's meant to be our 51st state.""

Recently, Mark Carney, an economist and former governor of the Bank of England replaced Trudeau and promised to “stand up to” Trump. He also said that the two countries will “sit down and have a conversation about our broader partnership with the United States” only after Trump stops making “disrespectful” comments about Canada's sovereignty.

Trump also answered if his policies will change the political landscape of Canada which is expecting its federal elections by October, saying, it's easier to deal with the ruling Liberals than the opposition Conservatives. “I don't care. I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,” he said.

Amazon is planning to cut 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025 as part of its efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency, according to a report. The move, which accounts for a 13% reduction in its global management workforce, is expected to help the company save between Rs 210 crore and Rs 360 crore annually. Once implemented, the total number of managers at the e-commerce giant will drop from 1,05,770 to 91,936, Financial Express reported.The decision follows recent job cuts in Amazon's communications and sustainability divisions, reflecting the company's broader restructuring plans.In a bid to streamline operations, Amazon has introduced a “bureaucracy tipline” — a mechanism allowing employees to report inefficiencies within the organisation, the report said.A January 2025 report in Business Insider said the e-commerce major issued new directives for its managerial staff, including:

These measures align with Amazon's strategy to improve operational efficiency and prioritise profitability. The company has already discontinued certain initiatives, such as its ‘Try Before You Buy' clothing programme and a rapid brick-and-mortar delivery service, as it shifts focus to its core business areas.The layoffs were part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to streamline decision-making and improve efficiency. Jassy plans to raise the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by 2025, aiming to cut bureaucracy and accelerate operations, Business Insider reported.Earlier, in September 2024, Mr Jassy told employees that they would be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2025. In a note, he said that in-office work makes it easier for employees to learn and collaborate. Reducing the number of managers would eliminate unnecessary layers, allowing Amazon to operate more efficiently and with fewer bureaucratic obstacles, he added.In a note published in October 2024, Morgan Stanley estimated that this restructuring could lead to the elimination of around 13,834 managerial roles by early 2025.Amazon's workforce expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, reportedly growing from 7.98 lakh employees in 2019 to over 16 lakh by the end of 2021. The company has since adjusted its staffing levels, cutting 27,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023, reported Financial Express.

Multiple Tesla vehicles were set on fire and shot at a Las Vegas service centre overnight, according to a CNN report. The attack, which occurred at the Tesla Collision Center, resulted in at least five vehicles being damaged, with two of them fully engulfed in flames. The FBI is investigating the incident, stating that it has ""some of the hallmarks"" of terrorism,

According to authorities, the perpetrator used Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at the vehicles. The word ""resist"" was also painted on the front doors of the business. The investigation is ongoing, with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department working together to identify the perpetrator.

""This was a targeted attack against a Tesla facility. Officers discovered several vehicles on fire as well as the word ‘Resist' spray-painted on the front doors of the business,"" Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a Tuesday news conference.

Video of the incident showed vehicles erupting in flames while the suspect, dressed entirely in black, appeared to walk between the cars while reaching into a bag. No injuries were reported, and the fire department extinguished the fires before they could reach the vehicles' batteries.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has condemned the attack, calling it ""terrorism"" and stating that the level of violence is ""insane and deeply wrong"". 

See the post here:

In another post, he said, ""This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong. Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.""

This incident is part of a larger trend of attacks on Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US, with some incidents involving vandalism, graffiti, and even shootings. President Trump has condemned the attacks, suggesting that they be classified as domestic terrorism. 

US Attorney-General Pamela Bondi has also strongly condemned the recent attacks on Tesla property, labelling them as ""nothing short of domestic terrorism"". ""We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,"" she said.

A Dragon spacecraft bringing astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore home after nine months in space splashed down off the coast of Florida at 5.57 pm (3.27 am IST). Shortly after, 59-year-old Williams and 62-year-old Wilmore were brought out of the spacecraft, smiling and waving, as the world cheered. NASA's Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov accompanied them on the 17-hour journey home.

But these moments of joy were preceded by hours during which the astronauts -- and the world -- had their fingers crossed. And the last leg was the most tricky when SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere. At this point, the capsule is travelling at speeds going up to 28,800 kmph. The friction this creates takes the temperatures of its outer casing to about 1,600 degrees Celsius, with heat shields protecting the occupants inside. So, the cheers to celebrate Sunita Williams' homecoming came only after the spacecraft turned a ball of fire entering the atmosphere and heading for a splash in the ocean.

What Protects The Astronauts

Docked at the International Space Station, the Dragon spacecraft is in a state of near-vacuum. Following a series of departure burns, it moved away from the station and began its journey home. As it enters Earth's atmosphere, high friction is created, pushing the temperatures up significantly, as high as 1,600 degrees.

The SpaceX's Dragon capsule is equipped with a heat-resistant casing of Phenolic-Impregnated Carbon Ablator of PICA. It was NASA that first used this lightweight material. Later, SpaceX got its Dragon capsule outfitted with PICA tiles for cargo and human movement to and from the International Space Station. The Dragon capsule that brought Williams and Wilmore home went from sparkling white to brownish by the time it splashed down, indicating how the outer shell burned as it entered the atmosphere, but ensured occupants' safety.

Manouevering The Splashdown

The Dragon spacecraft has a total of six parachutes -- two drogue parachutes to stabilise it after it re-enters Earth's atmosphere and four main parachutes to slow down the spacecraft before landing. Minutes before the splashdown, as the Dragon spacecraft approached the ocean, two main parachutes were deployed, stabilising and slowing down the capsule.

A minute later, four more parachutes opened, slowing down the capsule further. The target speed for the spacecraft at the time of splashdown is 25 km per hour. This was achieved by slowing it down and positioning it over the ocean's surface using the four parachutes. As the spacecraft splashed down, the next phase of work began. The first team that approached the spacecraft checked for gas leaks before opening the hatch and bringing the occupants out.

And Finally, The Cheers

The first to come out of the Dragon spacecraft was NASA's Nick Hague, and moments later Aleksandr Gorbunov from Russian space agency Roscosmos emerged. The most awaited moment followed. Sunita Williams, whose eight-day mission to the International Space Station turned into a nine-month-long stay, came out, smiling and waving. The last to exit the spacecraft was Butch Wilmore.

Williams and Wilmore will undergo an extensive check-up following their 286-day stay in space. Bone and muscle deterioration, radiation exposure, and vision impairment are some risks space travellers face on their return to Earth after a prolonged stay in space.

The lack of gravity causes significant, and sometimes irreversible, bone density loss. Muscles, usually activated by moving around on Earth, weaken because they no longer need to work as hard.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Puffy heads, chicken legs, taller space height and reduced density - as Crew-9 astronauts face all these health implications on their return to Earth after nine months in space, they will undergo a 45-day rehabilitation programme to prepare for gravity.

A stay at the International Space Station can have various effects on the astronauts' bodies in terms of aerobic capacity, muscular strength, power, endurance, stamina, bone, balance, agility, coordination, orthostatic tolerances, proprioception, neurovestibular function and flexibility. These are attributed to microgravity and are consistent with deficits seen in terrestrial, de-conditioning individuals.

The Astronaut Strength, Conditioning and Rehabilitation (ASCR) specialists have administered a reconditioning program, focusing on all deficits, which improves the physical condition of all returning astronauts.

Post-flight reconditioning begins on landing day, is scheduled for two hours per day, seven days a week for 45 days and is tailored to the specific needs of the astronaut.

Phase 1 of the rehabilitation program starts on landing day and places emphasis on ambulation, flexibility, and muscle strengthening. Phase 2 adds proprioceptive exercise and cardiovascular conditioning. Phase 3, the longest phase, focuses on functional development. All programs are tailored specifically for each individual according to their test results, preferred recreational activities, and mission roles and duties.

Specific attention is given to each astronaut's overall condition, testing results, medical status, and assigned duties after their mission. After completing post-flight reconditioning, it is shown that astronauts have regained, and in most cases improved upon, their pre-flight baseline condition.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore spent nine months in space, after propulsion systems on the Boeing Starliner that rocketed them to the International Space Station (ISS) developed issues and returned without them.

Since then, their stay in space has invited global attention, concern for their health and political debates.

After relief Crew-10 docked on to the ISS on Sunday, Williams, Wilmore, NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksander Gorbunov started preparing for their return to Earth. 17 hours after started their journey from space, astronauts on board the SpaceX Dragon capsule splashed off the coast of Florida at 3.27 am IST.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore flew aboard NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test to space on June 5 last year. The two astronauts went on an eight-day mission to the ISS but, on June 6, as Starliner approached the space station, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters. The Starliner was sent back to Earth without the crew.

Later, in August, it was decided to reassign the two astronauts to SpaceX's Crew-9 mission. They joined NASA astronaut Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.

Today, after over nine months, the Crew-9 team returned to earth.

How Musk And Trump Partnered For Sunita Williams' Return

Earlier this year, on January 28, President Trump said he has asked Elon Musk and SpaceX to ""go get"" the two brave astronauts ""who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration.""

Musk shared details of the talk on social media and said that President Trump has asked him to facilitate the return of the two Boeing Starliner astronauts, who have been on the space station since June 2024, as soon as possible.

The SpaceX CEO said it was ""terrible"" that the Biden administration ""left them there so long"".

The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so.Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.



In his latest interview with Fox News earlier today, Musk claimed that SpaceX offered former President Joe Biden's administration to bring back the two astronauts earlier but it was ""rejected for political reasons.""

""We definitely offered to return the astronauts earlier. There is no question about that. The astronauts were only supposed to be there for eight days and they have been there for almost 10 months. Obvioulsy, that doesn't make any sense. SpaceX could have brought the astronauts after a few months at most and we made that offer to Biden administration. It was rejected for political reasons and that's just a fact,"" he said.

Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar said that Hamas has refused to release the remaining hostages.

The military campaign will continue in Gaza till there is a Gaza free of Hamas, Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar told NDTV World today. The 42-day temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is now over and Hamas has gone back on its promise of releasing the hostages kidnapped by the terrorist organisation. This, Mr Azar said, is a violation of the agreement, and hence, left Israel with no option but to resort to military pressure.

""There can be a peace today, if Hamas agrees and abides by the conditions set out for it,"" said Mr Azar explaining that the two main conditions include freeing all the remaining hostages and never to be able to arm itself to launch terrorist attacks on Israel.

But Hamas doesn't want peace, he told NDTV World, citing the decision not to release the hostages. ""Hamas has rejected to proposals of the American mediator time and again. It simply refuses to release the hostages. There is no option left for Israel now, but to resort to military pressure.""

""Military pressure is effective and works,"" he said, adding that ""It is because of military pressure that 195 of the 254 hostages have been released in the first place.""

The United States has ""fully backed Israel"" in its efforts to rout Gaza of any terrorist elements, and bringing lasting peace to the region both for Jews as well as Palestinians.

Israel, he said, will pursue its efforts to the desired outcome at any cost. ""If a solution is not found diplomatically, then we shall achieve it militarily,"" he said.

Reacting to condemnation globally, the Israeli Ambassador said, ""Condemnations do not change facts. And the fact is that there is a terrorist organisation in the Gaza strip that continues to hold hostages. The hostages they are holding are not just those from Israel, but they are holding the entire Palestinian population hostage to its misdeeds.""

""Hamas is taking control of the aid being sent and is in turn selling them to Palestinian people. They are trying to extort the people with the hope of pushing Israel to a surrender. This is simply not going to happen. It is ridiculous,"" he said, making Tel Aviv's intentions clear.

Instead of condemning Israel, what we expect from a responsible international community is to ""put pressure on Hamas, and help push for efforts to create peace in the region. They should do that diplomatically by getting the top brass of Hamas out of Gaza and give hope to the Palestinian people by encouraging a new and moderate Palestinian leadership - one that will allow Gaza to be reestablished and rebuilt for the betterment future of its people. Such peace is what is of common interest.""

""Anyone from the international community who says that military pressure should not be used is basically wanting Israel to surrender to a terrorist organisation that will continue to have a grip on Gaza forever. That cannot be acceptable,"" he said.

The Ambassador said that ""Hamas has to understand that its control of the Gaza strip is over. They will have to relinquish power at any cost. Israel will allow for them to peacefully leave Gaza forever, to give a chance to the Palestinian people to have a better future.""

""Hamas has now got only two options - One is to return to the diplomatic table in a constructive way and accept the terms. That will stop the military campaign. The other option is for them not to cooperate. What that will do is leave Israel with the option for a ground invasion throughout Gaza in order to completely clean it out of all terror elements linked to Hamas and then transfer authority of Gaza to a new moderate Palestinian leadership and to responsible international stakeholders who will help bring peace and prosperity in Gaza.""

""Israel has the resolution and the resilience to do this, but I want to make it clear that we would prefer taking the first option - of diplomacy and dialogue. We will resort to option two only if Hamas refuses to cooperate.""

The Israeli Ambassador concluded by saying that ""In this holy month of Ramadan (Ramzan), more than 75,000 Muslims come every single day to pray in the holy city of Jerusalem in Israel. We have always supported religious freedom. It is the terrorists who we go after.""

Hamas still holds 59 Israeli hostages, which it has so far refused to release. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Sunita Williams' Journey From Earth To Space And Back

The two astronauts went on an eight-day mission to the ISS but, on June 6, as Starliner approached the space station, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters. The Starliner was sent back to Earth without the crew.

Later, in August, it was decided to reassign the two astronauts to SpaceX's Crew-9 mission. This meant, downsizing the Crew-9 from four to two and dropping NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson, previously announced as crewmates, to make space for Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore.

NASA astronaut Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov flew to the space station as commander and mission specialist, respectively, as part of a two-crew member flight aboard a SpaceX Dragon.

Today, after over nine months, the Crew-9 team returned to earth.

After a 17-hour-long journey, the spacecraft deployed its parachute before a splashdown in the ocean off the coast of Florida.

A NASA team opened the hatch and helped astronauts onto mobility aids.

Ms Williams was seen waving and flashing thumbs-up signs as she came out of the capsule.

When asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user if the astronauts will get a special meal now, NASA said that Crew-9 will go for a thorough medical check first and fresh food will be served soon.

Even as the Quad steadily strengthens its hold across the Indo-Pacific region, India may soon consider being a part of another key multilateral alliance that focuses on the South China Sea. The group in question is the 'Squad' - whose members currently include Japan, Australia, the US, and the Philippines. The group now plans to invite India and South Korea to join it.

Philippines and Japan, which face challenges with China's growing military presence in the South China Sea, aim to counter Beijing and keep it in check, said General Romeo S. Brawner, the Philippines' Armed Forces chief.

Though Squad is still an informal grouping, member states have conducted joint maritime activities in South China Sea for over a year. ""Together with Japan and our partners we are trying to expand the squad to include India and probably South Korea,"" General Brawner said at the Raisina Dialogue - a multilateral conference in New Delhi.

Interestingly, the General's comment on inviting India to the 'Squad', came as his counterpart from Japan, the chief of the Indian Navy, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, and Australia's chief of Joint Operations were on stage for a panel discussion on security in the Indo-Pacific.

General Brawner went on to say that the Philippines was making efforts to enhance its deterrence capabilities, including by working with partners in the Squad, which he said was an informal collaboration between the four nations on military aspects, intelligence sharing, and joint exercises and operations.

The mention of a possible invite to India and South Korea comes at a time when Manila and Beijing are facing increasing hostilities and a series of escalating confrontations in the South China Sea.

China unilaterally claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own territory, totally disregarding international maritime law. Beijing considers the entire sea as its exclusive economic, strategic, and military zone - something that has been shot down by the International and UN court in 2016.

China has rejected the international court ruling and blatantly disregards it, opposing a rules-based global order. Beijing also disregards the sovereignty claims by the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam - all of which have coastlines along the South China Sea - similar to that of China.

The South China Sea is one of the most significant maritime trade routes, which sees an annual trade flow of more than $3 trillion.

""We find commonality with India because we have a common enemy. And I'm not afraid to say that China is our common enemy. So, it is important that we collaborate together, maybe exchange intelligence,"" General Brawner told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.

According to a report by news agency Reuters, the General went on to say that the Philippines already had a partnership with the Indian military and defence industry.

He said that he will extend an offer for India to join the 'Squad' when he meets India's Chief of Defence Staff or CDS General Anil Chauhan later in the day. After the meeting, a senior Indian defence personnel told news agency Reuters that there was no clarity yet if the matter was indeed discussed. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A former US Navy captain, Williams, 59, was born to a Gujarati father Deepak Pandya hailing from Jhulasan in Mehsana district and Slovenian mother Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, on September 19, 1965 in Euclid, Ohio. Proud of her multicultural roots, Williams has carried symbols of her heritage to space '"" including samosas, a Slovenian flag, and Ganesha idol during previous missions.

Williams and Butch Wilmore's eight-day mission to the International Space Station turned into a stay in orbit for nine months after Boeing's Starliner developed propulsion issues. The capsule undocked from the space station on Tuesday and splashed down off the Florida coast on Wednesday morning. This was Williams' third space flight and she has clocked a cumulative 608 days in space.

Joshua Steven Riibe, the last person seen with Indian student Sudiksha Konanki who went missing from a beach in the Dominican Republic, has been released after days of detention. This came a day after Ms Konanki's parents asked authorities to declare their daughter officially dead.

Ms Konanki, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, was on spring break in Punta Cana when she disappeared two weeks ago.

Mr Riibe, a 22-year-old Iowa resident and a student at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, said that the authorities detained him without any formal charges, adding he was treated unfairly during the investigation.

He filed a habeas corpus petition, a legal action people can take if they believe they are being held unfairly, last week.

According to the court documents, he claimed that Dominican authorities and even the hotel staff where he stayed violated his rights. They restricted his movements without charges filed against him, he added.

""I really want to go home and see my family. I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days,"" he said.

Although released, the authorities still have his passport, which they confiscated last week. Mr Riibe's attorney, Beatriz Santana, said they were requesting a new passport with the US Embassy. 

Ms Konanki was last seen at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana town on March 6.

The 20-year-old, accompanied by five friends, went out to party at a Punta Cana resort nightclub on the evening of March 5.

Ms Konanki and Mr Riibe were seen together at an outdoor bar before she vanished from a beach on March 6.

Surveillance footage captured them at the club before heading to the beach at around 4:15 am. Most of Ms Konanki's friends left by 5:50 am, leaving her alone with Mr Riibe.

Another clip from the Riu Republica Resort showed the woman walking arm-in-arm with the man, along a resort pathway. They were accompanied by her friends in the video.

Mr Riibe, who was in custody since Ms Konanki's disappearance, told investigators he was with her in waist-deep water, when a strong wave pulled them out to sea.

He said he tried to hold Ms Konanki under his arm while swimming back to shore.

Mr Riibe last asked if she was okay but didn't hear her response. He began vomiting seawater and blacked out on a beach chair.

Ms Konanki's parents asked Dominican authorities to declare her dead. Investigators believe Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, drowned “and no evidence of foul play has been found,” they said in a letter obtained by CNN.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Russian President Vladimir Putin, known for making world leaders wait, once again lived up to his reputation and delayed a phone call with US President Donald Trump. The scheduled call between him and Trump was set to begin between 4 pm and 6 pm Russian time (6.30 pm to 8.30 pm IST). Putin was attending a conference with Russian business leaders in Moscow at the time and reportedly showed no urgency in leaving the event, keeping his American counterpart waiting for over an hour.

At the Moscow event, Putin engaged in discussions with industrialists and business tycoons when Alexander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union for Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, took note of the time, reported The Sun.

Shokhin pointed out that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced that it was past 4 pm Moscow time — the designated slot for Putin's call with Trump.In video footage from the event, Shokhin is seen asking Putin if he would be late, referencing Peskov's statement about the scheduled call.Instead of rushing to the Kremlin, Putin casually dismissed the concern with a joke, according to the report. He said, “Don't listen to him! That's his job,” while shrugging, eliciting laughter from the audience.Shokhin, a former deputy prime minister under Putin, responded, “Now, we need to see what Trump says about this.”Putin, still smiling, replied, “I didn't mention Trump. I was talking about Peskov.”Watch the clip here:

Despite the phone call being a highly anticipated diplomatic exchange, Putin did not leave the Moscow International Music Hall immediately. Instead, he continued with his engagement, ultimately leaving the venue at around 5 pm Russian time (7.30 pm IST), a full hour after the scheduled start of his telephonic conversation with Trump.The main focus of the discussion was expected to be the ongoing war in Ukraine, amid US-led negotiations for a ceasefire.Trump earlier expressed optimism about securing a 30-day truce, claiming there was a “very good chance” of convincing Putin to agree to the proposal, which had already received approval from Kyiv.What Donald Trump said about the call with Vladimir PutinThe call between the two leaders eventually lasted nearly two hours, according to Fox News. The call with Putin was “great”, Trump said during an exclusive interview with Fox News's The Ingraham Angle.Speaking about the call, the US President referred to Russia's three-year war against Ukraine and said, “[We] talked about a lot of things — toward getting it to peace, and we talked about other things also.”Despite the phone call with Trump, Putin did not immediately agree to an unconditional ceasefire. He said on March 18 that Moscow would pause strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days instead of committing to a full cessation of hostilities.But just an hour after the Kremlin's statement, a Russia-guided bomb struck the Ukrainian city of Slovyansk, knocking out power, according to Wall Street Journal chief foreign affairs correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Google has agreed to pay $28 million to settle a class action lawsuit that claims it pays white and Asian employees more and even puts them on a higher career track than other workers.

The lawsuit was led by Ana Cantu, a Mexican who is racially indigenous, on behalf of other minority communities including Hispanic, Latino, Native Americans at Google.

The accord with Google won approval from Judge Charles Adams of the Santa Clara county superior court in California last week.

He said the settlement was fair and reasonable and “a good result for the class” of 6,632 Google employees in California between 15 February 2018 and 31 December 2024.

Despite confirming the settlement, a Google spokesperson said, “We continue to disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring and levelling all employees fairly.”

Cantu had claimed that inspite of working exemplarily for seven years at Google, she remained at the same job, while white and Asian employees got promotions and extra pay.

Moreover, she claimed that even for the same work, white and Asian employees were placed at higher job ""levels"" and workers who raised complaints would be withheld from promotions and raises.

She quit in September 2021 arguing that Google's actions violated the California Equal Pay Act.

The total settlement amount comes to $20.4 million after deducting $7 million for legal fees, penalties tied to Cantu's claim under California's Private Attorneys General Act, and other costs.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The Israeli military said on Wednesday it launched a ""limited ground operation"" to retake part of a key Gaza corridor.

The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza, which shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January.

As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which it had used as a military zone and which bisected northern Gaza from the south.

Billionaire Elon Musk has named three tech titans he believes are the smartest people he ever met. On the ""Verdict with Ted Cruz"" podcast, the Republican senator asked the Tesla CEO to choose the CEO he most admired or the smartest person he ever met.Musk praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and first CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page as the sharpest people he knew.The entrepreneur praised the Amazon CEO, saying, “Jeff Bezos has done a lot of difficult and significant things.”The compliment came despite their well-documented 20-year rivalry, which is mostly focused on their conflicting space aspirations at Musk's SpaceX and Bezos' Blue Origin.The dynamic between Bezos and Musk has evolved recently, with the Tesla CEO sharing several memes from the comedy movie “Step Brothers,” suggesting a reconciliation between the two tech titans.“Larry Ellison is very smart. I will say Larry Ellison is one of the smartest people,” Musk added. The SpaceX CEO shares a long-standing bond with Ellison, who committed $1 billion to Musk's acquisition of Twitter while serving on the Tesla board from 2018 to 2022.Often referred to as ""very close friends,"" Ellison reportedly assisted Musk in obtaining expensive Nvidia GPUs to develop artificial intelligence.Musk then complimented Google co-founder Larry Page, adding he believed a person's achievements could be used to evaluate their IQ. “To some degree, smart is as smart does,” he said.The most recent Bloomberg Billionaires Index values Bezos, Ellison, and Page, at $218 billion, $169 billion, and $149 billion, respectively.

Musk, despite losing billions of dollars, with 30 per cent of his fortune wiped out in the last ten weeks, remains at the top of Bloomberg's list.In January, Musk, one of the most influential people in the Trump administration, called the Amazon CEO a “copycat” and made fun of Blue Origin's lunar landing plan.

Germany accused President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday of ""playing a game"" after Kyiv reported Russian strikes on Ukranian civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed to temporarily pause attacks on energy facilities.

""We've seen that attacks on civilian infrastructure have not eased at all in the first night after this supposedly ground-breaking, great phone call"" between Putin and US President Donald Trump, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a TV interview.

""Putin is playing a game.""

""The American president has a responsibility for one of the great nations of the world. And I am very sure that there will come a time when he will have to react,"" Pistorius added.

In the 90-minute call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin agreed to a scaled-back commitment to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, but refused a full ceasefire in its three-year war with Ukraine.

Following the fresh strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of effectively rejecting the US-backed truce proposal, which Kyiv had previously accepted. 

Pistorius said Putin's commitment to stop attacks on energy targets was ""basically nothing"" because such infrastructure in Ukraine was already the ""best protected"". 



The minister also described as ""unacceptable"" the Kremlin's insistence that a ""key condition"" for peace would be a total halt of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.

""This is very transparent,"" Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from ""further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire"".

Israeli strikes killed at least five Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, health officials in the enclave said, and the Israeli army, which resumed attacks against the territory, said it targeted a Hamas military site in the north.

Three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra suburb in Gaza City, while another airstrike left two men dead and wounded six others in Beit Hanoun town in the north, the Gaza health officials said.

The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas site in northern Gaza, where they detected preparations for firing into Israeli territory. Israel resumed airstrikes a day earlier as both sides traded blame over breaking a ceasefire and shattering nearly two months of relative calm.

Israeli naval vessels attacked several boats it said were intended to carry out ""terrorist"" acts by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups. Palestinians said an Israeli drone fired at several fishing boats onshore of Gaza City, setting several of them ablaze.

On Wednesday, the Israeli army dropped leaflets on areas in Beit Hanoun and Khan Younis in the northern and southern Gaza Strip, ordering residents to evacuate their homes warning them they were in ""dangerous combat zones.""

""Staying in the shelters or the current tent put your lives and that of your family members in danger, evacuate immediately,"" read a leaflet dropped on Beit Hanoun.

Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday left more than 400 people dead, according to Palestinian health authorities, and Israel warned the onslaught was ""just the beginning.""

Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had broadly held since January and offered respite for the 2.3 million inhabitants of Gaza, which has been reduced to rubble.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered strikes because Hamas had rejected proposals to secure a ceasefire extension.

Hamas, which still holds 59 of about 250 hostages Israel says the group seized in its October 7, 2023 cross-border attack, accused Israel of jeopardizing efforts by mediators to negotiate a permanent deal to end the fighting.

Hamas officials said they remained keen on concluding the three-phase ceasefire deal as signed.

Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people and taking the hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 people, say Palestinian health authorities.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that they had a constructive call about moving toward a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow, with the White House suggesting the U.S. could take control of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.



Trump told Zelenskyy that the U.S could be “very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,” according to a White House statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz that described the call as “fantastic.”



Trump added that “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.”

Weeks after a disastrous Oval Office meeting between the two leaders that led to Trump temporarily pausing intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, Trump and Zelenskyy had “a very good conversation” in which they joked around, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly. There was an emphasis during the call on how any ceasefire process would need to be monitored and how the negotiating teams would still need to resolve technical issues, said the official.



During the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot defense missile systems. Rubio and Waltz said Trump “agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.”



Trump has made clear that quickly ending the war is a top priority for his new administration. He has repeatedly complained about the cost — the U.S. has sent Ukraine more than $180 billion in military and economic aid since the start of the war.



The call came a day after Trump held similar talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who agreed not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to back a full 30-day ceasefire.



According to the Kremlin, Putin made clear to Trump that there must be a halt to foreign military aide and intelligence sharing as part of any deal. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue.

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, left and center, Pavel Bednyakov, right)













Prior to his call with Trump, Zelenskyy said Putin's limited ceasefire pledge was “very much at odds with reality” following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country.



“Even last night, after Putin's conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,” Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb.






Russia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking equipment near one of its pipelines.



“Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.



The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a “movement to peace” that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting.

But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said that Putin's demands during the call with Trump would amount to “Ukrainian capitulation.”



“Putin is attempting to hold the temporary ceasefire proposal hostage in order to extract preemptive concessions ahead of formal negotiations to end the war,” the ISW said in an analysis of readouts from the calls.



Stubb called the discussions between Putin and Trump a step in the right direction, but Finland's president said that Russia needs to end its aggression.



“There are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: it's a yes or a no — no buts, no conditions,” Stubb said. “Ukraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table.”



Waltz said on social media that he and his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, agreed Wednesday that their teams would meet soon in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, “to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia.”



It was not immediately clear who would be part of the delegations or if Ukrainian officials were also invited to take part in the Saudi Arabia talks.







Shortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.



Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said. Russian drones were reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.



The Russian Defense Ministry said its military had launched seven drones at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv region, but that it shot them down after receiving Putin's order to not hit energy infrastructure.



Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said that three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.



“It is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,” the ministry said.



Russia said that its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions — the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.



Zelenskyy said that “words of a ceasefire” weren't enough.



“If the Russians don't hit our facilities, we definitely won't hit theirs,” Zelenskyy said.



Meanwhile, the two combatants said Wednesday that they had each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges of the war.

Zelenskyy rejected Putin's key condition that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. He said that doing so would endanger lives if citizens were blind to incoming air raids, and lead to the continuation of the war.



“I don't think anybody should make any concessions in terms of helping Ukraine, but rather, assistance to Ukraine should be increased,” Zelenskyy said. “This will be a signal that Ukraine is ready for any surprises from the Russians.”



Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that it was “completely unsurprising” that Putin rejected the ceasefire, adding that it's “imprudent for him to tell President Trump that directly, since Trump has made ending the war a very, very high priority.”



“What we have now, in effect, is a competition or rivalry between Kyiv and Moscow to persuade Trump that it's the other side that is responsible for preventing Trump from achieving his goal of ending the war,” Gould-Davies said.



Zelenskyy said that one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions.



“For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian,” he said. “We will not go for it.”

Administration accused of deliberately flouting James Boasberg's ruling to halt deportation of 200 immigrants

Donald Trump has repeated his declaration that he would not defy a court ruling, even as controversy swirls about whether his administration has already ignored several of them following a spate of negative judgments that threaten to block his governing agenda.

Anger among the president's supporters has been simmering against a federal judge, James Boasberg, who ordered a halt to the deportation of more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants last weekend.

The deportation flights to El Salvador went ahead nevertheless, with administration officials claiming that the planes had already departed when the judge issued his order. That, in turn, triggered accusations that Trump had deliberately flouted the courts.

Asked by Laura Ingraham on Fox News if he would ever defy a court ruling, Trump said he would not but launched an attack on Boasberg, without naming him.

“I never did defy and I wouldn't in the future, no. You can't do that,” he said. “However, we have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think at a certain point you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge.

“The judge that we're talking about is you look at his other rulings … He's a lunatic.”

Trump renewed his assault in a later post on his Truth Social platform: “If a President doesn't have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our country because a radical left lunatic judge wants to assume the role of president, then our country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!”

The comments followed a rare rebuke from John Roberts, the conservative-leaning chief justice of the US supreme court, who criticised demands by Trump and his supporters, including his wealthiest backer, Elon Musk, that Boasberg be impeached.

Fears over the administration's readiness to defy the courts – widely seen as the only obstacle to Trump's rampant agenda in the absence of meaningful resistance from a Republican-ruled Congress – seemed likely to intensify after high-profile negative rulings on Tuesday.

In one, a US district court judge, Theodore Chuang, ruled that Musk and his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit had violated the constitution in “multiple ways” in attempting to dismantle USAid.

A separate ruling barred the Pentagon from enforcing Trump's order banning transgender people from serving in the military, saying it was “soaked in animus”.

Another order on Wednesday by Judge Jesse Furman rebuffed the administration's effort to dismiss an attempt by Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, to fight a deportation order and said the case must be heard in New Jersey, rather than Louisiana, where he is now detained.

In yet another case, the government has been forced to rehire more than 7,000 workers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who had not finished their probationary period after they were sent unsigned letters telling them they were being fired for poor work performances.

The letters were sent despite an IRS lawyer warning officials that they contained “false statements” that amounted to “fraud”, ProPublica reported.

Trump's insistence that he would obey the courts is at odds with previous statements from the vice-president, JD Vance, who has suggested he should defy them.

In a 2021 interview with Politico, Vance said Trump – if he were re-elected – should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, [and] every civil servant in the administrative state … and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.'”

The statement attributed to Jackson, president from 1829 to 1837, is widely believed to be apocryphal.

Vance reiterated the sentiment in a social media post in February of this year following an earlier injunction against Doge.

“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal,” he wrote. “If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.”

Legal commentators have warned that a president openly ignoring court orders could portend a slide into dictatorship.

Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, told NBC that Trump had already “declared war on the rule of law”.

“In the past few weeks, the president himself has led a full frontal assault on the constitutional rule of law, the federal judiciary, the American justice system and the nation's legal profession,” Luttig said. “America is in a constitutional crisis.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Officials raise inflation forecast to 2.7% this year, as Fed chair Jerome Powell says uncertainty is ‘remarkably high'

Officials at the US Federal Reserve cut their US economic growth forecasts and raised projections for price growth as they kept interest rates on hold.

“Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,” the central bank said in a statement, as Donald Trump's bid to overhaul the global economy with sweeping tariffs sparks concern over inflation and growth.

Policymakers at the Fed expect inflation to increase by an average rate of 2.7% this year, according to projections released on Wednesday, up from a previous estimate of 2.5%.

They expect US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – to rise by 1.7% this year, down from an estimate of 2.1% in December. Officials also revised down their projections for GDP growth in 2026 and 2027, to 1.8%.

Uncertainty is “remarkably high”, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, cautioned, as the Trump administration attempts to engineer radical economic change. “I don't know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.”

Some of the increase in the Fed's inflation expectations was “clearly” due to tariffs, Powell said.

Fed officials maintained the benchmark interest from 4.25% to 4.5% following their latest two-day policy meeting. A closely watched “dot plot”, which shows policymakers' predictions for the trajectory of rates, indicated that they might cut them twice over the course of this year.

The Bank of England is also expected on Thursday to announce that it will keep UK rates on hold at 4.5%.

Trump, who returned to the White House in January after promising to rapidly bring down prices for millions of Americans, has roiled businesses and investors in the US and across the world with the erratic rollout of an aggressive tariff strategy.

Many economists warn the Trump administration's plans to impose or increase US tariffs on goods from overseas risk raising prices further.

The president has insisted, however, that hitting trading partners and economic rivals with such duties will help him to rebalance the global stage to America's advantage – and raise funds for the US federal government.

“Surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook,” Powell said at a news conference. “It remains [to be] seen how these developments affect future spending and investment.”

The Fed is targeting a 2% inflation rate. While price growth has fallen dramatically from its peak at 9.1% – the highest level in a generation – three years ago, it has yet to fall below the central bank's target.

Wall Street rose slightly after the latest Fed announcement, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.8% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite up 1.2% during the afternoon session in New York.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Doge head makes unfounded claim that Democrats use fraud in programs such as Medicare to boost voting ranks

Elon Musk is claiming, without evidence, that Democrats have been using fraud in entitlements like social security and Medicare to attract immigrants and boost their voting ranks – language that also echoes racist rightwing conspiracy theories.

The billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX and Donald Trump's “first buddy” has been trying to justify cuts to programs like social security, arguing that the fraud has cost the government up to $200bn.

“This is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation,” Musk said on a podcast with the Republican senator Ted Cruz and radio host Ben Ferguson.

“By using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants and buy voters. Basically bring in 10, 20 million people who are beholden to the Democrats for government handouts and will vote overwhelmingly Democrat.”

Musk said that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) will “turn off fraudulent payments of entitlements” to “illegals”, as he listed off a long slate of government programs including social security, Medicare, unemployment, disability and small business loans.

He then voiced what sounded akin to the “great replacement theory”, which has been taken on by rightwing extremists and describes the theory that people in the US, specifically those who are white, are being “replaced” by immigrants.

“If the Dems can bring in 200,000 illegals and get them legalized … even without cheating, if you bring in illegals that are 10 [times] the voting differential in a swing state, it will no longer be a swing state,” Musk said. “And the Dems will win all the swing states in a matter of time.”

Musk then warned of the “deep socialist state” that Democrats will achieve if they take over the federal government.

“They will further cement that by bringing in more aliens, so you can't vote your way out of it,” he said.

Over the last few days, Musk's Doge has started to zero in on social security – what Musk has called “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” – arguing that the agency has seen billions of dollars in fraud, though not necessarily from immigrants.

Musk has especially attached himself to an alleged list of dead people he says the agency is still giving money to. In a recent interview with Fox Business, Musk claimed that there were 20 million “dead people in the social security database”.

At least 10 employees with Doge have been specifically tasked with trying to find people in the US who are dead but still receive social security payments. Those with the agency, including the acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, have said the list Musk is referring to are people who don't have date of deaths on their records and are not necessarily receiving benefits.

Musk has also made some other changes at the Social Security Administration (SSA), the agency that oversees social security. Like many other federal agencies, SSA is seeing cuts to its workforce. In February, the agency said that it was reducing its staffing target to 50,000, down from 57,000.

Under pressure from Musk, the SSA said that it will start requiring in-person identity checks for recipients. In the past, recipients who couldn't verify their identity online could do so over the phone.

Different government agencies have released competing figures of how much the government has lost to fraud.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported last April that estimated fraud could be between $233bn to $521bn, though it notes that it accounts for pandemic-specific payments that could have led to a “higher-risk environment” for fraud. The report that the White House's office of management and budget had found lower estimates of fraud, between $4.4bn and $7.31bn during the same time period.

When it comes to social security, the agency records improper payments and has said that 0.3% of all payments have been inaccurate, largely due to mistakes or delays.

The White House has been trying to balance Musk's desire for wide cuts to entitlements with reassurances that Americans won't see any cuts themselves. Last week, the White House released a statement reiterating: “The Trump administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits.”

“What kind of a person doesn't support eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in government spending that ultimately costs taxpayers more?” the statement read.

Recent polling has shown that while more people in the US are on board with Musk's Doge than those who are not, more people in the US hold negative views of Musk himself. In a poll from NBC News, while 46% of people in the US said they hold a positive view of Doge, only 39% said they have a positive view of Musk.

Maryland's Glenn Ivey is first Democratic lawmaker to publicly demand that the Senate minority leader step down

A Democratic congressman has become the first to publicly call for Chuck Schumer to step down as Senate minority leader, highlighting growing divisions within the party over how to confront and counter Donald Trump's administration.

Glenn Ivey of Maryland told constituents on Tuesday that Schumer's decision to allow a Republican funding bill to pass had surrendered crucial leverage against the administration.

“I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great career,” Ivey said at a packed Maryland town hall. “But it may be time for Senate Democrats to get a new leader.”

The rebuke – met with applause at the meeting in Prince George's county, home to thousands of federal workers bordering Washington DC – marks the first public demand from a Democratic lawmaker for Schumer's removal.

Ivey's callout adds to the deepening Democratic divisions over how to fight Trump and Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency”, which has in turn slashed thousands of federal jobs, and spurred courts to get involved. After Schumer's Senate caucus fractured, Democrats – and their constituents – are arguing that the Senate minority leader surrendered a massive opportunity to resist these actions by allowing the Republican funding bill to pass through so easily.

But Ivey didn't get off so easily either, and at one point the town hall turned on him, with attendees repeatedly interrupting the congressman to demand more aggressive action against Trump's policies now, not during the 2026 midterm elections.

“You are talking about voting! People are losing their lives!” one woman screamed from the rafters. “It is not business as usual! You are too calm.”

Despite the growing dissent, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, publicly backed Schumer on Tuesday, a notable shift after previously dodging questions about the Senate leader's future. When asked last Friday if it was time for new Senate leadership, Jeffries had simply replied: “Next question”.

The two New York Democrats met on Sunday and released a joint statement on Tuesday morning, vowing to fight potential Medicaid cuts in Republicans' budget reconciliation bill.

The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, while saying she still supports Schumer, offered her own critique of his decision during a news conference in San Francisco.

“I myself don't give away anything for nothing,” Pelosi told reporters. “We could have, in my view, perhaps, gotten them to agree to a third way.”

The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken lawmakers admonishing Schumer, telling reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, last week that she had mobilized Democratic supporters against what she called an “acquiesce” to the GOP bill.

“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think, is a huge slap in the face.”

The Democratic failure has elevated Ocasio-Cortez's profile, with a CNN survey released on Sunday showing she narrowly leads her party when asked which political leader “best reflects the core values of the Democratic party”.

Schumer defended his decision during a Tuesday appearance on The View, facing particularly pointed criticism from co-host Sunny Hostin.

“It gives me no pleasure to say this to you because we are friends but I think you caved,” Hostin told the Senate minority leader. “I think you and nine other Democrats caved and didn't show the fight this party needs right now because you're playing by a rule book where the other party has thrown that rule book away.”

Schumer insisted: “No one wants to fight more than me and no one fights more than me,” arguing that while the bill “was bad”, it would do “far less damage” to the social safety net than a government shutdown.

“I want to fight, and we are fighting. We are going to fight every day on this – every day,” he said. “I understand we want to stick it to them. We're going to stick it to them and fight smart and win.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

An article history detailing Jackie Robinson's military career has seemingly been taken down on the Department of Defense's website as a purge of articles considered to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) continues.

Robinson, who Donald Trump last month described as helping “drive our country forward to greatness”, is widely considered a national hero in the US. He broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 when he suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers; he went on to be elected to his sport's Hall of Fame. Robinson also served in the US Army during the second world war. However, on Tuesday night ESPN'S Jeff Passan noted a page detailing Robinson's army career had been taken down and “dei” added to the URL.

The move is in step with similar decisions in recent weeks as the Pentagon works on the removal of any webpage it considers to be representative of DEI programs. The Trump administration has made its distaste for DEI clear and has rolled back many DEI programs across the federal government. One Trump executive order sought to end all “mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government” related to “illegal DEI and ‘diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility' (DEIA) programs”.

Other pages to have been removed include one focusing on Ira Hayes, a Native American who was one of the marines pictured raising the American flag at Iwo Jima during the second world war. Articles about the Native American code talkers also appear to have been removed from military websites.

There has been pushback to the removals. A page dedicated to Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers, a Black Medal of Honor recipient who had served in Vietnam, was removed and then restored after public outcry.

Defense department spokesperson Sean Parnell has defended the removals. “I think the president and the secretary have been very clear on this – that anybody that says in the Department of Defense that diversity is our strength is, is frankly, incorrect,” Parnell said.

Robinson had a striking military career. After a successful battle to train as an officer, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943 and assigned to a tank regiment. However, in 1944 the driver of an army bus ordered Robinson to sit at the back, a directive Robinson refused. Robinson was court martialed and acquitted, then served as an athletics coach before being honorably discharged in November 1944.

The removal of Robinson's page seems to be at odds with comments by Trump himself, who last month said Robinson's statue would be added to a garden of national heroes. Trump said at the time that Robinson was one of a number of “Black legends, champions, warriors and patriots who helped drive our country forward to greatness.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Adams administration has continued to pay the hotel company of Weihong Hu, a developer accused of funneling illegal campaign donations to the mayor 

The administration of New York City mayor Eric Adams is continuing to pay over $500,000 a month to a hotel developer who could potentially provide valuable testimony to prosecutors against the mayor and several of his top allies.

The developer, Weihong Hu, was indicted last month for allegedly bribing a New York City non-profit CEO. The indictment charges that she gave the nonprofit executive stacks of cash and helped him purchase a $1.3m townhouse in exchange for more than $20m in city-funded contracts for her two Queens hotels and a catering company. Hu has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Despite these allegations brought by the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, Adams's administration has continued to pay one of Hu's companies more than $542,000 a month to host another nonprofit program at one of her Queens hotels, according to two city officials with knowledge of the matter.

Hu was the subject of a previous joint investigation by the Guardian, the City and Documented, which found that she funnelled apparently illegal campaign contributions to Adams at that hotel, allowed one of his top advisers to live in her taxpayer-funded shelter hotel for months, and allowed Adams's son to bring a female companion to the hotel and stay there overnight.

After doling out those favors, the media partners found, Hu received millions more in contract dollars from Adams's administration. She also received favorable regulatory decisions, including the greenlighting of her construction projects cited for worker safety and affordable housing violations.

In response to that story, her attorney for civil matters, Kevin Tung, pushed back on the notion that his client had engaged in wrongdoing: “All of these are allegations … and most of them, I don't think they're true.”

But following the outlets' investigation, federal investigators raided Hu's hotel on the same day they raided the home of a friend of Adams, who reportedly intervened with city officials to help her clear a construction safety violation, suggesting that prosecutors were looking into Hu's favors to Adams and his inner circle.

After her indictment, Hu began engaging in plea negotiations with prosecutors, a court filing shows. Good government experts said the developer could seek to trade information about her dealings with Adams, his son, and his top advisers in exchange for leniency from prosecutors – a possibility that makes his administration's ongoing payments to the indicted developer all the more troubling.

“Put in the bluntest way possible, it does seem extraordinary given the indictment, that the administration is essentially paying someone that is poised to be a witness against them,” said Elizabeth Glazer, a former federal prosecutor and the former head of the mayoral agency currently paying Hu under Adams.

Ben Weinberg, Citizen Union's director of public policy, said the mayor's office should find alternative hotel providers “as soon as possible”.

“It's baffling that taxpayer dollars continue to fund a subcontractor after their indictment for bribery and theft of public funds,” he said. “The possibility that this subcontractor could implicate City Hall officials as part of a plea deal raises even more ethical concerns.”

Contacted by the Guardian, Hu's criminal attorney Benjamin Brafman, who has previously described his client as a “victim” and not a co-conspirator, said that “there are zero plea negotiations under way” despite the document filed in court, signed by his co-counsel and approved by a judge, that specifically references “plea negotiations”.

In response to questions from the Guardian, a spokesperson for the mayor's office of criminal justice, the agency in charge of the contract, said the Adams administration had begun working with the social service non-profit currently at Hu's hotel to find an alternative site.

The agency provided no timeline for when that move might occur and cautioned that finding an alternative property would be difficult. Terminating Hu's contract abruptly “without a suitable alternative would risk community safety, retraumatize individuals, and ultimately cost taxpayers more”, the spokesperson said.

But in an email, Elizabeth Koke, a spokesperson for HousingWorks, the social services non-profit, suggested that thus far there had been no substantive coordination between her group and the city to find an alternative site for the program which houses formerly incarcerated individuals.

The ongoing payments, which could result in approximately $20m for Hu over the next three years, come as the Trump administration has been pushing to free Adams of federal corruption charges in a separate federal court, the southern district of New York, a politically motivated move that might undermine further cooperation opportunities for Hu.

Donald Trump officials have sought to dismiss the indictment against Adams, which concerned allegations of bribery involving Turkish government officials, but in a way that would not dismiss the charges permanently – thus incentivizing the mayor to collaborate with Trump's hardline immigration agenda.

The US attorney's office for the eastern district of New York did not respond to questions about how the Department of Justice's internal campaign on behalf of Adams could affect its investigation in this case, and whether its prohibitions on “targeting Adams” would extend to the members of his inner circle whom Hu also worked with.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Moves to roll back 31 pollution regulations risk public health and big annual healthcare savings, Guardian analysis shows

A push by Donald Trump's administration to repeal a barrage of clean air and water regulations may deal a severe blow to US public health, with a Guardian analysis finding that the targeted rules were set to save the lives of nearly 200,000 people in the years ahead.

Last week, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provoked uproar by unveiling a list of 31 regulations it will scale back or eliminate, including rules limiting harmful air pollution from cars and power plants; restrictions on the emission of mercury, a neurotoxin; and clean water protections for rivers and streams.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA's administrator, called the extraordinary series of rollbacks the “greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” and declared it a “dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion”. One of the most consequential actions will see the EPA reconsider a landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health, which has been used to underpin laws aimed at addressing the climate crisis.

But the rules targeted by Zeldin have immediate, measurable benefits to Americans' health even without considering the longer-term impacts of the climate crisis. In total, the regulations on the hit list will prevent nearly 200,000 deaths over the next 25 years, by helping avoid an array of heart, respiratory and other health problems worsened by air and water pollution, according to assessments conducted by the EPA itself.

Trump's EPA has said its immolation of environmental protections will “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes' on US families”. However, the agency's own analyses shows that the regulations save the US economy far more money than it costs businesses to implement new pollution controls, by a factor of around six to one.

The regulations slated for repeal, affecting coal plants, cars, trucks and other sources of pollution, had been set to deliver at least $254bn in economic benefits annually via lowered healthcare costs and fewer sick days, among other improvements. By contrast, the cost of complying with the regulations is around $40bn a year.

“The costs of these regulations are a fraction of their benefits,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA staffer, now senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network (EPN), a group made up of former EPA employees.

“For every million dollars of favors that Trump's EPA is handing out to corporate polluters, the public suffers $6m in public health costs through asthma attacks, cancers and heart and lung disease. That's a great deal for the wealthy corporate polluters who backed Trump but it's a bad deal for anyone else who breathes.”

The Guardian's analysis is drawn from the findings of an EPN report published last year that broke down the costs and benefits of EPA rules. The study looked at evidence gathered by the EPA when formulating each new rule, factored in inflation and verified with the agency a uniform extrapolation of these figures to 2050.

Of the 31 rollbacks announced by Zeldin, 11 can be analyzed in this way as they include assessments of health and economic impacts. The estimates used by the EPA are almost certainly undercounts as they often do not factor some health conditions, such as cancer, nor do they account for damages from wildfires, floods, storms and other disasters that are being worsened by a climate crisis that is being driven by fossil fuel pollution.

As well as scores of deaths, a wave of other harms would likely be unleashed if the targeted regulations were removed. More than 20,000 emergency room visits for cardiovascular problems would occur by 2050 if not for the rules, the analysis finds, while children would have to restrict their activities for a collective 89m days due to excess pollution.

About one in 12 Americans, meanwhile, have asthma and are particularly vulnerable to air pollution. The current limits upon emissions from coal-fired power plants, cars, trucks and other sources are on track to avoid 100m symptomatic asthma incidents across the US by 2050. “If you carry around an inhaler, these rollbacks are a nightmare,” said Symons.

“The rollback of these critical public health interventions will increase heart attacks, hospitalizations, cognitive impairment, respiratory disease, and healthcare costs,” said Gaurab Basu, an assistant professor of medicine climate expert at Harvard University. “It will leave our children facing an increasingly unstable planet Earth.”

The Trump administration is attempting to severely shrink the EPA, firing hundreds of employees and drawing up plans to remove as many as 1,155 scientists while dissolving the agency's office of research and development. But it cannot simply sweep aside EPA regulations, which require several years of grueling agency work and public comment to replace.

John Walke, a director at the green non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, said it will be difficult for officials to justify the changes. One now-slashed Biden-era rule limiting power plants' emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants, for instance, simply saw regulators codify pollution standards that most power providers had been meeting for years.

“If this administration tries to go in to change that, they're going to have to show that somehow is impossible for those facilities to meet standards they were already meeting,” he said. “They're just not going to be able to make that showing.”

Environmental groups have vowed lawsuits to fight the rollbacks, meaning that a diminished EPA is faced with a mountain of legal and administrative paperwork just as Zeldin has promised to cut the agency's spending by 65% this year.

“A rule is based on science and study, you have to come up with alternative science that makes sense,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was the EPA administrator under George W Bush. But Whitman said that recent mass firings of EPA staff and a drop-off in enforcement activity will in practice make it difficult to uphold existing anti-pollution laws.

“The message to businesses is ‘we won't enforce what we are already doing,'” she said. “Real people will be hurt, especially children. We need to all be concerned about this. What this administration is doing is endangering our lives – ours, our children's, our grandchildren's.”

A deeper fear expressed by former EPA administrators last week, from prior Democratic and Republican presidencies, is that the agency won't bother to even craft weaker regulations to replace the existing rules. The goal may be “not to reconsider the rules but to bury them”, said Gina McCarthy, the EPA chief under Barack Obama. “If that's the case that's now being thrust upon us then shame on the EPA's leadership.”

McCarthy said the announcement of the mass rollbacks was the “most disastrous day in EPA history” and signaled a stark break from its historic mission. The agency was founded in 1970 under Republican president Richard Nixon with a task of protecting the environment and public health. Under Trump, however, the EPA has installed industry lobbyists in key positions and its stated priorities now include boosting the US car industry and aiding the advance of artificial intelligence.

“Alongside President Trump, we are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry,” Zeldin said last week.

William Reilly, who was EPA administrator under George HW Bush, said that such a vision is a “catastrophe” and threatens to plunge the US back into a pre-1970s era when cities were routinely shrouded by dangerous smog and rivers were so polluted by chemicals and waste that in some cases they caught fire.

“We are almost going to an honors system where we are going to trust corporations behave as if there are laws, when there are no laws,” Reilly said. “I honestly wonder if the malefactors are going to give us more burning rivers.”

An EPA spokesperson said: “No longer will the EPA view the goals of protecting our environment and growing our economy as binary choices. We will and we must choose both.

“Under President Trump, EPA is fully committed to fulfilling all of our statutory obligations under the many bipartisan landmark laws that help ensure clean air, land, and water.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Karoline Leavitt singles out James Boasberg in briefing attacking federal judges as court battle over deportations continues

Karoline Leavitt then singled out James Boasberg, the federal judge who is weighing the legality of Donald Trump's deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.

Boasberg attempted over the weekend to prevent planes carrying the migrants from leaving, and has since demanded from the government details of the aircrafts' exact itineraries to determine if they complied with his order.

“The judge in this case is essentially trying to say that the [resident doesn't have the executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our American soil. That is an egregious abuse of the bench. This judge cannot, does not have that authority,” Leavitt said.

“And it's very, very clear that this is an activist judge who is trying to usurp the president's authority under the Alien Enemies Act. The president has this power, and that's why this deportation campaign has continued, and this judge, judge Boasberg is a Democrat activist.”

Republican George W Bush appointed Boasberg as a judge in the District of Columbia's superior court, then Democrat Barack Obama elevated him the federal court.

This post has been corrected to note that Bush appointed Boasberg to the District of Columbia's superior court, and that Obama appointed him to the federal court.

The Trump administration's cancellation of an affordable repayment plan for student loans has prompted a lawsuit from the American Federal of Teachers, the Guardian's Michael Sainato reports:

A top teachers union has sued the US Department of Education after it stopped processing applications for affordable repayment plans of student loans last month and disabled the online application for the programs.

The American Federation of Teachers, or AFT – one the country's largest unions, representing 1.8 million workers – filed a lawsuit alleging the sweeping action violates federal law.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC, seeks a court order to restore access to these programs.

Another court order last month shut out borrowers of student loans from participating in four income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which tie income to student loan payments, designed to keep payments affordable and avoid defaults on loans.

“By effectively freezing the nation's student loan system, the new administration seems intent on making life harder for working people, including for millions of borrowers who have taken on student debt so they can go to college,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT. “The former president tried to fix the system for 45 million Americans, but the new president is breaking it again.”

Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is standing by his vote to fund the government, even as the calls for him to step aside grow.

“I believe so strongly I did the right thing for all the flack I'm getting,” Schumer said in an interview on Morning Joe.

He said he understood Democrats' desire to stand up to Trump, but warned that forcing a shutdown was not the way to do it. “Let's stand up to him smart. Let's not give him the keys to the kingdom.”

One major activist group, Indivisible, has already called on Schumer to resign as leader and constituents are raising the issue at town halls. According to Axios, at least two House Democrats responded yes when asked at a town hall whether Senate Democrats need new leadership.

Schumer this weekend cancelled several stops on a tour for his forthcoming book, citing security concerns after progressive groups announced plans to protest the New York Democrat's decision to lend his vote to a Republican funding bill

Schumer has argued that he does not support the bill, but feared a government shutdown at the exact moment Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trying to downsize the federal workforce would have been a far worse outcome.

“If we shut down the government and they started doing all these bad things, in a month, those folks would be saying, hey, save Medicaid, save our rural hospitals, save this, save that, and we'll say we can't, there's a government shutdown. And then they would come to us and say, so why'd you let it happen?” Schumer argued on Morning Joe. “I prevented that from happening, and I think my caucus, no matter which way they voted, understands that.

The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has declined to say publicly whether he continues to support Schumer. On Tuesday the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a sharp critique of Schumer's strategy: “I myself don't give away anything for nothing. I think that's what happened the other day,” she said, according to Politico. Unlike Jeffries, Pelosi said she still has confidence in Schumer's leadership.

Officials at the US Federal Reserve cut their US economic growth forecasts and raised their projections for price growth as they kept interest rates on hold.

“Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,” the central bank said in a statement, as Donald Trump's bid to overhaul the global economy with sweeping tariffs sparks concern over inflation and growth.

Policymakers at the Fed expect inflation to increase by an average rate of 2.7% this year, according to projections released on Wednesday, up from a previous estimate of 2.5%.

They expect US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – to rise by 1.7% this year, down from an estimate of 2.1% in December. Officials also revised down their projections for GDP growth in 2026 and 2027, to 1.8%.

Uncertainty is “unusually elevated”, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, cautioned, as the Trump administration attempts to engineer radical economic change. Some of the increase in the Fed's inflation expectations was “clearly” due to tariffs, he said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt provided a readout of Donald Trump's call today with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying the US president briefed his Ukrainian counterpart on his conversation yesterday with Vladimir Putin.

Trump and Zelenskyy agreed on “a partial ceasefire against energy” targets, while the Ukrainian president “asked for additional air defence systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems”. According to Leavitt, Trump “agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.”

For more on this, follow our European live blogger Jakub Krupa:

Leavitt also outlined why Donald Trump moved to fire two Democratic appointees to the Federal Trade Commission.

“The time was right to let these people go, and the president absolutely has the authority to do it,” Leavitt said.

It is widely suspected that the Trump administration hopes the firings will prompt a supreme court case that results in the conservative majority overturn a longstanding precedent and allowing presidents to make such terminations. Asked about that, Leavitt said:

We have to fight it all the way to the supreme court. We certainly will.

Karoline Leavitt also offered the administration's side of the story when it came to the takeover of the US Institute for Peace.

Agents of the department of government efficiency (Doge) entered its building on Monday, prompting a lawsuit from the institute saying the takeover was illegal. Here's Leavitt's recounting of the incident:

We were made aware of this story by individuals at Doge, at Elon Musk's team, and also at the State Department, who were unable to access this building. And it became very clear that there was a concerted effort amongst the rogue bureaucrats at the United States Institute of Peace to actually physically barricade themselves essentially inside of the building to prevent political appointees of this administration who work at the direction of the president of the United States to get into the building.

…

Staff contacted [Washington DC police] in an attempt to prevent Doge personnel from entering. They barricaded the doors. They also disabled telephone lines, internet connections and other IT infrastructure within the building. They distributed flyers internally, encouraging each other to basically prevent these individuals from accessing the building.

I use this to say this is what Doge and this administration is facing. It's a resistance from bureaucrats who don't want to see change in this city. President Trump was elected on an overwhelming mandate to seek change and implement change, and this is unacceptable behavior.

The press secretary was further pressed on if the Trump administration would authorize more flights to El Salvador.

The three planes that may have departed the United States in violation of a court order arrived in El Salvador, where the suspected Venezuelan gang members on board are being held in the country's troubled prison system.

“We don't have any flights planned specifically, but we will continue with the mass deportations,” Karoline Leavitt replied.

A reporter pointed out to Karoline Leavitt that James Boasberg was a George W Bush appointee. She countered by saying that most of the injunctions brought against the Trump administration so far have come from Democratic-appointed judges.

“This is a clear concerted effort by leftists who don't like this president and are trying to impose or slow down his agenda,” she said.

Leavitt also reiterated that Trump thinks Boasberg should be impeached, politically impossible though that may be, and said she expects the supreme court to weigh in on the case:

It's incumbent upon the supreme court to rein in these activist judges.

Karoline Leavitt then singled out James Boasberg, the federal judge who is weighing the legality of Donald Trump's deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.

Boasberg attempted over the weekend to prevent planes carrying the migrants from leaving, and has since demanded from the government details of the aircrafts' exact itineraries to determine if they complied with his order.

“The judge in this case is essentially trying to say that the [resident doesn't have the executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our American soil. That is an egregious abuse of the bench. This judge cannot, does not have that authority,” Leavitt said.

“And it's very, very clear that this is an activist judge who is trying to usurp the president's authority under the Alien Enemies Act. The president has this power, and that's why this deportation campaign has continued, and this judge, judge Boasberg is a Democrat activist.”

Republican George W Bush appointed Boasberg as a judge in the District of Columbia's superior court, then Democrat Barack Obama elevated him the federal court.

This post has been corrected to note that Bush appointed Boasberg to the District of Columbia's superior court, and that Obama appointed him to the federal court.

Speaking from the podium of the White House briefing room, Donald Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused federal judges of ruling against the president for partisan reasons.

“I would like to point out that the judges in this country are acting erroneously. We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy for the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable,” Leavitt said.

The press secretary was responding to a question about the federal judge who had ruled against Trump's attempt to deport suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, but did not name him specifically.

She continued:

It's incredibly apparent that there is a concerted effort by the far left to judge shop, to pick judges who are clearly acting as partisan activists from the bench in an attempt to derail this president's agenda. We will not allow that happen, and not only are they usurping the will of the [resident and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public, tens of millions of Americans who duly elected this president to implement the policies that are coming out of this White House.

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has condemned Donald Trump's firing of two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC):

“A bipartisan FTC is vital to enforcing anti-trust laws and consumer protections. By illegally firing two senate-confirmed Democratic commissioners, Trump has given a green light to businesses across the country to gouge consumers and skyrocket prices for American families,” Schumer said.

“Make no mistake about it: this decision will directly lead to higher prices for Americans. While President Trump and Senate Republicans continue to put their thumbs on the scale for billionaires and corporations, Democrats are committed to fighting for American families.”

Since taking office, Trump has terminated Democratic appointees to independent agencies across the federal government, prompting accusations that he is overstepping his bounds. Some judges have agreed.

The Trump administration continues to face skepticism from federal courts, particularly when it comes to their attempts to push the boundaries of immigration enforcement. A federal judge ordered Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil's case moved from Louisiana, where he is being detained and where judges may be more conservative, to New Jersey. Separately, justice department lawyers sparred with federal judge James Boasberg over his demand for details of three migrant deportation flights that may have taken place in violation of his order. The government criticized the judge's request and ask that he drop his noon deadline for them to answer his questions. Boasberg partially agreed, giving the Trump administration until 12pm tomorrow to either answer his questions, or outline national security related reasons why they are not able to.

Here's what else is going on today:

Donald Trump spoke with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said they were “very much on track” towards a ceasefire agreement.

The US Institute of Peace has sued after agents from the “department of government efficiency” took over its building, with the help of police.

The University of Pennsylvania lost $175m in federal funding at the order of the Trump administration, which accused them of allowing transgender athletes to play.

The deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act came as Donald Trump implements hardline policies to arrest undocumented immigrants and swiftly deport them.

That push includes reauthorizing the detention of entire families, something he allowed during his first administration, but which Joe Biden stopped. The practice essentially means children will be locked up alongside their parents, and today, 21 Democratic senators asked the Trump administration to curb the practice:

We strongly object to the failed and inhumane practice of detaining migrant families. We are deeply disturbed by reports that your Administration has revived this cruel policy, which has proven to be ineffective, costly, and devastating for children and families.

There is a widespread consensus in the United States that family detention poses serious risks to the physical and mental well-being of children. Medical and child welfare experts— including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association—have consistently condemned this practice, warning that even short-term detention fails to meet basic child welfare standards and exposes children to lasting trauma. Even the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) own medical consultants have concluded that family detention presents a “high risk of harm to children and families.” The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Advisory Committee on Family Residential Centers also determined that family detention should be discontinued.

Even as 2024 election loomed, reporters say, Democratic Senate leader was sure GOP would ‘expel the turd of Trump'

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, insisted Republicans would move on from Donald Trump and go back to a past version of the party even as Trump's return to power loomed last year, according to the authors of a new book on politics during the Biden administration.

The revelation comes as Trump's second term has begun in a flurry of radical policy moves that have rocked the US's political landscape and triggered fears of a slide into authoritarianism. It also comes amid serious Democratic backlash against Schumer for failing to provide stiff enough resistance to Trump's actions.

Schumer told Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater: “Here's my hope … after this election, when the Republican party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican party.”

That insult may cause a splash at the White House in light of Trump's abuse of Schumer, who he said last week was “not Jewish any more”, over the senator's response to anti-Israel college protests.

According to Karni and Broadwater, of the New York Times, Schumer delivered his judgment over a glass of wine one night in June 2023. With hindsight, the authors add: “If Schumer had seen any of it coming, he had not wanted to face it.”

They are referring to events since Trump's win over Kamala Harris in November, including the appointment of extremists to key roles and Trump's assault on the federal government, assisted by Elon Musk.

“The old Republican party was leaving, and the new MAGA guard was staying,” the authors write.

Mad House: How Donald Trump, MAGA Mean Girls, a Former Used Car Salesman, a Florida Nepo Baby, and a Man With Rats in His Walls Broke Congress, will be published next Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.

The Times has run excerpts, prominently about how Schumer sat with Joe Biden last July and told him he must relinquish the presidential nomination, little more than 100 days from election day, a disastrous debate having convinced Biden's own party he was too old to go on.

But it is now Schumer's turn in the spotlight, under fire from his own party. Last week, Schumer first said Democrats would not help Republicans stave off a government shutdown, then reversed and supported the GOP budget. Enough Democrats followed that the measure passed, promising more draconian cuts.

Schumer told the Times he “knew there would be divisions” but insisted “we are all unified in going after Trump”. But on Monday, amid heavy fire from figures including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman many want to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat, Schumer cancelled a tour for his own book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning.

Karni and Broadwater quote another Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has prominently gone after Trump and who many see as a Senate leader in waiting. Murphy was “willing to entertain the Schumer theory of the case” about a Republican party rescuable from Trumpism, the authors write. But “he didn't buy it himself”.

“There are plenty of examples of societies captured by a singularly unique individual demagogue and that get healthy after that person disappears,” Murphy says. “I don't know. I'm not as optimistic as [Schumer] is. I worry there's a rot at the core of the country that will continue to be exposed politically.”

Now 74, Schumer entered Congress in 1981. A senator since 1999, he became minority leader in 2016 and was majority leader from 2021 until this year.

Karni and Broadwater describe a 2013 dinner at the Palm, a “see-and-be-seen steakhouse” in Washington, between Schumer, the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, and the far-right shock jock Rush Limbaugh.

The meeting was brokered by the rightwing media baron Rupert Murdoch, so the senators could sell Limbaugh on immigration reform that offered a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented migrants.

Limbaugh refused to back it so Murdoch backed off too, taking Fox News with him. Republicans, Schumer realized, were “being led by the listeners who had fully bought into the baseless claims and toxic rumors peddled by Limbaugh”. The reform failed. Soon after, Trump seized the GOP.

Schumer discussed that fateful dinner “with his shoes off in his Senate office one night in June 2023 … noshing on gluten-free crackers and serving what he called his ‘special white wine', one he later conceded he didn't know much about: it had been picked out by his wife.”

Trump had just been indicted a second time, over his retention of classified records. “Schumer didn't think it would matter one bit in the presidential election,” the authors write. “On this point, he would be proven correct.”

Schumer also mused on voters who back Trump, wondering why a notional “New York City firefighter” should be “so fucking angry” when he had such a comfortable life. Schumer posited that the firefighter was made “so fucking mad” by “this technological revolution” and the ensuing loss of “family, community, religion”.

“Trump, who's an evil sorcerer, comes in, he says, ‘I can get that old world back.'”

But according to Karni and Broadwater, Schumer did not harbor such realism about Trump's party.

“Despite all facts to the contrary, it was a core belief of Schumer's that politics in America would recalibrate after Trump exited the stage. Driving through Brooklyn months before the shattering election cycle, Schumer repeated the sentiment.”

Schumer thought 25 Republican senators “were scared of Trump” but “those people, if Trump is gone, will go back”.

Karni and Broadwater add: “Schumer was bullish on everything, especially after Biden's dramatic exit from the race.

“He liked telling people that Robert Caro, the famed biographer of President Lyndon B Johnson, had referred to him, Schumer, as the ‘Jewish LBJ'. So, he let himself fantasize about Democrats winning everything, the White House, the Senate, and the dysfunctional House and steamrolling through progressive legislation that would have him live up to the moniker. ‘The one thing I'd really like to do is immigration reform,' he said. He was still thinking about the 2013 failure … ‘If that bill had passed,' he said, ‘the country would be a different place.'

“But it was never going to be that simple, because nothing ever is.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

China's embassy in Canada says it is ‘rule of law' country and those convicted of breaking laws ‘must be held accountable'

Canada's foreign affairs ministry has said it “strongly condemns” the execution of several of the country's citizens in China this year, highlighting sustained tensions between the two countries.

Global Affairs Canada confirmed on Wednesday that an unspecified number of citizens were executed earlier this year. The revelations were first reported by the Globe and Mail.

“Canada strongly condemns China's use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity,” a GAC spokesperson, Charlotte MacLeod, said in a statement to the Guardian. “Canada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere.”

McLeod said Canada was providing consular assistance to the victims' families and asked media “respect the family's privacy during this difficult time”.

China's embassy in Canada said in a statement it is a “rule of law” nation and that anyone convicted of breaking laws “must be held accountable”.

“Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognized worldwide as extremely harmful to the society, and will be faced with severe penalties in all countries. China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a ‘zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem,” the embassy said, adding it had “solid and sufficient” evidence in all the cases in which prisoners were executed.

“The Chinese judicial authorities have handled the cases in strict accordance with the law, and have fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned.”

China has a conviction rate of more than 99%, a result that has elicited skepticism and criticism from human rights groups over the years.

The embassy called on Canada to “respect the rule of law and China's judicial sovereignty” and to “stop making irresponsible remarks” in order to improve relationship between to the two countries.

Relations between the two countries hit a low point between 2018 and 2022, after the prominent Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver at the request of US authorities.

Her detention in Canada prompted China to quickly detain and charge two Canadians living in the country, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, eventually charing the pair with espionage.

But the upgrading of charges against a Canadian in prison further cemented views in Canada that China was engaged in “hostage diplomacy”.

In 2014, the Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg was accused of attempting to smuggle 225kg of methamphetamine to Australia. He has maintained his innocence, but in December 2018 he was sentenced to 15 years. That charge was upgraded to execution in 2019, during the fervour of China's diplomatic spat with Canada. At the time, Canada issued a travel warning to its citizens going to China.

MacLeod confirmed on Wednesday that Schellenberg was still detained and said the federal government “continues to advocate for clemency”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Zelenskyy says he will contact US president to discuss the call with Russian leader following the attack. Plus, dolphins welcome Nasa astronauts back to Earth

Good morning.

Russia attacked Ukraine with kamikaze drones and S-300 surface-to-air missiles overnight, Ukrainian authorities said, hours after Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump he would sign up to a partial and temporary ceasefire.

The US and Russian presidents spoke for more than two hours on Tuesday evening, and while Putin rejected Trump's request for a full 30-day ceasefire – to which Ukraine had agreed last week in Saudi Arabia – the pair agreed on a moratorium on strikes on energy and infrastructure targets.

However, shortly after the call ended, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv. About 45 drones attacked the region around the capital, and anti-aircraft fire was audible across the capital overnight.

What has Volodymyr Zelenskyy said? The Ukrainian president said he would contact Trump today to discuss the call with Putin, adding that the “next steps cannot be done without us”.

A push by the Trump administration to repeal a barrage of clean air and water regulations may deal a severe blow to US public health, with a Guardian analysis finding that the targeted rules were set to save the lives of nearly 200,000 people in the years ahead.

Last week, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provoked uproar by unveiling a list of 31 regulations it will scale back or eliminate, including rules limiting harmful air pollution from cars and power plants; restrictions on the emission of mercury, a neurotoxin; and clean water protections for rivers and streams.

What could be repealed? One of the most consequential actions will see the EPA reconsider a landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health, which has been used to underpin laws aimed at addressing the climate crisis.

The administration of the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, is continuing to pay more than $500,000 a month to a hotel developer who could provide valuable testimony to prosecutors against the mayor and several of his top allies.

The developer, Weihong Hu, was indicted last month for allegedly bribing a New York City non-profit CEO. The indictment charges that she gave the executive stacks of cash and helped him purchase a $1.3m townhouse in exchange for more than $20m in city-funded contracts for her two Queens hotels and a catering company. Hu has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

What is the money for? Despite these allegations brought by the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, Adams's administration has continued to pay one of Hu's companies more than $542,000 a month to host another nonprofit program at one of her Queens hotels, according to two city officials with knowledge of the matter.

The Trump administration yesterday released thousands of pages of files relating to the assassination of John F Kennedy, the 35th president who was shot dead in Dallas, Texas, in November 1963.

Heavily redacted court documents related to Prince Harry's US visa have been released in the US, with his “exact status” remaining confidential over fears he could be subjected to harassment. A rightwing group has argued that he might have concealed past illegal drug use.

Google has agreed to pay $28m (£22m) to settle a class action lawsuit claiming that it favoured white and Asian employees by paying them more and putting them on higher career tracks than other workers.

The Australian bestselling children's author Aaron Blabey has signed an eight-figure deal with the UK, US and Australian arms of Macmillan. Blabey, whose books have sold about 55m copies, is a New York Times-bestselling author.

The value of Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has reportedly risen back to the $44bn he paid for it, in a reversal of fortunes since the billionaire became a key ally of Donald Trump. Investors valued the site formerly known as Twitter at $44bn (£33.9bn) earlier this month, according to a Financial Times report.

Highly sexual fantasy stories are nothing new. But “romantasy” is part of a recent wave of entertainment that has exploded in popularity in recent years.

As parents resist vaccines over vague potential harms, advocates call it a case of ‘morals more than science'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning to devote research dollars to the debunked myth that vaccines cause autism – legitimizing stigma not only around vaccines, but around autism itself.

Matthew Shallenberger, father to an 11-year-old autistic son in Tennessee, says this myth is harmful because “it treats autism as some dreadful disease to avoid at all costs”.

Parents in the Texas community where an unvaccinated child died of measles last month, have continued to resist vaccines in the name of vague potential harms, including autism.

Shallenberger finds this bewildering: “I would much rather my son be alive, healthy and autistic than dead from a preventable childhood illness. It's not even a decision, really. There is only one choice for me: vaccinate my kids.”

Parents including Shallenberger are in the odd position of defending their decision to vaccinate – even though there is no evidence of a link between vaccines and autism. The myth, based on a 1998 study that was later retracted due to ethical concerns and falsified data, has been regaining traction since Covid-19 sparked debates over vaccine safety. Robert F Kennedy Jr, who was recently appointed as the US health and human services secretary, has also publicly suggested that autism may be linked to vaccination.

Lynne Peskoe-Yang, a 34-year-old Massachusetts-based journalist with autism, says the myth's persistence illustrates something disturbing about how the world sees autistic people – that because they are different, they must be contaminated somehow.

“It fits really well into other kinds of beliefs about health that really boil down to morals more than science,” Peskoe-Yang said.

Autism spectrum disorder is defined by persistent social difficulties as well as repetitive behaviors and interests, sometimes shaped by heightened sensitivity to stimuli like noises, textures and touch, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

The “spectrum” refers to the variety of ways people fit this definition. Many autistic people make it to adulthood without a diagnosis – despite the challenges that come even with mild cases, they are able to live independently. Others require lifetime support. While autism as a disability is defined by impairments, it is also associated with strengths, including dedication, focus and creativity in the workplace.

Even in more challenging cases, parents of autistic children find it repugnant that other parents are risking their own children's serious illness or death, ostensibly to avoid the condition.

Kate Abarca, a retired occupational therapist in South Carolina, says that learning to understand her son's autism was immensely rewarding. Caring for him made her a better therapist, and advocating for him helped her overcome her shyness. Now 35, her son Benjamin Beals is beloved in his community. He lives in a semi-independent facility and is known for his karaoke performances.

Abarca realized early that her son's difficulties stemmed from her own inability to understand his needs. When he was an infant, she says he screamed constantly and would kick and bite her when she was trying to care for him.

“ I came to recognize his actions as self-defense against me providing caregiving that he perceived as an assault,” she said.

Jonathan Knapp, 71, a podcaster in Indiana known by the stage name Johnny Profane, agrees that some of the difficulties associated with autism are more manageable if you understand their cause.

“Any child will start screaming in a supermarket given the right stimuli,” he said. Knapp, along with others contacted for this story, suspects that anti-vaxxers see autism as a combination of exaggerated stereotypes stemming from misunderstood behaviors.

Knapp was diagnosed with autism at 63. While the diagnosis is still stigmatized, Knapp says that understanding why he felt different his whole life has been a blessing.

Emir Lopez, a 32-year-old working in IT in Massachusetts, also sees his autism diagnosis as a gift. Lopez said when he was diagnosed as a child, his parents hid it. He connected the dots himself studying psychology in college. When his mother confirmed he had autism, Lopez realized there actually was “nothing wrong” with him. He was “normal” – just autistic.

Hearing parents fret over vaccines causing autism “just makes me so angry”, says Lopez, adding: “Autistic people, we're very logical, so that blows my mind even more.” Lopez remembers a particularly upsetting instance when his father's former girlfriend told him he might not have autism had he not been vaccinated.

Eventually, Lopez became so fed up with the stigma he decided to disclose his autism on social media with the joke “vaccines are just computer updates for me”.

A 37-year-old autistic sound engineer said he finds misinformation so disturbing he loses sleep over it, adding that anti-vaxxers are not “entitled” to “their own set of facts”. He echoed Lopez's sentiment that this cognitive dissonance can be especially distressing for autistic people: “It saps your energy away. You lose your appetite and your body temperature changes. It's a drastically physical thing.”.

Knapp, too, said he's lost days replaying social media conversations with anti-vaxxers over and over in his head.

While Lopez is troubled by misunderstandings over autism, he says he's most concerned over declining vaccination rates.

EU launches scheme to buy more weapons in Europe as Russia remains ‘a threat for the foreseeable future'

Europe needs to be able to deter potential invaders by 2030, the EU executive has said as it launched a push to buy more weapons in the bloc and from allied countries, rather than from the US.

The UK, US and Turkey will be excluded from defence contracts funded by a €150bn (£125bn) EU loans programme, unless they sign a security and defence partnership agreement with the EU.

The €150bn loans scheme will be open to EU member states as part of a massive surge in defence spending, but 65% of the costs of equipment funded must come from suppliers in the EU, Norway or Ukraine. The rest could be spent in non-EU countries with a security agreement.

The details came as the European Commission said Russia would remain “a fundamental threat to Europe's security for the foreseeable future”.

The EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters that the EU was preparing for the worst: “We don't have a cold war, but we have a hot war on European soil, and the threat is existential. It's as real as it can get.”

Last month Danish intelligence services warned that if Moscow perceived Nato as weak, Russia could be ready to wage a large-scale war in Europe within five years. Denmark's prime minister Mette Frederiksen urged fellow EU leaders to set a 2030 target on rearmament at a recent emergency summit in Brussels.

Addressing the Royal Danish Military Academy in Copenhagen on Tuesday, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said “readiness 2030” meant “to have rearmed and developed the capabilities to have credible deterrence” and “an industrial base that is a strategic advantage”.

The UK is described as an “essential European ally” in the paper, which also proposes deepening cooperation with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. The EU has defence pacts with six countries, including Japan, Korea and Norway.

Kallas, who met the UK foreign secretary David Lammy on Tuesday, said the commission was working on having a defence and security partnership with the UK and she hoped for results at an EU-UK summit in May.

The “Buy European” approach is a victory for France, but is likely to face pushback from member states, such as the Netherlands and Poland, in discussions on finalising the €150bn loan proposals. Many countries say they want a bigger European defence industry, but oppose restrictions on military spending.

“The British defence industry is so much intertwined with ours [in the EU],” a senior EU diplomat said. “We have an integrated value chain in the west for our military stuff. And it wouldn't make sense to cut it.”

They added that China, Iran and Russia were deepening defence industry cooperation. “So those who say that we should cut out the non-Europeans are shooting themselves geopolitically and economically in the foot.”

EU leaders, who will discuss the plans at a summit on Thursday, also differ in the tone they take on the US.

Italy's former prime minister, Mario Draghi, who is advising the commission on competitiveness, told Italian lawmakers this week that European security had been put in doubt by Donald Trump's change in foreign policy towards Russia.

A senior German government official in Berlin told reporters: “We don't want to give the impression we are seeking to decouple ourselves from the US.”

EU countries, such as France and Spain, are likely to be disappointed that the commission has not come up with new money to fund defence ambitions.

Officials think the EU can raise €800bn in new defence spending – €150bn from EU-backed loans raised on capital markets and €650bn fiscal flexibilities that allow EU member states to go into debt for defence without breaking the EU's fiscal rules.

EU diplomats say the headline €800bn will never be realised. Some of the largest and wealthiest member states, with top credit ratings, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have no intention of taking out EU-backed loans. Other member states, especially in southern Europe, are seen as reluctant to deepen their national debts for defence.

The commission could act as a central purchasing body, it suggests in the paper, opening the door to the EU executive buying drones, missiles and other equipment, if member states wished. The proposal recalls the role EU bodies have already played in buying ammunition for Ukraine and vaccines during the Covid pandemic.

Defence spending in Europe has jumped since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hitting 1.9% of GDP in 2024 for 27 member states, which includes 23 Nato allies. But Donald Trump's rapprochement towards Russia and hostility to the EU has forced a change of thinking.

The EU's 450 million citizens “should not have to depend on 340 million Americans to defend ourselves against 140 million Russians, who cannot defeat 38 million Ukrainians”, EU defence commissioner Andrius Kubilius said.

“We really can do better. It's time for us to take responsibility for the defence of Europe.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

David Yambio, founder of Refugees in Libya, urges international criminal court members to have phones checked 

A prominent activist in Italy has warned the international criminal court that his mobile phone was under surveillance when he was providing the ICC with confidential information about victims of torture in Libya.

A report released on Wednesday by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital surveillance of members of civil society, has confirmed that David Yambio, the founder of an organisation called Refugees in Libya, was targeted by mercenary spyware. The attack occurred at a time when he was in communication with The Hague, he said. At least one attack took place around June 2024, researchers said.

In a statement to the Guardian, Yambio said he alerted the ICC to the attack after it had been confirmed and urged members of the court to have their phones checked for spyware. The ICC's office of the prosecutor said it would not comment on matters related to “ongoing investigations”.

The revelation raises questions about whether a government agency with access to military-grade spyware may have been seeking to interfere with ICC proceedings by keeping tabs on individuals who have access to and advocate on behalf of victims of torture. It will probably put pressure on Giorgia Meloni, who has faced questions about the use of spyware in her government since revelations emerged in January that a handful of Italian activists and journalists had received warnings from WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Meta, that their phones had been targeted by spyware.

Meloni's government has been heavily criticised after authorities in Italy released a Libyan citizen wanted by the ICC for war crimes who had been arrested in Rome. Osama Najim, who is known as Almasri, is the director of a detention centre in Mitiga in Tripoli, which has been condemned by human rights organisations for its arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees.

The Citizen Lab report has confirmed that several activists and associates of Yambio, including two personal friends of Pope Francis, were targeted by hacking software that is supposed to be used against targets in terrorism investigations and other serious crime.

Researchers have not yet been able to determine the exact kind of spyware used against Yambio, but are continuing their investigation. They were able to confirm that the hacking software used against other activists was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli surveillance technology company that is now owned by a US financial investor. The researchers included Luca Casarini and Giuseppe Caccia, the two founders of an NGO that tries to protect migrants and refugees who are crossing the Mediterranean.

The researchers said: “We forensically analysed multiple Android phones belonging to Paragon targets in Italy [an acknowledged Paragon user] who were notified by WhatsApp. We found clear indications that spyware had been loaded into WhatsApp, as well as other apps on their devices.”

The Italian government has acknowledged it was a client of Paragon but has denied it was behind a spate of surveillance attacks against a journalist and several activists. Paragon has since suspended its contract with Italy because, according to a a person close to the matter, of a failure to abide by Paragon's rules that forbid spyware to be used against journalists or other members of civil society.

WhatsApp first revealed in January that 90 of its users, including civil society members and journalists, had been the target of government clients of Paragon. When it is successfully deployed, Paragon's spyware, which is called Graphite, can hack into any phone and access a user's messages and listen to mobile phone conversations, including those held over encrypted apps such as WhatsApp or Signal.

Yambio was first notified by Apple of a possible attack in November and his mobile phone was subsequently examined by experts at Cyber Hub-AM and the Citizen Lab.

Forensic details of the researchers' investigation was then shared for further analysis with Apple, which said in a statement that attacks like the one used against Yambio were “extremely sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop … and are used to target specific individuals because of who they are or what they do”. Apple confirmed it had developed and deployed “a fix” to the security flaw that had been exploited to attack Yambio, and that the fix was released in its iOS 18 to protect iPhone users.

The Citizen Lab researchers said its investigation found a number of other countries appeared to be clients of Paragon, including: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Cyprus, Singapore and Israel. No other details about the alleged relationship of those countries with Paragon were revealed in the report.

John Scott-Railton, a senior Citzen Lab researcher, said the emergence of fresh information about Paragon clients ought to raise questions about who was running the deployment of spyware, what was being done with information gathered, and whether the use of the spyware was aligned with domestic laws.

John Fleming, the executive chair of Paragon US, said in a statement: “Paragon has been contacted by Citizen Lab and provided with a very limited amount of information, some of which appears to be inaccurate. Given the limited nature of the information provided, we are unable to offer a comment at this time.”

The company, which has previously agreed a contract with US immigration authorities, said it required all users to adhere to terms and conditions that “preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders”.

Fleming said: “While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”

Hannah Neumann, an MEP who investigated the abuse of spyware inside the EU, said in a statement that spyware abuse continued in Europe, and followed a similar pattern.

She said: “We have seen this pattern before – denial, deflection, and ultimately, no justice for the victims. It is Groundhog Day for spyware abuse, and unless we fix the loopholes in regulation and strengthen victim protection, these violations will continue unchecked. We need strong European rules and accountability measures to stop this cycle once and for all.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tech companies could be fined billions if EU finds they have breached the Digital Markets Act

The European Commission has accused the US tech companies Google and Apple of breaking its digital rules, in a landmark action that could escalate transatlantic tension with Donald Trump.

The US president has sought to exert pressure on the EU to back away from tougher regulation of American technology groups, warning that he could retaliate by imposing tariffs on foreign companies.

But on Wednesday, the commission pressed ahead with enforcement action against Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, two of the world's five largest companies by stock market value, accusing them of breaking the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Breaches of the DMA can result in companies being fined 10% of worldwide revenue, or 20% if they reoffend. Based on Apple's 2024 revenue of $391bn (£301bn), the maximum fine would be nearly $80bn.

The commission said it had taken a “preliminary view” that Google's search engine prioritises results pointing to Alphabet's own services over those of rivals, breaching the requirement to treat third-party services in a “transparent, fair and non-discriminatory” way.

It also said that Google Play, the company's app store, prevents developers from steering consumers towards other channels where better offers might be available.

The commission told Apple it must make its operating systems available to devices made by competitors, such as smartphones and wireless headphones, or else face the prospect of investigations and fines.

The order is designed to promote competition by making it possible for makers of rival technology to connect with Apple's devices, such as iPads and iPhones.

The EU issued a second order against Apple, laying out a detailed timeline and methodology for how Apple should respond to requests from app developers to open up its systems.

A spokesperson for Apple said: “Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules.”

The company added: “It's bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”

Google's senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, wrote in a blogpost: “The commission's findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses.”

He said if the company could not charge reasonable fees to support the ongoing development of Android and its Play services, then it would be unable to invest in an open platform.

The EU competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said the bloc was “simply implementing the law, and providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and developers”.

Brussels opened proceedings in September designed to ensure that Apple complies with the DMA.

The EU is also investigating Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, over its “pay or consent” model, under which users pay a monthly fee for an advert-free version of the social media platforms that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes.

Trump has indicated that he will factor any regulatory action against US companies into his decisions about imposing tariffs on foreign goods. The US vice-president, JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation in a rebuke aimed at the EU's sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.

The US has also pushed back against Britain's plans for a digital services tax, amid regular attacks by Elon Musk, the owner of X, on the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Vance has also attacked the UK's Online Safety Act, claiming last month that free speech in the UK was “in retreat”. However, the UK government is adamant that the act will not be a bargaining chip in any negotiations between the Trump administration and Britain over tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Charity's CEO says visit could help rebuild fighter's reputation after he was found liable for rape in civil case

An Irish rape crisis charity has complained about Conor McGregor's meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, describing it as a “sinister” move that could help “launder” the mixed martial arts fighter's reputation.

Rachel Morrogh, the chief executive of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, has written to the US embassy in the Irish capital raising concerns about the meeting, which took place on Monday, Saint Patrick's Day.

Morrogh told the Guardian the meeting, which took place four months after a jury in an Irish civil case found McGregor liable for rape, sent a message that “there is a path to redemption leading directly to the White House”.

She said: “We do believe that the meeting between Trump and Conor McGregor was really very sinister and we have called it out for what it is, which is … an attempt to rebuild the very damaged reputation of Conor McGregor.

“I think what has really shocked us is that the office of the president of the United States, which is so respected and so revered, is being used to launder Conor McGregor's reputation.”

In November, McGregor was ordered by a civil court to pay nearly €250,000 (£210,000) in damages to a woman who said he “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. He has said he had consensual sex with the woman and is appealing against the verdict, with a hearing scheduled for Friday in the high court in Dublin.

McGregor, a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion, used his platform at the White House to hit out at the Irish government over immigration, saying the country was “potentially losing its Irishness” and claiming that some rural towns had been “overrun in one swoop”.

Dressed in a green suit on Ireland's national day, McGregor was invited to speak in the official White House briefing room alongside the president's press secretary before going on to meet Trump and Elon Musk in the Oval Office along with his partner and children.

McGregor, 36, has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Musk's retweets.

But his claim to speak for the people of Ireland on the issue of immigration has been widely derided and condemned. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said McGregor's claims were simply “wrong”. The finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said his “heart fell” when he learned of the meeting.

McGregor later responded by saying the Irish government had taken “zero action with zero accountability”.

A rise in immigration has caused tensions in some parts of Ireland but there is no evidence for McGregor's claims of towns being “overrun”. Government data shows that in the last three years, just over 45,000 people have applied for asylum in Ireland, which has a population of about 5.3 million.

Some believe the fighter may be positioning himself for a presidential run in Ireland later this year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Coastguard rescues 10 people and search resumes after half-sunken dinghy spotted near islet

Six people have died and 40 are missing after a boat disaster off the Italian island of Lampedusa.

The wreck occurred on Tuesday afternoon. A half-sunken dinghy was spotted by Italian police patrols close to the islet of Lampione.

The Italian coastguard rescued 10 people. The search for survivors resumed early on Wednesday morning.

According to reports in the Italian press, survivors told rescuers there were about 56 people on the vessel, which had left from Sfax in Tunisia and got into difficulty owing to bad weather. They said many had fallen into the sea.

The bodies of six people were taken to Lampedusa. Six men and four women were among the survivors transferred to a reception centre on the island.

“The deaths in the Mediterranean of those who set out in search of a more dignified future point a finger towards our own inability to imagine a future capable of giving hope and horizons of life,” said Father Marco Pagniello, the director of the Italian unit for the Catholic church-run charity Caritas.

“During days in which the merciless violence of wars are once again getting the upper hand over the prospect of peace, all the more is required of everyone, but especially those who have received the mandate to work for the common good, to respond first and foremost to the needs of those who are forced to abandon their home. We cannot get used to these [tragic] events as if they are business as usual.”

The wreck comes amid a steady increase in the number of people arriving in Italy after making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from north Africa in search of refuge.

The rise was most noticeable in January, when 3,368 people arrived compared with 2,258 in the same month in 2024. Most of the people who came towards the end of that month had left from Libya, with whom Italy has a controversial pushback deal.

The increase is believed to have been connected to the arrest in Italy of Osama Najim, a Libyan warlord wanted by the international criminal court for suspected war crimes, including abuse of migrants and refugees held in Libyan detention centres as part of the pact. Najim was subsequently released and deported back to Tripoli, causing uproar in Italy.

At least 248 people are estimated to have died while trying to cross the Mediterranean in January and February, according to figures from the International Organisation for Migration. An estimated 2,300 either died or went missing during the crossing in 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Order calls for revising infrastructure policy to better assess risks instead of ‘all-hazards approach', White House said

Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order that seeks to shift responsibility for disaster preparations to state and local governments, deepening the president's drive to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

The order, first previewed by the White House on 10 March, calls for a review of all infrastructure, continuity and preparedness and response policies to update and simplify federal approaches.

It said “common sense” investments by state and local governments to address risks ranging from wildfires to hurricanes and cyber attacks would enhance national security, but did not detail what they were or how they would be funded.

“Preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the state, local, and even individual levels, supported by a competent, accessible, and efficient federal government,” the order said. “When states are empowered to make smart infrastructure choices, taxpayers benefit.”

The order calls for revising critical infrastructure policy to better reflect assessed risks instead of an “all-hazards approach”, the White House said in a fact sheet on the order.

It creates a “National Risk Register” to identify, describe and measure risk to US national infrastructure and streamlines federal functions to help states work with Washington more easily.

Trump in January ordered a review of Fema that stopped short of shuttering the country's lead disaster response agency and a White House official said the latest order was not aimed at closing Fema.

Rob Moore, the director of the flooding solutions team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, accused the Trump administration of systematically weakening US disaster readiness.

“From day one, the Trump administration has been eroding the nation's capacity to plan for, respond to, and recover from disasters,” Moore told Reuters.

“They've overseen the dismissal of 1,000 Fema staff – who won't be there to respond to a flood or wildfire – and are withholding funding from local and state governments who are doing risk reduction projects and more.“

Shana Udvardy, a senior researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she was concerned the order marked “another dangerous step” that would leave communities with fewer resources to prepare for future disasters.

“The executive order shifts most of the responsibility for disaster preparedness to state and local governments, asking them to make more expensive infrastructure investments without outlining the federal role in that,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Ice-cream brand's board says David Stever has been ‘removed' for refusing to ‘oversee the dismantling' of its values

Ben & Jerry's has accused its parent group, Unilever, of sacking the ice-cream brand's chief executive for refusing to “oversee the dismantling” of its progressive values.

David Stever – who led the company for almost two years having first joined it as a tour guide in 1988 – was “removed” from his post earlier this month, it has was claimed in a court filing from the US-based brand.

Ben & Jerry's alleged in a submission to the US district court for the southern district of New York that Unilever, the UK-based consumer group that owns brands including Marmite and Dove, wanted to stop the boss from making political statements.

Anuradha Mittal, the chair of Ben & Jerry's independent board, said: “Dave has courageously advanced the company's social mission and values, has continued to drive innovation in its super premium product range, and has delivered strong financial results, far outpacing the rest of Unilever's ice-cream business.

“What Dave hasn't done is what Unilever would like him to do, which is to oversee the dismantling of Ben & Jerry's mission, progressive values.”

The court action is the latest episode in a testy relationship between the ice-cream brand and its parent group, which ousted its own chief executive, Hein Schumacher, last month and replaced him with its finance chief, Fernando Fernandez, to speed up a turnaround process.

Last month, Ben & Jerry's accused Unilever of demanding that it stop publicly criticising Donald Trump. And in November it launched legal action against its parent, accusing the company of trying to block it from making public statements supporting Palestinian refugees in the conflict in Gaza.

It claimed Unilever had breached the terms of a confidential settlement agreed in 2022 after a clash over plans to stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Ben & Jerry's, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978, was bought by the UK-based consumer goods group in 2000.

As part of the merger deal, an independent board was set up to protect the ice-cream brand's mission and strong stance on social issues.

Mittal also accused Unilever of wanted to dismantle that agreement, which he said had “protected Ben & Jerry's position as a wholly owned autonomous subsidiary, the very things that have created the company's financial success and incredible brand loyalty among its fans.

“That is why the independent board has sued Unilever and why Unilever is seeking to punish the chief executive.”

The court filing said: “Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission.

“On 3 March 2025, Unilever informed the independent board that they were removing and replacing Mr Stever as Ben & Jerry's CEO.”

The two parties have had a series of disputes in recent years, with particular tensions over Ben & Jerry's move to halt sales in the West Bank in 2021. Unilever blocked the attempt but was then sued by Ben & Jerry's.

The latest row comes after Unilever announced plans to list its ice-cream business on the Amsterdam stock exchange.

The listing will separate a division that makes five of the world's top-selling 10 ice-cream brands, including Wall's, Magnum and Ben & Jerry's. It also makes Cornetto, Viennetta, Carte d'Or and Breyers, which is big in the US.

Dramatic reversal of fortune for platform since billionaire owner became key ally of Donald Trump

The value of Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has reportedly soared back to the $44bn he paid for it, in a dramatic reversal of fortunes since the billionaire became a key ally of Donald Trump.

Investors valued the site formerly known as Twitter at $44bn (£33.9bn) in a secondary deal earlier this month, in which they exchange existing stakes in the company, according to a Financial Times report.

X, which is also working on raising $2bn in fresh capital in a primary funding round selling new equity to pay off more than $1bn in junior debt, had been valued at just $10bn by the existing investor Fidelity Investments as recently as late September.

Musk, the world's richest man, took control of what was then Twitter in October 2022 and subsequently tweeted “the bird is free”, in a reference to its corporate logo. The following summer he rebranded the platform as X.

Since taking over, Musk has loosened the site's moderation policies, which prompted many advertisers to pause or leave. Musk subsequently said advertisers were trying to “blackmail” him with boycotts and hit out in a profanity-laced outburst in a session at the New York Times DealBook Summit in November 2023.

X subsequently sued a global advertising alliance and several big companies, including Unilever, Mars and CVS Health, accusing them of unlawfully conspiring to shun the social network and intentionally causing it to lose revenue.

“We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,” Musk tweeted after the launch of the legal action.

The new $44bn valuation represents a remarkable turnaround for the platform and its investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, 8VC, Goanna Capital and Fidelity Investments. The secondary deal will set a price for the primary fund raise of $2bn.

Institutions that provided loans to help fund Musk's X takeover also received a boost after Musk gave a 25% stake in his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI, to them early last year.

Since then, xAI has obtained a valuation of $45bn, providing new security to lenders, which has also boosted the updated valuation of X.

Revenues at the social media platform have fallen since Musk's takeover but it posted adjusted profits of $1.2bn last year.

It emerged this week that Musk's vast stake in Tesla is no longer the most valuable asset in his business empire, with the electric car company's market value continuing to fall as investors sell off stock and customers turned away in disgust at his politics.

Musk's stake in SpaceX, his private rockets and satellites business, is now the tycoon's largest asset for the first time in five years, according to Forbes.

Forbes still estimates his net worth at $323bn, with Musk's SpaceX stake worth an estimated $147bn, about $20bn more than his shares in Tesla after the carmaker's shares halved since December.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

German defence minister says Putin ‘is playing a game here' and calls Russian president's demands ‘unacceptable'

European leaders have reacted sceptically to the limited ceasefire in Ukraine agreed by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, saying it has made it abundantly clear that the Russian president is not serious about seeking a peaceful end to the three-year-old conflict.

During a call with the US president, Putin agreed to a partial ceasefire that would stop his forces targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but declined to commit to the 30-day full ceasefire plan pitched by Trump last week and agreed to by Ukraine.

Further doubts about the deal arose after Russia launched a wave of attacks on targets across Ukraine hours after Trump and Putin spoke. Russia also reported a series of attacks by Ukrainian drones.

“Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated,” Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in an interview with the German broadcaster ZDF. “Putin is playing a game here and I'm sure that the American president won't be able to sit and watch for much longer.”

Pistorius said Putin's commitment to stop attacks on energy targets was “basically nothing” because such infrastructure in Ukraine was already the “best protected”.

The minister also described as “unacceptable” the Kremlin's insistence that a key condition for peace would be a total halt of western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.

“This is very transparent,” Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from “further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”.

The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said their countries would continue sending military aid to Ukraine. “Ukraine can count on us,” Scholz said.

The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, also dismissed Russian demands that help for Kyiv be halted. “Ukraine has an undeniable right to defend itself on its own and supported by its partners,” he said on Wednesday. “This right cannot be restricted in any way, not now, and not in the future.”

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, downplayed the US-Russian deal. She said: “It is clear that Russia does not really want to make any kind of concessions.” She added that Kremlin demands to stop arming Kyiv could not be accepted.

Spain's foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was equally cautious about the prospects for peace. In an interview with Radio Nacional de España on Wednesday morning, he described the conflict as “one man's war”, adding that there was “no real will from Putin to stop this war”.

He asaid: “It's positive that there's talk of a ceasefire and talk of peace with Russia, but we're still very far from the peace that Spain and the European people want.”

Others, however, were more optimistic. On Wednesday, China applauded the deal between Putin and Trump.

“The Chinese side has advocated resolving the crisis through dialogue and negotiation from the very beginning,” its foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We welcome all efforts toward a ceasefire and consider it a necessary step toward achieving peace.”

Ukraine's energy facilities attacked hours after Putin agreed to halt strikes on such targets in a call with US president

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would speak with the US president, Donald Trump, on Wednesday, their first conversation since last month's disastrous Oval Office meeting, as the Ukrainian president warned Vladimir Putin's pledge to halt strikes on energy infrastructure was “very much at odds with reality” after a barrage of drone attacks across the country.

Russia carried out overnight strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure despite Putin agreeing in a call with Trump on Tuesday to avoid such targets for 30 days.

“Even last night, after Putin's conversation with Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,” Ukraine's president said at a news conference in Helsinki with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb.

Zelenskyy announced he would have a call with Trump later in the day to “discuss the details” ahead of the next round of talks between US and Russian delegations on Sunday in Saudi Arabia.

It would be the first known conversation between Trump and Zelenskyy since their disastrous meeting at the White House last month.

Kyiv is expected to agree to the new, more limited ceasefire, but Zelenskyy said he was waiting for further information from Washington.

“If the Russians would stop hitting our targets we would certainly not be striking their targets,” Zelenskyy said in Helsinki on Wednesday.

Russia and the US are meeting in Riyadh this weekend to finalise the limited ceasefire deal and begin discussions on a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, as well as the prospects for a full ceasefire.

Trump and Putin spoke for more than two hours on Tuesday evening, and while the Russian president rejected Trump's request for a full 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine had agreed last week in Jeddah, the pair agreed on a mutual moratorium between Russia and Ukraine on strikes on energy and infrastructure targets.

However, shortly after the call ended, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv. About 45 drones attacked the region around the capital, and anti-aircraft fire was audible across Kyiv overnight.

Authorities said numerous houses and cars were damaged by drones that fell in Bucha and other areas around the capital, and two people were injured. In the eastern city of Sumy, a drone hit a hospital building, and more than 100 patients had to be evacuated. In a separate incident, one civilian died in a nearby village.

Ukraine also continued its own long-range drone assaults on Russia overnight, apparently hitting an oil depot in the southern region of Krasnodar. Russia's defence ministry claimed it destroyed 57 Ukrainian drones, the majority in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have recently been withdrawing from a small chunk of territory they have occupied for the past seven months.

Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Wednesday, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, reiterated that Putin and Trump had agreed to a 30-day ceasefire specifically targeting energy infrastructure.

Russia's defence ministry claimed in a statement that, as part of Putin's limited ceasefire pledge, its air defence systems shot down its own kamikaze drones, which had reportedly been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Peskov also underscored the growing warmth between the two leaders, who have been lavishing praise on each other in recent weeks, fuelling anxieties in Europe and Ukraine.

“Presidents Putin and Trump understand each other well, trust each other and are intent to gradually move towards the normalisation of ties,” he said.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News that talks to finalise the deal between the two sides would begin on Sunday. “We have some details to work out of course, but that will begin on Sunday in Jeddah, and beyond that we'll move to a full ceasefire,” he said.

He described the call as “two great leaders coming together for the betterment of mankind”.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and productive” conversation with Putin.

He added: “We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.”

Trump later told the Washington Examiner news outlet that the call with Putin was “very good,” describing the Russian leader as “very solid, very strong – which he is”.

Trump has been keen to do a quick deal to end the war, which many in other western capitals are concerned may involve pressuring Ukraine into an unfavourable deal, as Russia shows no sign of relaxing its maximalist demands for peace.

A Kremlin statement said Putin had issued an order to the Russian military to suspend strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. However, it added that in order to agree to a full ceasefire Moscow would first require all western military aid to Ukraine to cease.

“It was emphasised that a key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means must be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv,” the Kremlin said.

Speaking on Fox News after the call, Trump denied that the issue had even come up. “No, we didn't talk about aid, actually, we didn't talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed,” he said.

However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump on Wednesday, telling reporters in Moscow that “the need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump's conversation”.

“The suspension of military aid to Kyiv will be high on the agenda in negotiations between Russia and the US, but the topic will not be discussed publicly,” Peskov said.

Ukraine had initially proposed a ceasefire on sea and in the air, but the US delegation at talks in Saudi Arabia last week pushed Kyiv to agree to a full 30-day ceasefire, which was eventually agreed after eight hours of talks.

If upheld by both sides, a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure would mark the first part-ceasefire in more than three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine's infrastructure for the past three years, while in recent months Ukraine has been increasingly able to hit targets deep inside Russia with long-range drones.

In Moscow, senior Russian officials signalled their satisfaction with Putin's conversation with Trump. Kirill Dmitriev, a senior aide close to Putin, wrote on X: “It is official now – a PERFECT call.”

There remains no indication that Putin has abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine.

Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would never recognise any occupied territories as part of Russia.

“The key thing is not to lose our independence, our state's sovereignty, and to ensure that Russia never, ever has any influence over Ukraine's freedom,” he said.

Zelenskyy also rejected any discussion on the role or size of Ukraine's military, firmly rebuffing one of Putin's key demands, to impose a cap on its armed forces.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Report on ‘possible links' raises questions about extent and scope of Canadian authorities' use of cyber weapons

Researchers have uncovered “possible links” between Ontario's provincial police force and an Israel-based military-grade spyware maker called Paragon Solutions, raising questions about the extent and scope of Canadian authorities' use of cyber weapons.

The new findings were published by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks and identifies digital threats against civil society, and come three years after a parliamentary committee in Canada called for Ottawa to update the country's privacy laws in the wake of press reports that the national police force was using spyware to hack mobile phone devices. No laws were ever passed to address the controversy.

The Citizen Lab, in a report published on Wednesday, found a possible technical link between Paragon, which sells a spyware known as Graphite to government clients, and entities based in Ontario, Canada, including one that used the address of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).

Paragon, which is now a US-owned company, does not disclose the names of its clients and did not comment on this story.

Like other spyware makers, the company has emphasized that it is meant to be used to fight serious crime and terrorism. But the company's spyware, which can hack into any phone, was recently found to be used against an Italian journalist and several activists who support migrants. The Italian government has acknowledged it was a Paragon client and that the company has suspended its contract with Italy following revelations that the hacking software was used against members of civil society.

In a previous statement, a spokesperson said Paragon requires all of its users to “adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders”. A spokesperson added: “While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”

Canada's use of spyware was a source of controversy in 2022, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police admitted – in what was called a “remarkable” disclosure – that the national police force used spyware to infiltrate mobile devices and collect data. It said at the time that it only used the technology in serious cases, when other surveillance technology failed.

The Citizen Lab's new report provides more detail about the use of spyware by Canadian authorities. Researchers said they found evidence of a “growing ecosystem” of spyware capability among Ontario-based police services. Researchers said public court records obtained by the Citizen Lab show that the OPP used a surveillance tool that was being used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the course of a 2019 investigation to infect a mobile phone for remote interception of private communications.

Additionally, a 2023 judgement from the superior court of justice in Toronto described a joined investigation by Toronto police and York regional police services where investigators “considered” the use of a spyware surveillance tool, which in Canada is referred to as an “on-device investigative tool” (ODIT).

A 2023 search warrant application obtained by the Citizen Lab, which was prepared by the Toronto Police Service, also revealed that TPS has obtained an ODIT from an unknown source, and that the police were seeking authorization to use the software to intercept cellular communications through encrypted instant messaging applications.

“What these findings show is that there is a widening gap in public awareness regarding the extent to which spyware technology is being used in Canada,” said Kate Robertson, a senior researcher at the Lab. “These findings raise important questions for the government and privacy regulators about what technologies are being used, and underscores again the need for law reform to address the security and human rights risks concerned.”

The OPP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Facing new threats to its sovereignty, the country is looking to reaffirm itself as ‘an Arctic nation'

Warrant officer Jim Davison had spent a full day travelling the sea ice off the coast of Baffin Island when his group decided to set up camp for the night.

The Canadian soldier ran through a mental checklist of what was needed: shelter in the forest, wood for a fire and a source of fresh water.

“I look around and I'm a kilometre offshore. The only trees are more than one thousand kilometres away,” he said. “I realize at that moment: I don't know what to do.”

But the combat veteran was traveling with the Canadian Rangers, a group of reservists largely drawn from Indigenous communities who serve as scouts and guides for Canada's military in the north.

During that trip in 2023, they explained to Davison how to find shelter and food in a landscape that, to the unacquainted eye, looks both homogenous and hostile.

“When they talk, I listen,” he said. “And when they say stop, I stop.”

In recent years, Canada has realized the deep vulnerabilities of a land mass spanning nearly 4m sq km (1.5m sq miles) that makes up nearly half the country. With renewed threats to its territorial claims coming both from foes and allies, the country's government has pledged to devote far more resources to holding the north.

But those efforts are meaningless without the help of the region's inhabitants – long seen as pawns in a greater geopolitical game, and yet whose knowledge of the lands and waters is irreplaceable.

On Tuesday, Mark Carney made his first major domestic visit as prime minister to the far-north city of Iqaluit in a bid to “reaffirm” Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty, adding the region was a “strategic priority” for his government.

“Canada is, and will forever be, an Arctic nation,” he said, flanked by Canada's top soldier, the country's defence minister and the Nunavut premier.

Carney, the first prime minister born in one of Canada's northern territories, announced the purchase of an Australian early warning radar system and millions of dollars' investment to improve housing and upgrade power plants in northern communities.

Carney's visit follows the completion of Operation Nanook, an Arctic military exercise involving nearly 650 personnel. The operation, conducted alongside allies from the US, the UK, Belgium, Sweden and Finland, reflects an aim to “project force” in the Arctic, but also to sustain that force amid frozen conditions.

At every military camp scattered throughout the north, members of the Canadian Rangers are easy to spot: they sport a bright red hooded sweatshirt peeking out from underneath a parka and camouflage pants.

Their jobs include predator control, guiding to remote sites and finding paths through treacherous ice and snow. Between duties, they shelter in tents, snacking on salted fish harvested earlier in the summer. If temperatures enter a sustained deep freeze, they pull out the beluga oil, dipping pieces of caribou meat for a combination that warms one up so much “that will make your ears burn”, says ranger Emmanuel Adam.

Whitney Lackenbauer, a professor at Trent University and an honorary lt col in the Canadian Rangers, said the 5,000-strong force, whose members come from 200 northern communities and speak 26 languages and dialects is unlike any other unit around the world.

“It's truly unique. It has a respect for Indigenous ways of knowing, being and seeing, rather than trying to convert people into a different model of service, like conventional soldiers,” he said. “Because the Rangers have an intimate tie to the lands, they are able to navigate effectively without having to rely on GPS and anything that needs batteries. To have people who use the direction of the snow drifts, the prevailing wind conditions and the night sky to navigate – these are things I've experienced and they're both invaluable.”

The Rangers' status within the armed forces stands in contrast with the region's dark history.

In the 1950s, the federal police rounded up transient Inuit communities under the false promise of new hunting grounds and prosperous lands, forcibly moving them to newly established settlements, so that Canada could claim the territory amid threats from the Soviet Union and the United States.

The Inuit, intimately familiar with their old hunting areas after a lifetime of learning to read the nuances of the land, were thrown by their new locations. The environments, once capable of supporting small roving groups, could not supply larger permanent settlements with enough fresh game.

“As Inuit, we have endured a great deal in the name of Canadian sovereignty,” Nunavut premier PJ Akeeagok said during Carney's visit to Iqaluit. “Canada's national identity as an Arctic nation was built on the backs of our communities.”

In past decades, many of those who served as Canadian Rangers were sent to residential schools, where they endured widespread abuse and attempts to crush their culture.

“I know the after-effects of what that did to our communities and the three or four generations that come after it. We're still dealing with it,” said Jackie Jacobson, a prominent Canadian Ranger and former politician. Jacobsen spent three years at a residential school in Inuvik.

Yet Jacobson has committed decades of his life to the Rangers, mentoring countless youngsters to become key sentinels for Canada's military.

“When the green army comes up there, we're going to be the ones that guide them. We know our land, we know areas with overflow, pressure ridges and thin ice. The local knowledge of a ranger is priceless,” he said.

As Canada grapples with its past and the search for justice , a broader criticism of the current relationship between Indigenous peoples and the federal government often rests on symbolic platitudes. Land acknowledgments, a fixture of cultural events, have at times been rendered meaningless by a tangled attempt to reconcile broken treaties and unceded territory with sustained occupation.

But in the north, arrogance and ignorance are deadly, says Capt Alex Boom of the Canadian army, and the only way to survive is with a trusting relationship between both parties.

“The Rangers you'll meet don't go to the armories and play soldier once a week. They live it constantly,” Boom tells a crop of 150 newly arrived reservists before they head out onto the land. Most have never been to the Arctic. “They hunt, they fish, they survive. They pull bodies out of water. They recover downed aircraft. This is their land.,”Boom says.

Boom cautions the troops that the Rangers' job is to keep them alive and safe – not to be called on for menial tasks. “These are sage men and women born of, and shaped by, the north. They thrive up here,” he said. “They're quiet but they're watching all the time. They hear everything. They're seeing you constantly. They're very happy to share their knowledge, once you gain their respect.”

For Rangers, too, Operation Nanook gives some a chance to experience parts of the country that are foreign to them: the Arctic encompasses a vast and diverse geography. During the exercise, Angela Okalik, who flew to Inuvik from the hamlet of Whale Cove, had to grapple with a new and unfamiliar obstacle on the landscape: trees.

“I love it here, learning from others. And snowmobiling through forests is weird, but really fun,” she said.

Working with Jim Davison, who now serves as liaison between the Rangers and the rigid structure of the military, Okalik and two others from Whale Cove have been given a task closer to their comfort zone: standing guard while military scientists test cold-weather gear on a frozen lake well above the tree line, and helping build a runway for one of the world's largest transport plane.

“This,” she says, surveying the vast white landscape. “This, I know.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Search continues for missing woman after three tourists were caught by rushing snow in Lyngen municipality

A tourist buried by an avalanche in northern Norway has been pulled out alive in a “miracle” rescue after spending seven hours trapped beneath the snow, local media reported.

The man, described as being in his 40s or 50s, was found conscious under about 1.5 metres (5ft) of snow shortly after midnight in the municipality of Lyngen.

He had spent nearly seven hours in an air pocket – from where he had been able to call the police.

“People [buried under the snow] who survive an avalanche usually suffocate within 10 minutes,” Dr Audun Hetland, an avalanche researcher from the Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, told the newspaper iTromsø. “Some survive longer. But seven hours is almost unique in history.”

Kristian Midtgard, a dog handler who – with his dog, Whiskey – found the man, told TV2: “It was very surprising that he was still alive.”

“All the statistics and experience say that it's not possible when you stay buried for so long,” he added.

The mayor of Lyngen, Erik Larsen, quoted by the public broadcaster NRK, called it “a miracle”.

The man was part of a group of three foreign tourists on a ski tour in a region where authorities warned there was a high risk of avalanches.

Another member of the trio was caught by the rushing snow and swept into the waters of a fjord below. He managed to get ashore and was able to contact authorities. A search operation is continuing for a woman who is still missing.

Killing of Jessie Hoffman Jr for 1996 rape and murder of Mary Elliott is state's first execution in 15 years

Louisiana has carried out its first execution using nitrogen gas, an experimental method for judicial killings that has only been used by one other death-penalty state.

Jessie Hoffman Jr, 46, was pronounced dead at the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola at 6.50pm local time on Tuesday. He had been convicted of the 1996 rape and murder in New Orleans of Mary “Molly” Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive.

Reporters who were present at the execution described a prolonged and disturbed death. Hoffman was forced to breathe nitrogen for 19 minutes through an industrial-style mask while strapped to the gurney.

According to the Advocate, the reporters said that the gas began to flow at 6.21pm and Hoffman instantly began twitching. His head jerked and his hands clenched, with his last visible breath recorded 16 minutes after the procedure began.

Louisiana officials conceded that there had been signs of “convulsive activity”, with Hoffman moving and shaking as he died.

Last-minute appeals for a reprieve failed when the US supreme court declined to take Hoffman's petition. The court had similarly refused to intervene in the earlier nitrogen executions carried out by Alabama.

Five of the six rightwing supreme court justices voted to allow the execution to proceed, with the three liberal-leaning justices saying they would have halted it. The sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, said he would have stayed the killing to give time to consider Hoffman's religious objections.

Shortly after the execution had been confirmed, Hoffman's attorney Cecelia Kappel bemoaned what she called the “senseless” killing of a man whom she said had changed beyond recognition from the 18-year-old who had committed the rape and murder. “He was a father, a husband, and a man who showed extraordinary capacity for redemption,” she said.

Kappel criticised the Republican governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, who had provided the impetus behind the resumption of capital punishment in the state. Louisiana last carried out an execution 15 years ago.

“Governor Landry says he is doing this for the victims, but we have heard directly from victim family members that killing Jessie will not bring them peace,” Kappel said.

Andy Elliott, the husband of Hoffman's victim, said that the execution had been “bittersweet”. “There is relief that this long nightmare is finally over, but also renewed grief for Molly and sadness for Mr Hoffman's family whose nightmare began when mine did.”

Hoffman's death marks the spread of the controversial technique of nitrogen gas as a killing method. His lawyers had argued that the procedure, which involves piping pure nitrogen through a gas mask to induce fatal oxygen deprivation, would violate the prisoner's constitutional rights by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment.

The four previous executions carried out using nitrogen in Alabama led to distressing scenes in the death chamber. Eyewitnesses reported that Kenneth Smith shook violently, and writhed and convulsed on the gurney.

Hoffman's lawyers also argued that death by nitrogen hypoxia – forcing the condemned man to breathe only nitrogen – would interfere with his religious practices as a Buddhist. They said that meditative breathing at the time of death was integral to the religion.

Louisiana also faces questions about how it got hold of the nitrogen used in Hoffman's execution. Last year, the Guardian revealed that three of the biggest manufacturers of medical-grade nitrogen in the US had put a block on their products being used in executions.

Airgas, Air Products and Matheson Gas all took steps to prevent their nitrogen from reaching departments of correction in death-penalty states.

Yet photographs put into the public record in ongoing litigation in Louisiana show that the corrections department obtained canisters of nitrogen gas produced by Airgas, in apparent contravention of the company's strict rules. In a statement to the Guardian, Airgas said that it had been in direct contact with the department of corrections to affirm its position.

“Airgas has not and will not supply nitrogen or other inert gases to induce hypoxia for the purpose of human execution,” the company said. “We have not supplied medical grade NF nitrogen and the facility does not have any such cylinders owned by Airgas, according to our records.”

The statement added: “The department of corrections in Louisiana has acknowledged our letter prohibiting the use of any nitrogen for execution purposes.”

Before the execution went ahead, the sister-in-law of Hoffman's victim called for him to be pardoned. “Executing Jessie Hoffman is not justice in my name, it is the opposite,” Kate Murphy wrote.

Earlier on Tuesday Arkansas became the fifth state to adopt nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, after Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Arkansas currently has 25 people on its death row.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Hospital in Sumy hit as Zelenskyy says Putin has rejected full ceasefire; Ukrainian troops go on attack at Belgorod border. What we know on day 1,1120

A hospital in Sumy was bombed in a wave of attacks on Ukraine that led Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Vladimir Putin had “effectively rejected” a ceasefire – immediately after the Russian president told Donald Trump he would halt strikes against Ukraine's energy grid and infrastructure. The Kremlin said after Trump and Putin's call that the Russian president had given immediate orders for such strikes to stop.

Soon after the call, air raid sirens wailed and explosions rang out in Ukraine. Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, said “there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure”. Local reports said the city of Slovyansk was partly blacked out after power infrastructure was damaged. Zelenskyy said more than 40 Russian drones were launched by Russia. He added: “It is precisely such night attacks by Russia that destroy our energy systems, our infrastructure, the normal life of Ukrainians. Today, Putin de facto rejected the proposal for a complete ceasefire. It would be right for the world to reject in response any attempts by Putin to drag out the war.”

Zelenskyy said he would support stopping strikes on energy targets but was waiting for further information from Washington. “I think it will be right that we will have a conversation with President Trump and we will know in detail what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians. After we get details from the American president, from the American side, we will give our answer, prepare it, and our team will be ready for technical discussions.” Ukraine last week offered a full 30-day ceasefire, which Putin has rejected. Zelenskyy said: “They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that. They are not ready even for the first step, which is a ceasefire. [Putin's] whole game is to weaken [Ukraine].”

Ukraine's troops attacked along the border with Russia's Belgorod region on Tuesday, just south-east of the remaining Ukrainian positions in Kursk. The Institute for the Study of War said that, according to Russian bloggers, Ukrainian forces moved from Sumy oblast to reach south-west of Demidovka in Belgorod before they were pushed back. On Wednesday morning, the Belgorod regional governor, said the situation in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district of Belgorod “remains difficult”. Ukraine carried out up to five attacks on Tuesday using up to 200 fighters with tanks, armoured combat vehicles and demolition vehicles, the Russian defence ministry said. Kyiv did not comment.

Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said early on Wednesday that a Ukrainian drone attack set fire to an oil complex near the village of Kavkazskaya. Nasa Firms satellite fire monitoring showed a fire at a petroleum pipeline facility matching the description. Thirty employees were evacuated and “the work at the facility has been suspended”, the local administration said. The Russian Shot Telegram channel posted video of fires at what it described as the Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point.

Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said that it was suspending flights from airports at Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Nizhnekamsk, all hundreds of kilometres east of Moscow, to “ensure air safety”, which usually happens when there are reports of drone attacks.

Zelenskyy on Tuesday said Ukrainian troops were still fighting in Russia's Kursk region and would stay there “as long as we need”, following days of Russian advances in the area. “Ukraine is fulfilling its task in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian military are there.”

Olaf Scholz, the outgoing German chancellor, said at a news conference in Berlin with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that ending Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure would be “a good start” and first step but “there cannot be an agreement without Ukraine”. “The next step must be a complete ceasefire for Ukraine and as quickly as possible.” Macron said: “We have been promoting peace since day one and that cannot be achieved without Ukraine taking part in talks.”

Germany's parliament voted in favour of unleashing historic levels of spending to boost its military against Russian aggression. The incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and his party joined with likely coalition partners to create a €500bn fund and relax Germany's rules on government debt.

The Kremlin said Russia and Ukraine would exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday, and Russia would also hand over to Ukraine 23 badly wounded soldiers.

The US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that more talks with Russia on the Ukraine war would take place on Sunday in Jeddah. He told told Fox News: “The devil is in the details. We've got a team going to Saudi Arabia, led by our national security adviser [Mike Waltz] and our secretary of state [Marco Rubio], and I think, you know, we've got to figure out those details.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The extraordinary demands of the Russian leader to weaken Ukraine would make a mockery of any peace deal

Donald Trump began his conversation with Vladimir Putin with a simple demand: a 30-day ceasefire on land, sea and air which Ukraine has already signed up to, as an initial measure on which to build towards a peace.

Instead, what the US president got from Putin were questions, half-offers and limited concessions – and, above all, an extraordinary demand from the Russian leader to weaken Ukraine that would make a mockery of any peace agreement.

The “key condition” for resolving the conflict, the Kremlin said in a statement after the call, should be “the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv”.

That means halting military support not just from the US but from all Ukraine's foreign backers, including Britain, France and all those putting together plans for a post-conflict “reassurance force” intended to provide a long-term security guarantee to Kyiv, allowing it to open its ports and airports, and safeguard utility supplies.

It is nowhere near a position Ukraine can accept. Kyiv has spent three years fighting off Russia, incurring tens of thousands of casualties and successfully preventing a full takeover of the country – albeit for loss of around a fifth of its territory, which it accepts it cannot win back through fighting.

So bold is the demand, it is hard to believe that Putin is entirely serious. “It sounds like the Russians are projecting their desires,” said Matthew Savill, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, simply describing the Kremlin position as “incompatible” with the European-led security plan.

It is not yet clear how far Trump pressed the full 30-day ceasefire proposal, negotiated a week earlier with Ukraine by his secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Lord Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, said: “We need to know how Trump reacted to it. But I can only assume it was designed to ensure a Zelenskyy rejection, taking the pressure off Putin.”

Key European leaders did not appear too impressed either. France and Germany's leaders, hosting a press conference, reiterated their continuing support for Ukraine. “We will continue to support the Ukrainian army in its war of resistance,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said, speaking alongside Germany's Olaf Scholz.

What Trump did obtain was something considerably more modest than a full ceasefire: an immediate commitment from Putin to cease bombing Ukraine's energy infrastructure if Kyiv would “mutually refrain” from similar attacks of its own.

Over the past three years, Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukraine's power plants to the point where there is little energy generation left that is not nuclear, too risky for even Moscow's forces to attack. Ukraine, meanwhile, is being asked to halt a destabilising campaign of refinery attacks in the Russian rear that probably has some way to run – though any cooling of hostilities has to be welcomed.

Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine expert at the Chatham House thinktank, adds that the arrival of spring means that Kyiv gains relatively little from a 30-day halt to energy attacks. She described Putin's offer as “a kind of goodwill gesture to keep Trump interested and get a bigger prize: [the] US abandoning Ukraine”.

Nevertheless, the White House said both sides would begin “technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire”. Trump himself added that came “with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire” though this latter point was obscured by Russia.

Instead, the Kremlin emphasised that Ukraine would remain shut out from the talks. “The leaders confirmed their intention to continue efforts to achieve a Ukrainian settlement in a bilateral mode,” negotiations that also restore legitimacy to a country whose aggression and war crimes had left it isolated and sanctioned by the west.

The positive is that talks continue, though the concern must be that Russia will use them to try to detach the US from Europe. In the meantime, Trump and Putin did also agree to organise ice hockey matches between players in the American and Russian leagues. The puck, at least, does not stop here.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

International rules of combat to deter impact on noncombatants have been loosened or ignored – and other regimes may follow

It is a casualty rate that would have unimaginable before the start of the Israel-Hamas war. More than 400 Palestinians have been reported killed after 10 hours of resumed Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday, including, according to one early report, at least six members of one family in an attack on a car east of Khan Younis.

Though it is too soon to determine how many noncombatants died in attacks that Israel says were directed at Hamas military commanders and political officials (casualty totals from Gaza's health ministry do not distinguish combatants from the uninvolved), the likelihood is that civilians will have been killed in large numbers.

More than 7,000 incidents in which civilians were killed were recorded by the monitoring group Airwars during the previous 15-month war, a conflict in which the bombing has been so intense it has raised questions about the military doctrine of proportionality that is supposed to reduce the impact of warfare on noncombatants.

“Our analysis shows the number of casualties is far beyond anything we have seen from comparative air campaigns in the last decade,” says Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, which has monitored the impact of bombing campaigns in wars for more than 10 years.

International humanitarian law, underpinned by the Geneva conventions, is intended to act as a check on armed conflict. Parties in war are expected to adhere to the principle of distinction between militaries and civilians, and the principle of proportionality. Attacks against military objectives which cause excessive civilian casualties relative to the advantage gained are, in theory, a war crime.

Hamas showed no respect for distinction or proportionality in the 7 October attack in which about 1,200 were killed. Six months after, Israel's social security agency said 814 civilians had been killed, 39 of them children, in brutal attacks on the Nova music festival, where an estimated 365 people were killed, and at Nahal Oz and other kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip.

Israel's military response has been ferocious, leading to the deaths in Gaza of more than 49,000 people – civilians and military personnel – about 59% of whom were women, children or elderly, according to Palestinian health authorities. These figures are so high they raise questions of their own.

“Even without looking at specific incidents, it becomes hard to see how harm may have been mitigated towards civilians and how the principles of distinction and proportionality were applied,” said Anna Gallina, a specialist international humanitarian lawyer with Global Rights Compliance.

In some incidents, the number of civilian casualties is extraordinary. At least 126 Palestinians are recorded to have been killed in the bombing of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp on 31 October 2023. The target, in an attack that took place with no warning, was Hamas's northern commander, Ibrahim Biari, and an underground base, Israel's military said. Craters 40ft deep were left behind.

There is also ample evidence to suggest the Israeli military relaxed its own rules of engagement. Reports in Israeli publication +972 magazine and the Guardian, citing sources within the IDF, said it was deemed permissible to kill up to 15 to 20 civilians when attacking a person identified as a junior Hamas operative and 100 for a commander.

On 25 October 2023, the IDF struck a block above what it said was a “Hamas terror tunnel” multiple times. The attack destroyed the al-Taj residential building, and 101 people (44 children, 37 women, 26 men) were counted by Airwars as killed.

When Israel dramatically increased its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon last September after nearly a year of tit-for-tat cross-border strikes, 492 civilians and military were reported by Beirut as killed in a single day. A few days later 73 were killed when a six-storey apartment block was destroyed by Israeli missiles in the village of Ain el-Delb. Six victims were identified as having links to Hezbollah.

Craig Jones, the author of a study of military lawyers, said that while Nato militaries, in the US under the former president Joe Biden, and particularly in Europe, have become increasingly cautious about the risks of civilian casualties, “Israel has gone 180 degrees in the opposite direction” during the Gaza war.

Britain, by contrast, is particularly cautious. The UK military says it operates a policy of no civilian casualties. Though the RAF's claim that its bombing raids have only caused one civilian death during the war against Islamic State has been repeatedly challenged, former insiders say the commitment to avoid civilian harm was genuine.

“If it was thought there would be any civilian casualties then the strike would be aborted even if the aircraft was already in the air,” said a former UK government lawyer. “The Israelis have always been absolutely wildly different to us and this is discussed openly.”

Israel's argument is that it is fighting a different kind of war. Hamas, Israel has repeatedly argued, deliberately erased civilian-military distinctions throughout the conflict. It accuses the Palestinian group of locating command centres in tunnel networks below buildings such as hospitals in Gaza's dense urban environment, while its besieged 2.3 million citizens had nowhere to escape.

A former IDF military lawyer, who asked not to be named, asked how the British would act if the UK was invaded. “This was a war we thought we could lose – and when you are under direct attack, it was very important to get rid of the main commanders of Hamas.” Because the threat was considered existential, it justified an alternative approach, the former lawyer added.

Key western allies – the UK and US – have not concluded that Israel has violated the doctrine of proportionality. A letter from David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, to the foreign affairs committee from January said it had “not been possible to make an assessment of Israel's compliance with the principle of proportionality” because of “the opaque and contested information environment in Gaza”.

Last May, a leaked US state department review requested by Biden on whether countries receiving US arms were using them “in accordance with international humanitarian law” concluded that a determination was not possible because “Israel has not shared complete information” about its decision-making processes.

“What we have seen is that there's been no accountability for this gross widening of the whole concept of proportionality,” said Dearbhla Minogue, a human rights lawyer with Global Legal Action Network. “You could imagine it loosening other militaries' standards in future conflicts.”

Donald Trump's administration, which says it was consulted before Israel's overnight assault, has made clear it is strongly pro-Israel. At the same time, the US is rewriting its own rules. Earlier this month, Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, moved to cut positions of those who work to mitigate and assess risks to civilians – and began an overhaul of US military lawyers aimed at loosening the rules of engagement.

On Saturday, the US military bombed the Houthis in Yemen, killing 53 and wounding 98 according to the Houthi health ministry, including women and children. By contrast, five were reported killed and six injured in joint US-UK air raids on the Houthis in mid-January 2024. Early indications are that the US doctrine is already changing in practice.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney says deal on ‘over the horizon' radar is part of effort to assert Canada's sovereignty over Arctic as US priorities shift

The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, has announced a C$6bn deal (A$6.6bn) with Australia to develop an Arctic radar system, warning that Canada must take more responsibility for its defence as US priorities shift.

Carney made the announcement on Tuesday in Iqaluit, capital of the Nunavut territory in the Canadian Arctic, on the final leg of his first official trip as prime minister since taking over from Justin Trudeau last week.

Carney – who has previously described the US under President Donald Trump as a country Canada “can no longer trust” – characterised the radar deal as part of a broader effort to assert Canadian sovereignty over the Arctic.

“The world is changing,” Carney said in Iqaluit, where he made a domestic stop after visits to Paris and London.

“International institutions and norms that have kept Canada secure are now being called into question. And the United States's priorities, our ally, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,” he said.

“We cannot and should not look first to others to defend our nation.”

Australia is a leader in “over-the-horizon” radar, an advanced system that allows for continuous threat-tracking over a vast area.

“The radar system's long-range surveillance and threat tracking capabilities will detect and deter threats across the North,” Carney's office said in a statement announcing the deal.

The new network will replace an ageing cold war-era North Warning System, which relies on radar stations from Alaska to northern Quebec that are incapable of responding to modern missile threats.

Ottawa will also invest an additional C$420m to boost Canada's year-round military presence in the far north.

“Securing Canada is an absolute strategic priority of this government,” Carney said. “We will need to do more.”

Funding for enhanced Arctic radar was announced under Trudeau, but the decision to partner with Australia was unveiled on Tuesday.

Canada made Arctic security a priority before Trump returned to office, amid concern about possible Russian aggression as melting ice caused by climate change increasingly opens the region for resource extraction.

But Trump's repeated questioning of Canadian sovereignty has sparked renewed focus on national defence in Canada, which once viewed its security ties with Washington as iron-clad.

Canada's defence minister, Bill Blair, this month announced plans for three new Arctic military hubs with airstrips and equipment depots.

New Canadian prime ministers typically make calling the American president a first priority after taking office, but with the countries fighting a trade war initiated by Trump's tariffs, it remains unclear when Carney and Trump will speak.

Carney said on Tuesday he would have a “comprehensive” discussion with Trump about trade “at the appropriate time”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

With more teams to qualify than ever we take a look at the situation in the six confederations, from Japan being close to securing their place to Brazil's struggles

The road to the 2026 World Cup, an unprecedented 48-team event, is under way. The finals, hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, expands to 104 matches in 16 cities. Here is all you need to know about the diverse qualification paths for each confederation, key matches and emerging contenders.

Number of spots Eight plus possibly one via intercontinental playoff, up from six in 2022

Format Qualification features five rounds. Initially, 20 lower-ranked teams competed, followed by 36 teams in group stages. The top two from 18 teams in round three will qualify directly. Subsequent rounds determine further qualifiers via group play and playoffs, culminating in inter-confederation playoffs.

Latest With the third round under way Japan is on course becoming the first country (excluding hosts) to qualify in what will shape up to be a two-year qualification process for AFC teams. A victory against Bahrain in Saitama on Thursday will secure Hajime Moriyasu's side's spot as they hold a 10-point lead over third-placed Indonesia in Group C with four games to go. The race for the other qualification spots in Group C is tight, with Australia in second, one point ahead of Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and China. In Group A, Qatar's Almoez Ali is the top scorer across all confederations with 12 goals and the 2022 hosts need a win against North Korea to keep their automatic qualification hopes alive. Group leaders Iran will be close to qualification if they secure a victory against the United Arab Emirates in Tehran. South Korea, leading Group B and with the most World Cup appearances by an Asian country (11), can qualify with a win against Oman and at least a point against Jordan, both matches being played at home.

Key fixtures during this international break:

Iran v UAE, 20 March

South Korea v Jordan, 25 March

Number of spots Nine plus possibly one via intercontinental playoff, up from five in 2022

Format Qualification features two rounds. First, 53 teams are competing in nine groups, with each group winner qualifying. The four best runners-up will battle in playoffs: two semi-finals and a final. The playoff winner advances to the inter-confederation playoffs.

Latest In the first round, Egypt, with a four-point lead in Group A and the healthiest cushion in Caf qualifying, are unbeaten and aim to solidify their qualification bid with matches against Ethiopia and Sierra Leone with Caf's joint-top scorers Mohamed Salah and Mahmoud Trézéguet. Under Pape Thiaw, Senegal will seek to close the two-point gap on surprise Group B leaders Sudan in their match on Saturday. Nigeria, winless in Group C, and desperate to qualify after missing out in 2022, have must-win games against Rwanda and Zimbabwe under their new coach, Éric Chelle, the first non-Nigerian African to manage the Super Eagles. Morocco are Africa's highest-ranked team after their fantastic showing in Qatar and with a perfect record in Group E should face an easy route to qualification. The Afcon champions, Ivory Coast, have a one-point lead in Group F.

Key fixtures during this international break:

Niger v Morocco, 21 March

Sudan v Senegal, 22 March

Number of spots 3+3 (hosts) plus possibly two via an intercontinental playoff, up from four in 2022

Format Qualification features three rounds – the first a playoff for the four lowest-ranked teams. Then, 30 teams compete in six groups, with the top two advancing. The final 12 teams are divided into three groups; group winners qualify directly and the best two runners-up enter inter-confederation playoffs.

Latest With three automatic qualification spots already taken by the host nations, the competition for the remaining three direct places and two playoff opportunities is particularly tight. Honduras and Costa Rica are performing as anticipated, topping Group A and B respectively in the second round. Still, strong starts for Curaçao, who top Group C on goal difference thanks to Concacaf's top goalscorer Rangelo Janga suggest that the path to the World Cup may hold some unexpected twists.

No fixtures during this international break, next games in June

Number of spots: six plus possibly one via intercontinental playoff, up from four in 2022

Format Conmebol's qualification is a single, gruelling league format. All 10 nations play each other home and away. The top six teams qualify directly for the World Cup while the seventh-placed team enters the inter-confederation playoffs.

Latest With six matchdays remaining, Argentina, leading by five points, faces crucial encounters against Uruguay and Brazil. Lionel Messi will miss these matches due to injury but the defending champions need seven points from their remaining 18 to secure qualification. Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, in second, will face his native Argentina, aiming to maintain their recent scoring form after a goal drought late last year meant they went four matches without finding the net. Brazil, sitting fifth and without Neymar, have been inconsistent but will hope Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton's recent historic trophy win with Newcastle will provide a boost. While Chile remain in contention for seventh place, Bolivia and Venezuela are the primary contenders for the playoff spot, each seeking a notable World Cup appearance: Bolivia's first since 1994 and Venezuela's inaugural qualification.

Key fixtures during this international break:

Number of spots One plus possibly one via intercontinental playoff, up from zero in 2022

Format In the first of three rounds, four lowest-ranked teams compete in a knockout tournament. The winner joins seven top teams in two groups, playing once each. The top two from each group advance to a final knockout round where the winner qualifies directly and the runner-up enters inter-confederation playoffs.

Latest Oceania's guaranteed World Cup spot will be decided in crucial matches with New Caledonia facing Tahiti, and New Zealand playing Fiji in the semi-finals. New Zealand, favoured due to their experience and ranking, topped Group B with a perfect record, while New Caledonia led Group A with two wins and a draw. Fiji will be without their captain and all-time top scorer, Roy Krishna, who misses out after succumbing to injury with the Indian side Odisha. Rob Sherman's side, made up of amateurs who work as police officers and construction workers, face the daunting task of keeping out the in-form Chris Wood for New Zealand.

Key fixtures during this international break:

New Caledonia v Tahiti, semi-final, 21 March

New Zealand v Fiji, semi-final, 21 March

Final, 24 March

Number of spots 16, up from 13 in 2022

Format Fifty-four teams are divided into 12 groups for the first round, playing home and away. Group winners qualify directly while the second round features 12 runners-up and four top Nations League group winners who missed direct qualification. These 16 teams are split into four playoff paths, each with semi-finals and a final, with the four final winners securing qualification.

Latest The first round group stage begins during this international break, with Thomas Tuchel getting his first taste as England head coach in Group K, facing Albania and Latvia in the initial fixtures. The group stage, which continues up until November 2025, has a staggered start with five-team groups, such as England's, beginning this month while four-team groups, involving Nations League quarter-finalists, start in September. Wales face Kazakhstan, Scotland play Belarus and Greece in their early matches, while Northern Ireland await their start. Liechtenstein, one of the smallest countries aiming for a spot at the 2026 World Cup, will hope for an upset in a tough group with Belgium, Wales, North Macedonia and Kazakhstan.

Key fixtures during this international break:

England v Albania, 21 March

Wales v Kazakhstan, 22 March

Poland v Malta, 24 March

The final two spots will be decided through a tournament that will take place in one of the host countries in March 2026. This six-team, single-elimination event will include one team from the AFC, Caf, Conmebol and OFC, along with two teams from Concacaf (the host confederation receives an additional entry). The six teams will be ranked on their Fifa world ranking. The four lowest-ranked teams will compete in two semi-finals, while the two highest-ranked teams will receive a bye o the finals. Winners of the two semi-finals will then face the two seeded teams and the winners of these matches will secure the last two places at the 2026 World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Police arrested dozens of people, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who was expected to be the opposition party's presidential candidate.

Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul's mayor and a high-profile member of the opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was arrested along with dozens of others Wednesday, state-run media reported, in what critics called a significant escalation of the government's crackdown on dissent.

The chief public prosecutor's office ordered the arrest of about 100 people Wednesday, saying Imamoglu and others faced allegations such as being members of a criminal organization, bribery, aggravated fraud and unlawful acquisition of personal data. More than 80 people had been detained so far, local media reported.

Imamoglu, a popular politician and member of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, became mayor of Turkey's largest city in 2019 and won reelection last year in high-profile races where he defeated candidates from Erdogan's ruling party. He was expected to be selected as the CHP's candidate for president in the party's primary elections scheduled for this weekend.

The statement from the prosecutor's office accused Imamoglu of using his position to lead profit-making schemes, including improperly awarding contracts for government works, and also accused him of aiding the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant Kurdish group considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and others.

Imamoglu denied the allegations against him in a video released on his X account just before his detention and said in a separate social media statement that “the will of the people cannot be silenced through intimidation or unlawful acts.” Ozgur Ozel, leader of the CHP, described the arrest as a “coup attempt against our next president.”

Some of Imamoglu's close aides and Istanbul's Sisli and Beylikduzu district mayors were among the arrested, according to Turkish media reports.

Gokhan Gunaydin, lawmaker and the CHP's group deputy chairman, told The Washington Post that it was not immediately clear whether Imamoglu would be released while under investigation or kept in detention, but that the charges against him were “slanderous,” and “anyone who has a conscience”  knows  the arrest was politically motivated.

The Turkish lira and stock market plunged after Imamoglu's arrest. The lira suffered a decline of more than 10 percent, while stocks fell more than 5 percent in value.

Speaking at a televised news conference, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the investigation was carried out rigorously and warned against street protests, criticizing those who used “terms such as ‘coup'” to describe the arrests. Erdogan's communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, wrote on social media that critics were subjecting the president to a “smear campaign.”

Prosecutors have also accused Imamoglu of assisting the PKK through his alleged links to the Peoples' Democratic Congress (HDK), an alliance of left-wing and pro-Kurdish groups. In 2024 local elections the pro-Kurdish DEM Party and the CHP reached an informal agreement where they avoided directly competing with each other in many constituencies.

Turkey's next presidential election is scheduled for 2028, and analysts have said Erdogan may look to extend his rule then.

Access to multiple social media platforms, including X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, appeared to be restricted in Turkey on Wednesday morning, according to cybersecurity monitoring group NetBlocks. Meanwhile, Istanbul's governor issued a statement Wednesday banning demonstrations for four days, and closed major roads and several metro stations to block any potential protest.

Despite this, supporters of Imamoglu  gathered in the streets of Istanbul, protesting near Istanbul University and clashing with police, and protesting outside the CHP headquarters in Ankara, the capital. The Istanbul city council, which was  led by Imamoglu, called for a protest outside the municipal building Wednesday evening.

The latest arrests came a day after Imamoglu's diploma was annulled by Istanbul University, which cited irregularities in Imamoglu's transfer from a northern Cyprus university more than 30 years ago. The move could effectively block Imamoglu from running in the presidential election, as a university degree is required to compete in elections under Turkish law. The CHP called the annulment a politically motivated move, and Imamoglu is expected to challenge the decision in court.

Imamoglu has been charged in multiple cases and was sentenced in 2022 to more than two years in prison for “insulting public figures.” His appeal in that case is ongoing, according to the Associated Press.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The move comes as Europe scrambles to strengthen its security amid concerns over U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump.

BERLIN — German lawmakers passed a mammoth spending plan Tuesday that could allow for up to $1 trillion in defense and infrastructure investments over the next decade.

The package amends the country's constitution to relax strict limits on debt that have long constrained German spending, as European countries, questioning the reliability of U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump, rush to strengthen their defenses. It's part of a push to rearm across the continent, where leaders are seeking to prepare for Russian threats and American unpredictability.

The temporary U.S. suspension of Ukraine aid following the Oval Office clash last month between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prodded German officials to accelerate a rethink of the country's tightly drawn purse strings.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday that the continent should aim to “have rearmed and developed the capabilities to have credible deterrence” in the next five years.

Claudia Major, a senior vice president of the U.S.-based German Marshall Fund, said the vote shows the threat Germans see in an aggressive Russia and a retreating United States.

“If you consider the amount of money Germany is putting there — Germany, a country that is so addicted to a balanced budget — that shows how seriously the incoming coalition is taking the current challenges,” she said. “This is about survival.”

Under the plan approved by the Bundestag, defense spending above 1 percent of gross domestic product would be exempted from Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt brake. Proponents of the brake, which limits the structural budget deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP except in emergencies, cherish it as a pillar of Germany's signature fiscal responsibility. Critics call it a fiscal straitjacket.

Lawmakers also approved a $533 billion infrastructure fund. Financed by borrowing, it's to be invested in Germany's crumbling infrastructure over the coming 12 years in the hope of boosting a stagnant economy.

“The special fund for infrastructure and the defense package are linked because total defense obviously requires functioning infrastructure,” Major said. “If your tank, your rocket launcher or your soldier is not able to move to the eastern flank in Poland because a bridge or train is breaking down, then you have an issue, to put it mildly.”

The European Commission, the European Union's executive branch, will propose establishing a mechanism for joint purchasing of weapons to help the bloc's 27 nations pool demand and reinforce stocks, von der Leyen said Tuesday. The proposal, one of several to encourage a military spending spree, is to be hashed out by E.U. member states.

European countries “need to be able to fully rely on European defense supply chains, especially in times of urgent need,” von der Leyen said. “A European market would deliver that.”

The German vote Tuesday sends a “very clear message” that the country “is determined to invest massively in defense,” she said.

The vote followed a heated debate in the Bundestag. The loudest criticism came from the far left and the far right.

Members of the leftist-populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance were reprimanded by Bundestag Vice President Petra Pau for holding up banners bearing the words “1914 as in 2025: No to war loans.”

Friedrich Merz, expected to be Germany's next chancellor, said such huge sums of debt can be justified only under “very extraordinary circumstances.” He told lawmakers the criteria have been met.

“The circumstances are determined above all by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Europe,” Merz said. “Our friends in the E.U. are looking to us just as much as our adversaries,” he added, and the package was the “first major step toward a European defense community.”

Merz's conservative Christian Democratic Union and its sister party, the Christian Social Union, having won a plurality of seats in last month's federal election, are holding coalition talks with the Social Democratic Party.

The likely coalition partners were keen to push the changes through the outgoing parliament Tuesday, as attaining the required two-thirds majority, with the help of the Greens, was more feasible in the current constellation. Once the newly elected parliament convenes — no later than March 25 — their majority will be lost to electoral gains by the far-right Alternative for Germany and the Left party. Both parties oppose the changes.

In a concession to the Greens, the conservatives and the Social Democrats agreed that just over $100 billion from the infrastructure investment fund would be directed to climate-related projects. The defense spending exemption was expanded to cover funding for civil defense, intelligence agencies, cyberdefense and aid for Ukraine.

“This is about total defense,” Major said. “It's a larger understanding of security and defense — not only military — because the threats to Germany, the threats to Europe, are not only military. They are also in the gray zone,” such as sabotage and disinformation, she said.

A survey of German voters published by Infratest Dimap this month suggested that public support for more defense spending is also high. According to the poll, 66 percent said they were in favor of more defense spending; 20 percent said it should stay the same, while 11 percent said Germany should spend less on defense.

The defense deal opens the way for Germany to release an additional $3.3 billion in support for Ukraine, bringing the total aid for 2025 to $7.3 billion. Germany is the second-largest provider of military and financial aid to Ukraine after the U.S.

The Bundesrat, Germany's upper house of parliament, will vote on the package Friday.

For years, Germany was lambasted by the U.S. — particularly the first Trump administration — for failing to spend 2 percent of its annual economic output on defense. Only last year, under outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz, did the country reach the NATO goal for the first time since the Cold War, mostly on the back of a special fund of 100 billion euros. The fund was announced days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago to boost the country's mothballed Bundeswehr, or armed forces. It is set to dry up by the end of 2027 — two years before German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the country should be “fit for war.”

At an air base near France's border with Germany on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his country would order more Rafale fighter jets and invest 1.4 billion euros (about $1.53 billion) in upgrading the base to host two squadrons equipped with nuclear missile technology, making it part of the country's deterrence by 2035.

E.U. leaders are set to discuss defense and Ukraine plans when they meet Thursday in Brussels. Earlier this month, they endorsed plans to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in extra defense spending in the coming years. While decisions will ultimately be up to individual states, the E.U. plans include a $150 billion loan program for investments — such as in air and missile defense, artillery and drones — and some loosening of fiscal rules for defense spending.

Gustav Klimt's portrait of an African prince, painted when his people were displayed in a “human zoo,” was first dismissed because it didn't “look like a Klimt.”

An oil painting of an African prince created by the Austrian master Gustav Klimt, unearthed in recent years and almost dismissed for not looking like one of his more famous works, is now on sale for $16.32 million (15 million euro).

The 1897 oil painting named after its subject, Prince William Nii Nortey Dowuona, was first displayed at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, this past Thursday and already has several interested parties, including a museum and private buyers, said Lui Wienerroither, co-owner of Wienerroither & Kohlbacher, the gallery selling the piece.

“Klimt gives him such a dignity and warmth,” Wienerroither said of the prince in a phone interview with The Washington Post. “It's showing a turning point in his oeuvre.”

The image was painted the same year Klimt founded what became known as the Vienna Secession movement, in which he and other artists split from the Austrian art establishment's conservative style.

Wienerroither said the value of the painting was not immediately apparent when the current owners walked into his gallery carrying a photograph of it in 2023. A young gallery assistant initially sent them away, believing the image — which was covered in dirt at the time — didn't “look like a Klimt,” he said.

“It was not imaginable that this was a Klimt, it was very dirty,” Wienerroither said. But after his co-owner, Ebi Kohlbacher, tracked the couple down at a coffee shop near the gallery, Wienerroither called his friend and colleague, art historian Alfred Weidinger, who said he had been “searching for this painting for twenty years,” having known of its existence through a black-and-white photograph, Wienerroither said.

The portrait's subject, the prince, was one of around 120 members of the Osu tribe, part of the Ga people, from what is now modern-day Greater Accra in Ghana, Weidinger said in a statement this month. The prince had traveled to Vienna to take part in a “Völkerschau,” a type of exhibition that was popular across Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and often featured people and animals put on display, said Weidinger, who is also executive director at the OÖ Landes-Kultur GmbH, a cultural institution in Austria.

An Austrian zoo worker had — with the support of British colonial administrators in Africa — recruited the prince and members of his tribe to be displayed in Vienna, Weidinger said. After a 53-day journey, the prince and the group took part in a “guest performance”  in Austria's Tiergarten am Schüttel from April to  October 1897, watched by around 10,000 people each day, Weidinger said.

Marie Rodet, an expert in West African history at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said those taking part in “human zoos” were “probably exploited” and left with little choice. She said two types of exhibitions were popular across Europe at the time: those run by states to showcase colonial exploits, and commercial ventures.

“These people were dehumanized in these exhibitions; they were used and exploited, and in a context in which actually it was almost about affirming the superiority of the White race over the rest of the world,” she told The Post, adding such shows were designed to showcase “power.”

It was during this period the prince's portrait was painted by Klimt and fellow Austrian artist Franz Matsch from different angles, Weidinger said, adding it was unclear if this was done on a whim or as part of an established practice. The location of the painting is unknown, he said.

Weidinger said the fact that Klimt's painting remained unsigned, while Matsch's had his signature and a frame, suggests that a potential client may have chosen Matsch's version.

The painting features a stamp that shows the painting is “almost certainly from the estate of Gustav Klimt,” Weidinger added. It was auctioned in Vienna in May 1923 and sold to a wealthy family, but they fled the country when the Nazis came to power in Austria in 1938, leaving their home abandoned. The painting was later revealed to have been part of a private collection since the 1950s, according to Weidinger.

Klimt was a key figure in Vienna's art nouveau movement, perhaps best known for “The Kiss” (1907-1908). This past April, his “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” — a vivid painting of a woman believed to be Henriette Lieser, who was deported and killed by the Nazis — sold for $32 million after it was rediscovered nearly 100 years after being painted.

Wienerroither said the 1897 painting has all the hallmarks of Klimt's early work, including emerging floral forms, which became a feature of his later paintings, such as “Portrait of Sonja Knips” (1898).

Wienerroither described the price tag for the prince's portrait as “very reasonable” for a work he said he had seen move someone to tears.

“It is touching, because you feel this is a person you know,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

For Palestinians, the renewed strikes brought a sudden return to the carnage and terror of the 15-month-long war.

JERUSALEM — Israel pummeled the Gaza Strip with airstrikes Tuesday, killing more than 400 people, injuring hundreds more and shattering a two-month-old ceasefire that, for a time, brought both a measure of calm to the war-battered enclave and the release of nearly three dozen Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas and other Palestinian militants.

The Israeli military and Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security service, said in a statement early Tuesday that they were conducting “extensive strikes” on purported Hamas targets in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the Israel Defense Forces to “take strong action” against the militants, according to a statement from his office, accusing Hamas of rejecting multiple proposals from mediators to release the remaining hostages.

Those proposals aimed to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, which expired March 1. Israel and Hamas agreed to a three-stage truce in January and were supposed to begin hashing out the second phase of the agreement — including a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — last month.

But Israel dragged its feet, delaying substantive talks, as Netanyahu sought to keep his shaky governing coalition, which includes right-wing hawks keen on continuing the war, from falling apart.

“From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing intensity. Negotiations will take place only under fire,” Netanyahu said Tuesday night in a televised address.

“This is just the beginning,” he added. “Military pressure is a necessary condition for the release of the hostages.”

For the roughly 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, the strikes brought a sudden return to the carnage, terror and displacement that shaped their lives in the 15 months leading up to the ceasefire.

The last two months of relative calm allowed many displaced people to return home and take stock of the damage. As humanitarian relief flowed in, Gazans reunited with relatives and neighbors, buried their dead, and started the process of trying to heal.

A little more than two weeks ago, however, Israel said it was blocking all food, aid and other supplies from entering the enclave. The move sent prices of basic goods soaring, and aid agencies condemned Israel for what they said was an act of collective punishment.

Then, on Tuesday, the bombardment began shortly after 2 a.m. local time, before the predawn Ramadan meal of suhoor, when families gather to eat before resuming their daily fasts.

Salma Kaddoumi, 35, a citizen journalist living in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, said she was preparing suhoor when suddenly “we heard a huge explosion and our house shook.” At first, she thought a gas cylinder had exploded — but then the booms sounded again and again, from all directions.

Momentary quiet descended only when the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for neighborhoods along the enclave's perimeter, she said, sparking fear among Gazans of yet another ground invasion and leaving many wondering where they could safely go.

The ongoing air and artillery assault killed at least 404 people and injured nearly 600, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The daily toll was one of the war's highest, and the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement that more than 130 children had been killed, “representing one of the largest single-day child death tolls in the last year.”

Before Tuesday's strikes, the Gaza Health Ministry reported that more than 48,577 people in Gaza had been killed and 112,041 people injured since the war began Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and allied fighters from Gaza streamed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Israel had consulted the U.S. administration about the strikes. “As President Trump has made it clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek to terrorize not just Israel, but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay,” Leavitt said.

Israel informed the United States ahead of the attack, and U.S. officials “supported it — because justice is on our side,” said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, who was speaking to leaders from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee during a meeting in Jerusalem on Tuesday.

The strikes across Gaza sent injured men, women and children streaming into nearby hospitals, where rows of the dead, wrapped in bloodied shrouds, soon covered the floors, according to photos, witness testimonies and videos verified by The Washington Post.

Only 13 out of 38 hospitals across Gaza remain in service, the Health Ministry said. Feroze Sidhwa, an American surgeon working at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, said his hospital had been inundated with wounded civilians. “Mostly children,” he said. “Some women, a smattering of men.”

He had worked in the operating room all night and said he lost count of the surgeries he completed. There was a toddler with shrapnel in her brain and spleen, and a 6-year-old boy whose heart briefly stopped after he suffered grievous wounds to his belly. One of the most badly injured patients, a 29-year-old woman, was the sister of a nurse at the hospital, Sidhwa said. As the sun rose, a crowd grew outside the hospital's morgue.

Ramy Abdu, head of the newly established Palestinian Center for Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons, said an early-morning strike killed eight members of his family, among them four children — including his niece, Suwar. In a recent photo Abdu shared on X, the little girl, wearing tennis shoes with pink laces and a red sweater, sits with a slight smile in the ruins of her destroyed home.

“They believed the ceasefire was in place and that they, as civilians, were safe from any targeting,” he said. “What we are witnessing is a deliberate massacre of civilians in their homes — the work of gangs rather than regular armies.”

The casualty count was so high because Israel struck dozens of residential buildings, many of which were sheltering extended families, in the middle of the night, said Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Civil Defense.

High-ranking members of the Hamas-run government, including acting prime minister Essam Al-Da'alis and senior officials in the Justice Ministry, Interior Ministry and internal security service, were killed in the bombings, Hamas said in a statement. The Israeli military and Shin Bet alleged that they “oversaw the integration of all of Hamas' branches in Gaza and their use for terrorist purposes.”

Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allied group, said the spokesman for its military wing, known by the nom de guerre Abu Hamza, was also killed.

Hamas condemned Israel for breaking the ceasefire and warned that it could have consequences for the 59 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza — 24 of whom were believed to be alive before Tuesday's strikes.

The overnight blitz followed weeks of stalemate, and two Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, told The Washington Post that the bombardment was largely a negotiating tactic to force Hamas to soften its stance.

Israeli leaders had weighed options for renewing fighting in Gaza and applying military pressure on Hamas. Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials gathered in recent days and chose one of the options presented by the military that entailed heavy airstrikes on dozens of targets, including mid- to high-level Hamas leaders who were regrouping forces — but not the organization's most senior figures, one Israeli official said.

The other Israeli official described the military plans as “phased” and said the government was waiting to see whether the air campaign influences the negotiations before advancing to heavier attacks. “If the other side [Hamas] decides to go back to the table for genuine talks, then the IDF would stop,” the official said. “But at the moment, because all else failed, this is the opportunity.”

Later Tuesday, David Mencer, a spokesman for Netanyahu's office, offered a conflicting rationale, telling reporters the strikes were “preemptive” and launched after officials learned that Hamas was preparing to attack Israel.

The bombing was condemned by relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza, who fear that the resumption of hostilities will mean a death sentence for their loved ones in captivity.

“We are shocked, outraged, and terrified,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing most of the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, said in a statement, calling for a return to negotiations.

Egyptian and Qatari mediators were scrambling Tuesday to bring the parties back to the negotiating table, said a former Egyptian official briefed on the efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

Condemnations of Israel's attack poured in Tuesday from Arab countries, which warned that it risked reigniting a regional conflagration.

The Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen vowed to “continue military escalation in support of Gaza and the Palestinian people until the aggression stops and the siege is lifted,” referring to Israel's blockade. On Tuesday, the group fired a missile at Israel, but the air force intercepted it before it reached Israeli territory, the IDF said.

But fear of retaliatory missile fire didn't deter Israeli hostage families and their supporters from protesting a decision they see as prioritizing Netanyahu's political survival over the wishes of a majority of Israelis who support moving to the second phase of the ceasefire.

Demonstrations were underway near Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, stood along the Gaza border, in Nir Oz, on Tuesday in an effort to “physically block the return to war,” she wrote in a Facebook post, calling on Israelis to join her.

Yarden Bibas, who was released during the first phase of the ceasefire and whose wife and two young sons were killed in captivity — and became symbols of the Israeli hostages' plight — wrote on Facebook, “Israel's decision to return to fighting brings me back to Gaza, to the moments where I heard the sounds of explosions around me and where I feared for my life as I was afraid that the tunnel where I was being held would collapse.”

He added, “The military pressure endangers the hostages while an agreement brings them home.”

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

With his governing coalition facing possible collapse by the end of the month, the Israeli leader needs to lock in support from his far-right allies.

JERUSALEM — After Israel launched airstrikes against Hamas on Tuesday, killing hundreds of people in one of the deadliest days of the war, some Israeli and U.S. officials said the surprise operation came in response to the militant group's recalcitrance during recent negotiations. Others said it was to preempt an imminent attack that Hamas was plotting against Israel.

But leaders from across Israel's political spectrum and analysts say the decision to resume fighting was also influenced by the mounting domestic pressures on Benjamin Netanyahu.

In recent days, the Israeli prime minister has publicly feuded with officials from the country's security establishment, including many who favor reaching a deal with Hamas to recover all the hostages left in Gaza. He has announced his intent to fire his internal intelligence chief, prompting calls for mass street protests. And most pressing, Netanyahu is facing a March 31 deadline to corral enough votes in the Knesset to pass a national budget — or otherwise see his government forced to dissolve under Israeli law.

In resuming war, the Israeli leader not only sought to redirect the country's attention, political observers say, but also cemented a governing coalition that can help him get past his most immediate political hurdles. As Netanyahu prepared to enter delicate discussions with his coalition partners over the budget this week, some members of allied ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties threatened to withhold their votes and derail its passage. Instead, Netanyahu shored up support from far-right political parties that have insisted that he resume the war, said Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser.

“There is a military case to be made that Hamas wasn't destroyed and is in the process of reconstituting, but there is no way to divorce this from the political events,” Freilich said. “I don't think anyone can ignore the timing.”

Hours after the start of the Israeli air campaign, Itamar Ben Gvir, leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, welcomed Israel's return to “intense fighting” and announced that he would rejoin Netanyahu's government, bolstering its number of parliamentary votes. But opposition leaders — including Yair Golan, the head of the left-leaning Democrats, the centrist Yair Lapid, and Gadi Eisenkot, a key figure in the center-right National Unity party, challenged Netanyahu's decision to resume fighting and his motives for doing so. Moreover, they questioned whether the move would doom the chances of freeing the remaining hostages.

The decision also provoked a surge of anger from the families of hostages, who called for more protests. Einav Zangauker, an Israeli mother whose son is one of 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, accused Netanyahu of favoring “cheap politics over our children, brothers and sisters in captivity” and led demonstrators near the Gaza border, saying she would help form a human chain to block an Israeli ground invasion.

In response, Netanyahu said Tuesday evening that he had refrained for weeks from restarting the Israel Defense Forces offensive against Hamas in hopes that the militant group would compromise during negotiations but that it refused. Now, “military pressure is a necessary condition for the release of the hostages,” he said.

“I hear the commentators claiming that the IDF's actions are driven by political motives,” Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement. “They have no shame. They are echoing Hamas propaganda.”

Israeli officials said the planning for the strike was underway for weeks, as negotiations between Israel and Hamas showed little signs of progress.

Netanyahu had favored a proposal by President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to negotiate for the release of up to 10 living hostages instead of entering a second phase of the ceasefire, as Israel and Hamas had earlier agreed. Under the framework deal reached in January, the second phase would require the return of all Israeli hostages in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners and a permanent cessation of hostilities — something Netanyahu vowed he would not accept until Hamas was destroyed.

On Friday, Hamas proposed releasing only one living hostage — the Israeli American dual national Edan Alexander — in an offer that highlighted the size of the gulf between the two sides. Soon after, Netanyahu chose the option of launching the air campaign, which could be ratcheted up in “phases” to include a full-on ground assault, Israeli officials said.

Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. State Department official, said Netanyahu not only was motivated by domestic political considerations but also felt reassured by support from the Trump administration. After Israel launched its strikes, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Israel had consulted the United States before the operation and then used a phrase favored by Trump. “All hell will break loose,” she warned Hamas.

“What would've been a fight from the Biden administration is now welcomed by Trump,” said Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “At least on Gaza, you have nothing short of a Vulcan mind meld between Trump and Netanyahu.”

By contrast, Netanyahu has found himself at odds with his director of the Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, who has argued for putting a priority on the release of hostages over prolonging the war. On Tuesday night, an estimated 40,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv to protest Netanyahu's decision, announced Sunday, to dismiss Bar.

In recent weeks, the tensions between Bar and Netanyahu spilled dramatically into public view, with Bar's supporters — who include retired spy chiefs and army generals — and Netanyahu accusing each other of corruption, unethical behavior, disloyalty and blackmail.

Avi Melamed, a former Israeli military intelligence official, said the high-level infighting and mass protests have been ramping up the pressures on Netanyahu but would not deter him. If anything, they motivated him to keep fighting.

“At the end of the day, Netanyahu's government is hanging by a thread, and it depends on the far right,” he said. “And they have been very clearly pressuring him not to stop the war, but to resume the war.”

A university has invalidated Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu's diploma in a move widely perceived as politically motivated

ANKARA, Turkey — A university invalidated the diploma of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday, in a move widely perceived as politically motivated to block the popular opposition figure and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's key rival from running in the next presidential race.

Istanbul University nullified Imamoglu's diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its Faculty of Business Administration. The decision disqualifies Imamoglu from running for president — a position that requires candidates to hold a university degree. Imamoglu is expected to appeal.

The decision comes just days before the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is scheduled to hold a primary election, where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen as its presidential candidate. The next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but early elections are likely.

Imamoglu, 53, called the university's decision “illegal,” insisting it does not have the authority to cancel the diploma.

“The days when those who made this decision will be held accountable before history and justice are near. The march of our people, who are thirsty for justice, law, and democracy, cannot be stopped,” he wrote on X.

He later also suggested the decision was made under pressure from Erdogan's government and raised concerns about the judiciary's independence. He said however, that he planned to challenge the decision.

“What will I do next? I will keep running like a lion. There's no stepping back, I'll run even harder,” Imamoglu said.

Mansur Yavas, the mayor of Ankara and another popular CHP figure, denounced the move as a blow to democracy and announced he was suspending his own presidential candidacy until the “injustice” against Imamoglu is resolved.

“We will stand against every step that casts a shadow over the rule of law in Turkey and will continue the fight for justice and democracy,” Yavas wrote on X. “Mayor Ekrem, we are with you until the end of your rightful struggle.”

CHP legislators meanwhile, staged a protest in parliament against the decision, which also led to the cancelation of diplomas of 28 other students who similarly transferred to Istanbul University.

The decision comes during an escalating government crackdown on the opposition, including the arrest of politicians, journalists and artists and the prosecution of business leaders who criticized the government's policies.

Wolfango Piccoli, of the Teneo political risk advisory firm, said the diploma's annulment indicates that Erdogan recognizes he cannot secure an election victory.

“The decision to revoke Imamoglu's diploma goes beyond merely undermining a fair electoral race by removing the strongest opponent,” Piccoli wrote in an emailed note. “It reflects the boldness and power to dictate what is real and what is not by controlling the state apparatus.”

Imamoglu has faced a series of legal challenges. In 2022, he was convicted of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council in a case that could result in a political ban. He is appealing his conviction.

He faces multiple other lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019. His win was a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against the governing party.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

            Turkish authorities detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu – a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – on Wednesday as part of corruption and terrorism investigations.
    


            Detention orders were also issued for around 100 others connected to the mayor, including his press adviser Murat Ongun, according to state-run news agency Anadolu Agency. Among those detained are elected Istanbul district mayors Resul Emrah Sahan and Murat Calik.
    


            The move came just days before the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was scheduled to hold a primary election where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen as its presidential candidate.
    


            CHP leader Ozgur Ozel called the detention “a coup attempt against our next president.”
    


            Video from CNN Turk showed police wearing riot gear and dozens of security vehicles outside Imamoglu's home.
    


            “I am saddened to say, a handful of people who are trying to steal the will of the people, have sent the dear police, the security forces implicating them in this wrongful doing,” Imamoglu said in a video posted to X on Wednesday as he got dressed in what appeared to be a closet.
    


            “Hundreds of police officers have been sent to the door my house — the house of the 16 million people of Istanbul.”
    


            Critics denounced the detentions as politically motivated and part of an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition following Erdogan's major defeat in local and mayoral elections last year.
    


            “Making decisions on behalf of the people, using force to replace the will of the people or to obstruct it is a coup. There is currently a force in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,” Ozel said in a post on X.
    


            Following Imamoglu's detention, Istanbul's governorship suspended the right to demonstrate in the city until March 23 “to maintain public order.” It also announced the closure of some metro stops and roads in downtown Istanbul.
    


            According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, access to X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok has been restricted in the country.
    


            Meanwhile, the mayor's detention sent shockwaves through Turkey's financial markets, deepening investor fears and triggering sharp losses in the currency and stock market.
    


            The Turkish lira plunged more than 10%, trading above 40 against the dollar – its weakest level on record – as Imamoglu's detention spooked investors.
    


            Stock trading in Turkey got off to a rough start, as a sharp drop in the main BIST 100 index triggered a temporary trading halt. By 6:30 a.m. ET, the index had fallen 6.7% for the day.
    


            Imamoglu and around 100 others linked to him are accused of being members of a criminal organization, extortion, bribery and aggravated fraud, according to a statement from the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, Andadolu reported.
    


            Imamoglu is also under investigation for allegedly aiding the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), which Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations, Anadolu said, citing the prosecutor's office.
    


            Dilek Imamoglu, wife of the detained mayor, said of the accusations against her husband: “One can only laugh at such a thing.”

            “Such a thing is of course impossible,” she said, according to Reuters. “It is completely a huge slander. Everything will come out in the open anyway.”
    


            The move to detain the mayor of Turkey's largest and most populous city, a key political battleground, comes after Istanbul University said on Tuesday it had annulled Imamoglu's degree over irregularities, dealing a blow to the opposition and dashing the mayor's presidential ambitions.
    


            Without a university degree, Imamoglu would be disqualified from running for president.
    


            Imamoglu said the university's decision was illegal and outside its jurisdiction, and that he would launch a legal challenge. “The decision of the Istanbul University Board of Directors is UNLAWFUL” he said. “The days when those who made this decision will be held accountable before history and justice are near.”
    


            Imamoglu was elected mayor in 2019 and again in 2024. The next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but some analysts say Erdogan could call for early elections which would allow him to bypass term limits.
    


            “We are up against a huge bullying. But I will not back down,” the mayor said in his video message.

Follow:


            A “no” is not a “yes” when it is a “maybe,” a “probably not,” or an “only if.”
    


            This is the painfully predictable lesson the Trump administration's first real foray into wartime diplomacy with the Kremlin has dealt. They've been hopelessly bluffed.
    


            They asked for a 30-day, frontline-wide ceasefire, without conditions. On Tuesday, they got  – after a theatrical week-long wait and hundreds more lives lost – a relatively small prisoner swap, hockey matches, more talks, and – per the Kremlin readout – a month-long mutual pause on attacks against “energy infrastructure.”
    


            This last phrase is where an easily avoidable technical minefield begins. Per US President Donald Trump's post and that of his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, the agreement concerned “energy and infrastructure.” These are two entirely different sets of ideas.
    


            Russia says it will not attack Ukraine's electricity grids and gas supplies, as it has mercilessly over the past years, to the extent that Ukraine's winters have always been a dicey dance with icy families and reserve power sources. The White House, confusingly – in a disagreement, typo or translation nuance – has extended this truce to potentially every part of Ukraine that is considered infrastructure: bridges, perhaps key roads, or ports, or railways. It has created conditions that are almost impossible for Russia's relentless pace of air assaults – which resumed, as they do every night, on Tuesday night – to adhere to.
    


            Arguably, with summer close and the urgent need for Ukrainians to have heating reduced, Moscow ceasing energy infrastructure attacks is less of a concession. For Kyiv, however, the demand they stop hitting Russia's energy infrastructure removes one of the most potent forms of attack Ukraine has. For months they have used long-range drones and missiles to strike Russia's oil refineries and pipelines, causing serious damage to the Kremlin's main fundraising tool: the export of its hydrocarbons, principally to China and India. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared amenable to the idea of a pause Tuesday, but said he still needed to know the “details.”
    


            It is important to emphasize that Trump's long-heralded call with Russian President Vladimir Putin yielded almost nothing bar the predictable fact that the Kremlin head feels he can outmaneuver his counterpart effortlessly. The swap of 175 prisoners and return of 23 seriously wounded Ukrainians is a minor arrangement, and smacks of something already in the works, given the frequency of similar past swaps and the fact it is due to happen as quickly as Wednesday.
    


            Outside of this and the pause in attacks (whichever ones they agreed), Russia used this week-long delay and phone call to emphasize it wants all foreign aid and intelligence sharing halted as part of a deal and a series of “working groups” on Ukraine and Russia-US relations established. “Working groups” is a Russian diplomatic euphemism for fervid disinterest. Putin evidenced as much by apparently executing a pause in energy attacks immediately, but leaving all the stuff he didn't want to do to another set of meetings at an undefined time. Putin seems set on returning to the idea that all aid to Ukraine be stopped, something which Trump has already done once, for about a week. It will return to their conversation again.

Putin agrees to pause attacks on some Ukraine targets after Trump call



            Some of these technical traps were laid by the basic nature of the initial Jeddah statement by the US and Ukraine. It was admirable but wildly simplistic to demand an immediate month-long stop to all hostilities in a three-year savage war. The proposal did not take into account how long such a step would take to enact with soldiers often cut off from their command, and made no mention of who would monitor adherence to it.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested “satellites” could provide all the surveillance needed. That is almost certainly true, but as an idea it assumes Moscow would be happy with the United States poring over its front-line positions in great detail and being the arbiter of who violated what. A cynic might say the Jeddah proposal was geared to pander to Trump's simplistic, yet desirable, demand for immediate peace, but also allow Moscow's customary and pedantic search for loopholes to get ensnared on its lack of technicalities. And Putin immediately sought to dangle the deal's feet into these plentiful weeds.
    


            Ultimately, the Kremlin did not seek to discuss “nuances” – the finer points, for example, of whether the OSCE or the UN would police the front line – but instead offered as few concessions as it could without providing Trump with a flat “no.”
    


            But a flat “no” is what Trump has received. It is packaged as a “partial ceasefire,” but that is simply the first phase of Russia renewing its decade-long deceptive diplomacy. They have agreed to a pause in attacks that – largely from now on – will damage Moscow's bank balance. Indeed, the initial and amateur confusion over what was agreed has opened a chasm in any future peace deal wide enough for Putin to drive another full-scale invasion through. Did both sides not set staffers aside after the call to prepare an identical readout of what was agreed?
    


            The vaudeville theater of the past month should provide little comfort that the war is suddenly headed toward peace. Yes, the Trump administration has talked peace in a way that nobody has done so far in this war. But they have also managed to confirm, in short shrift, that Moscow looks for cracks of weakness and mercilessly drives a tank through them.

            Trump felt he could either persuade, coax, or outsmart Putin. He has yet to do any of that. He has palpably lost in their first direct diplomatic face-off. For millions of Ukrainians his next choice defines their lives. Does he lose interest, apply pressure, or again provide concessions? It is a dizzying prospect.
    


            His adversary is focused not on improved relations with Russia's decades-long adversary, the United States, or with its current president, Donald Trump, but instead on victory in its most existential conflict since the Nazis.
    


            These are not two similar perspectives to the deal. The art of one is more applied than the other.

FIRST ON FOX – The Biden administration buried for more than a year a final draft report that failed to prove that an increase in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals was linked to a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas emissions, according to a copy of the findings, exclusively previewed to Fox News Digital.

The Biden administration stalled the release of the information, senior Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital, delaying sharing the data with House Oversight Committee Republicans. The Daily Caller News Foundation first reported that the Biden administration ""intentionally buried"" the study. 

The impact that new U.S. LNG exports had on the environment and the economy had been reviewed by U.S. Energy Department scientists and federal contractors, who by September 2023 had completed their work and had a draft final report ready for publication.

Fox News independently reviewed a copy of that draft study, titled, ""Energy, Economic, and Environmental Assessment of U.S. LNG Exports."" That report and its findings were slated for publication in 2023 — months before then-President Joe Biden, who was still seeking re-election at the time, announced a pause on all new U.S. LNG export terminals in January 2024, citing the need to better consider environmental and economic impacts.

The draft report found that across all modeled scenarios, an increase in U.S. LNG exports and natural gas production did not change global or U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, nor did it correlate with a strong uptick in energy prices for consumers, Trump administration officials said.

""​​Secretary Granholm, and Biden White House told Americans that the increase in LNG exports would disproportionately increase prices for American consumers as well as from the environment,"" an official said.

""And both these claims were refuted in the report that the Biden administration hid from Congress and the American public,"" the official said.

A copy of the report was shared Wednesday morning with the House Oversight Committee, which had been requesting the Energy Department to share its findings on LNG since March 2024.

A September 2024 court filing from Government Accountability and Oversight (GAO) revealed that the Energy Department was conducting an LNG study in 2023, Comer's office told Fox News Digital. But DOE repeatedly declined to provide this study to the House Oversight Committee or comply with other requests for information.

""Biden Administration officials, who religiously claimed to ‘follow the science,' abandoned it to undermine American-made energy production, appease climate activists, and achieve their predetermined outcomes,"" House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. told Fox News in response to the report's release. 

""I am grateful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for providing the transparency the American people deserve and for taking action to restore America's energy dominance.""

The 2023 findings present the most definitive data to date that the Biden administration, and then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, misrepresented the impact LNG exports would have on the U.S.

At the time, Biden was facing mounting criticism from progressives in the party to scale back LNG exports, which during his term rose to an all-time high. The U.S. became the world's largest energy exporter in 2023, underpinned by new demand in the EU, following Russia's war in Ukraine, and its abrupt cutoff of nearly all piped gas supplies to the bloc.

To help alleviate the deep energy security concerns, the U.S. ramped up exports to Europe to a record-high, supplying more than 50% of their LNG, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That prompted fierce pushback from progressive Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., which put new pressure on the administration for the pause.

However, rather than come forward with the report, the Biden administration continued to stall on releasing the study and declined to comply with requests from the House Oversight Committee to testify or share their findings, Trump administration officials said.

That's far less significant than the data eventually released by the Biden administration in December 2024, after the presidential election, which suggested the rise in exports could cause consumer prices to rise by as much as 30% in the coming years.

That sparked fierce backlash from both industry groups and Republicans, who panned the study as exaggerated and failing to justify the administration's 10-month pause.

Donald Trump has proposed the US take over the running of Ukraine's energy plants “for security”, in a phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky.

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since last month's infamous White House row.

A White House statement following the call read: “President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise, American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”

Mr Zelensky hit out at Vladimir Putin over strikes on Ukraine's energy grid – which came within hours of the Russian leader's promising to halt such strikes for 30 days.

In a social media post, Mr Trump said the call was to “align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs”, as he sought to bring about a ceasefire.

“We are very much on track,” Mr Trump added.

On Tuesday, the Russian autocrat promised to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to back a complete month-long ceasefire.

An overnight Russian missile attack left part of Slovyansk city without electricity, military officials said.

The White House said President Zelensky thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian [sic] including the exchange of prisoners of war.

“President Trump also asked President Zelensky about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted, and President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home,” the White House statement said.

“They agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The presidents noted the positive work of their advisers and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg and others.

“The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire.

“The presidents instructed their advisers and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible.

“The President's emphasis on the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security.""

Ukraine's President Zelensky says he had a “positive, very substantive and frank” conversation with President Trump the first time the two leaders had spoken since Mr Trump and JD Vance verbally attacked Mr Zelensky in the Oval Office.

Mr Zelensky said he thanked the US president for a good and productive start to the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah.

The meeting significantly helped in moving toward ending the war, he said.

“We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace,” he went on.

“We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year.

“President Trump shared details of his conversation with Putin and the key issues discussed.

“One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.”

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says she will present a proposal to EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday to provide Ukraine with two million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

The bloc's diplomatic service last week circulated a discussion paper saying the EU should be prepared to go as far as doubling its military aid to Ukraine this year to 40 billion euros, but several countries made clear they were not ready to back that plan.

Now Kallas is pushing for one part of the plan to be agreed as a first step, writing in a letter addressed to EU foreign and defence ministers that two million rounds, valued at 5 billion euros, ""is available on the market and could be delivered in 2025"".

""Ukraine is relying on us to act now,"" she wrote, adding: ""I intend to present this proposal to European leaders tomorrow at the European Council meeting and stress the importance of supporting this objective.""

The US will share battlefield intelligence again with Ukraine, President Trump has told President Zelensky.

According to a White House briefing on a call between the two leaders, President Trump “fully briefed President Zelensky on his conversation with Putin and the key issues discussed.

“They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.

“President Zelensky asked for additional air defense systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, and President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.”

Two weeks ago, Mr Trump suspended intelligence-sharing for several days.

Donald Trump has proposed the US take over the running of Ukraine's energy plants, in a phone call with President Zelensky.

A White House statement following the call read: “President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants.

“He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise, American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”

Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukraine's energy infrastructure over the past three years.

Ukraine's president Zelensky has again made clear his ambition for his country of joining the EU and Nato.

After meeting Finnish politicians, including the parliament's Speaker, Mr Zelensky wrote on social media: “Our state, together with its partners, is developing a plan to achieve peace and ensure reliable security guarantees for Ukraine.

“Special attention was paid to supporting Ukraine on its path to EU and NATO membership.

“We are glad to be among friends, and I thank the Parliament and all political groups for their unanimous support of Ukraine and our people.”

The West has until now resisted Ukraine membership of Nato, as it could lead to direct war with Russia.

Donald Trump has hailed a “very good telephone call” with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which lasted around one hour.

“Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed. That Statement will be put out shortly.”

Ukrainian boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk visited a destroyed energy plant in central Ukraine, shortly before Vladimir Putin agreed to immediately halt attacks on energy infrastructure in Ukraine.

Standing among the devastation of the central Ukrainian plant, the 38-year-old heavyweight saw first-hand the effects of Russia's systematic and repeated attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in its attempt to weaken Kyiv's war effort.

Usyk visited the site on Monday, just one day before Putin agreed to temporarily halt all attacks on energy infrastructure in a phone call with US president Donald Trump on Tuesday.

In their first talks since late February, presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky will almost certainly be discussing the partial ceasefire agreed by Vladimir Putin yesterday.

The Russian autocrat agreed to halt all attacks on energy infrastructure for around a month during a phone call with Mr Trump on Tuesday.

But Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of striking energy facilities after the city of Slovyansk lost power overnight.

Moscow countered the claims, stating that it called off a drone attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and had shot down seven of its own drones. The Kremlin also accused Ukraine of targeting Russian energy targets overnight, including an alleged attack on an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya.

Mr Zelensky does not trust that Putin is an honest candidate for peace, and will likely make that clear to the US president.

Speaking on X yesterday about last night's attacks, he said: “The fact that this night is no exception shows that the pressure on Russia must continue for the sake of peace.

“Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire. It would be right for the world to respond by rejecting any attempts by Putin to prolong the war.”

Volodymyr Zelensky is currently speaking with US president Donald Trump for the first time in just under three weeks.

The last time the pair spoke produced one of the most infamous scenes in recent history, when Mr Trump and vice president JD Vance teamed up in a verbal attack of the Ukrainian president, who they accused of not showing enough gratitude to the US for its military support.

News anchors were left open-mouthed as Mr Zelensky was subsequently booted out of the Oval Office by his US counterpart, who told him not to return until he was “ready for peace”.

“You're playing cards, you're gambling with the lives of millions of people,” Mr Trump told Ukraine's war leader. “You're not in a good position right now,” Mr Zelensky was repeatedly told, in remarks which drew outrage from leaders around the world.

It kicked off when Mr Zelensky - who was officially at the White House to sign a crucial minerals deal with the US - repeatedly reiterated the need for US security guarantees in any future peace settlement, before Mr Vance accused him of not being grateful enough to the US.

President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are speaking by phone as Kyiv continues to weather attacks on energy infrastructure despite Russian leader Vladimir Putin's claim to have ordered a halt to such attacks following a phone call with Trump one day earlier.

The White House said the call would take place Wednesday morning, and White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the two leaders had been connected and were speaking as of 10:38 am ET.

Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed Wednesday's prisoner exchange, describing it as “one of the largest” which has been held.

A total of 197 Ukrainians were released from Russia, including 175 detainees and 22 who were released “through measures beyond exchanges”.

“Thank you to our Ukrainian POW [prisoner of war] search and exchange team for this important work, for the results that give hope. And we are grateful to all our partners, especially the United Arab Emirates, for making today's exchange possible,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram.

“Ukraine remembers each and every one of our heroes, and we will definitely bring all of our people home.”

President Vladimir Putin wants Donald Trump to formally recognise the four Ukrainian regions occupied by Russian forces, a Russian outlet has reported.

Putin wants his US counterpart to recognise the eastern Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which have been occupied since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, Kommersant reported, citing sources who attended a business event with Putin on Tuesday.

Moscow does not fully control any of the four regions.

The Russian autocrat also wants the US to recognise Crimea, southern land seized and annexed by Russia in 2014.

In return for recognition “in the near future”, Putin would not attempt to lay claim to the southern port city of Odesa or any other part of Ukraine, the report added.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday Putin and Trump had not discussed the idea on their Tuesday call.

14:10 , Alex Croft

Russia and Ukraine have each released 175 prisoners of war in an exchange finalised during last night's call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian Defence Ministry said.

Moscow handed over an additional 22 badly wounded Ukrainian prisoners, the ministry added, in what it says was a goodwill measure.

The deal, which will see Russian soldiers freed from Ukraine via Belarus, was mediated by the United Arab Emirates.

Political correspondent Archie Mitchell reports live from Westminster:

Downing Street has refused to say Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted after he was accused by Ukraine of attacking energy infrastructure within hours of promising to halt the strikes.

The prime minister's official spokesman would not be drawn on whether the Russian dictator can be relied on to keep his word as peace talks continue.

But the spokesman said: “That is why we are always going to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.

“We are going to support Ukraine as long as it needs, both now and in the event of a potential peace deal.

“Clearly we all want to see an end to the fighting, we share president Trump's ambitions there.

“But you've seen from Russia's barbaric war in Ukraine they will go to any extent to impose suffering on the Ukrainian people.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday he hopes President Donald Trump will increase pressure on Russian individuals and entities violating U.S. sanctions.

He made the remark at a talk in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and said Russian President Vladimir Putin will look for any possibility to avoid a full ceasefire with Ukraine.

13:15 , Holly Evans

Vladimir Putin has broken his promise to Donald Trump to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure just hours after his agreement with the US president.

In a readout of the call between the two leaders, the Kremlin said Mr Trump had requested that Russia refrain from striking energy infrastructure. It added that Mr Putin had responded “positively” to this request and had “immediately given the Russian military the corresponding command”.

But Russia fired several ballistic missiles and nearly 150 drones across Ukraine a few hours later, cutting off electricity in the eastern city of Slovyansk, damaging two medical facilities in the northeast Sumy region, and wounding people in the capital of Kyiv.

An international effort to trace and rescue tens of thousands of children kidnapped from Ukraine to Russia and prosecute those responsible has been crippled by the US state department's deletion of evidence.

The Trump administration cut funding to Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab, which was compiling a database of alleged Russian war crimes, including the abduction of an estimated 35,000 children from occupied areas of Ukraine, last month.

Using satellite imagery and other surveillance systems provided through the US government, the Yale researchers were monitoring 116 sites in Russia.

Zelensky, in a joint briefing in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, said Putin's words were not enough and that Ukraine would provide a list of energy facilities it hopes the U.S. and allies would help monitor.

""I really want there to be control. But I believe that the main agent of this control should be the United States of America,"" he said, adding that Kyiv would be ready to commit to a ceasefire.

""If the Russians will not strike our facilities, then we will definitely not strike theirs,"" Zelenskiy said.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russia had suspended its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure after a Tuesday phone call between Putin and Trump and had shot down its own Ukraine-bound drones while they were in the air.

In the call, Putin agreed to stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities temporarily but declined to endorse a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump hoped would be the first step toward a permanent peace deal.

Germany's outgoing government has agreed to release additional 3 billion euros (£2.5 billion) in military aid for Ukraine this year after lawmakers passed plans for a fiscal overhaul, a finance ministry document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.

The move is widely seen as a breakthrough after outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz had insisted on making the easing of borrowing rules a prerequisite for the additional aid.

As uncertainty grows about the future of US security guarantees under President Donald Trump, European states are under increasing pressure to show their commitment to Ukraine in its war with Russia, including with military spending.

Finance Minister Joerg Kukies has informed parliament's budget committee that the requirements for authorisation of the extra funds have been met, according to a submission to the committee from his ministry.

An exchange of 175 prisoners of war and some wounded soldiers, talks covering Iran and Israel, Russia's “legitimate interests” in the field of security and “expert groups” convened to discuss an eventual peace settlement over Ukraine. Even ice hockey games.

There was plenty of ground that presidents Trump and Putin covered during their 90-minute discussion – but only a limited ceasefire, for a month, covering energy and infrastructure, coupled with a proposal to end the flow of arms and intelligence to Ukraine. President Putin has given the least he could possibly get away with to President Trump without actually saying “nyet”. The fighting on the front line goes on.

Nothing that has emerged about Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin – one that reportedly went “very well” – suggests that the Russian president is in any hurry to settle the war he started three years ago.

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russian troops were ""completing the defeat"" of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region after a seven-month incursion by Kyiv's forces.

The incursion, which began in August, was aimed at diverting Moscow's forces from eastern Ukraine, gaining a bargaining chip in any future talks, and at riling Putin.

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have agreed to shackle Ukraine after hours of talking on the telephone over ceasefire terms, which won't work but are intended to further divide Ukraine and Europe from the White House.

“The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,” the White House said in a statement about the call.

The Kremlin added: “It was emphasised that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be a complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.”

Poland plans to plant mines on its borders with Russia and Belarus, the country's deputy defence minister has said.

""We have no other choice. The situation on the border is serious. I'm talking about the Polish-Belarusian and Polish-Russian border,” Paweł Bejda said according to European Pravda.

It will be an element of Poland's East Shield security project, he said, adding that Poland does not yet have anti-personne mines but has the “capacity to produce them”.

""This [the production of landmines] will be carried out by the factories of the Polish Armed Group, but I don't want to go into details. We're talking about an order for several hundred thousand, we can talk about a million,"" Mr Bejda said.

Vladimir Putin is “playing a game”, German defence minister Boris Pistorius has said following Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure overnight.

“I'm sure that the American president won't be able to sit and watch for much longer,” Mr Pistorius said, adding that the Kremlin's insistence that the US must end military support to Ukraine as a condition of a ceasefire is “unacceptable”.

Speaking to German broadcaster ZDF, Mr Pistorius said: ""Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated.

""This is very transparent,"" Mr Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from ""further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”.

Volodymyr Zelensky is asked about the prospect of the US withdrawing military aid to Ukraine - something Russian president Vladimir Putin has demanded as a condition for a full ceasefire.

“No one can influence the United States,” he said. “The decision is the personal decision of president Trump, in my opinion.

“Russia would like that our partners would stop helping us because that weakens the Ukrainian position,” he added.

“If you really want peace, why are you then worrying about the Ukrainian army, doing everything to weaken our army or weaken the defence of our people?”

Ukraine would never agree to the territory currently occupied by Moscow being recognised as Russian, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

Speaking in Finland, he added: “So far the Russians are not showing that their ready to finish the war. With regard to the Crimean territory, that would be one of the sensitive and complex issues.”

Moscow and Kyiv need to “cross some ground” to get towards a full ceasefire, he added.

Ukraine is considering a “complete, full ceasefire” as a step towards long-term peace, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

“Now, as a result of global efforts, we can stop Putin. We have to do it together, all of us.

“Ukraine would like to thank the American side, to thank president Trump for meeting our teams. It was a productive meeting, a good meeting. We are hoping that agreements about the ceasefire will by the end be realised, we hope that America will carry on putting pressure on Russia.

“We are considering complete, full ceasefire as one of the steps towards peace.

Volodymyr Zelensky has said Vladimir Putin's claim that Russia will halt strikes on energy infrastructure is “very different from reality”.

“Putin allegedly said he has given the order to stop strikes, but 150 drones attacked Ukraine's infrastructure, including hospitals and transport,” he said.

Russian authorities have accused Ukraine of firing dozens of drones and attacking an oil depot, hours after Vladimir Putin agreed to a limited ceasefire.

Moscow said 57 Ukrainian drones were destroyed overnight, 35 of them over the border Kursk region - but the total number launched is unclear.

A small fire was sparked in the depot near the village of Kavkazskaya and spread 20 square meters without causing any injuries. 30 employees were evacuated from the site, the administration of the Kavkazskaya region said.

Russian SHOT Telegram channel posted a video of blazes at what appeared to be an industrial area. The channel says the Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point is an important facility designed to transport Russian oil for exports railway

Vladimir Putin's promises to Donald Trump to pause Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have lasted just a few hours.

Footage is emerging online showing the devastation wrought by Russia's latest missile and drone strikes.

Ukraine's air force said Russia fired at least two ballistic missiles, four anti-aircraft guided missiles and 145 attack drones at targets across Ukraine.

The city of Slovyansk was hit by a Russian missile, knocking out the power for around 100,000 people.

In Sumy, in the northeast, two Russian drones hit a medical facility just after 1am local time, according to Ukraine's emergency services. The facility was partially destroyed. As rescuers arrived to help 22 patients trapped in the building, emergency services say Russia fired five more drones.

The blast wave also damaged the premises of a children's medical facility, local emergency services reported.

In Kyiv, two people were injured, including a 60-year-old man after drone debris fell on the city.

Below, you can see the aftermath of the Sumy strikes, posted by Ukraine's emergency services.

Sir Keir Starmer has spoken with Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ""progress President Trump had made towards a ceasefire in talks with Russia"", Downing Street said on Tuesday evening.

Giving a readout of a call between the UK prime minister and the Ukrainian president, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister spoke to President Zelensky this evening.

""They discussed progress President Trump had made towards a ceasefire in talks with Russia.

""President Zelensky updated on the situation on the front line and the prime minister reiterated the UK's unwavering support.""

Since returning to the White House in 2025, US President Donald Trump has dramatically reshaped US policy toward Russia, adopting a markedly softer stance on Vladimir Putin and the ongoing war in Ukraine. This approach has included cutting military aid to Ukraine, and pressuring Kyiv to accept unfavourable terms to end the fighting.

Trump is also weakening America's negotiating position by repeatedly and prematurely signalling the concessions the US is willing to make.

Historically, Russia has responded to strength, not appeasement. As US diplomat and historian George Kennan famously stated in his 1946 Long Telegram, the Soviet Union understood only the language of power. He was proven right – throughout and since the Cold War, Western concessions have often invigorated rather than calmed Russian aggression.

The Trump administration has slashed a government-funded initiative which tracked the mass deportation of children from Ukraine, Democratic lawmakers have said.

As part of its widespread slashes to foreign aid and US government programmes, the White House has ended the initiative at Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab (Yale HRL).

Researchers have lost access to vast amounts of information about some 30,000 children taken from Ukraine, including satellite imagery and other data.

In a letter to secretary of state Marco Rubio and treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the Democratic lawmakers say they believe the data has been “permanently deleted” in a move which would have “devastating consequences”

The Trump administration took “$26 million of US taxpayers money used for war crimes data and threw it into the woodchipper, including the dossiers on all the children”, a person familiar with the programme told Reuters.

""If you wanted to protect President Putin from prosecution, you nuke that thing. And they did it. It's the final court-admissible version with all the metadata,"" the source said.

Two people were killed and 18 were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine over the past day, regional authorities have said.

A 45-year-old woman was killed and four people were injured in the northeastern Kharkiv region, after a Russian first-person-view drone hit a car on the highway, governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

An attack on Uhroidy village in the Sumy region killed one person, injured three, and damaged a two-story house, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Further injuries were reported in the eastern Donetsk region, southern Kherson region, and the northern region of Kyiv.

A 60-year-old man was injured in a Russian drone attack in the Kyiv region overnight.

The attack also damaged several houses in the capital region, governor Mykola Kalashnyk said in a statement early today.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched more than 40 drones against Ukraine in the hours following the call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.

Ukrainian military said on Wednesday its air defence units shot down 72 of the 145 drones launched by Russia overnight.

06:54 , Arpan Rai

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have agreed to shackle Ukraine after hours of talking on the telephone over ceasefire terms, which won't work but are intended to further divide Ukraine and Europe from the White House.

There has not been a Russian agreement to a ceasefire. But if there is to be one, then all foreign military and intelligence assistance has to stop.

That means the Anglo-French efforts to create a coalition of the willing to back Ukraine and support a long-term peace with military muscle must stop. US assistance must stop, again. All intelligence sharing, by both the US and other Nato members, must also be ended.

Ukraine, Russia has demanded, must be hog-tied, muzzled and blinded before substantial talks can begin.

Russia's air defence units intercepted and destroyed 57 Ukrainian drones overnight, the Russian defence ministry said this morning.

Of these, 35 drones were destroyed over the Kursk border region, while the rest were over the territory of the Oryol, Tula, Bryansk regions and the Sea of Azov, the ministry said in a statement.

It did not mention the targets of the drone attacks and if any damage was caused.

China has said it is ready to assist countries involved in the Ukraine conflict with post-war reconstruction.

Beijing has remained a close ally to Russia throughout the war and refused to condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion, while offering to act as a mediator for peace.

""We are ready to continue to provide assistance within our capacity according to the wishes of parties involved, which, of course, includes post-war reconstruction,"" said Li Ming, spokesperson for the China International Development Cooperation Agency.

He added that Beijing has already delivered four batches of humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia's all-out invasion.

China remains committed to being a ""positive force for world peace and stability and a progressive force for global fairness and justice,"" the spokesperson said.

The government should not “ask businesses to shoulder any more of a burden”, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) chief has warned in the wake of the welfare cuts.

Work and pensions secretary Lilz Kendall announced on Tuesday a raft of welfare measures she said will help bring more working age people back into jobs.

The changes are set to save the taxpayer more than £5bn a year in 2029-30, she said, with tighter eligibility for personal independence payments (PIP) to account for the largest chunk.

The government has also announced it will pass legislation to deliver a so-called ‘right to try”, which Kendall argued would ensure people are able to “take the plunge and try work – without the fear this will put their benefits at risk”.

Ministers added they would invest an additional £1bn a year by 2029-30 to help support people into work, including through one-to-one help.

Responding to the government's new green paper on the changes – inviting consultation on the issues – work and pensions committee chairwoman Debbie Abrahams stressed the need for firms to be “receptive to the changing needs of a more diverse labour market.”

She added: “With a stagnant disability employment gap of 28 per cent, we need to do much better.”

But Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, stressed that the government needed to avoid overburdening businesses any further, in light of the added tax burden from Rachel Reeves' national insurance contributions (NICs) rise, and the employment rights package.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: “We will hold the Chancellor to account on what she has said, and what she has told us, that she will not increase that burden on business any further.”

Newton-Smith said: “If we want to see growth in our economy, if we want to help those two million young people back into work, we need to not make it more costly or risky to hire people.”

She added: “We know the government are listening on many areas that we have said are hugely important, and there is no more important time, I think, for our economy than when we look to the spring statement next week.”

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation and economic growth amid uncertainties stemming from President Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Fed officials now see inflation staying higher this year than previously estimated and economic growth going lower than prior predictions.

Policymakers estimate that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) measure of inflation will be 2.8% at the end of 2025, compared with 2.5% previously.

And the US economy is now projected to grow at an annualized pace of 1.7% instead of 2.1%. The unemployment rate is seen edging up to 4.4% from 4.3% previously.

""There are so many things we don't know,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday, and ""uncertainty is remarkably high.""

But what is known about tariffs is that they ""tend to bring growth down and they tend to bring inflation up.""

He acknowledged that the new Fed view on inflation this year can be attributed at least in ""good part"" to the tariffs, but his ""base case"" is that the inflationary effect from tariffs will be transitory.

While progress on bringing inflation down to the Fed's goal ""is probably delayed for the time being,"" Powell noted that officials do see the goal still being reached by 2027.

Powell has also consistently stressed a wait-and-see approach to assessing the economic impact of policy changes and did the same Wednesday at his press conference, telling reporters that the Fed is focusing on ""separating the signal from the noise"" when evaluating how Trump's policies may affect the economic outlook.

""We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,"" Powell said.

The Fed has now held borrowing costs steady for two consecutive meetings, maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25%-4.5%. The pause follows three consecutive rate cuts in late 2024.

The central bank also announced it will begin slowing the pace of Treasuries being drawn off its balance sheet starting in April, reducing the amount of Treasuries allowed to roll off from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Fed, however, will maintain the pace of mortgage-backed securities being drawn down by $35 billion per month.

Fed governor Chris Waller dissented in Wednesday decision because he would have preferred to continue the current pace of decline in letting bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet. He agreed with the decision to hold rates steady.

Waller and his Fed colleagues on Wednesday kept their median estimate first made in December for two rate cuts in 2025, even as a much-studied ""dot plot"" showed a large number of policymakers favored fewer or no cuts.

Nine officials see 2 cuts, while 4 officials see 1 cut and 4 see no cuts.

The biggest challenge for the Fed going forward may be how to balance both sides of their mandate — maximum employment and price stabilities — as uncertainties mount about both of those goals.

One large concern for investors is the possibility of a scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises — a dynamic known as stagflation that was last seen in the US during the 1970s.

Powell downplayed any comparisons to that time, saying in response to a question from Yahoo Finance that ""I don't see any reason to think we are looking at a replay of the 70s.""

On the inflation front, the next reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge of core PCE could reveal some new complications.

The metric is likely to show the gauge remained elevated in February, rising to 2.7% from 2.6% seen in January, when it is released next week.

That is still far from the Fed's eventual goal of 2%.

He acknowledged that consumer surveys show short-term worries about inflation but said that the relationship between survey data and hard data ""isn't tight."" Long-run inflation expectations ""really haven't moved.""

""We will be watching very carefully for signs of weakness in the real data.""

He acknowledged that ""it's going to be a challenge"" for the central bank to navigate the coming period as new policies from the Trump administration are put in place.

It's “really hard to know how this will work out,” he added.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to take questions from journalists after the central bank held interest rates steady amid increasing economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's agenda.

The Fed held interest rates at current levels for the second straight meeting after three consecutive rate cuts to end 2024. In recent months, many Fed officials have made clear they are increasingly concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025.

To make the ""Magnificent Seven"" trade great again, its historical top dog will have to spring back to life.

""I don't think the Mag 7 is going to work without Nvidia working,"" EMJ Capital founder and Nvidia bull Eric Jackson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).

As Jackson pointed out, the Mag 7 has ""sucked wind"" in 2025 as fears deepen on the complex's valuation and potential of peak AI spending.

Apple (AAPL) is off by 14% year to date, Microsoft (MSFT) 9%, Amazon (AMZN) 12%, Google (GOOG) 14%, and Tesla (TSLA) a stunning 49%. Meta (META) has outperformed the group with a modest drop, in part as cofounder Mark Zuckerberg has cozied up to the Trump administration.

As for Nvidia, its stock is down 12%, mostly on peak AI build-out fears.

But Nvidia is seen as the straw that stirs the drink for the cohort, given how its AI chips are laying the foundation for the Mag 7 to build out their AI infrastructure.

If the bears aren't going to buy into the Nvidia growth narrative, warming up to the other six names, even on their relative lows, will be a tough sell, Jackson said.

Nvidia did its part to jump-start its stock at its annual GTC spectacle on Tuesday.

There were lots of details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, which could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity.

Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang dropped a host of big numbers around artificial intelligence's potential. None were bigger than his prediction that Nvidia's data center infrastructure revenue will hit $1 trillion by 2028.

 

The company even took some wraps off a future AI chip called Feynman, set to drop in 2028.

By the end of the presentation, Huang had displayed Nvidia's full product roadmap through 2028 — impressive given how much innovation the company has done on AI chips in the past two years alone.

Nvidia's stock still fell 3.4% by the close of trading on Tuesday, which pressured the broader Mag 7. Shares of Nvidia and the Mag 7 rebounded only slightly on Wednesday as the Street voiced its letdown with the event.

Jackson added on the markets: ""Hope springs eternal that this is just like a recent pullback that is healthy and the market can catch its breath and move forward, including the Mag 7 names.""

Tesla stock (TSLA) rebounded on Wednesday on news that the EV maker was one step closer to robotaxi ride-hailing in the state of California.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a transportation charter-party carrier permit (TCP), per Reuters. This is most likely an “A” certificate or “P” permit that allows for chartered and point-to-point hired trips, with charges based on mileage and or time. The CPUC did not immediately respond when reached for comment.

Tesla's permit is likely the same permit that robotaxi rival Waymo secured before it was converted for autonomous vehicle use in the state of California.

Tesla shares were up 3% in early trading.

Read more about Tesla stock moves and today's market action.

Currently, the permit allows Tesla to perform supervised ride-hailing in California for its employees, for example, but ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public, the CPUC said.

Furthermore, Tesla would need authorization from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to operate an autonomous vehicle without a safety driver; currently, it only has a permit to test autonomous vehicles with a driver at the helm.

Much of Tesla's rich valuation is based on the promise of its robotaxi product and service offering. In addition to testing in California, CEO Elon Musk has said unsupervised, paid FSD (Full Self-Driving) was coming to Austin, Texas, later this year.

Musk's connection with the White House through his leadership of the controversial DOGE commission is seen as a way to pave a more regulatory-friendly approach to future robotaxi deployments, though much of the permitting process is still handled at the state and local government levels.

Tesla's Cybercab, a two-person vehicle without pedals or a steering wheel, is the company's purpose-built robotaxi EV which the company is targeting for a 2026 launch. However, Tesla is using current-generation vehicles like its Model Y and Model 3 to handle autonomous testing.

Also lifting Tesla shares today is a bullish upgrade from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Following a recent factory visit, analyst Andres Sheppard wrote that the recent massive downdraft in Tesla shares represented an “attractive entry point for investors,” with the company's autonomous ride-hailing effort in Austin a likely catalyst for the stock and FSD rollouts in China and Europe. Sheppard upgraded shares to Overweight from Neutral and maintained his $425 price target

That said, Sheppard acknowledged headwinds remained, such as Trump tariffs, the likely loss of EV tax credits, and Musk's political forays.

“We also expect a mild 1Q, driven by lower demand in Europe and increased competition in China, plus some negative sentiment from Elon's polarizing politics,” Sheppard said.

Cantor Fitzgerald's Tesla upgrade comes after former chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick left the firm to become Commerce Secretary, working alongside DOGE leader Elon Musk at the White House.

Though Lutnick stepped down and claims to no longer control Cantor Fitzgerald, he appointed his sons Brandon and Kyle as chairman and executive vice chairman, respectively.

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly% Wednesday midday, stemming losses from a two-day slide that saw shares drop 5% as the AI chipmaker's annual GTC event failed to excite investors amid a broader market downturn.

Nvidia stock's reversal comes as Wall Street analysts walked away from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched GTC 2025 keynote Tuesday optimistic about the company's roadmap and AI demand, doubling down on their bullish outlooks on the chipmaker in notes to investors. Those outlooks counter broader concerns about long-term AI demand and more efficient AI models reducing the need for computing hardware such as Nvidia's acclaimed GPUs (graphics processing units, or AI chips).

Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action.

“We came out of the keynote reassured in NVIDIA's leadership which if anything seems to be expanding,” Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote, reiterating his Buy rating on Nvidia stock and $163 price target and calling the chipmaker “king of the hill.”

Huang laid out Nvidia's upcoming AI chips during his presentation in San Jose, Calif., on Tuesday afternoon: Nvidia will launch its upcoming AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, in the second half of 2025; its next AI superchip, Vera Rubin in the second half of 2026; and the next-gen superchip after that (Vera Rubin Ultra) in the second half of 2027. Huang reiterated that he sees data center spending on compute hardware (i.e., Nvidia's total addressable market) reaching $1 trillion.

“I've said before that I expect data center build-out to reach $1 trillion. And I am fairly certain we're going to reach that very soon,” he told a large crowd.

Raymond James (RJF) analyst Srini Pajjuri reiterated his Strong Buy rating on Nvidia, echoing Citi's Malik: “Overall, we walked away comfortable with long term AI demand and continue to be impressed with NVDA's roadmap & technology innovation.”

Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon wrote in his own note to investors Wednesday morning, “The roadmap looks really solid, and their capability gap vs competitors across their entire massive stack continues to widen.”

Huang also seemed to convince analysts that cheaper, cost-efficient AI models (e.g., that of China's DeepSeek) won't hurt AI chip demand.

Read more: How does Nvidia make money?

“During the keynote session, Jensen Huang presented a compelling case on how innovations in AI models, such as DeepSeek, will drive higher compute complexity and necessitate increasing compute demand,” wrote JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur in a note early Wednesday.

Some were more skeptical.

“There was little commentary comparing the use cases [of Nvidia's GPUs] vs. peers or ASICs [custom chips made by companies such as Broadcom seen as competition for Nvidia's GPUs],” Jefferies (JEF) analyst Blayne Curtis wrote late Tuesday, adding that Vera Rubin “will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.”

Still, Curtis wrote, “The pace of innovation throughout the rack from GPU performance to power continues to show why NVDA will remain the leader in AI,” reiterating his Buy rating and $185 price target on the stock.

Nvidia shares fell 3.4% after Huang's keynote, bringing the stock down more than 17% over the past month.

The stock's decline comes amid a broader slump in Big Tech stocks, which has led a wide-scale market downturn as the Trump administration's policies fuel macroeconomic uncertainty.

The normal AI wonders and promises that powered Nvidia stock (NVDA) to record highs may not do the trick in getting the stock to rise again.

It'll likely require more real-world use of AI applications, which would help quash Wall Street's concerns about the future pace of AI demand.

""I think it's probably still the use of more applications, which won't come from Nvidia — it'll come from their partners and their customers' customers. They're users of the Blackwell chips,"" EMJ Capital founder and Nvidia bull Eric Jackson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast on the potential next Nvidia stock catalyst (video above; listen in below).

Jackson pointed to recent AI application advances from tech plays Palantir (PLTR) and Klarna as good examples of showing the Street what is likely coming in real-world AI use and how Nvidia stands at the center of it, given its leadership position for chips.

Jackson added, ""So I think it's got to be another story like those coming from some company using AI that is seeing just tremendous cost savings and so forth. I think it's got to come [from] that excitement and then the fact that other people are feeling the need to play catch-up to those examples. And then, obviously, they're going to have to buy more.""

Nvidia's typical jaw-dropping moments at its annual GTC gathering on Tuesday made a thud in markets.

There were lots of details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, which could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity.

Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang dropped a host of big numbers around artificial intelligence's potential. None were bigger than his prediction that Nvidia's data center infrastructure revenue will hit $1 trillion by 2028.

By the end of the presentation, Huang had displayed Nvidia's full product roadmap through 2028 — impressive given how much innovation the company has done on AI chips in the past two years alone.

Nvidia's stock still fell 3.4% by the close of trading on Tuesday. Shares rebounded only slightly in premarket trading to $116 each on Wednesday.

Year to date, the once-hot stock is down by 14% as the Street questions Nvidia's pace of future growth.

""As expected, there were no major surprises from GTC given confirmation of second half Blackwell Ultra (GB300) transition, and the Vera Rubin platform launch which will feature HBM4 as well as CPO spec upgrade were all widely expected,"" HSBC analyst Ryan Mellor wrote. ""More importantly, Vera Rubin NVL 144 (based on 144 GPU dies instead of exact number of GPUs) in the second half of 2026 suggests no GPU content growth given 72 GPUs per NVL rack remains the same as Blackwell NVL 72.""

Nvidia's stock will need time before it can command a premium price-to-earnings multiple again relative to its historical norms due to demand concerns, Jackson acknowledged.

Jackson's long-term bull case has been shaken, he said.

""Nvidia still looks good on a relative basis to pretty much anything else in the 'Magnificent Seven,'"" Jackson added.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has big plans for the AI data center industry. During the company's GTC conference, the chip giant's executive and co-founder debuted Nvidia's Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics networking systems.

Networking switches connect multiple Nvidia graphics chips together to act as one giant system. Huang says Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics can join hundreds and even thousands of GPUs and will enable data center companies to deploy up to 1 million GPU clusters.

That's a massive jump from the current largest AI supercomputer, xAI's Colossus, which is made up of 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs. And according to Huang, those million cluster data centers will be connected to other million-dollar data centers nearby to form massive data center facilities.

“Over the next several years, we're going to be building giant AI factories. Not normal AI factories … ones you see from space,” Huang explained.

The CEO spent a good deal of his time on stage during his GTC keynote explaining how Nvidia's latest advancements, ranging from Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics to its Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin superchips, will help the company's customers, including cloud service providers like Microsoft and Google, operate ever-more-powerful AI systems to drive better revenue opportunities.

“AI factories are directly related to revenue, and if the throughput is not good, your revenue is hurt. If you don't have enough capacity, your revenue is hurt. If you're not producing something of great value ... your revenue is hurt,” Huang said.

The CEO equated AI factories to auto plants, explaining how if automakers don't have the right factories and products on offer, their revenues will suffer.

”This could apply to a car company. If your capacity is not high enough, your revenue is hurt. If your utilization is not good, your revenue is hurt. if you build a car, nobody wants to buy it, your revenue is hurt,” he explained.

“It's a factory. Except it's a factory of tokens. It's a new world. An industrial revolution.”

That industrial revolution won't just take place inside of data centers though. In addition to its chips for massive server systems, Nvidia also showed off a handful of smaller AI-centered computers, including its mini desktop-sized DGX Spark and full-size desktop-sized DGX Station.

Packed with Nvidia's Grace Blackwell super chips, the computers are designed for AI developers and researchers. And when paired with the company's other AI platforms, they make up a new approach to enterprise IT that revolves around AI.

According to Huang, enterprise IT represents a half-a-trillion-dollar market opportunity.

""If you look at the world's data center spend, half of it is [cloud service providers], half of it is enterprise,"" Huang said. ""Still, that half of the enterprise, unless somebody does something, it's going to stay not AI. That's what Nvidia AI enterprise is all about.""

Economic data releases and earnings

Chaos may be a ladder, but where is it leading investors? Up, the dip buyers hope, taking advantage of Wall Street's newfound pessimism with cash and courage. The same tariff uncertainty that has sent markets tumbling has created a feasting opportunity for those willing to go against the grain.

Bank of America equity strategists wrote on Tuesday that as the market entered correction territory last week, clients poured into US equities, targeting single stocks. Energy and tech were the sectors leading the inflow. And as strategists Jill Carey Hall and Nicolas Woods noted, more investments came into cyclical sectors than defensive ones, suggesting that clients aren't preparing for a recession.

""Timing a market bottom is tough, but recognizing patterns is more straightforward,” said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, in a note this week. “Right now, contrarian signals remain one of the most reliable trading patterns. Retail investors continue to embrace a 'buy the dip' mindset, while institutional investors have been more reactive.""

But what do retail investors know that institutional ones don't? Or rather, what are they willing to tolerate?

Share prices to the skeptical investor are only now reaching “normal” levels, with the market having just jettisoned the most extreme frothiness. A correction after all-time highs doesn't mean stocks are cheap. And the swift drawdown and the nature of the tariff-triggered sell-off have left some analysts expressing caution.

“The damage to longer-term breadth, lack of institutional participation, and defensive rotational pressures leave us cautious on buying the dip right now,” wrote Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.

And as a flood of absurd and darkly amusing memes on X and Instagram get at, what happens when the dip keeps on dipping?

The unraveling AI trade doesn't yet have a clear catalyst to rebound; growth concerns may soon become crystallized in objective data; the Fed's rate-cutting ability to protect growth will be hamstrung by pressure to counteract tariffs; and the tariff deadline next month is another economic time bomb.

You don't have to reach for the metaphor of a falling knife to grasp the difficulty of timing the bottom. For the experts urging caution — that the market still has a ways to fall, or at least that the environment is far from being settled — there's a cluster of interconnected obstacles ahead.

Still, as more educated retail — and specifically, retail and long-term — investors seem to now understand implicitly, time will almost certainly heal these wounds. The question is exactly how much.

	This is the second study in six months to find planets around Barnard's star

Four small, probably rocky planets orbit Barnard's star (illustrated). The planetary system is the nearest one to the sun centered on a single star.

The nearest single star to the sun, Barnard's star, has a brood of planets all its own. The red dwarf star, about six light-years from Earth, hosts four close-in planets each about two to three times the mass of Mars, astronomers report in the March 20 Astrophysical Journal Letters.

“Barnard's star has a long history of claimed detections, but none of them could be confirmed for a long time,” says astronomer Ritvik Basant of the University of Chicago. “It's pretty exciting to know what's orbiting the nearest stars.”

From 2021 to 2023, Basant and his colleagues observed Barnard's star 112 times using the MAROON-X spectrograph on the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. “I was starting to see these signals in the dataset,” Basant says. But because he was still calibrating the instrument, “we ignored it for that time.”

Then last October, a team using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a telescope in Chile reported evidence of one planet orbiting Barnard's star, dubbed simply b, and hints of three others — designated c, d and e. With these hints in mind, Basant and colleagues reexamined their data,  confirming three of the planets.“I am very happy to see that new MAROON-X data provide an independent confirmation of the planet b and candidates c and d,” says astrophysicist Jonay González Hernández of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain, who led the ESPRESSO team. “Together with the ESPRESSO data, the analysis makes the detection significantly more robust.”Combining the MAROON-X and ESPRESSO data also confirmed the existence of planet e.

All four planets are so close to Barnard's star, which has about one-seventh the mass of the sun, that they orbit it in less than a week. That means they're too hot to be habitable, Basant says. In fact, the new observations probably rule out the presence of any habitable-zone planets.

Both studies employed the radial velocity method, which detects changes in the light from Barnard's star caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planets. This technique was responsible for finding the first known exoplanet in 1995 and has since identified hundreds of planets.

But all those planets were more massive than Earth. Thanks to larger telescopes and improved control over temperature and pressure variations in the instruments, the MAROON-X and ESPRESSO teams successfully detected much smaller planets. The four planets range from at least 0.19 to 0.34 times the mass of Earth, Basant and his colleagues found.

“Previous instruments were not that great at finding sub-Earth mass planets,” Basant says. “This is a big technological break. And a glimpse of what these next generation instruments can do.”

	Budgerigar's language centers use a ""vocal keyboard"" that's surprisingly humanlike

Specific nerve cells in budgerigars' brains allow the parrots to combine different elements of sounds, a new study shows.

Christopher Auger-Dominguez

By Laura Sanders

3 hours ago

When it comes to speech, parrots have the gift of gab. And the way the brains of small parrots known as budgerigars bestow this gift is remarkably similar to human speech, researchers report March 19 in Nature. 

So far, budgerigars are the only animals known to have language-producing centers akin to those in humans, says Michael Long, a neuroscientist at New York University Langone Health. This “is really the first nonhuman animal in which that has been shown.” Understanding how speech gets created in budgies' brains could help clarify what goes wrong in certain communication disorders in people.

Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) are tropical-colored, smart cutie pies. Beyond their looks, these parrots are particularly social and chatty, making them interesting research subjects for language studies.

Long and his Langone Health colleague Zetian Yang tracked the behavior of individual nerve cells in four of these birds' brains as they produced their chirrups. The activity of these cells, nestled in a part of the brain called the anterior arcopallium, is tied to the sounds the birds make, the duo found.

The organization of these neurons' activity, it turns out, is pretty simple, Long says. He compares this neural organization to a keyboard that can produce a range of sounds — consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A budgie “is able to generate arbitrary sounds in its universe by just playing this vocal keyboard,” Long says. Overall, this flexible system has a humanlike organization.

The similarities between human and parrot brains may reflect two species solving a problem in a similar way, neurally speaking. These parallels could be “a very tidy example of convergent evolution, where you have humans that have developed this kind of neural mechanism for speech, and these parrots have developed a kind of similar mechanism,” Long says.

Now that scientists know more about how budgie brains help the birds talk, another question dogs Long: What are these parrots talking about? 

“We are trying now to translate budgie,” he says, using advanced machine learning to determine what each warble and chirp means. Perhaps their language itself — not just the way their brain creates it — is similar to that of people. With these kinds of experiments, Long says, “maybe we can start to reexamine the notions of human exceptionalism.”

	The robot can take flying leaps and adjust its landing — just like squirrels do

A one-legged robot can hop from one narrow pipe to another and land balanced, like a squirrel leaping between branches.

Justin K. Yim

By Meghan Rosen

1 hour ago

Salto the robot is acting a little squirrelly.

The jumping bot can take a flying leap and land on a narrow pipe ­­­— just like a squirrel soaring from branch to branch. It's the first time scientists have been able to get a robot to land balanced on such a tiny target, says engineer Justin Yim, whose team reported the results March 19 in Science Robotics. 

“We've been inspired by squirrels,” says Yim, who worked on the project at the University of California, Berkeley and is now at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

Squirrels are one of nature's acrobats. They can scamper over telephone wires, vault between trees and even navigate Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses. A secret to squirrels' parkour prowess is exceptional balance. Even if a jump carries them a bit beyond or short of their target, squirrels can maneuver their bodies into staying upright. One way is by adjusting how hard their legs push against a branch as they land, Yim and his collaborators reported February 27 in the Journal of Experimental Biology. 

Think of playing hopscotch, he says. If you land on a square and feel like you're going to fall forward, you might stand up tall, pushing hard against the ground to prevent yourself from toppling over. And if you land too far back, you might crouch down, so you don't tip backward.

Yim's team tried to mimic those strategies in Salto, a spindly little hopping bot that was developed in 2016, and named after “saltatorial,” or jumping, movement. In 2020, the researchers figured out how to make Salto stick the landing on flat surfaces. For the new work, the team made two big changes. They added a clawlike gripper to Salto's foot so it could catch a pipe during landings. And they gave Salto the ability to stand or crouch to improve its balance. 

In test jumps in the lab, Salto successfully leapt from one PVC pipe to another 25 times out of 30, catching the tube and swinging over or under it most of the time. But in two trials, Salto leapt, landed and perched just perfectly, balancing upright on the pipe. 

“There's lots of room for improvement,” Yim says. Salto may not be ready to join Cirque du Soleil yet, but he has ideas about how to improve the bot's balance. One way would be enhancing its gripper, making it better for grasping the pipe upon landing, like a squirrel squeezing a branch with its toes. 

Yim envisions future bots that are even more agile than Salto and could one day help with construction, hopping onto pipes or girders while carrying cameras for inspection, for example, or working outside in a forest doing environmental monitoring. But Salto will need many more tweaks to catch up to its bushy-tailed brothers, Yim says. “The robot is definitely not able to do what a squirrel can do just yet.”

The European Space Agency has released the first batch of large-scale images from the Euclid space telescope, which astronomers have already used to find hundreds of strong gravitational lenses

Extraordinary images from the Euclid space telescope have captured 26 million galaxies, some as far off as 10.5 billion light years.

Euclid was launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in July 2023 and sent back its first images in November that year. During a six-year mission, it will image about one-third of the sky, building the most detailed 3D map of the cosmos ever created. Once complete, this survey will help to illuminate how dark matter and dark energy behave on cosmic scales.

ESA has now released the first large-scale data from this mission, beginning with three “deep fields” – areas where the telescope will peer in more detail than in the rest of its survey area. These three spots represent just 63 square degrees of sky, an area equivalent to that covered by the full moon 300 times over. In the coming years, Euclid will pass over these regions between 30 and 52 times, building up an ever more detailed image.

Will Percival at the University of Waterloo in Canada says the current batch of images is less than half a per cent of what Euclid will gather over the mission, but there is already plenty for researchers to work with. “For a lot of individual galaxies and their properties, there's so much science you can do, and that's because nobody has done a space-based survey in the near infrared and the optical like this before,” he says. “It's not quite the same quality as HST [the Hubble Space Telescope], but it's very close, and we're not just pointing and shooting at individual objects – we're doing a survey.”

Researchers have already used the Euclid data to find hundreds of strong gravitational lenses. These phenomena are formed when the gravity of an object in the foreground distorts light from a distant galaxy, creating an arc shape or even a full ring. Previously, scientists had to hunt these down individually and get HST to point at them and collect more images. Now astronomers can search the survey data from Euclid and find many at once, which will help gather insights into the evolution of galaxies and the universe.

Using an AI model, researchers were able to find and catalogue 500 galaxies with strong gravitational lensing in this first batch of data alone, doubling the total found to date. “The statistics are phenomenal,” says Percival. “Euclid's going to get 200 times this amount of data in the end.”

The data released so far represents just a single week of images from Euclid, but it adds up to some 35 terabytes – the equivalent of 200 days of high-quality video streaming. The next batch of data, due to be released late next year, will be a whole year's worth of images covering 2000 square degrees and requiring more than 2000 terabytes of storage space.

Looking at each galaxy manually could take over a hundred years, so AI has been used to massively speed up the process, says Mike Walmsley at the University of Toronto. “We can ask new questions in weeks, rather than years,” he says.

String theory may be our best attempt at a theory of everything, except that it can't describe an expanding universe like ours. Now a radical new twist on the idea could finally fix that – but it requires us to completely reimagine reality

By Jon Cartwright


                                    19 March 2025

String theory is the best candidate we have for a theory of everything. Bend to its rule and the various tangled theories of conventional physics emerge as part of a sublime, higher-dimensional tapestry. It can unify all four of nature's forces, including the most troublesome of all, gravity. With any luck, it can also tame big bangs and black holes without losing the thread.

There's just one catch: string theory can't explain a universe like ours. Its maths can describe gazillions of different possible universes, just not one expanding at an accelerating rate, which is precisely what we see ours doing. To be sure, no one knows what is driving this acceleration – a mysterious “dark energy” is the usual placeholder. According to theory, though, it probably shouldn't be happening at all.

The laws of physics appear to follow a mysterious mathematical pattern

For 25 years, this has been a big problem, but now we may have found a way past it. Superficially, the answer won't shock anyone used to the extravagance of modern physics: we just have to rethink our universe as part of a much grander enterprise. Do this, and it can balloon to its heart's content – indeed, accelerated expansion seems to come naturally. But this new scheme may be the wildest yet, one in which our familiar space is delicately poised between high-dimensional hyperspace and complete nothingness. “In our proposal, our existence is like a shadow – a projection onto a wall at the end of the world,” says Antonio Padilla, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in the UK.

I have something of a reputation as a party-pooper in the New Scientist office. At our weekly meeting to discuss the latest and greatest ideas in science, colleagues will eagerly describe some incredible new theory or spectacular find, then sit back to field questions. I can already hear the groans before I open my mouth to say: “Yes, but what is the actual evidence?”

I don't do this because I enjoy shooting down ideas (OK, maybe I do…

Feedback, a Lego fan, delves into a new science-related set, and learns that the model of a DNA double helix is the wrong way around. Time for some jokes about mirror organisms...




                                    19 March 2025

Feedback is New Scientist's popular sideways look at the latest science and technology news. You can submit items you believe may amuse readers to Feedback by emailing feedback@newscientist.com 

Feedback may be well into middle age, verging on dotage, but we aren't ashamed to admit that we enjoy playing with Lego, to the point of having a special cabinet in our home office in which to house our more prized sets. So, we were naturally intrigued to learn of a set, released on 1 March, called “The Evolution of STEM” (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).

The build is a cornucopia of STEM-related objects: a DNA double helix, a space shuttle, an apple tree with Isaac Newton stood nervously beneath it and more. They all erupt out of the pages of an open book, accompanied by minifigures of chemist Marie Skłodowska-Curie and agricultural scientist George Washington Carver.

It's a bit chaotic-looking, but there is a deeper problem, highlighted in a Reddit thread flagged to us by news editor Jacob Aron, and noted by at least one reviewer. It's quite simple: the DNA is the wrong way around. Many biological chemicals can be either left or right-handed, and in Earthly life, DNA is always right-handed – but Lego's DNA molecule is left-handed.

Feedback was going to suggest this was Lego subtly arguing that, despite what the experts say, we should go ahead and construct a mirror organism in which key molecules have the opposite handedness to existing life – even if it might kill us all. But then we saw that Jay's Brick Blog had already made that remark in their review.

So instead, we call on the world's palaeontologists to find something wrong with the metre-long T. rex skeleton kit Lego released on 15 March. We need to stop ourselves buying it.

With a certain weary inevitability, many big energy companies have rolled back their commitments to renewable energy, preferring to chase the immediate profits from fossil fuels.

In late February, BP announced it was boosting its investments in oil and gas by about 20 per cent, while cutting renewables funding by more than $5 billion. This was, it said, about maximising returns for shareholders. Alas, the firm's net income was a mere $8.9 billion in 2024. Oh, how their hands were tied.

On the day this announcement was made, the story was presented on the UK's BBC News homepage – next to one headlined “Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told”. Feedback briefly joined some dots in our addled mind, before reminding ourselves that it's fine: the people in suits know what they're doing.

After all, BP isn't alone. A few weeks earlier, Shell released its full 2024 results, which noted that it had cut its capital spending on renewables from $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion. Last year, it abandoned its 2035 emissions target. Likewise, in December, Exxon set out a plan to boost its oil and gas output by 18 per cent by 2030.

To paraphrase Futurama‘s Philip J. Fry: Feedback is shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked.

The whole saga leads us to wonder if “corporate strategy” might be an oxymoron on a par with “military intelligence”. In the early 2000s, BP rebranded itself from “British Petroleum” to “Beyond Petroleum”, to signal its intention to embrace renewables. Then it abandoned the whole thing after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill cost it a lot of money, bringing its focus back to fossil fuels. Fast-forward to 2020, and the company announced a raft of new renewables targets – many of which it is now slinking away from with this recent drop in funding.

If Feedback were this indecisive, we would, er, struggle to decide how to wrap this up, um.

Reporter Michael Le Page draws our attention to The Journal of Geek Studies. Despite its (somewhat) formal-sounding name, it isn't peer-reviewed, but it will publish “any original contribution that combines an academic topic with something geeky”.

Hence the paper that Michael found, published on 8 March, titled: “Is a bone a viable weapon when combating a Rancor? Estimating the bite force of an intergalactic mega-predator“.

For readers unfamiliar with what a Rancor is, it's the great big reptile-like monster in the basement of Jabba the Hutt's palace in Return of the Jedi, which Luke Skywalker fights off. Another Rancor appeared in the 2021 series The Book of Boba Fett, but the less said about that the better.

Authors Thomas Clements and Stephan Lautenschlager seek to understand one key moment from Return of the Jedi. To avoid being eaten, Luke picks up a long bone and lodges it vertically in the Rancor's mouth, locking its jaw open. However, Luke's reprieve is only temporary, as the Rancor bites down so hard it snaps the bone in two.

Is this feasible? The pair simulate the muscles and bones of the Rancor's jaw and estimate it could bite with a force of around 44,000 newtons – “more than capable of vertically snapping a large long bone”. Reassuringly, “no living vertebrate's bite force comes close to the Rancor”, with great white sharks and saltwater crocodiles topping out around 16,000 to 18,000 newtons.

During our journalistic career, Feedback has repeatedly been told by editors to write stories that lead to practical advice, or “news you can use”. Well, here it is. Readers: every time you venture into crocodile territory, carry a femur or two with you, just in case.

Debunking Colonoscopy Myths That Could Be Putting Your Health at Risk

A colonoscopy can save your life, but misinformation keeps many people from getting one. A gastroenterologist sets the record straight.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Few outpatient medical procedures inspire as much negativity as the colonoscopy. In honor of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, we've decided to bust up some of the myths that make people avoid this crucial procedure. My guest today is John Nathanson. He's a gastroenterologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Thanks so much for joining us today.

John Nathanson: It's great being here. Thank you for having me.

Feltman: So we are here to debunk some colonoscopy myths. First things first, you know, why do you think colonoscopies are, like, so reviled by the general public? I had one to check on some post-COVID GI issues about a year ago, and I was really surprised at how not awful it all was [laughs] based on the general vibe. So, yeah, why do you think they sort of loom so large in people's minds?

Nathanson: Well, absolutely. You know, I think it's a sensitive topic. People, you know, don't normally get these things checked out and don't normally talk about the things that we address in colonoscopy in a normal day-to-day conversation. So I think, for people, there's this mystical nature about it, where they kind of understand what we do but may not have a full understanding of everything, and because it's such a sensitive area, people tend to have some misconceptions about it.

Feltman: Yeah, so what do colonoscopies do? Why are they important?

Nathanson: Colonoscopy is a critical tool in our armamentarium as gastroenterologists. Number one, colonoscopy can be used to diagnose common GI issues like constipation, bleeding, diarrhea without any other cause, but more importantly, and for the general public at large, it can be used as a tool for screening for colon cancer.

Feltman: So most people assume colonoscopy prep is gonna be really awful. What does it actually involve, and what is it like?

Nathanson: You know, it's highly variable from doctor to doctor—everybody recommends their own way of doing things. But for most people it generally involves, a day before your colonoscopy, modifying your diet and taking some sort of laxative to help cleanse the system prior to the procedure.

Feltman: And why is getting a good prep in so important for the procedure?

Nathanson: Getting a good prep is a critical part of this experience because the better the prep, the more thorough our exam is. So the cleaner the colon, the more we are able to look for precancerous lesions, to make sure there's nothing else developing in the colon and to potentially diagnose some issues that brought people in in the first place.

Feltman: Yeah. Is there anything that people can do to make the prep process more easier? I mean, for example, my doctor recommended, you know, slowly changing my diet in the days before, which I found really helpful.

Nathanson: Absolutely, that's a great idea. And, you know, we try and make very mild changes to people's routines so that this is not a disruptive experience—rather, this is just something that you get through very easily.

We generally recommend drinking the prep cold; that can sometimes help. Number two is just changing your diet little by little prior to the colonoscopy. Mostly what we recommend is just the entire day before the colonoscopy, be on a liquid diet, but you can do things like drink broth, Jell-O, Popsicles, that type of stuff.

Feltman: What are some of the sort of common mistakes people might make in their prep work that might impact the quality of the colonoscopy?

Nathanson: Sure, you know, people these days love fiber, and as a gastroenterologist we recommend that people increase fiber in their diet pretty much to everybody.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Nathanson: In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, however, a high-fiber diet may make it more difficult to prep completely for your colonoscopy ...

Feltman: Right.

Nathanson: So while fiber in general is excellent—it's great for your health, it's great for your digestion—it may make the prep process a little bit more complicated. And it may make it so that the prep is not as complete as we need it to be. So generally we recommend a lower-fiber diet in the days leading up to the colonoscopy.

Feltman: That makes sense. So moving from the prep into the procedure, you know, in the most not-scary terms, what happens during a colonoscopy?

Nathanson: Sure, well, you come into our office, you get an IV in your arm, and you're being monitored by an anesthesiologist, who is giving you medication to keep you comfortable. And as a patient is asleep we put a camera in from below to examine the lining of the colon. While you're asleep we look for any signs of cancer or any signs of developing cancer. And if we see anything irregular or developing, we biopsy it or take it out completely.

Feltman: And do you have to be sedated to have a colonoscopy?

Nathanson: You don't. We recommend it. We find that when patients are more comfortable, we do a more thorough and complete exam. However, there are patients that choose to forgo anesthesia altogether and do just fine.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and relatedly, you know, what about people who've heard that colonoscopies are really painful, either during or even after due to bloating? How bad is it usually?

Nathanson: The vast majority of our patients experience almost no discomfort at all. During the procedure patients are incredibly comfortable and are being monitored by an anesthesiologist, who can give them more medication if they experience any discomfort whatsoever. And after the procedure any discomfort is, is minimal as well. Patients usually pass gas very quickly, don't feel any discomfort lasting after the procedure.

Feltman: So now that we've demystified the procedure itself a little bit, let's talk about deciding to get one.

So what would you say to people who assume they don't need colonoscopies because they're healthy, they eat right, they don't have any problems in the bathroom?

Nathanson: Sure. I, I say to everybody: if you are between 45 and 75, a colonoscopy is right for you for colon cancer screening. This is something that everybody, provided they are healthy enough to undergo anesthesia and healthy enough to undergo the procedure, should be offered as a critical method to screen for and to prevent colon cancer.

Feltman: So we've been seeing a lot of studies and stuff in the news about younger folks getting colorectal cancer. Is there anything that people should take away from that in terms of when they should get screened or what symptoms they should be looking out for?

Nathanson: For sure, and I think this is an important point to bring up—we are seeing a slight increase in the absolute number of patients under the age of 45 who are being diagnosed with colon cancer.

So colonoscopy is only one tool that we use to screen for colon cancer. It's the tool that I generally recommend most often because colonoscopy has the added advantage of being able to detect but also prevent colon cancer. I always say: Don't ignore symptoms. If there are symptoms that are scary, that are new, speak with your doctor to figure out whether or not a colonoscopy is the right test to evaluate what's going on.

I will say, starting at 45 is a great time to think about colorectal cancer screening, but if there is a family history, if there is a high-risk genetic condition, you may be a candidate to start screening earlier. For example, if a patient has a family history of colon cancer in a first-degree relative, we generally recommend starting at 40 or 10 years before the age of diagnosis—whatever is earlier. So I always say to talk with your doctor to figure out when you should start screening and start thinking about engaging in this process.

Feltman: And if people have, you know, any GI concerns that make them feel like maybe they should be getting a colonoscopy, what should their first steps be?

Nathanson: Absolutely. You know, this is what we specialize in, and if patients have any questions about GI symptoms, I always recommend speaking with a gastroenterologist. Working with your doctor is an excellent way to figure out if a colonoscopy may be the right screening test for you and may be the right test to figure out what is going on and what is causing your symptoms.

Feltman: I think a lot of people assume that all a colonoscopy can do for you is tell you that you've got colon cancer. What else can come out of these procedures?

Nathanson: Yeah, I think that's a dangerous misconception because colonoscopy is an excellent way to actually prevent colon cancer, which is the reason why we push it so much, or we, we really talk with our patients more about getting colonoscopies, because if we find precancerous polyps, we can remove them and prevent them from ever becoming an issue.

Feltman: Yeah, that's a huge deal. Are there any other big misconceptions about colonoscopies that you want our listeners to know the truth about?

Nathanson: Yeah, that this is an unpleasant experience. I find that most of our patients actually say, “Well, that was not much of a problem at all, and if I had known it was so easy, I would have come in sooner.”

So this is a, a straightforward test, it's a safe test, and it is a test that is not associated with significant discomfort.

Feltman: Awesome, thanks so much for coming in and helping us dispel some of these myths.

Nathanson: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday with a special look into the science of the hit TV series Severance, featuring the neurosurgeon who helped writers develop the show's titular procedure.

Google X has introduced the Taara chip, a fingernail-sized invention that taps the ""virtually limitless"" potential of light-based internet connectivity.

Google X has revealed the Taara chip, the latest development in its quest to harness the power of light for inexpensive, cable-free, high-speed internet.

This ""fingernail-sized"" chip uses software-controlled light emitters to steer data-encoded light beams between two points. In tests, researchers successfully transmitted data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) over 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) outdoors using two Taara chips.

""We believe this is the first time silicon photonics chips have transmitted such high-capacity data outdoors at this distance,"" Mahesh Krishnaswamy, the general manager of Taara, said in a statement.

The researchers at X, which is Google's research and development arm, hope Taara can deliver fiber-like internet speeds to regions that are difficult to access with traditional fiber-optic cables. These traditional cables are typically buried deep underground, making them impractical for remote areas or challenging terrains, such as mountains and forests. This, however, isn't a problem for Taara.

Related: Scientists achieve record-breaking 402 Tbps data transmission speeds — 1.6 million times faster than home broadband

Similarly, because the light frequencies Taara uses don't overlap with radio frequency bands like 5G, Taara doesn't have to contend with other signals taking up bandwidth.

He added that the goal was to make high-speed connectivity cheaper and easier to deploy by reducing the size and cost of the infrastructure, specifically by creating a mesh network of multiple Taara devices connected together.

These devices could then exchange data directly, providing high-speed, easily-scalable coverage wherever Taara nodes exist.

""Using chips deployed in a global mesh network, we see opportunities to bring high-speed internet to underserved regions, rethink the way data centers are built and operated, enable faster, create safer communication for autonomous vehicles, and so much more.""

Fiber-optic cables contain tiny plastic or glass strands that transmit data as pulses of light. These are extremely effective at carrying high-speed data over long distances — far more so than older, copper-based cables, which carry data as slower electrical signals that are more prone to interference.

Taara also sends data as optical signals; however, it avoids the need for underground cables and networks that require physical maintenance. This means it can be installed ""in hours instead of the days, months, or even years it can take to lay fiber,"" Krishnaswamy said.

—Scientists use TV tech to test light-powered internet connections that can be 100 times faster than Wi-Fi

—Key to faster 6G speeds lies in letting new AI architecture take control, scientists say

—Wireless data speeds hit 938 Gbps — a new record and 10,000 times faster than 5G

The Taara chip is actually a newer, smaller version of an existing Google X invention called Taara Lightbridge, which is about the size of a traffic light.

Lightbridge featured a physical housing and mechanisms consisting of ""mirrors, sensors, precision optics, and smart software"" to align light beams to where they need to be. When two beams lock onto each other, they create a secure link capable of transmitting data up to speeds of 20 Gbps up to distances of 12.4 miles (20 km).

Krishnaswamy said the Taara chip will be available in 2026 in X's next product — which the company has not disclosed. In the meantime, Google's research arm has invited researchers and tinkerers to get in touch to explore potential applications.

After finding the debris of two colliding stars swimming in the ocean, researchers are after more evidence from the lunar soil.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — The wreckage of some of the universe's most violent explosions has crept closer than you might think; in fact, you may have taken a swim in it during your last dip in the ocean.

By analyzing samples from the deep sea, researchers have found a unique variety of radioactive plutonium that appears to be debris from a rare breed of cosmic explosion called a kilonova, which likely detonated near Earth some 10 million years ago. But proving this explosion's existence will require more evidence, and the researchers think they know where to find it: on the surface of the moon.

""We live in a supernova graveyard,"" Brian Fields, an astronomer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a March 17 presentation here at the 2025 American Physical Society Global Physics Summit. ""[Supernovas make] tiny specks of rocks that can literally rain upon the Earth. They'll accumulate in the depths of the ocean, and they'll also hang onto the moon.""

Fields has theorized about this cosmic rubble since the 1990s. But it wasn't until 2004 that researchers started sifting out supernova remnants from ocean samples. They found traces of a radioactive version of iron that doesn't occur naturally on Earth and can only be explained by a nearby supernova sometime in Earth's recent history.

In the following years, about a dozen more samples from both the ocean and the moon painted a more detailed picture of this explosive history. Fields and his colleagues' refined theories pointed to two separate supernova events that occurred 3 million and 8 million years ago. ""This is direct observational evidence that supernovas are radioactivity factories,"" Fields said.

The plot thickened in 2021, when researchers discovered an even rarer substance sprinkled in with those same samples: a radioactive isotope of plutonium. This finding required an origin story even more unusual than the violent star deaths that birth supernovas.

The plutonium variant the researchers found is thought to come from kilonovas — eruptions that occur as two binary neutron stars spiral toward each other in a cataclysmic collision. Kilonovas are also factories for some of our planet's rarest elements, like gold and platinum, and astronomers have long tried to unravel the mechanics of this class of explosion.

Now, Fields and his colleagues suspect that a separate kilonova event predated those two previously identified supernovas, erupting at least 10 million years ago. These different explosions formed a sort of radioactive cocktail, embedding a hybrid iron and plutonium signature in the samples.

""We had a kilonova that made plutonium — like it loves to do — and blasted it all over the place,"" Fields said. ""Then, with the stirring of material by a supernova, it got all mixed up, and some of that fell to Earth.""

But Fields and his team still want to run more tests to bolster their theory. With renewed efforts like the Artemis missions to return humans to the moon, the researchers are optimistic that the lunar samples they hope to analyze won't be in such short supply.

""Right now, our lunar soil is so precious because it's all we've got,"" Fields told Live Science. ""The hope is, eventually, we'll be taking routine trips to the moon, so it's no big deal — sampling a kilogram won't sound like a lot to people.""

With more soil, Fields and his colleagues hope to verify that this kilonova indeed happened, as well as pinpoint when and where it occurred. Because of its simpler geology, the moon should provide a clearer snapshot of exactly how the cosmic debris landed there.

—Evidence for Stephen Hawking's unproven black hole theory may have just been found — at the bottom of the sea

—The universe's water is billions of years older than scientists thought — and may be nearly as old as the Big Bang itself

""On Earth, things sink to the bottom of the ocean, and you have to worry about currents and the atmosphere,"" Fields told Live Science. ""But the moon is awesome because when stuff lands, it just lands.""

With the next phase of the Artemis mission not set to launch until at least next year, Fields and his team are still a ways away from formally requesting access to this hot commodity. But in the meantime, they're convincing the scientific community that the research is a worthwhile investment.

""We're writing papers to prove to the Artemis community that this is something to seriously think about,"" Fields said. ""The samples are coming back anyway. We just want to piggyback off of it.""

A quartet of small, rocky exoplanets likely circle Barnard's Star, around 6 billion light-years from Earth, putting them in contention as targets of missions for future human generations.

A quartet of Earth-like worlds, each about 20% to 30% the size of our planet, circle one of our closest stellar neighbors, a new study reveals. The rocky alien worlds are close enough that future generations of humans may be able to visit them with futuristic rocket propulsion technology. However, it is unlikely that we will find any life there.

Astronomers have long suspected that there was at least one exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star — a red dwarf with a mass around one-sixth that of the sun. At 5.97 light-years from Earth, it is the fourth-closest star to our solar system, after the three interconnected stars of the Alpha Centauri system. (Five potential planets have also been detected around the stars of Alpha Centauri, though not all of them have been confirmed yet.)

In the past, researchers assumed that Barnard's Star was circled by a gas giant exoplanet similar to Jupiter, because the star frequently wobbles closer to and then farther from Earth. This suggests that something is gravitationally tugging on the star, similar to how the moon pulls on our planet and causes Earth's tides. However, proving the existence of such a planet has remained elusive.

But in a new study, published March 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, researchers say they have discovered that this wobbling is not caused by the pull of one gas giant but instead by the combined force exerted by four smaller, rocky worlds, each around four times more massive than Mercury.

""It's a really exciting find,"" study lead author Ritvik Basant, a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago, said in a statement. ""Barnard's Star is our cosmic neighbor, and yet we know so little about it.""

The newly detected worlds, which have not been officially named yet, are ""so close to their home star that they zip around the entire star in a matter of days,"" the researchers wrote. ""That probably means they are too hot to be habitable.""

The new findings also likely rule out the possibility that any other exoplanets circle within the habitable zone of Barnard's Star, they added.

But that doesn't mean this system will remain uninhabited forever. Although Barnard's Star is currently out of reach for humans using current rocket propulsion technology, future human generations might be able to travel to and colonize these newly discovered planets using new forms of rocket propulsion, such as nuclear fusion engines or light sails.

Most exoplanets are discovered when they pass in front of their home star and block out some of the light shining toward Earth. However, in this case, researchers think we are looking at Barnard's Star from above, meaning its planets do not pass in between it and us. As a result, scientists often refer to our stellar neighbor as ""great white whale"" of planet hunting, researchers wrote.

To get around this problem, the study team turned to MAROON-X, an instrument attached to the Gemini North telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. Over 112 nights during a three-year period, the telescope detected subtle shifts in the movement of Barnard's Star in order to ""tease apart the number and masses of the planets that must be circling the star to have this effect,"" the researchers wrote.



Initially, MAROON-X identified only three planets. However, in another study, published in October 2024, researchers identified another planet using a similar device, dubbed ESPRESSO, at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. By combining these data with their own, the researchers could see this fourth planet for themselves.

Using data from both MAROON-X and ESPRESSO also challenges the idea that the researchers are being misled by anomalies in either data set, making them more confident in their results.

—Exoplanet with iron rain has violent winds 'like something out of science fiction'

—Nearby exoplanet has grown a tail 44 times longer than Earth — and it's acting like a giant 'stellar windsock'

Red dwarfs are the most common star type in the universe, but most are too far from Earth for researchers to easily spot planets around them. However, the new results hint that small, rocky planets could be abundant around these miniature stars.

But for the study team, the most exciting thing about the new research was finding worlds that are so close to Earth.

""We found something that humanity will hopefully know forever,"" Jacob Bean, an astronomer at the University of Chicago who specializes in exoplanet systems, said in the statement. ""That sense of discovery is incredible.""

New photos have revealed the ""love planet"" Venus looking unrecognizable as it prepares to line up for a striking conjunction later this week. The hellish world has transformed into a slim crescent, which can look like a giant fiery rainbow under the right conditions.

On March 23, Venus will reach its inferior conjunction, or the point at which it lies directly between Earth and the sun. On this day, the sun's glare will make it almost impossible to see the planet. But even if we could see it, it would be covered in shadow, similar to a new moon. Over the last few weeks and months, the planet has been waning as it gets closer to alignment, giving it an increasingly crescent-like appearance.

Astrophotographer Douglas Kostyk set out to capture the disappearing planet on March 8 at the Marian and Max Farash Center for Observational Astronomy in Ionia, New York — when only around 7% of Venus was visible. But his photos also showed that the crescent looked like a cosmic rainbow.

The striking rainbow effect is caused by particles in Earth's atmosphere refracting, or splitting apart, different wavelengths of light like a prism, according to Spaceweather.com. ""When Venus is near the horizon, refraction separates the red crescent from the blue,"" Spaceweather.com representatives wrote. ""The crescent is so thin, the splitting of colors is obvious.""

The same effect was also captured by Kevin R. Witman, who snapped a less-detailed image of Venus' rainbow crescent from Cochranville, Pennsylvania on March 9. In this image, the rainbow's colors are inverted compared to Kostyk's photo because the planet was in a different part of the sky relative to the observer.

More recently, on March 16, astronomer Raffaello Lena captured video footage of the rainbow effect from near Rome, Italy. In this instance, atmospheric turbulence caused the light coming from Venus to shimmer and become distorted, making it appear as if the rainbow was ""on fire,"" Spaceweather.com reported.

Venus has become unusually bright in recent weeks as it gets closer to Earth, which has made it a prime target for astronomy enthusiasts since early February onwards. During this time, the hellish world also starred in a rare planetary parade, when all of the solar system's worlds appeared in the night sky at one point or another.

Venus was one of the most clearly visible planets throughout the parade, often appearing close to the moon and occasionally right alongside other planets like Mercury. It was also one of the most easily identifiable bodies when all seven planets were photographed in a line in late February.

Bright Venus is easily spotted with the naked eye, but to make out its crescent-like appearance you'll need a strong pair of stargazing binoculars or a good backyard telescope.

The planetary parade is now over. However, several planets will remain easier to spot than usual in the coming weeks and months. After the upcoming inferior conjunction, Venus will begin its waxing phase and transition from a slim crescent to its more usual filled-in appearance. As this happens, the rainbow effect should still be visible for a few weeks if the conditions are right.

Venus reaches an inferior conjunction approximately every 18 months. The next time this happens will be on Oct. 24, 2026.

The giant sea spiders can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters).

Scientists have captured stunning video of a dinner-plate-size sea spider crawling on the seafloor off the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of volcanic islands near Antarctica in one of the most remote areas of the world.

Sea spiders, also known as pycnogonids, are distant cousins of the creepy-crawly arachnids we see scuttling about on land. These creatures can have leg spans of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) — nearly double those of the largest land spiders, whose leg spans top out at around 12 inches (30 cm).

According to the Schmidt Ocean Institute, which shared the footage, the spider's massive size is a result of deep-sea gigantism, the tendency for deep-sea creatures to grow significantly larger than their shallow-water relatives. In this case, the pycnogonid was filmed at a depth of 6,903 feet (2,104 meters).

""Immense pressure and frigid temperatures, while insurmountable obstacles to land-lovers like humans, allow some animals to have very slow metabolisms and the ability to reach gargantuan proportions,"" Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives wrote in a Facebook post.

Larger animals can also move faster and farther to find food or to locate a mate, which is important when both are scarce.

Deep-sea gigantism is particularly prevalent toward the poles, where freezing temperatures facilitate slower metabolisms. Schmidt Ocean Institute representatives described sea spiders as both ""abundant"" and ""abundantly large"" in polar regions.

There are roughly 1,500 species of sea spider known to science and likely many more yet to be discovered, according to the post. Sea spiders inhabit oceans around the world and range just a few millimeters to the size of a serving platter. The species of spider in the video from the Schmidt Ocean Institute has not been specified.

The largest members of this group are usually found at depths between 7,200 and 13,100 feet (2,200 to 4,000 m), according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

Instead of spinning webs or creating burrows as land spiders do, sea spiders use a specialized tube-like mouth structure, called a proboscis, to slurp up prey such as sea anemones, jellies and other invertebrates.

This latest footage was taken by remotely operated vehicle pilots as part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute's South Sandwich Islands expedition, a mission to locate and describe new species in these frigid waters. According to the institute, scientists have discovered only 10% of ocean life.

Scientists have unveiled the most detailed map yet of the landscape hidden beneath Antarctica's ice.

The high-resolution map reveals what the frozen continent looks like beneath its miles-thick blanket of ice and snow, and will help researchers predict how Antarctica might evolve in a fast-warming climate.

""Imagine pouring syrup over a rock cake [or a chocolate chip cookie, if that's more familiar to you] — all the lumps, all the bumps, will determine where the syrup goes and how fast,"" Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the lead author of a new study outlining the research, said in a statement.

The same process will occur in Antarctica if a significant amount of the ice sheet melts, Pritchard said. ""Some ridges will hold up the flowing ice; the hollows and smooth bits are where that ice could accelerate,"" he said.

Bedmap3 builds on two previous studies that digitally stripped Antarctica of its ice. The new map incorporates all of the data used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2 — including measurements gathered by planes, satellites, ships and even dog-drawn sleds. But the team also sourced an extra 52 million data points to refine these previous results, according to the study, published March 10 in the journal Scientific Data.

In total, more than six decades' worth of data was compiled to construct Bedmap3, the researchers said in the statement. ""This is the fundamental information that underpins the computer models we use to investigate how the ice will flow across the continent as temperatures rise,"" Pritchard said.

The new map is color coded to show the height of Antarctica's bedrock above sea level, highlighting the continent's tallest mountains and deepest valleys. The topography is revealed in the finest detail yet, providing new insight into understudied areas, including around the South Pole, according to the statement.



The researchers used radar, seismic and gravity measurements to map the bedrock and estimate the thickness of the ice sheet above it. Against their expectations, they found that the place with the thickest ice in Antarctica is an unnamed canyon in Wilkes Land, a district in the east of the continent.

Previous surveys placed Antarctica's thickest ice in the Astrolabe Basin in Adélie Land. The difference in ice thickness between the two areas is small: The Astrolabe Basin has a thickness of around 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers), while Wilkes Land is almost 3 miles (4.8 km) thick, according to the study.



The new research also reveals, in unprecedented detail, the shape of the ice sheet and ice shelves that float around the fringes of the continent.

""In general, it's become clear the Antarctic Ice Sheet is thicker than we originally realized and has a larger volume of ice that is grounded on a rock bed sitting below sea level,"" study co-author Peter Fretwell, a mapping specialist and geographic information officer at the BAS, said in the statement.

Although thickness in itself is not a problem, the fact that much of the ice sits below sea level is concerning, because relatively warm seawater can flood into the ice sheet, Fretwell said. ""This puts the ice at greater risk of melting,"" he added.

""What Bedmap3 is showing us is that we have got a slightly more vulnerable Antarctica than we previously thought,"" Fretwell added.

The NHL regular season is nearing the finish line, and while other teams are fighting just to stay alive in the playoff race, the Colorado Avalanche are rolling. With all the ingredients for a Stanley Cup run, it looks like things are starting to come together for the Avs.

Since the start of February, the Avalanche are 11-3-1, which is the NHL's best record in that span. Their plus-22 goal differential is second only to the Tampa Bay Lightning, another streaking contender.

Few front offices, if any, have been more aggressive than the Avalanche this year. The duo of Joe Sakic and Chris MacFarland completely revamped Colorado's goaltending situation mid-stream, and that has paid off in spades. That was followed by the deal that sent Mikko Rantanen to Carolina for Martin Necas, who has been a perfect fit up front.

Then, at the trade deadline, the Avs aggressively upgraded their center depth with the additions of Brock Nelson and Charlie Coyle.

While all that movement has been entertaining, the real engines of this Avalanche team have been humming since opening night. Nathan MacKinnon has followed up his Hart Trophy campaign with 103 points in 68 games to lead the league in that category. On the blue line, Cale Makar leads all defensemen in goals (25) and assists (53).

While other teams are just fighting for playoff positioning, the Avalanche have their eyes on the big picture. As fun as those wild card races are, it's hard to take your eyes off this Colorado squad each night.

With the Avalanche firing on all cylinders, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with each team's playoff chances provided by MoneyPuck.

The NFC belonged to the Philadelphia Eagles last season, as they rolled through the conference by winning 16 of their last 17 games en route to the Super Bowl. The Eagles weren't viewed as the best team in the conference until the Detroit Lions were eliminated in the divisional round by the Washington Commanders, who were the biggest surprise in the league last season. 

The Eagles lost several key defensive starters in free agency. Milton Williams, Darius Slay, Josh Sweat and C.J. Gardner-Johnson departed via free agency or trade, as Philadelphia is left to pick up the pieces of its championship roster.

There are teams waiting to pounce on Philadelphia's losses. Washington and Detroit are both active in free agency, while the Los Angeles Rams avoided trading Matthew Stafford and kept the core intact by giving Stafford a contract extension. 

Of course, the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings are also in the picture as playoff teams from last season. Then there's whoever comes out of the NFC South (usually ends up being the Tampa Bay Buccaneers).

So where do things stand after the first week of 2025 free agency? Are the Eagles still the top dog or did someone knock them off their throne? Let's rank all 16 teams in the NFC after the first wave of free agency has concluded. 

The Eagles knew they were going to be gutted of talent from their Super Bowl championship roster in free agency, losing five starters over the past week. They have been adding players to one-year deals that are mostly depth moves, as there could be a major move coming to bolster the defense. 

The core of the Eagles is still in place, including 10 of 11 starters on offense. The Eagles are also replacing Kellen Moore at offensive coordinator, but this team is still equipped to make another Super Bowl run. If Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown, DeVonta Smith and that offensive line stay healthy, the Eagles still are in the championship mix. 

The biggest gain for the Lions are all the players they'll get back on defense who were on injured reserve during their playoff loss. Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill, Kyle Peko and Derrick Barnes will all be back as the defense ended up starting 30 players last season (the most for any team since the merger). 

The Lions may have more talent than the Eagles when going through the overall roster (the core of their offense is still in place), but how will Detroit react toward losing both coordinators (Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn)? Ask the 1995 49ers and 2023 Eagles how that fared for them. 

The Commanders are a conference title contender with Jayden Daniels at quarterback, and Washington took care of his blind side by acquiring Tunsil and added another dimension to the offense with Samuel. The offense is better than last year's version, but what about the defense?

Washington needs a pass rusher who can consistently get to the quarterback, and Kinlaw doesn't move the needle much on the interior. Keeping Bobby Wagner was massive for that unit. A tougher schedule in 2025 could also affect the Commanders in the early going, but this team has the talent to make a playoff run again. 

The Vikings had a very good offseason despite the free agent loss of Darnold. They significantly improved the offensive line with the addition of Kelly at center. Hargrave and Allen are massive upgrades on the interior of the defensive line, which will significantly help Jonathan Greenard. 

Minnesota is reportedly rolling with J.J. McCarthy, who will have a lot of talent to work with, and not pursuing Aaron Rodgers. Still, this team won 13 games for a reason last season, and the roster is better. 

Stafford returning was the biggest offseason move for the Rams, who were just 13 yards away from defeating the Super Bowl champion Eagles in the playoffs. Adams is the Kupp replacement at wide receiver and the defensive line gets stronger with Ford as a run stopper. 

The Rams are good, but is Ford enough for their defense to cure their problems against the run? Los Angeles could use some help at linebacker as well. Their top end talent is good enough to get to the Super Bowl. 

The Packers already had a lot of young talent, but had two smart moves in free agency with the Banks and Hobbs signings. They upgraded on the interior of the offensive line with Banks, which allows them to move Elgton Jenkins to center. Hobbs will slide into the slot corner role.

Green Bay can win games, but the Packers need to beat the elite teams in the league. Hence why they are ranked lower than they should be.  

A slight rebuild happened in Seattle, starting with the franchise moving on from Geno Smith and the signing of Sam Darnold. The Seahawks moved on from Metcalf and Lockett and signed Kupp to pair with Jaxon Smith-Njigba, changing up the key skill positions on offense.

Lawrence will assist Leonard Williams up front, and the Seahawks defense improved in Year 1 under Mike Macdonald. There's still work to do, but Seattle is a team that could win 11-plus games next season if Darnold replicates his 2024 season. 

No team was gutted in free agency more than the 49ers, who lost several key pieces on their defense. San Francisco has drafted well in recent years, which allowed the 49ers to move on. San Francisco also moved on from Samuel in favor of Ricky Pearsall, another young player the 49ers like. 

The 49ers are banking on the young talent to back up the core of Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, Brandon Aiyuk, George Kittle, Trent Williams, Fred Warner, and Nick Bosa. This team can still compete for an NFC title if the core players remain healthy. 

The Bears significantly improved the interior of the offensive line for Caleb Williams by adding Thuney and Jackson via trade, making sure their sophomore quarterback is protected. They still need to figure out running back, but the skill positions are there for Ben Johnson to dial up his innovative offense in Chicago. 

The defense should get back to a top-10 level with Dennis Allen as the new defensive coordinator. There will be expectations in Chicago, but they will be measured by how Williams develops in Year 2. 

The best team in the NFC South is still the best team in the NFC South. The Buccaneers didn't improve, but kept key players like Chris Godwin, Lavonte David and Ben Bredeson. Tampa Bay will end up getting a home playoff game and will be a tough out for any team.

This team is better than its ranking, but are the Buccaneers a Super Bowl contender? They'll have to make a playoff run in 2025 for that to happen, but there's plenty to like about this team in this division. 

Hard to tell if the Cardinals got better or not this offseason, as they significantly improved from 2023 to 2024. Head coach Jonathan Gannon was able to lure Sweat to bolster the pass rush, which is where the free agent money was spent. 

The Cardinals have a star at tight end in Trey McBride and a future star at wide receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr. The offensive line is improving as well, starting with Paris Johnson up front. They're an intriguing watch in 2025. 

The Cowboys were cautiously aggressive in free agency, improving at running back with Williams and Sanders after having just six touchdowns as a group last year. Dak prescott being healthy should help, but will this team be able to sign Micah Parsons? 

Dallas had solid moves to make the team better, but how much better are the Cowboys? They still have to improve in the trenches for an opportunity to compete in the NFC East. 

Usually one of the big spenders in free agency, this offseason has been quiet in Atlanta. The Falcons are moving forward with Michael Penix at quarterback, possibly trying to find a suitor for Kirk Cousins after their $180 million blunder. 

Atlanta is the biggest threat to Tampa Bay for the NFC South on paper. 

The Panthers spent big on shoring up the league's worst defense last season, even though a few signings are to be desired. Carolina spent the most money of any NFC team. 

The improvement of Bryce Young has the Panthers hopeful they can compete in 2025. Let's see how Carolina improves, even though the Panthers need help at wide receiver. 

Another offseason the Saints needed to get cap compliant, hindering their ability to improve the roster. There are still core players on offense in Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave, but not enough talent in New Orleans to compete week in and week out. 

Let's see how things change in Year 1 under Kellen Moore. 

The Giants still need to find a quarterback, and maybe looking in the draft if Aaron Rodgers declines to come to New York. None of the free agent options left are enticing as New York is still rebuilding. 

There have been some good signings on defense, but the Giants aren't good enough to score consistently. Could be another long season in New York.

Aaron Rodgers seemingly wants the Minnesota Vikings. Unfortunately for the veteran quarterback, the Minnesota Vikings do not want him. At least for now, according to NFL Media, which reported Wednesday that the Vikings are standing by 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy as their signal-caller for 2025.

Specifically, the Vikings have rejected multiple trade inquiries for McCarthy, per Tom Pelissero, ""telling other teams they're moving forward with"" the Michigan product as their presumptive starter. Minnesota still plans to add another veteran quarterback, Pelissero reported, but Rodgers isn't among the options ""at this time.""

The Vikings may not be completely ruling out a later exploration of Rodgers, according to ESPN, especially if McCarthy ""gets reinjured or [demonstrates] a need for more development time"" ahead of training camp.

This comes days after The Athletic reported Vikings decision-makers were discussing the possibility of pursuing Rodgers, who's reportedly resisted stronger interest from the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers in hopes of the Vikings emerging as a potential destination. Minnesota, meanwhile, only surfaced as a speculated landing spot once 2024 starter Sam Darnold signed elsewhere in free agency.

For Rodgers, a Vikings team-up makes sense: Besides the ironic Brett Favre parallels, going from the Green Bay Packers to New York Jets to wearing purple, he would've found an enviable setup in Minnesota, where coach Kevin O'Connell and playmakers like Justin Jefferson helped Darnold reach career heights in 2024. The Vikings just invested a top-10 pick in McCarthy, however, and have repeatedly endorsed him as a starting-caliber quarterback despite his missing all of 2024 due to injury.

The Giants and Steelers now register as Rodgers' other obvious options for 2025, barring a retirement at age 41. Pittsburgh was previously considered a favorite to sign the former NFL MVP.

They'll tell you the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award has been decided. They'll tell you Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the prodigious and remarkable engine behind the Oklahoma City Thunder, is a shoo-in. They'll tell you SGA's literal odds, a rising voter fatigue, the force of narrative and the power of his team's winning ways has set this thing in stone.

But a survey of likely voters and conversation with those across the NBA -- former players, all-time greats, GMs, scouts -- delivered a fascinating reality: This race between SGA and Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokić is wide open, and those of us that get to choose will have an excruciating decision to make in the coming weeks.

Several media members and NBA bigwigs were flummoxed when pressed to choose, if the vote were today, between the two players.

Don't misunderstand. There is not a trace of disrespect or doubt about SGA's stunning season and rock-solid MVP résumé. He's a superstar, whose league-leading 33 points per game, defensive excellence, exceptional leadership and status as the centerpiece of an OKC team running away with the West make him a wholly worthy favorite.

Vegas certainly thinks so. Sportsbooks have him at a whopping -850 to win MVP. The general narrative out there -- and those can take on lives of their own -- also unrelentingly pushes the notion that the hardware will surely, undoubtedly, irrevocably go Shai's way.

Even a straw poll by ESPN last month that had SGA as the favorite serves as an oft-cited bit of evidence that it's going to be the OKC point guard who hoists the hardware. But things change fast in the NBA.

I have an official vote this year and am currently leaning toward Jokić. Vegas may currently put his odds at either 4-to-1 or 5-to-1 to win, but that just feels off -- and somehow out of touch with the vibe inside the league.

""Are you kidding me?"" one likely voter told me. ""This thing is so close it's painful.""

This race feels like a dead heat.

For starters, a smaller quick survey of CBSSports.com writers this week had Jokić ahead, 5-2. My colleague James Herbert, who also has an official vote, also leans Jokić and, like me, would vote for him if that decision were due now.

Conversations with other NBA media members who are likely to vote for the award this year revealed a similar reality: A brutally close vote, a headache-inducing choice between two players who each deserve this award, and a sense of exasperation and confusion that so many, Vegas included, think this thing is already decided. Many leaned SGA. But almost as many, when pushed, went the other way.

Jokić, too, is having a career year — quite a statement given he's already won this thing three times. He's averaging 29, 13 and 10. Those are career highs in points and assists per game for a three-time MVP. Ditto his 3-point shooting percentage and 3-point assists per game, 41.3% and 4.6, respectively.

Oh, and the 50/40/80 seasons he's on track for would be the first and only of his career, another wow-what-a-season statistical eyebrow-raiser.

Both SGA and Jokić should, were it not for the other, win this year's award. Only one can. And either might, depending on an array of factors and the still-evolving contours of a race as close and hard to judge as any in recent memory.

That sense was driven home in conversations with others across the NBA community about this year's MVP showdown.

Here's a sampling of those talks, all of which underscores the degree of difficulty in choosing between SGA and Jokić, the different ways different people in the league view the award, and the fact this thing is wide open.

""For me, I probably tend to lean into winning. And your impact on winning. And so to me both are MVP candidates, both have had an MVP season, and it's not to say one is an MVP and one is not. But if I had an actual vote I would give it to Shai, because they have won at a much higher level. And winning at that level matters, and I'm going to give an edge to the winning. And that, to me, has Shai as the MVP.""

""I will say this: Shai has a lot more help. I get the voter fatigue around Nikola, I do, but the Nuggets aren't a play-in team without Nikola Jokić. The Thunder are still housing people without Shai. I'd vote for Jokić.""

""You know, this is a tough one because -- Christ,"" he said, laughing. ""This is hard. OK. I've said this before: There's no one who's playing better basketball than Joker. He's playing the best basketball. The 'but' is Shai is playing great too and OKC is kicking everyone's ass -- that winning factor.

""You'd have to lean toward SGA from a winning perspective, and toward Joker from a basketball perspective. There's also the fatigue thing. This happened with [Karl] Malone and [Michael] Jordan -- people got tired of voting for Jordan and went, 'Let's go Malone.' That could be happening again.""

He paused.

""That said,"" he went on, laughing. ""Shit, this is hard! OKC is winning, and they're winning because of SGA.""

Another pause.

""I think you go SGA.""

He paused again. You could almost hear the hedge.

""It really is 50-50. You can't go wrong with either.""

""I think a lot of people have already made up their minds. SGA has been the most consistent all year long. But I'm not one for voter fatigue. Best player is the best damn player. Period. But this year is tough, man. When Joker did 30-20-21, I was like, 'Jesus, man, are you kidding?' And if I had a vote? Geeeeeez.""

He thought it over.

""Man. Man. I think I'm voting Joker.""

""Joker. Close though. Really close. No one in the league makes bad players good, or good players great, more than Jokić. He's like LeBron when he was winning these things. That's not Shai. He's great, amazing. But he's going to go out and get his. He's may be even a better player than Jokić this year. But he doesn't lift that team as much as Jokić does.""

And on and on it goes. SGA just over Jokić. No, Jokić just over SGA. Or maybe the other way around? Who can know? It's so close.

One thing, and maybe only one thing about this MVP race, is clear: The closing few weeks will be critical in a contest between two remarkable players having remarkable seasons in which every twist, turn, and eye-popping performance could end up making the difference.

The Philadelphia 76ers have been publicly criticized quite a bit this season, as they've yet again fallen far short of the championship aspirations they've envisioned. Their handling of Joel Embiid and his nagging knee has been questionable, as the MVP big man has played just 19 games this season. Paul George was recently shut down for the rest of the season as he was deemed ""medically unable to play"" due to an adductor injury in his left knee and a pinky injury he's been playing through. That's in addition to the extensive list of other players injured, including Tyrese Maxey and promising rookie Jared McCain.

With all the injuries, the Sixers are 12th in the Eastern Conference, looking to hold onto their top-six protected first-round pick in this summer's draft. This season has been a massive disappointment, especially after the Sixers looked like big winners of the offseason when they signed George. And now one former Sixers player is calling out team president Daryl Morey for how he runs the team.

Marcus Morris Sr., who was appearing on the ""Kevin O'Connor Show"" podcast this week, was asked about what his thoughts were when he heard Morey uses artificial intelligence to assist in making some basketball decisions. He used the question to explain why he does not trust Morey.

""This will be the first time I've ever said this, I don't trust Daryl Morey,"" Morris said. ""I think he's thinking too far ahead of the way basketball needs to be played. He's trying to do a whole new team, trying to bring guys in -- he's flipping them in and out. Does he even understand the dynamic of being in Philadelphia, what guys you need to play in Philadelphia? Understand how the team needs to gel first before you talk about AI. What does AI do? I understand the effects it can have in other spots, maybe the offense, the numbers and things like that. But telling you what guys you should choose, or which guy fits with what you're trying to do. What has he won? He hasn't won in so long.""

Morris, a 13-year NBA veteran who has not played this season, continued on by bringing up the situation with former Sixers player James Harden who famously called out Morey in a very public fashion while touring around China to promote his new basketball shoes in 2023. At the time, Harden said, ""Daryl Morey is a liar, and I will never be part of an organization that he's a part of."" It was the cherry on top of what was a monthslong feud between Harden and the Sixers over a new contract he was promised by Morey. However, the contract Harden wanted never came and he requested a trade, which landed him with his preferred destination of the Los Angeles Clippers. 

""You tell my guy [James Harden] you're gonna do something for him, a guy you brought from all these teams and then you don't -- like did AI tell him not to pay James Harden this amount of money,"" Morris said. ""Did AI tell him to go get Paul George, hire Nick Nurse? Did AI tell you to get Caleb Martin because he played well in the Boston series? He can't shoot the ball. You got three dominant guys who need the ball in their hand, why is that the first guy you go get? Why do you want to start a brand new team and try to win a championship? I haven't seen any team that has 10 new guys be really good the following year. I don't even know if any team has ever done that. I'm just not a fan of how he goes about choosing players. It's like he's trying to outsmart the game too much.""

Morris played for the Sixers during the 2023-24 season before being traded to Cleveland. He was one of the guys who Morey ""flipped in and out"" after just one season, as the Sixers overhauled their roster going into this season. And it's not the first time it's happened under Morey's leadership. The Sixers have routinely overhauled their roster on a season-to-season basis, trying to figure out what fits around Embiid. First it was Ben Simmons, then it was James Harden and now it's Paul George.

It's been a constant carousel in Philadelphia with no ability to build long-lasting chemistry. And even if chemistry were to be built, injuries seem to always get in the way for this team.

""Some of the things I think that he does doesn't have anything to do with basketball,"" Morris said. ""It's his own values in how he thinks a team should be structured or ran. It's mind-boggling, I just don't understand it.""

The Green Bay Packers finished the 2024 NFL season with injuries plaguing their wide receiver corps. This week they added some reinforcements, signing former Kansas City Chiefs standout Mecole Hardman to a one-year contract, according to ESPN.

The 27-year-old Hardman is coming off his second stint with the Chiefs, with whom he won three different Super Bowls. Originally a second-round draft pick in 2019, the veteran pass catcher primarily served as a special teams role in 2024, accumulating nearly 500 all-purpose yards as a kick and punt returner.

Hardman had a larger offensive role earlier in his NFL career, when head coach Andy Reid deployed his speed as part of the Chiefs' wide receiver rotation. He averaged more than 20 yards per catch as a rookie, when Kansas City went on to win Super Bowl LIV, and secured a career-high 59 catches for 693 yards two seasons later.

The Georgia product joined the New York Jets in 2023 free agency but played a minimal role in just five games before he was traded back to the Chiefs. Hardman went on to haul in Patrick Mahomes' game-winning touchdown pass in overtime of Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers.

He had just 12 catches for 90 yards in Kansas City during the 2024 campaign.

Aaron Rodgers isn't the only hot-button topic currently surrounding the Pittsburgh Steelers. While the Steelers continue to wait for the legendary quarterback to make up his mind, there have been some rumblings regarding the future of Pittsburgh wideout George Pickens following the team's recent trade for two-time Pro Bowl wideout DK Metcalf. 

Pickens essentially threw gasoline on the proverbial fire when he recently posted a photo on social media of him standing alongside Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback and Las Vegas Raiders minority owner. 

When the Steelers traded for Metcalf, the thought was that the Steelers want to see how Pickens' game would elevate with another top-tier wideout playing opposite him. That is likely still the plan for the Steelers, but it's safe to assume that Pittsburgh would at least explore trading Pickens if a team reached out and made it an offer that made sense. Pickens is entering the last year of his rookie contract, and it's unlikely the Steelers will bring him back after signing Metcalf to a five-year, $150 million deal. 

If the Steelers do consider trading Pickens, they would probably want a player who can replace him in the starting lineup as part of the transaction. Pittsburgh is trying to snap its eight-year drought without a playoff win and need proven assets at the skill positions in order to possibly do that. 

Several NFL teams would want Pickens, a 2022 second-round pick who ranked second in the NFL in average yards per catch in 2023. Here's a look at five possible options if Pittsburgh elects to trade Pickens this offseason. 

Pickens' recent social media post made the Raiders' inclusion on this list inevitable. But even if Pickens' didn't post that picture of he and Brady, the Raiders make sense as a possible trade partner given their current receiver situation. 

Las Vegas desperately needs a receiver and would likely trade as high as a second-round pick to acquire one of Pickens' stature. The Raiders, however, don't have any receivers the Steelers would likely want sans veteran Jakobi Meyers, who recorded a career-high 1,087 receiving yards in 2024. Unless Las Vegas would be willing to deal Myers, this trade would likely revolve more around draft capital. 

Denver is intriguing as it has two possible trade candidates in Courtland Sutton and Marvin Mims. Sutton, a seven-year veteran who caught 81 passes for 1,081 yards and eight touchdowns last season, is entering the final year of his current contract. Mims, a 2023 second-round pick, caught six touchdown passes last year and was named to the Pro Bowl as a returner the past two seasons. 

Based on his talent and contract situation, it's more than possible that Denver may be willing to part with Sutton in exchange for Pickens, whose big-play potential could help Bo Nix take the next step following a highly successful rookie season. In return, the Steelers would get a productive veteran wideout (Sutton) to pair with Metcalf. It's also conceivable to assume that the Steelers would have a better shot at signing Sutton to a new deal than Pickens. Sutton, 29, has already signed one big contract, whereas Pickens is surely eyeing his first big deal next offseason. 

San Francisco would make sense on several fronts. With Pickens in tow, the 49ers would have flexibility when it comes to Brandon Aiyuk, the formerly disgruntled wideout who suffered a season-ending injury last year following a lengthy and nasty holdout. Aiyuk ultimately got his new contract, but it didn't come without some collateral damage. The 49ers could have Aiyuk and Pickens for at least one season before possibly moving Aiyuk. 

Pittsburgh wouldn't want to take on Aiyuk's salary, so this trade would likely be about acquiring a high draft pick unless the 49ers would be willing to deal Jauan Jennings, a 2020 seventh-round pick who set career highs last year with 77 receptions for 975 yards and six touchdowns. Pittsburgh would still need some sort of additional competition in this scenario. 

Indianapolis has a solid receiving corps but might be interested in trading for a top-tier wideout who can help Anthony Richardson reach his potential. The Colts have two possible trade candidates in Michael Pittman Jr. and Alec Pierce. Pittman is going into the second year of a three-year, $70 million deal. Pierce, who led the NFL in average yards per catch last year, is entering the final year of his rookie contract. 

Pierce is younger, but the better option here in a possible trade would likely be Pittman, a more proven player who has two years remaining on a very affordable contract. 

Arizona needs to bolster its receiving corps if it's going to contend for a playoff spot in 2025. A proven wideout would also help open things up for Marvin Harrison Jr. following his good but not great rookie season. Pickens would fit the bill, although it would likely cost Arizona a second-round pick since veteran Zay Jones is likely the only wideout Pittsburgh would be interested in. 

This trade would probably end up helping Arizona more than Pittsburgh. With Pickens, the Cardinals would have a pretty impressive list of skill players that also includes Harrison, quarterback Kyler Murray, tight end Trey McBride and former Steelers Pro Bowl running back James Conner.

DAYTON, Ohio (AP)  Amarr Knox's layup with a second left lifted Alabama State to its first NCAA Tournament win Tuesday night, 70-68 over Saint Francis (PA) in a matchup of No. 16 seeds at the First Four.

Knox scored 16 points to help the Hornets (20-15) earn a date with No. 1 overall seed Auburn on Thursday in a South Region game at Lexington, Kentucky.

“You just said it: March Madness,” said Alabama State coach Tony Madlock. “I think I've talked about this with all of the media, that all of our games end just like this, either we have to get a bucket or we have to get a stop. Fortunately enough we were able to get a bucket to finish this game off.”

After forcing a turnover in the final seconds, Alabama State had the ball out of bounds under its own basket. With the score tied, Micah Simpson threw a long pass nearly the length of the court toward a scrum of players in the lane at the other end - not unlike a Hail Mary in football.

The ball deflected off a teammate and right into Knox's hands near the rim, giving him a simple layup for the winning points.

“We put our tallest athletic person to go get the ball,” Knox said. “And fortunately everybody tipped the ball, and it landed to me, and I got the rebound and made the layup.”

Saint Francis chose not to pressure Simpson on the inbounds pass.

Officials determined there was 1 second remaining after Knox's layup, but a desperation heave by the Red Flash fell short.

Saint Francis, which lost its season opener at Dayton, made an unlikely return to the arena as the 19th team to enter the NCAA Tournament with a losing record. Those teams are now 0-19.

“These guys for 34 games left it all out on the court for us,” coach Rob Krimmel said. “I know that they're disappointed. That's the thing that I love about them. They're champions, and nothing can take that away from our group.”

Alabama State is making its fifth NCAA Tournament appearance.

Micah Octave's steal and dunk put the Hornets ahead by four with 1:36 left, but the Red Flash tied the score at 68 on Chris Moncrief's 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining.

Juan Cranford Jr., playing in his hometown, led Saint Francis with 18 points. Valentino Pinedo scored 17 for the Red Flash (16-18), who squandered a nine-point lead.

Saint Francis shot 59% and went 6 of 12 from 3-point range to take a 39-34 lead into halftime.

“We've been in that moment, that situation, a few times this year, and we knew we just had to come out and play ball,” Knox said. “We stayed positive. We knew as soon as the next half started that we would come out, fly around, play aggressive and just do whatever it takes to win the game.”

The Red Flash committed 15 turnovers, leading to 26 points for the Hornets.

“We turned the ball over too many times,” Cranford said. “We turned the ball over that many times, you can't expect to come out with a good outcome.”

Following a missed shot by Knox down the stretch, TJ Madlock was fouled scrambling for the rebound. He missed the front end of a 1-and-1, but Saint Francis committed a turnover at the other end, setting up the dramatic finish.

Up next: Auburn.

“I'll figure that all out tonight,” Tony Madlock said. “We're going to enjoy this tonight. We're going to have this bus ride, I guess a couple hours down the road to play in Lexington at Rupp Arena. How can you beat that?”

Things didn't start out so well for Saint Francis. During player introductions, the officials asked several Red Flash players to remove their black undershirts. By rule, undershirts must be the same color as the jersey. Saint Francis wore red.

Alabama State didn't attempt a free throw until there was 5:09 remaining. The Hornets went 1 of 4 from the line.

As sure as schools paying players next fall, the day is coming when the SEC places five teams into an expanded College Football Playoff.

That won't happen in 2025, but it may in 2026 when the CFP potentially expands to 14 teams and the Big Ten and SEC push for four automatic qualifiers. Until then, the criteria from the first 12-team playoff remain and the SEC will have to rely on its teams impressing the selection committee. Do wins matter more than strength of schedule? That worries the SEC, which is built on beating up its teams and leaving several title contenders with three losses.

The league nearly had four teams in the fold in 2024, but the committee smartly placed SMU ahead of three-loss Alabama and South Carolina. In the end, the SEC advanced only one of its three teams into the semifinals.

Who will contend for a national championship this fall? The usual contenders remain, but we're taking a chance on another team that has proven to be fool's gold the last two seasons. We kept the list of contenders to five teams, but we could easily argue for seven. 

Kalen DeBoer cannot afford to miss the playoffs in Year 2. An underwhelming 9-4 start to his Alabama career places the onus on him to lift the Tide into the 12-team CFP this season, and he must do so while replacing a quarterback and refilling several holes along the offensive and defensive lines, the primary units responsible for success or failure in the SEC. Still, the Tide ranks No. 2 in the initial SP+ ratings. The favorite to replace Jalen Milroe at quarterback is Ty Simpson, who DeBoer has praised often, but keep an eye on Austin Mack and five-star Keelon Russell in the offseason as newly-hired offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb reconfigures the offense into something that may more resemble the Washington team he coordinated to an appearance in the 2023 National Championship Game. 

Russell is undoubtedly the future after ranking No. 2 overall in the Top247 Rankings but he'll likely sit on the bench. Right tackle and left guard give us concerns, and the defensive line will need more help from the portal. The second level of the defense is elite, particularly at the safety spots led by Keon Sabb and Bray Hubbard.

We'll know early in the season whether Alabama is a contender. The Tide travel to Florida State in the season opener and close September with a trip to rival Georgia (Sept. 27). Potential risers South Carolina and Auburn are the toughest road games remaining on the schedule.

You can't keep Kirby Smart down for long. By any measure, a CFP appearance is enough to keep a fan base happy, but not in Georgia. The loss to Notre Dame in the quarterfinals was downright disappointing and 15 starters from that team are gone. The receivers never did quite break out last season and the defense, although great, was not up to the elite level of previous seasons. Plus, the offensive line struggled in run blocking. Things seem dour on paper, right? Wrong. 

Smart aggressively sought game-breaking receivers and delivered with transfers Zachariah Branch (USC), Micah Bell (Vanderbilt) and Noah Thomas (Texas A&M) to go along with an impressive haul of five high school recruits. Plus, the Bulldogs continue to be the marquee program for signing, keeping and developing high school talent, so refueling the defensive and offensive lines is not as difficult as it would be for other programs.

Despite losing all that talent, Georgia returns five top 10 tacklers and three of its top six receivers. How does Georgia replace All-American safety Malaki Starks? They signed three defensive backs out of the portal.

Georgia's semi-favorable schedule also helps. The two toughest opponents on paper come to Athens (Alabama and Texas), leaving trips to Tennessee (Sept. 13) and Auburn (Oct. 11) as games to circle.

Brian Kelly is not afraid; he's angry. How else can you explain the Tigers terrorizing the transfer portal, outpacing the field by a wide margin to record the No. 1 class with only 16 commitments? As my colleague John Talty opined earlier this spring, perhaps the best thing to happen to LSU was Bryce Underwood picking Michigan. LSU saved its money and spread the wealth to land bluechip after bluechip, picking up eight players from SEC rivals, and solidifying the defense with highly-rated pass rushers (Patrick Payton and Jack Pyburn), and two ready-made stars at receiver (Nic Anderson and Barion Brown).

Our biggest concern is the offensive line, which loses four starters. Quarterback Garrett Nussmeier is the SEC's leading returning passer (4,052 yards) but benefited from the best protection in the league (15 sacks allowed). Transfers Josh Thompson and Braelin Moore must live up to the hype along the interior.

The schedule is challenging but manageable. The Tigers do not play back-to-back road games, which is incredible, but trips to Clemson, Ole Miss, Alabama and Oklahoma are gigantic landmines. The Tigers open the season at Clemson, by the way, for Death Valley bragging rights. 

Lane Kiffin had us fooled into believing Ole Miss was a playoff contender again last season. So, why are we taking the bait for a third time? That schedule is incredibly tempting, with five of the first six games at home and the most challenging road trips not coming until back-to-back jaunts to Georgia and Oklahoma. That's right: no Alabama or Texas on the schedule, either. 

The nation's attention will be on quarterback after record-setting passer Jaxson Dart's career ended but that's not the spot that gives us pause. The roster must reload with a slew of transfers and prep additions. The defensive line is of particular concern, though Suntarine Perkins (10.5 sacks) returns as Walter Nolen and Princely Umanmielen chase their NFL dreams.

Ole Miss loses half a dozen receivers, including three future NFL players, but returns Cayden Lee (874 yards) and adds five more from the transfer portal as Kiffin continues his Moneyball approach, replicating or exceeding production in the aggregate. Oklahoma State's De'Zhaun Stribling (882 yards), Penn State's Harrison Wallace III (720 yards), West Virginia's Traylon Ray (426) and Wake Forest's Deuce Alexander (400 yards) lead the nation's No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports.

Expect Austin Simmons, who backed up Dart for two years, to take over at quarterback. Remember, he came into the game and led a touchdown drive in that blowout of Georgia last season.

Can Arch Manning deliver Texas a national championship? Sure, but he'll need to deliver under pressure and take over games as the Longhorns break in a new offensive line and replace two of the top three receivers. Texas draws a difficult schedule, too, starting with the season opener at defending national champion Ohio State (eke!). The Longhorns return only one starter along the offensive line, meaning Manning's duality will be on full display, especially early in the season. 

The defense seems poised for another top-10 finish but must replace elite defensive tackles for a second consecutive year. Vernon Broughton and Alfred Collins are gone but the staff reloaded with three transfers. Plus, edge rusher Colin Simmons returns after leading the team with nine sacks and forcing three fumbles and picking off a pass last season.

The defense will be fine, and we trust Steve Sarkisian to deliver on offense — and perhaps hunt down one more offensive gamechanger in the spring transfer portal window. We expect an explosive attack with a more dynamic quarterback replacing Quinn Ewers. Circle those trips to Florida (Oct. 4) and Georgia (Nov. 15) on the calendar as games that will separate the SEC's CFP contenders and pretenders.

Wildcards to watch: Florida, Tennessee

Free agency hasn't been kind to the Philadelphia Eagles, which they expected in the aftermath of their Super Bowl championship. The franchise expected to part ways with key players from that title team in order to maintain a championship window while trusting their young talent to fill the void. 

The Eagles spent their money to retain one of their own free agents in linebacker Zack Baun, yet knew several good players were on their way out the door. Philadelphia allowed defensive tackle Milton Williams, pass rusher Josh Sweat, guard Mekhi Becton, cornerback Darius Slay, cornerback Isaiah Rodgers, and linebacker Oren Burks to depart in free agency and traded safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson in order to create extra cash to sign key young players in future seasons. 

Since the Eagles lost many free agents, they're expected to get compensatory picks for the 2026 draft. This will significantly increase an already growing pick total over the next two drafts. The Eagles' projected draft pick count has reached 20, including the compensatory picks the Eagles will receive in 2026. 

So what's the Eagles' draft pick situation look like after the key free agents have departed? They'll have enough picks to make a major move this offseason if they so choose.

The Eagles certainly aren't going to use all 20 of these draft picks, as they will use the future draft capital to acquire players and move up and down the draft board over the next two years. Having all these picks is a luxury for general manager Howie Roseman, who is in position to strike for a major acquisition this offseason. 

Judging the Eagles' offseason moves, acquiring an edge rusher is something to be on the lookout for over the next several weeks. The Eagles did sign Josh Uche and Azeez Ojulari to one-year contracts, but those moves don't guarantee any of those players making the roster -- even with their current situation at the position. 

Philadelphia isn't going into the year with Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt as their starters on the edge, and Bryce Huff made an average annual salary of $17 million to be a healthy scratch in Super Bowl LIX. These are the Eagles' top three options ahead of Uche and Ojulari. 

What the Eagles have at edge rusher simply isn't good enough, and the franchise has enough draft capital to make a move to improve at the position. The Eagles believe in having a premium pass rusher in Vic Fangio's defense who can consistently get to the quarterback. They currently don't have one at this moment.

They could make a move to improve the pass rush in the coming weeks. Having a projected eight picks in the first three rounds over the next two years will certainly help.

When asked about his future, McNeese coach Will Wade could have sidestepped the speculation surrounding his next move on Wednesday. Instead, he acknowledged reality: he's been in contact with NC State as the Wolfpack close in on a new head coach.

""Yes,"" Wade said when asked if he, his agent, or anyone close to him had spoken to NC State.

Hours later, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' Matt Norlander that Wade is expected to take the job. 247Sports' NC State site, PackPride.com, also reports that Wade and the Wolfpack have reached an agreement on a deal. 

Just had a source follow up on @giglio_OG's report to say Will Wade's deal with NC State is getting close but not entirely done. Nothing has been signed, but, barring anything unexpected over the next couple of days, Wade is expected to be the next coach at NC State.

Wade's No. 12 seed Cowboys are preparing to face No. 5 seed Clemson on Thursday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. But as much as March is about the madness on the court, it's also about the coaching carousel. Wade isn't shying away from that part of the equation. He said he addressed the situation directly with his team.

""We addressed it head-on,"" Wade said. ""I talked to them Saturday about it. Here's what it is, here is where we are. It was just me and our players and we all talked about it. I'm aware of what I have got going on. They're aware of what we've got going on. You just hit it head-on. We're all on the same page with everything.""

With Kevin Keatts out, NC State has been closing in on Wade, and the expectation now is that he'll be the Wolfpack's next head coach. The 42-year-old former LSU coach owns a 243-104 record across four Division I coaching stops since breaking in at Chattanooga in 2013 at age 30.

""The smoke suggests Wade, but New Mexico coach Richard Pitino and Tennessee assistant Justin Gainey have also been involved,"" CBS Sports' Matt Norlander wrote earlier this week. But as the process nears its conclusion, momentum has settled on Wade.

Wade has done a masterful job in two seasons with McNeese, guiding the Cowboys to consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and rebuilding his reputation following a messy exit from LSU. Thursday's opponent, Clemson, is also Wade's alma mater. If the Cowboys pull off an upset, his return to the big stage will only grow louder.

""Coach Wade always tells us, don't worry about the outside noise,"" McNeese guard Javohn Garcia said. ""We just worry about what's going on now. We're going to take one day at a time, one game at a time and just play it like it's our last. We don't care about everything else that's going on with that type of stuff so we're just going to worry about what's going on now.""

Eight days until Opening Day ... 

We're talking about bold predictions today and I've got one for every team today. And I want to start with a new one I cooked up just this afternoon: Kristian Campbell is a top-five second baseman in 2025. 

I was high on Campbell early in the spring, then I backed off as he struggled in Grapefruit League action, and his path to playing time looked blocked following the Alex Bregman signing. But all signs lately have pointed towards one conclusion: None of that seems to matter. 

Sure, Campbell has struggled this spring, hitting .167/.286/.222 in official action. But he impressed in the Spring Breakout game and has apparently done everything else right, to the point where one prominent Red Sox beat writer reported Tuesday that Campbell appears to be the favorite for the second-base job, ""in the mind of the team decision-makers."" 

That's not a guarantee, of course, but it sure seems like the Red Sox have wanted Campbell to earn the job – they'd be going through an awful lot of trouble of potentially upsetting Rafael Devers to move him to DH just to have David Hamilton be the starting second baseman. I've moved Campbell up pretty aggressively in my rankings – inside the top 200 and around 13th at second base. It's a position with plenty of decent depth, but few players with the kind of difference-making upside Campbell has – though I will say, you should probably draft Matt Shaw ahead of Campbell in any drafts remaining, because he was in the Cubs lineup for the first game against the Dodgers, batting fifth, to boot. 

But Campbell is absolutely worth drafting if he has a chance to make the roster. He's coming off a breaking season that saw him force his way to Triple-A while hitting .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers and 24 steals in 115 games. The Red Sox have a crowded enough roster that Campbell's margin for error is pretty slim, but his price in Fantasy drafts has never really reflected his considerable upside – 310.8 ADP in the month of March – and that could go down as a huge mistake. I'd certainly much rather make a 15th-round bet on Campbell than a fifth-round bet on Matt McLain. 

In fact, I'm willing to make a bold prediction right here and now: Campbell will be a top-five second baseman in Fantasy this season if he makes the Opening Day roster. That's still something of an if, but it's one I feel more confident about than I did 24 hours ago.

Today is all about planting our flag on bold predictions. A whole bunch of them – one for all 30 teams, in fact. We've covered the Red Sox, but we've still got 29 to get to, so let's not waste any more time. 

The movement profile on Burnes' cutter has been a little inconsistent, which isn't what we wanted to see after he rediscovered it last September. But given that he got it back last September – so he clearly knows what he needs to do – I have faith in Burnes locking in when the games matter. He's backed up by a good defense and a great offense, is a rare workhorse in today's game, and I'm betting on the strikeout rate getting back up to better than one per inning. With his volume, that still gives him standout potential. 

Because he's about to enter his fourth full season and hasn't been as good as he was as a rookie since I think people forget how young Harris is. He just turned 24 11 days ago and still has high-end tools – including better raw power than he gets credit for. If he stays healthy, I think he's one of the better bets for batting average at the position and has the upside to be a true five-category superstar. There's a chance we're talking about him as a borderline first-rounder in 2026, and he'll headline a resurgent Braves offense that sees returns to form for Austin Riley, Matt Olson, and, once May hits, Ronald Acuna. 

Mayo isn't breaking camp with the Orioles, and he isn't happy about it – he called going back to Triple-A Norfolk a ""lose-lose"" for his career."" It's hard to argue he should have been on the roster based on his .501 spring OPS, but this is still a guy with 34 career homers in 145 games at Triple-A over the past two seasons, and I still want to bet on the upside here. Maybe Jackson Holliday flames out, or maybe the Orioles decide they need more from one of their corner spots – or maybe he gets traded for the pitching upgrade they so desperately need. One way or another life, uh, finds a way, and Mayo is going to make his presence felt before long. 

The nice thing about a catcher-based bold prediction is the bar is so low – David Fry was a top-12 catcher in 335 at-bats last season with just 14 homers, four steals, 51 RBI, and 44 runs. Teel could do that in two-thirds of a season, and I suspect he'll get at least that opportunity, even though he isn't breaking camp with the White Sox. He'll be a must-roster catcher as soon as he's up. 

Imanaga looked fine in his season debut Tuesday against the Dodgers, and it was nice to see his fastball velocity was actually up after some worries in the spring. I still think the margin for error here with his approach is pretty slim, and while I think he should always be helpful in WHIP, it's not hard to see Imanaga's ERA ballooning with just a bit more bad luck with homers – a few more leaving the yard than last year, and a few more come with multiple runners on base. He hasn't been a full-on fade for me, but he hasn't been a target either. 

Hunter Greene is going about 150 picks ahead of Lodolo – more in recent weeks – but I will just point out that, until Lodolo got hurt last season, he was clearly the team's best pitcher:Through June 18:

A blister totally derailed Lodolo's season while Greene just kept getting better and better, and he should go ahead of Lodolo. But Greene's injury history, full as it is with shoulder and elbow issues, is a lot scarier than Lodolo's finger and leg injuries, and I don't totally buy the leap Greene made in terms of quality of contact suppression. This is as much about being skeptical about Greene as it is about faith in Lodolo, but it's a little bit of both. 

Maybe we file this one under ""Wishful Thinking"" because no player in professional baseball is looking more snake-bitten than DeLauter these days. He has barely played as a professional – 96 games since 2022 – and had his spring derailed with early-March sports hernia surgery that will knock him out until May at the earliest. Scouts have consistently raved about him when he is healthy enough to play, and even with all the missed time, the Guardians have reportedly been considering fast-tracking his path to the majors. I hope we see him this summer and he can put all this behind him. 

I'll admit, there aren't exactly a ton of alternatives here, so this is more about my relative lack of excitement about Tovar, who has some of the worst plate discipline in the majors and is neither a good enough hitter nor an active enough base-stealer to overlook. Brenton Doyle is the obvious choice to outperform Tovar, but I also think Michael Toglia is just a flat-out better hitter – .358 xwOBA in 2024 vs. a .289 mark for Tovar – and I think one of Nolan Jones, Zac Veen or maybe Ryan McMahon could beat him out, too. And maybe we see someone like Chase Dollander or Adael Amador could get the call early enough to outperform Tovar, too. 

Okay well yeah, Tarik Skubal is one. But there's no shortage of interesting candidates beyond him, beginning with the underrated Jack Flaherty, plus Reese Olson, Casey Mize, and Jackson Jobe. This could be the best rotation in baseball in a hurry. 

This one shouldn't even be that bold – he was the No. 7 third baseman in 2023, and now he's playing in arguably the single-best park in the majors for his swing. He's being drafted near 200th overall on average, as the 16th third baseman, I guess because he spent a half-season playing in arguably the worst park for his swing and was terrible. Paredes just seems like the most obviously undervalued player in 2025 drafts, full stop. 

Most projection systems have India getting 80 or fewer, and I just can't wrap my mind around that pessimism. He's a good on-base guy – .352 for his career, .357 last season – who runs the bases well and is going to hit leadoff ahead of Bobby Witt and Salvador Perez. The biggest concern here is injury, but if India repeats his 151 games from 2024, I think 100-plus runs is a fairly easy bet. 

The talent is still there. Don't argue with me about the talent. Over his past 150 games, Trout has hit .267 with 44 homers, 101 runs, 87 RBI, and nine stolen bases – and he showed last season he can still be a contributor in the latter category if he wants to be. ""Oh, he can't play 150 games lol"" is what you're thinking, to which I respond simply: What if he does? He's the No. 28 outfielder off the board and there aren't more than a handful going ahead of him who are definitely better players. We're going to get one more big Trout season, I just know it. 

They've got two being drafted in the top 20 in Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, plus Roki Sasaki is SP24 and Tyler Glasnow is SP29, so expectations are pretty high. But this is a rotation filled with injury risks and plenty of depth options that should allow them to give everyone time off as soon as they need it. They're playing for October, not June, so the first sign of danger is going to lead to an IL trip – and none of this is even accounting for the likelihood of a six-man rotation whenever Shohei Ohtani is ready to go. There are just more ways things can go wrong than right for everyone here. 

Griffin Conine? Eh, maybe? Connor Norby? Why not? Matt Mervis? Wouldn't be my pick, but it could happen! The Marlins are probably going to be a pretty bad offense, but they've made a point of targeting guys with big raw power and a proven track record at the minor-league level, and someone is going to surprise us and flirt with a 30-homer season. My sleeper pick? Deyvsion De Los Santos, who hit 40 homers as a 21-year-old in Double-A and Triple-A last season and has a chance of being a Jake Burger clone whenever he gets the call. 

What if we're just writing him off too early? Hoskins made it to 26 homers last season in just 517 plate appearances last season despite it being his first season back from a torn ACL, and what if he just needed a full year to get his legs back under him? It sure looks like that might have been the case this spring, as he has hit six homers in just 11 games while striking out only six times in 34 trips to the plate to date. It's just spring, but Hoskins may not be quite finished just yet.

He was one on a per-game basis last season, but it doesn't seem like he's getting much credit for it based on his SS23 ADP. But, while he was limited to just 86 games last season, he had played at least 135 games in three straight seasons prior to that, so something close to a full season isn't as far-fetched as you might think. 

The PECOTA projection system has Rice 10th on the in projected homers, so I'm gonna count this one. Rice flashed plenty of pop even as he struggled last season, and with Giancarlo Stanton's timetable totally unclear as he deals with injuries to both elbows, Rice looks like the best bet to be the team's DH on Opening Day. And then there's this: The five hardest-hit balls of Rice's career have come this spring. He may not even need that short porch in right field, but it won't hurt, either. 

This one feels like it might not be bold enough – he just did it in 2022, after all! But any time you're picking one player to beat the field in any category, it's pretty bold. Alonso, of course, has the benefit of hitting behind Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto, arguably the best run-producing opportunity in the league. And, while he rarely puts up useful batting average marks, his ability to hit for big power without huge strikeout issues makes him well-suited for outlier RBI totals. 

They were bottom-five last season, but they've got a few things going for them this time around. One is just a solid all-around lineup full of breakout candidates, headlined by Lawrence Butler, but also featuring names like Shea Langeliers, Tyler Soderstrom, and Jacob Wilson who all seem like decent bets to improve on their 2024 production – and that's not to mention top prospect Nick Kurtz, who could be a fast riser after making it to Double-A the same summer he was drafted. And then, of course, there's the new ballpark in Sacramento, which should play much better than the old park in Oakland did. Pitching could still be an issue, but I think the A's are gonna be a fun watch this season. 

He hasn't gotten to 40 since 2018 and hasn't had more than 30 since 2021, so this one feels like a real long shot. Except that Turner was on pace for 50-plus before a hamstring injury early last May and hasn't really lost more than half a step – he was still 96th percentile in sprint speed last season despite the hamstring injury. Maybe the Phillies just won't want him to risk it given his trouble staying healthy, but if they give him the green light, Turner still absolutely has the skills to be an elite speed source. 

This would actually represent a bit of a step back from last season when they won 44% of their non-Skenes starts. But I just hate what the Pirates did this season – or, more accurately, what they didn't do – and I hope they face divine retribution for their inaction. They didn't sign a single player to a multi-year contract, and their biggest free agent expenditure was $5.25 million on Andrew Heaney. As long as Paul Skenes is healthy, the Pirates should be pressing the pedal to the metal to try to win, and they're content to tread water. Their front office shouldn't be rewarded for this offseason of complacency. 

The Padres' top prospect is Leodalis De Vries, a shortstop who won't even turn 19 until October; their No. 2 prospect is Ethan Salas, a catcher who turns 19 in June. I don't expect we'll see De Vries this season unless he goes absolutely nuclear, but Salas has already seen Double-A and figures to start the season there – and I always say, once you get to Double-A, you might only be a good month or two away from the call. The Padres have little in terms of long-term attachments at the catcher position, so Salas could be promoted aggressively if he hits the ground running this season – and, for whatever it's worth, The Athletic had a piece just this week that noted that team officials believe a late-2025 debut for De Vries isn't out of the question.

Okay, so Logan Webb is the obvious one, and I think at this point, Robbie Ray wouldn't be a bold prediction. So, who else? I think there's still room for Justin Verlander to be a useful Fantasy option – despite his struggles in 2024, he still had good control and limited damage on contact, leading to a respectable 3.78 expected ERA. A good defense and home park could push that more squarely into the mid-3.00s, giving him top-40 potential. And then let's go with Hayden Birdsong, who flashed big bat-missing potential on his way to the majors last season, where control issues proved too much to overcome. But he hasn't walked anyone this spring and seems to have forced his way into the rotation, so there's some upside here if he can just avoid too many walks. With that home park and a solid supporting cast, there's room for some upside in this overlooked rotation. 

The upside is always there, which is why he was a top-five pick this time last season. But a weirdly punch-less first half last season has scared many drafters off. Rodriguez is putting in extra work this spring to hopefully avoid the slow starts that have become a trademark for him in his young career. I'm not convinced that just getting extra reps in spring is going to instantly fix Rodriguez's early-season woes, but I'm also not at all convinced that he's just going to be a sub-.700-OPS bat in April for the rest of his career. If he can avoid the slow start and just hit like he's capable of for six months instead of his usual four, we're talking about a potential MVP winner, with a ceiling that might not be too far behind Bobby Witt's. 

Only, one of them won't be a catcher. Yeah, unless this is your first time checking in this offseason, you know we're all super-high on Willson Contreras, who is slated to be the team's primary first baseman. The hope here is that it helps keep him healthier and unlocks a full-season ceiling we've only gotten flashes of before. But the sneakier call is Ivan Herrera, who gives me a bit of a Braves-era William Contreras vibe. Like Contreras, Herrera was never a huge prospect before his partial-season breakout in 2022, when he hit .278/.354/.506 in 376 plate appearances with the Braves; not far off Herrera's .301/.372/.428 line in the majors last season. I'm not expecting Herrera to be the best hitter at the position like Contreras has become, but I do think there's plenty of upside here thanks to his strong plate discipline and above-average pop. His .366 expected wOBA in 2024 was actually the best at the position last season among players with at least 250 plate appearances, just ahead of – yep, you guessed it – Willson Contreras. 

Among second-base eligible players, only Ketel Marte and Marcus Semien had more than Lowe's 21 last season, so maybe this one isn't so bold. Except, you know, Marte had 15 more than him, so there's a pretty big gap to bridge here. But Lowe is probably more well-suited to hit for power than anyone at the position, with his 21 in 2024 coming in just 385 at-bats. He'll need to stay healthy, of course, but he'll also have some help in the form of the Rays' new home park, which has identical dimensions to Yankee Stadium, a pretty good park for left-handed power hitters. 

I'm grouping them together because Leiter and Rocker have always been grouped together, dating back to their time as one of the most hyped pitching duos in NCAA history at Vanderbilt. Neither's pro career has gone as expected since, because of similar issues – injuries, and an inability to consistently throw strikes with an expanded arsenal. I rank Leiter a bit ahead of Rocker right now based on a more impressive spring, where he has shown a more well-rounded menu of pitches, but both have electric arms that could see them take off with the right tweaks. And, with Jon Gray and Tyler Mahle on the IL to open the season, both should get a chance to show what they can do early on. I'm willing to take a flier on either in the later rounds of any drafts between now and Opening Day. 

Well, then who? Maybe Anthony Santander, though I'd be more willing to put my neck out for Bo Bichette, who was only drafted around six spots later than Guerrero last year, about three picks later in 2023, and was actually slightly ahead of him in ADP in 2022. Now, Guerrero is a first-rounder and Bichette is barely a 10th-rounder in most leagues. Based on last season, that difference in price is more than deserved, of course. But we know history didn't begin in 2024, don't we? It's fair to have concerns about Bichette, and obviously, I'm ranking Guerrero well ahead of him. But if Bichette is the better player this season, it wouldn't surprise me – and it wouldn't have surprised any of you 12 months ago, either. 

I'm not necessarily saying the Nationals are going to trade Abrams, though that's a live possibility at any point. But I don't think he's long for the shortstop spot one way or the other in Washington as they start to make the push out of the rebuilding phase and into the competing phase. Unless his defense takes a significant step forward at shortstop, they're going to have to consider an alternative – either moving him to second base or possibly to the outfield, where his speed could play in center. If Abrams hits like he did in the first half of last season, he's the kind of player you accommodate and find a spot for; if he scuffles like he did after the break, he might be the kind of player you sell low on just to get him out of the picture. The first few months of this season are going to be very important for Abrams' future.

When asked about his future, McNeese coach Will Wade could have sidestepped the speculation surrounding his next move on Wednesday. Instead, he acknowledged reality: he's been in contact with NC State as the Wolfpack close in on a new head coach.

""Yes,"" Wade said when asked if he, his agent, or anyone close to him had spoken to NC State.

Hours later, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' Matt Norlander that Wade is expected to take the job. 247Sports' NC State site, PackPride.com, also reports that Wade and the Wolfpack have reached an agreement on a deal. 

Just had a source follow up on @giglio_OG's report to say Will Wade's deal with NC State is getting close but not entirely done. Nothing has been signed, but, barring anything unexpected over the next couple of days, Wade is expected to be the next coach at NC State.

Wade's No. 12 seed Cowboys are preparing to face No. 5 seed Clemson on Thursday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. But as much as March is about the madness on the court, it's also about the coaching carousel. Wade isn't shying away from that part of the equation. He said he addressed the situation directly with his team.

""We addressed it head-on,"" Wade said. ""I talked to them Saturday about it. Here's what it is, here is where we are. It was just me and our players and we all talked about it. I'm aware of what I have got going on. They're aware of what we've got going on. You just hit it head-on. We're all on the same page with everything.""

With Kevin Keatts out, NC State has been closing in on Wade, and the expectation now is that he'll be the Wolfpack's next head coach. The 42-year-old former LSU coach owns a 243-104 record across four Division I coaching stops since breaking in at Chattanooga in 2013 at age 30.

""The smoke suggests Wade, but New Mexico coach Richard Pitino and Tennessee assistant Justin Gainey have also been involved,"" CBS Sports' Matt Norlander wrote earlier this week. But as the process nears its conclusion, momentum has settled on Wade.

Wade has done a masterful job in two seasons with McNeese, guiding the Cowboys to consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and rebuilding his reputation following a messy exit from LSU. Thursday's opponent, Clemson, is also Wade's alma mater. If the Cowboys pull off an upset, his return to the big stage will only grow louder.

""Coach Wade always tells us, don't worry about the outside noise,"" McNeese guard Javohn Garcia said. ""We just worry about what's going on now. We're going to take one day at a time, one game at a time and just play it like it's our last. We don't care about everything else that's going on with that type of stuff so we're just going to worry about what's going on now.""

The 2025 Valspar Championship is set to get underway on Thursday, March 20, and several players will enter this week's event confident they can secure the victory. Justin Thomas has 15 career victories on the PGA Tour and has finished T-9 or better in three of his last six starts, which includes a runner-up showing at The American Express in January. Thomas tied the course record (62) at TPC Sawgrass last week and will enter the 2025 Valspar Championship as one of the best putters on tour, ranking second in putting average (1.649) and ninth in one-putt percentage (44.05%). Thomas will play alongside Jordan Spieth and Karl Vilips through the first two rounds with the trio teeing off on Thursday at 1:23 p.m. ET. 

Meanwhile, Xander Schauffele has an impressive streak of 59 consecutive made cuts, the most on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods from 1998-2005. Schauffele, Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood are the 14-1 co-favorites, according to the latest 2025 Valspar Championship odds. Some of the other 2025 Valspar Championship contenders include Sam Burns (22-1), Corey Conners (25-1), Sepp Straka (25-1), Shane Lowry (25-1) and Will Zalatoris (25-1). Before locking in your 2025 Valspar Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

Now that the 2025 Valspar Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.

One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Valspar Championship: Sam Burns, a five-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and doesn't even crack the top 10. Burns has had tremendous success at this event in recent years. He finished on top of the Valspar Championship leaderboard in 2021 and 2022 before finishing sixth in 2023. 

However, Burns has battled with inconsistency in 2025 after securing a T-8 finish at The Sentry in January. He's coming off a missed cut at the Players Championship and has finished T-48 or worse in three of his past four starts on the PGA Tour. The 28-year-old has struggled with accuracy off the tee this season, ranking 113th in driving accuracy (57.35%). Burns also ranks 117th in one-putt percentage ((38.89%) and 154th in strokes gained: approach to green (-0.514). He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values in the 2025 Valspar Championship field. See who else to fade here. 

Another surprise: Alex Smalley, a 45-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.

Smalley is still searching for his first win on the PGA Tour, but he has all the tools needed to be in the mix at Innisbrook this week. He's been competitive this season, finishing T-18 or better in five of his first seven starts on the PGA Tour. He's coming off a T-14 showing at the Players Championship and is ranked second in scoring average (68.36), third in strokes gained: total (1.805) and 11th in strokes gained: off the tee (0.572). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2025 Valspar Championship bets. See who else to pick here. 

The model is also targeting two other golfers with odds of 40-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.

Who will win the 2025 Valspar Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the 2025 Valspar Championship odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

Happy midweek, everyone! We're officially one week into the new league year. Today's Pick Six newsletter is brought to you by Cody Benjamin, with tidbits on all the latest from around the NFL.

Be sure to subscribe right here, to ensure you never miss a daily dose of NFL updates. And keep on reading for everything from big Aaron Rodgers news to the latest free agency buzz. Let's get to it.

We now know one thing about the Aaron Rodgers sweepstakes: Minnesota probably isn't going to be the former NFL MVP's next home. Despite Rodgers reportedly eyeing the Vikings as a preferred landing spot (and Minnesota brass internally discussing the possibility of pursuing the former Green Bay Packers star), the Vikings have been telling teams they're moving forward with J.J. McCarthy as their quarterback, according to NFL Media, even rejecting multiple trade inquiries for the 2024 first-round pick.

Where does that leave Rodgers? His last obvious options consist of the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants. That is unless the 41-year-old decides to hang up the cleats instead. Both the Giants and Steelers have reportedly talked contract with Rodgers' camp, and Pittsburgh was previously considered a favorite to land the former Green Bay Packers star. Minnesota, meanwhile, is set to add a different veteran as insurance for McCarthy, who's set to open 2025 under center with Sam Darnold out the door.

New England spent big to beef up the defensive trenches early in free agency, committing $104 million to Milton Williams. Now the Patriots have added to the other side, signing the former Vikings center to a two-year deal. Bradbury started all 88 games he played for Minnesota after arriving as a first-round pick in 2019, and he's in line to replace David Andrews as the heart of the line protecting Drake Maye.

The offseason is far from over. But the first big waves of free agency are in the books, so it's a fair time to take stock of the best signings and trades to start the 2025 roster-shuffling. Which is precisely what we did. Here's a sneak peek at some of our favorite acquisitions so far:

Check out our full list of the top 10 moves of the 2025 offseason right here.

Hey look, Green Bay got Jordan Love another wide receiver! Well, sort of. After ending the 2024 season with just about every top pass catcher banged up, the Packers have signed Mecole Hardman to a one-year deal, bringing the three-time Super Bowl champion wideout to Lambeau. It's been a while since Hardman was a featured part of an offense, but he also offers experience as a kick and punt returner.

As mentioned above, the Vikings no longer appear to be an option for Aaron Rodgers. But are the Giants and Steelers really going to convince him to suit up in 2025? We decided to take a deeper dive into the quarterback's remaining options, and not only that, but rank them according to their pros and cons. Here's a preview of the rundown, which includes the possibility of not playing at all:

5. Cleveland Browns: They could still use quarterback help, even after adding Kenny Pickett via trade. But they're squarely in rebuild mode and could draft a signal-caller early as a result.

4. Tennessee Titans: They have other proven veterans in the lineup, including Tony Pollard and Calvin Ridley. But Tennessee is set up to use the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft on a quarterback of the future.

3. New York Giants: Rodgers is already familiar with New Jersey after two seasons with the New York Jets. And maligned Giants brass is motivated to win now. Yet staying on MetLife Stadium turf just to go from one bad New York team to another isn't exactly a dream sendoff.

2. Retirement: Rodgers doesn't have a clear path to a full-time gig with a guaranteed contender. Calling it a career might prevent further muddying of his Hall of Fame legacy as a Packers icon.

1. Pittsburgh Steelers: Getting over the wild-card hump would require outlasting the tough AFC North. But under Mike Tomlin, the Steelers are almost always in playoff contention. DK Metcalf's arrival gives them two Grade-A pass catchers. And Pittsburgh could be ""all in"" on a short-term veteran solution.

Speaking of Pittsburgh quarterback options, Steelers brass recently met with one of the top signal-caller prospects of the 2025 class, taking the Alabama prospect for dinner before his pro day. Milroe may or may not be a Day 1 selection in April, but he figures to be an early round target, thanks to his athleticism. Some have already begun to speculate the Steelers could pair him with the recently re-signed Mason Rudolph.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Most intriguing offensive free agent signings: Seahawks, Titans among teams making impactful moves","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/most-intriguing-offensive-free-agent-signings-seahawks-titans-among-teams-making-impactful-moves/","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:34:00 GMT","

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Given that we're into Week 2 of NFL free agency, we have more to look back on than we do to look forward. Most of the impactful signings happen during the first week (the first few days, really), which is obviously in the rearview mirror at this point.

This season, it seems like most of the true impact players changing teams in free agency were on defense. But that doesn't mean there isn't plenty to dig into on the offensive side of the ball. Plenty of notable players changed teams, including a couple of quarterbacks. 

With that in mind, we want to take a look at some of the most interesting signings that happened on offense. The key word to keep in mind there is interesting, and that can be on a schematic level or some other level, but it doesn't necessarily mean it has to include the most expensive or noteworthy players. (Although the list below obviously does include some of those players.)

In the space below, we're touching on eight different signings, though a few of them come in pairs because there were several teams that double dipped in defensive free agency. Without further ado ...

These might be the two most fascinating bets of the offseason. The Vikings seemingly did not try all that hard to bring Darnold back, if you look at the structure of the contract he accepted from the Seahawks. And the Rams paid a bunch of money to move on from Kupp and bring in Davante Adams instead. (More on him in a minute.) The Seahawks are clearly higher on both players than are their former teams. 

They should theoretically fit in new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak's offense, which is similar to those run by Kevin O'Connell in Minnesota and Sean McVay in Los Angeles. But Darnold -- who struggles with pressure -- is going to play behind a very suspect offensive line, and Kupp -- who has struggled to stay healthy and seemingly fell off over the second half of last season -- is leaving the McVay and Matthew Stafford cocoon. How these two signings work out will go a long way toward determining how the NFC West shakes out.

These signings are interesting less for what the players themselves will bring to the table than for what they signal about the NFL Draft. Many people thought the Titans would be in the veteran quarterback market, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Instead, they beefed up their offensive line, seemingly setting the stage for them to draft Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick. And that's certainly interesting.

We identified this signing as one we'd like to see when doing our NFC free agency matchmaker:

I debated between giving the Rams Adams and Chris Godwin, with the theory being that the latter could slide easily into Cooper Kupp's old role. But the Rams probably want to have Puka Nacua do more of that stuff, and getting someone who has more inside-outside versatility (and a better track record of health, given the health concerns they already have with Nacua) might make more sense. Either way, giving Matthew Stafford two elite receivers is always fun, so let's do it again.

Adams has played in this style of offense before during his time in Green Bay, and he can be both the prototypical X receiver and the guy who moves around the formation and forces defenses into uncomfortable situations. Pairing him with Nacua and giving Stafford a different kind of weapon than he had with Kupp is going to be really cool to watch.

The Chiefs going out and paying Moore -- who has been a backup throughout his entire four-year career -- to protect Patrick Mahomes' blind side is, technically, really interesting. Maybe not in a good way. But it's definitely something to which we need to devote a lot of attention. Mahomes got extremely frustrated with his left tackle play this past season, to the point that the Chiefs felt that they had to move one of the best guards in the NFL outside for the first time in his career. Moore has given up 36 pressures on 446 pass-blocking snaps, according to Pro Football Focus, an 8.1% pressure rate. That's ... not great. Kansas City is betting on some major improvement.

Is Hopkins as good as he once was? No. Obviously not. We saw that last season, when he was traded to the Chiefs and then remained a rotational player for the entire season and playoffs despite predictions that he'd eventually take over a larger role. But this signing and fit remains interesting because he's a specific type of player who the Ravens have never had during the Lamar Jackson era: The ball-winner. The contested-catch guy. It's going to be fascinating to see how that connection develops -- even if Hopkins is a secondary or tertiary passing-game option.

Fields got a chance to start early last season for the Steelers, and it looked a lot like what things looked like when he was in Chicago. He ran the ball A LOT -- 9.2 times for 38.5 yards per game. He threw the ball less often than almost any other starter, and he completed 66.3% of his passes at an average of 6.9 yards per attempt with just five touchdowns and one interception in six games. (He also had five rushing scores.) Playing for a team coached by a staff that came from the Detroit Lions -- a team whose defense Fields tore apart several times, particularly on the ground -- should provide some major intrigue. He also has some better weapons in New York (Garrett Wilson, Breece Hall) than he did in Chicago or Pittsburgh, so that could take his game to another level.

While the Concacaf Nations League is a tournament that will showcase the best that the confederation has to offer, this year's edition comes during a tenuous political climate between participants Mexico, Canada, Panama, and the United States. In the lead-up to the tournament, Canadian head coach and American Jesse Marsch spoke out against President Donald Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state during a Nations League press conference in February. Mexico coach Javier Aguirre even commented on Trump signing an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, saying, ""For me, it's the Gulf of Mexico.""

Preparing to face Panama on Thursday, March 20 at SoFi Stadium on Paramount+ at 7 p.m. ET, United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino. who was not at the press conference in February, wanted to make no mistake where the focus was. 

""I think we cannot mix political things with sport in my career. It's not because I don't want to talk,"" Pochettino said. 

""We have qualified people who can talk about politics, but I am not an expert on politics. I have, of course, my ideas as a 53-year-old, but it's not the point for me to mix.

""Soccer is soccer, or football for me. But we want to destroy Panama...When I say we destroy, it's in a [sporting] way. We want to beat them and win the game, and I think that motivation can't be from different diplomatic problems that we cannot be involved in, players cannot be involved in. 

""We need to play for us, we need to feel proud to defend our flag. We need to play for our country, always on the pitch trying to be better than the opponent. I think it's a big mistake if we talk about politics, because people are not waiting for us to talk in this way.""

Pochettino continued to state that soccer is a sport that should be enjoyed because to him it is the best sport in the world and something fun for the fans to enjoy. Tensions are high between the United States and Canada on a sporting level as showed during the 4 Nations Hockey tournament where Canadian fans booed the U.S. national anthem and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also posted a celebratory message on X when Canada won that tournament.

""You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game,"" Trudeau said.

""I'm not going to get too political right now. I've made my views be known,"" Marsch said. ""You can see the climate for sports in North America has been elevated for national teams. I'm really hopeful that this tournament can be the best reflection of our societies & that we don't have to waste time booing national anthems and getting caught up in politics.""

Two games into the new season, two Los Angeles Dodgers wins. Wednesday night in Japan/Wednesday morning in the United States, the Dodgers wrapped up the two-game Tokyo Series sweep of the the Chicago Cubs (LAD 6, CHC 3). Shohei Ohtani gave the people at the Tokyo Dome what they wanted and slugged a home run to help Los Angeles to Wednesday's win.

""I know Shohei puts his pants on like we all do, one leg at a time, but if there's every a superhero, I think Shohei just seems like a superhero,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. ""In the biggest of games, in the biggest of moments, he seems to always deliver.""

Wednesday's game occasioned the MLB debut of right-hander Roki Sasaki, the latest sensation to make the jump from Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball to MLB. The flamethrowing 23-year-old opened Wednesday's game with four straight 100 mph fastballs and his fastball averaged -- averaged -- 98.0 mph in the game. Eight of his 37 fastballs registered at 99 mph and above. 

Sasaki got countryman Seiya Suzuki, the second batter he faced, to swing through a 99.3 mph fastball for his first MLB strikeout.

Roki Sasaki gets his first Major League strikeout! #TokyoSeries pic.twitter.com/oX7iIARjJk

The sheer velocity was certainly impressive and Sasaki overpowered Cubs hitters at times, though he was very wild Wednesday. He threw only 19 of his 56 pitches within the Statcast strike zone, plus a handful of others just off the edges. Officially, Sasaki threw only 25 of his 56 pitches for strikes, or 45%. The MLB average strike rate was 64% in 2024. 

Following a quick 1-2-3 first inning, Sasaki retired only five of the final 11 batters he faced. He walked five of those 11 and also hit a batter, and needed a line-drive double play to scape a second-inning jam. In the third, Sasaki walked three straight batters, including Kyle Tucker with the bases loaded, before striking out Michael Busch and Matt Shaw to limit the damage. 

""I thought we did a pretty good job. He got himself in trouble with some walks,"" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said after the game. ""We did put pressure on him that we needed to, but he made pitches especially in the third inning when we had bases loaded and one out. There was a real opportunity there to get him out of the game.""

Despite the free bases, Roberts still saw growth in his rookie.

""Just the way he responded in that situation, he didn't have his best command tonight, I think it just speaks to how competitive he is,"" Roberts said. ""That was a pivot part of the game. He's just such a great competitor ... Even when he didn't have his best stuff early -- again, I think a lot of it was emotions -- but it speaks to how competitive. That he can make pitches.""

Sasaki pairs his high-octane fastball with an outlier splitter. It's an outlier because the pitch averages a spin rate right around 500 rpm, which is exceptionally low. The average MLB splitter sat 1,303 rpm last season and only 10 pitchers averaged less than 1,000 rpm on their split. The spin is so low that Sasaki's splitter has knuckleball action. It can break in either direction.

""The unique thing about his split-finger is it's very unpredictable,"" Roberts said prior to Wednesday's game (via Dodger Blue). ""It  can go to the left, it can go straight down, and it can go to the right.  Roki doesn't even know what it's going to do when he throws the  baseball. If the pitcher doesn't know, it's certainly hard for the  hitter to hit the split. The main thing is, the split has got to be  presented as a strike. If it looks like a strike out of the hand, it's  going to be a very effective pitch.""  

As unique as Sasaki's splitter is, the Cubs swung at only two of the 15 splitters he threw Wednesday because he was so wild, and because so many splitters were far outside the zone for easy takes. Nerves surely played some role in Sasaki's wildness. In the end, he showed dynamite raw stuff Wednesday. It's true top-of-the-rotation ability, but Sasaki also must improve his command.  

Like the other three starting pitchers in the Tokyo Series, Sasaki was pulled with a fairly low pitch count Wednesday because it is mid-March, and he's not fully built up for the season. Sasaki threw 46 and 41 pitches in his two spring training starts, respectively, though he went to the bullpen following his second start to continue throwing and build his pitch count up.  

""I want to see how all the pitches I have -- my fastball, my splitter -- will play against big-league hitters,"" Sasaki said through an interpreter when asked what he hopes to learn and improve moving forward. ""There will be issues that come up from that. I want to be in a position where I address those issues as early as possible."" 

Sasaki is the third-youngest Japanese-born player to debut in MLB after playing in NPB at 23 years and 136 days, according to MLB.com. Only Masanori Murakami (20 years and 118 days in 1963) and Tomo Ohka (23 years and 123 days in 1999) were younger. We ranked Sasaki as the seventh-best free agent available this past offseason. Here's the write-up:

The short hook: Explosive young righty with durability questions 	

Sasaki is the most talented pitcher not already in an MLB  organization. He's been on the global radar since throwing a  19-strikeout perfect game as a 20-year-old in 2022. He combines elite  velocity with a devastating swing-and-miss splitter/forkball. Sasaki has  dealt with his share of injuries, limiting him to 33 combined starts  across the last two seasons. His earning potential is completely  suppressed because of his amateur free agent classification.  Nevertheless, a fully actualized Sasaki has a chance to be an immediate  impact starter in the majors. 	

Sasaki, 23, joined the Dodgers on a minor-league contract with a $6.5 million signing bonus in January. MLB's international signing rules limited him to a minor-league deal rather than a massive contract on par with Yoshinobu Yamamoto's because he is under 25. The San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays were the two other finalists to sign him. 

The Dodgers' offense gave Sasaki plenty of support Wednesday. They scored two runs in the second inning and later tacked on with home runs from Tommy Edman (solo), Enrique Hernández (two-run), and Ohtani (solo). Edman's home run was the first of the 2025 MLB season. Sasaki exited the game with LA leading 5-1. They went on to win the game 6-3.

Los Angeles came back to win the first game at the iconic Tokyo Dome on Tuesday. The Cubs and Dodgers will now return home and resume their regular seasons next Thursday, on the traditional Opening Day.

The conclusion of a college baseball game between Jackson State and Prairie View A&M turned into a powder keg following a walk-off win. The two teams started to trade punches and shoves after Prairie View A&M notched a walk-off double. Nine different players have been suspended for four games apiece by the SWAC.

The incident happened after Saturday's game when Trenton Bush connected on a walk-off double to win the game 7-6. Bush began to celebrate as he approached second base when he was met by Jackson State left-fielder Davione Hull, who made a beeline for Bush.

Hull then could be seen shoving another Prairie View A&M player, which led to the brawl getting out of hand. The frustration could also been seen by the catcher launching the ball out of play as Prairie View A&M celebrated.

Due to the position of the camera behind home plate, it was hard to see exactly what took place during the brawl on the field. The teams were eventually separated.

According to the Clarion Ledger, Jackson State outfielder/pitcher Arjun Huerta grabbed Bush's bat and threw it into the crowd. As the fracas was unfolding, Prairie View A&M's public address announcer was attempting to tell fans not to make their way onto the field despite the chaotic situation, alerting them that they would be banned from future games if they entered the field of play.

Prairie View A&M and Jackson State were both fined $25,000 as a result of the brawl by the SWAC. The conference didn't reveal exactly which specific players received suspensions, but six players were from Jackson State and the other three were from Prairie View A&M.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Ja'Marr Chase reset the non-quarterback market with his new four-year, $161 million deal (with $112 million guaranteed), as the Bengals broke the bank to keep Joe Burrow happy this offseason by re-signing his two top targets in Chase and Tee Higgins. 

Chase has been one of the NFL's most productive and consistent receivers since joining the Bengals, as he and Burrow picked up right where they left off at LSU. Over his four years in Cincinnati, Chase has 395 catches for 5,425 yards and 46 touchdowns, acclimating himself quickly to life in the NFL and establishing himself as one of the best pass-catchers in all of football. While the on-field transition has been easy, off the field Chase is still trying to get used to life in southern Ohio. 

On Wednesday, Chase and Higgins met with the media in Cincinnati to discuss their new contracts, and Chase couldn't help but note that while he has set down roots and come to love the city, he still isn't used to the (in his eyes) less than stellar food. 

Still getting used to it 😂 pic.twitter.com/dC7gu6Y1a1

""At the end of the day, the food's not the best, but we can work on that,"" Chase said with a laugh. ""I'm from New Orleans, I'm not used to the food yet."" 

I'm sure the Skyline Chili defenders will be readying their replies to Chase, but it's hard to blame a man that grew up in one of the great food cities in the world, New Orleans, for finding it hard to adapt to the cuisine of Cincinnati. I particularly love that Chase tries to position it as an area for improvement with the ""we can work on that,"" like Cincinnati just needs to get in the kitchen and grind a little harder. With $112 million guaranteed, Chase could do his part and import a couple chefs from New Orleans to open a restaurant and help bring Cincy's food scene up to his standards.

Filed under:

We need Rodgers to make a decision so we can (hopefully) stop talking about him so much — but we're not holding our breath. 

The first week of free agency is in the rearview mirror and there are a number of big-time changes that have happened across the league.

We are still waiting on a handful of things to shake out before the waters will fully calm, but they mostly have to do with some older quarterbacks who are more about headlines than results these days. More on that in a bit.

As free agency warped several NFL rosters that means that our thoughts and opinions on them have changed. We here at The Skinny Post, Michael Peterson and RJ Ochoa, are here to let you know what we think.

Let's discuss. 

RJ: 

Last week we discussed how the Aaron Rodgers of everything feels so boring right now. In the time since then it feels like, judging by the internet, the idea of him joining the Minnesota Vikings has picked up steam.

Personally speaking, I hate reboots. Don't ruin something that once was. I'm not saying that I loved the time when Brett Favre was the quarterback for Minnesota, but this would be such a boring way for Rodgers' career to end. Obviously Rodgers has changed the way that people feel about him over the last few years, but we can all admit that he is still one of the greatest to ever play the game. For him to go out in the exact same fashion as his predecessor would be so flat and dull.

Michael:

I really, really thought we would go at least one week without talking about Aaron Rodgers, but here we are. He sure does have a way of staying at the forefront of the football news cycle, no matter where we are on the calendar.

So here' the thing: I think the Vikings are the best case scenario for Rodgers if he wants to chase the last bit of success in his career. However, I actually think signing him would be close to the worst-case scenario for Minnesota. Kevin O'Connell has built one of the best locker rooms in the NFL and the last thing I could see him do is bring in a guy who has long been a guy to be at odds with teammates who aren't playing up to “his standard.”

I just think signing Rodgers would be akin to tossing a brick into a drying machine. It's going to be loud and it's going to get busted up from the inside until it no longer runs smoothly.

Michael:

I knew the Bengals were going to get deals done for both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, but I did not expect the latter to also sign for over $100 million, as well.

Chase's $161.1 million over four years is insane but runs right along with what he's done for that offense. Higgins $115 million over the same span is the most for a team's WR2 in NFL history. That's what I can't wrap my head around. He's a good receiver! He's also missed 10 games over the past two seasons! That's a lot of money for a player that has never stayed healthy for an entire season outside of his rookie year in 2020.

The Bengals handing out this money is them pushing all the chips in on the offense being the exact same as it was in 2024. Bringing them both back is a good start, but history sort of says it was an outlier and they're more than likely going to revert back towards the mean than continue on this upwards trajectory.

I could be so incredibly wrong! I get that! But imagine if either gets hurt or they simply don't play all that well comparatively. Is the defense going to be any more competitive in 2025? It was kind of the one big thing that kept them out of the playoffs!

But hey, huck it, chuck it football. Amirite?

RJ:

Forgive me for making this about something other than Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins here, but I do not know that we have seen a single player change a franchise the way that Joe Burrow has with the Bengals.

Obviously the biggest sign of this is how competitive the Bengals have been, but consider that we are talking about one of the more frugal franchises in the league and how they are dishing out cash left and right (seemingly). A big reason for this is/was obviously that Burrow asked them to keep his weapons in tow in Chase and Higgins.

I'm not saying that the Bengals are suddenly completely different, but there is no question that their eyes have been opened and that they are willing to do what they need to in this window. That is very cool. 

What a home run of a pick Burrow continues to be, especially for Bengals fans.

Michael:

My biggest winner is split between a pair of NFC North teams in the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings.

New Bears head coach Ben Johnson had a good plan in his first offseason and he stuck to it by signing a brand new trio of players to reshape the interior of the offensive line. Drew Dalman was the best center available. They then trade for Rams right guard Jonah Jackson and Chiefs All-Pro left guard Joe Thuney So yeah, life is good for Caleb Williams! He needed protection and Johnson delivered.

For the Vikings, my reasoning is simple. They needed to get better along the interior on both sides of the ball. They did just that by signing defensive tackles Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave for Brian Flores while adding center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries for Kevin O'Connell.

Bam. Those are much more beefy and intimidating trenches for the Vikes.

As for a loser, I think the Raiders are a fringe team in that regard for me. The move to trade for quarterback Geno Smith obviously raises their floor a good amount, but they made no signings to help build the unit around him. The Seahawks had a good group of weapons for him to rely on. The Raiders essentially have just Brock Bowers at tight end. They need a new WR1 (because Jakobi Meyers should not be that) and that would keep them from having a WR3 named Ramel Keyton (is that even a real person?). Defensively, it's also just Maxx Crosby with no other real standout name.

This team just needs...more. Everywhere.

RJ:

For me the biggest winner is the Los Angeles Rams. This time a few weeks ago we thought that Matthew Stafford was gone and now not only is he not... but Davante Adams is opposite of Puka Nacua. They appear primed to run unchallenged through the NFC West.

From a losing standpoint, I think I have to stay in the division and go with the San Francisco 49ers. They have gotten picked apart and done nothing to really help their roster from an overall perspective. I have no idea why anyone can believe they will be fine by just running this all back next season.

RJ:

My answer is a bit strange here, but I am going with the Seattle Seahawks.

The reason this is strange is because I haven't changed my mind at all. I came into this offseason feeling like they were in a really interesting spot to either commit to Geno Smith or to a full rebuild. By moving on from Geno they appeared headed in one direction, but then in signing Sam Darnold they seemed to be content with just treading water.

I have no idea what the Seahawks are doing. It is weird. I don't like it. Fix it. Someone. Anyone.

Michael:

I'm going to stick in the NFC West and go with the Rams here for essentially the same reasons you touched on in the previous prompt.

I thought their late-season success was a little fluky due to how pedestrian Matthew Stafford's passing numbers were for most of the year and prior to their moves made in free agency I would have expected them to actually fall short of the postseason in 2025.

That's now changed thanks to some really savvy signings that don't actually fill their roster holes, but further emphasize their strengths. The first was the move to sign Davante Adams to replace Cooper Kupp. Packers coach Matt LaFleur is from the Sean McVay coaching tree so if there's any other coach who knows how to use him the best, it's the latter. I'm actually expecting a pretty big year from Adams.

Secondly, the Rams stole defensive tackle Poona Ford from my Chargers and I'm upset about it. The Rams already have a great foundation to their defensive front with 2024 rookies edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske. They did NOT have to add Ford following his breakout season, but they did, and now they're going to be even more of a pain in the rear to block.

In a weird way, the Rams seem to have gotten better by leaning even further into where they already excelled instead of trying to round out the lackluster parts of their roster.

March may wind up belonging to the Florida Gators

The Florida Gators are top seed as the NCAA Tournament begins and while history is full of examples that prove earning one of those doesn't guarantee you anything... this whole thing feels like it is theirs to lose.

Florida is coming into the tournament hot after taking care of Tennessee with relative ease in the SEC tournament final and many oddsmakers believe Todd Golden's squad is going to win it all. 

In case you think I am exaggerating... think again. Our friends at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Gators with the second-best odds to cut down all of the nets at +350. Only Duke is ahead of them at +280. Auburn comes in line right after Florida at +550 which really heightens, as many have noted, how strong the SEC was overall. It makes sense that the conference's best team has a strong shot relative to the main goal.

You may find my opinion one that you agree with, but I always like to double-check these sort of things and preferably prefer to do so with people who know more than I do. Thankfully this week offered me the chance to sit down with Ian Eagle and Clark Kellogg to discuss the tournament at large, plus their partnership with Wendy's, and both gentlemen believe that this could be Florida's year as well.

Clark Kellogg: “I think Florida's the most complete team in the field. When you look at the back court, the front court, depth, versatility, two-way players... I think they've been as impressive as Auburn and I think they're a little more explosive than every team in the field... this Florida Gators team is the team that I've picked to win it all.”

Ian Eagle: “I do know that in this tournament if you have superb, elite guard play... you can win the whole thing. And I think that's how the Gators are approaching this. They are, to me, top to bottom, probably the most impressive team that I've seen this season.”

Ian touched on guard play and Florida has that in serious fashion at the moment. Walter Clayton Jr. is one of the top guards in the country and the Gators roll deep with Will Richard, Craig Brown and Donnell Harvey as other options. It is a necessary ingredient to Ian's point.

Florida tips off against Norfolk State on Friday at 6:50pm ET and Ian will actually be on the call for that game with Bill Raftery, Grant Hill and Tracy Wolfson. You can watch it on TNT (thankfully I didn't have to make the obligatory truTV that everybody has this time of year).

As noted Ian and Clark were made available thanks to Wendy's and were pretty excited about it. How could they not be, Wendy's is delicious.

As the Official Hamburger of March Madness®, Wendy's is ensuring viewers can have fresh, never frozen beef* as millions tune into the action with a $1 Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger and $1 Double Stack™ with an additional purchase exclusively with the offer in the Wendy's app to fuel their appetites throughout the tournament.

Our thanks to Ian, Clark and Wendy's for the time. Best of luck to the Gators.

Filed under:

With Myles Garrett digging in his heels, the Browns decide to take the draft's top defender in Penn State's Abdul Carter.

The first week of free agency has come and gone and it went a long way toward changing what was actually the first rendition of this mock draft. We went back to the drawing board over the weekend and I think we've got it in a good place following the plethora of events that happened over the last eight or nine days.

Before anything new and crazy happens before I have time to hit “publish” on this monster, let's go ahead and dive in!

The Titans need a consistent player at the quarterback position if they ever want to get back to competing in the AFC. They stay at No. 1 and take the best quarterback in the draft. There's a lot to love about Ward's calm and collectedness in the pocket which keeps him ready to make plays out of structure when the time arises.

Myles Garrett signed back with the Browns so that's at least one massive problem solved for the Browns this offseason. The other involves who will be throwing passes for the team this season, but all reports and rumblings seem to point to a veteran being signed (Russell Wilson anyone?)

With that in mind, the Browns stick here at No. 2 and land the draft's top defensive prospect in Carter to pair with Garrett. If one side of the ball has to carry the majority of the load for the Browns in 2025, it might as well be the defense which could have one of the scariest pass rush duos in the league with Garrett and Carter.

This is not a particularly strong quarterback class and that surely has helped Sanders' stock this draft season. He's got a great head on his shoulders, he competes with a short memory, and he's always ready to meet the moment. I view Sanders as a low-floor quarterback with upside if he lands in the right situation. Is that situation the current iteration of the Giants? I don't believe so, but the G-Men need a QB and they get the next best after Ward here.

The Patriots once had a great defensive player who also found a way to score touchdowns on offense (I think he might be their head coach now?) and they get another player with the same upside but x1,000,000. The 2024 Heisman Trophy winner comes off the board to New England, which needs help on both sides of the ball, and they get the extravagant Hunter to help get the ball back for second-year QB Drake Maye. How much he truly ends up playing on offense remains to be seen, but this is great value for a team that wants to bounce back quickly to competitiveness under Mike Vrabel.

The Jaguars don't need a quarterback, edge rusher, or another player at a premium position so they get to take the best player available in Graham. The former Wolverine is a wrecking ball in the middle who uses his wrestling background to toss and throw would-be blockers at will en route to disrupting quarterbacks in the pocket. This move doesn't immediately turn them around, but it's a great place to start under the new regime.

The Raiders are not in line to land a truly impactful quarterback in this year's draft so they pivot to another player who could also have a sizable impact on the offense in Year 1. Jeanty is the best running back in this class and the Raiders would love to see him paired with a veteran quarterback signed in free agency. That could be Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson, both of whom would love to hand the ball off to Jeanty.

New head coach Aaron Glenn will want to keep his edge rusher group as one of the roster's best position groups so I have him taking a shot at Stewart, one of the NFL Combine's best testers.

The production wasn't there for Stewart in 2024 (1.5 sacks) but his athletic testing was comparable to that of Myles Garrett when he came out of the same program. New York already has both Jermaine Johnson and Will McDonald, but every good to great defense needs at least three impactful edge rushers to make sure they're always getting after the quarterback at a high level each and every week.

Bryce Young started to take a step in his development following his benching and now the Panthers feel a bit rejuvenated about his future prospects. If they want to keep his needle pointing upward, they need to give him a true No. 1 receiver and that's not going to be veteran Adam Thielen or Xavier Legette anytime soon. The 6'4 McMillan has an elite catch radius and the physicality to be the Panthers' new X receiver. He'll make life much easier for Young while the two grow together in the years to come.

Former Chargers and Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore is now the head coach of the Saints and that leads me to believe he'll look to immediately improve the 21st-ranked offense. Having a dual threat running back in Alvin Kamara and a budding receiver in Chris Olave is a good start, so let's go ahead and round out that grouping with the draft's top tight end in Warren. Mr. Everything from Penn State could learn a thing or two from Taysom Hill, a guy who's been doing exactly that in New Orleans for the past seven years.

The Bears have filled a number of needs thus far in free agency, including interior offensive linemen and edge rusher. Those moves allow them to grab the draft's top safety here in Starks.

The former Bulldog is a smart and savvy defensive back with high-level processing. He's cut his teeth for three seasons as a starter in Athens and that will surely allow him to hit the ground running in Chicago. He'll challenge the aging Kevin Byard for the starting spot in Year 1.

Now that Robert Saleh is back as their defensive coordinator, expect the defense to take a leap back towards the recent standard in San Francisco. Getting the draft class' best pure cornerback back is a good place to start as Johnson falls just outside the top 10 to the Niners.

Johnson is extremely confident in his off-man and zone skills where he can show off his elite instincts for finding the football. Saleh may have to make him more comfortable in delivering in run support, but overall the Niners should be more than happy getting who many believe to be the top cornerback in the draft after Hunter.

The Cowboys absolutely must continue giving Dak Prescott the proper weapons to throw to as it can't always be ONLY CeeDee Lamb each and every year. Dallas signed running backs Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders to help build a decent backfield but the receiver is still so lackluster. Behind Lamb, Prescott's top options are Jalen Tolbert and KaVontae Turpin, the team's return man.

Golden provides Prescott with an option who can help take the top of the defense and threaten YAC over the middle on intermediate routes. His speed will force more eyes off of Lamb, opening up more throwing lanes than he was able to find during the 2024 season.

I'm not the biggest fan of forcing great college tackles to play guard due to length questions or any nit-picky measurement of some kind. The thing is, regardless of Campbell's sub-33” arms, I just think he'd be one hell of a guard. He's got all the physical ability in the world to play wherever he wants on the line, but I think he could have a Zack Martin-type career should he end up transitioning inside.

Campbell could do a lot worse opening up the A and B gaps for a runner like De'Von Achane, as well.

After the show he put on at this year's combine, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to see Emmanwori go much higher than expected to a team who has fallen in love with his combination of size, speed, and athleticism. At 6'3 and 220 pounds, he's got the skillset to thrive near and around the box while also being able to hold his own on the back end in two-high looks.

New Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo deployed the undersized Akeem Davis-Gaither (6'2, 228) as the weakside run-and-chase backer in the Bengals' 4-3 defense, and that's easily where I could see Emmanwori spending most of his time as a member of the Colts.

The Falcons land this year's Jim Thorpe Award winner (nation's top defensive back) and a First-Team AP All-American halfway through the first round. The 5'11, 194-pounder played mainly in the slot for the Longhorns and was a disruptive force who used his notable physicality to smother short to intermediate routes thrown his way.

His man coverage skills still leave a bit to be desired as he struggles to keep connected at top of route stems. Coincidentally, Barron did not test in the agility drills at the combine and you have to think he may have been trying to hide his biggest shortcomings with that move.

Still, he's a very smart defender with a great sense for route combinations. He'll be a great pick for a zone-heavy team like the Falcons.

Harmon is one of my favorite prospects in this draft as a disruptive, high-motor defensive tackle that immediately gives juice to a front seven. He's truly gifted in one physical trait, but he's overall an extremely solid player with one of the higher floors at his position.

The one-year star for the Oregon Ducks posted 10 tackles for loss and five sacks en route to being named a Second-Team All-American in 2024. He uses his 6'5, 313-pound frame well to swallow gaps and hold his ground against down blocks hoping to wash him out.

This is an interesting part of the draft because both the Cardinals and Bengals need help along the interior of the defensive line and these players could go back-to-back in whatever order the Cardinals prefer. It could go Harmon-Nolen or Nolen-Harmon and I would not be surprised.

In this mock, the Bengals end up taking Nolen after Harmon comes off the board one pick before. The former Ole Miss defender needs to polish him game further to become more consistent down-by-down, but his biggest flash can't help but suck you in. He's a hiccup away from making a negative play, but that aggressiveness can, and will, come back to bite him at times.

The Seahawks like their backfield duo of Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet so it's understandable they'd want to add players who could help raise their rushing totals as fast as possible.

Enter Booker whom, despite a very underwhelming combine performance, is still the top guard prospect. The Seahawks shouldn't ask him to get on his horse in outside or wide zone often, but he'll be a people-mover in gap schemes from Day 1.

The Bucs signed former Dolphins linebacker Anthony Walker to pair with Lavonte David in the middle of their defense but that shouldn't stop them from finding a further upgrade at the second level. Campbell is an explosive athlete with the range to run sideline to sideline. He'll fit well into the identity of this Tampa Bay unit.

The Broncos want to keep their defense elite and that means making sure they're not lacking in the pass rush department. Williams is a lengthy, physically imposing edge rusher who will pair well with budding star Nik Bonitto. 

The Steelers lost Donte Jackson in free agency and need to find another solid starter opposite Joey Porter Jr. They signed a 34-year old Darius Slay in free agency, but they'll need to find a young player to help round out their Top 3 at the position and to make sure they have someone ready to go when and/or if Slay retires following the 2025 season.

Jim Harbaugh gets a Michigan man at a massive position of need. The Chargers need a difference-maker at tight end to complement Will Dissly's steady game in two tight end sets. The team could look for a guard or running back here to pair with Najee Harris, but the value of getting an elite pass-catcher with familiarity into the culture of the Chargers is too good to pass up.

The Packers need to get more out of their defensive lineman and a good place to start is adding a freakishly-strong player like Grant. At 6'3 and 332 pounds, he's a a literal house with dynamite under the foundation. He'll absorb double-teams at a high rate which would allow the likes of Rashan Gary and Kenny Clark to hopefully be more impactful on a snap-to-snap basis.

The Vikings lost Cam Bynum in free agency and will need to find a young starter on the back end who can spend a year learning next to Harrison Smith, the veteran returning to Minnesota on a one-year deal. Watts can play in single-high looks, in the box, and in the slot as a bonafide playmaker for a secondary.

The Texans land a top prospect from their backyard in the massive Banks. The former top-10 recruit out of high school won just about every accolade he could following his standout 2024 season, including being named a consensus All-American and winner of the Lombardi Award, given to the nation's top offensive lineman.

At 6'5 and 315 pounds, Banks would immediately slide in to the starting left tackle spot following Laremy Tunsil's trade to the Commanders. He's got the ideal functional strength to lock down edge rushers who try to win the corner and the basketball feet to stay on top of sudden inside counters.

Rams right tackle Rob Havenstein is 32 years old and the Rams may want to get ahead of schedule by drafting a backup who could challenge him for the starting job right away. Membou deserves to go higher in this draft, but the way the board fell in this mock has the Rams in a great position to draft a player at a premium position.

The Ravens cannot have the aging Kyle Van Noy starting at edge rusher for too much longer, so they grab a tough and rugged edge player here in Scourton to pair with Odafe Oweh. Scourton is NFL-ready with a well-muscled frame and a polished tool box as a pass rusher. He also just screams “Raven” to me and coincidentally they land him here late in the first.

The nation's top sack artist with 17 in 2024, Green has been one of the biggest risers of the entire draft season thus far. His 22.5 tackles for loss were also good for second in the nation, as well. The former member of the Thundering Herd has really impressive bend and he showed that at this year's Senior Bowl through two practices before bowing out for the week to start back on training ahead of the draft.

With the Lions expecting Aidan Hutchison to return to the field with a vengeance in 2025, they'd love to be able to pair him with another explosive pass rusher on the other side, especially after they released veteran Za'Darius Smith.

Ezeiruaku likely parlayed a strong week at the Senior Bowl into a potential selection in this year's first round. At a premium position, guys ahead of him will go fast which could force teams to start getting their guy before the talent drops off a cliff after the first and second tiers.

We don't won't know his 40 time until his pro day, but Ezeiruaku posted excellent agility numbers with a 6.96 in the three-cone drill and a 4.19 in the short shuttle. Those numbers check out after seeing his quick twitch and explosive first step on film. The 2024 Ted Hendricks Award winner (nation's best defensive end) posted a career-high 16.5 sacks this past season, good for second most in the country. After releasing defensive tackle Jonathan Allen on Friday, the Commanders would love to immediately add another impact player up front.

Hairston earned himself some money at this year's combine with a 4.28 40 time to go with a 39.5-inch vertical jump. Those numbers likely will bump him into the bottom of the first round and there is likely not a better spot for him to go late on Day 1 than to the Bills.

Buffalo is likely to move on from Rasul Douglas, who struggled in 2024. They could also consider a defensive lineman if they like one enough to take them here, but Hairston's value is much more in line with the pick and consensus ranking compared to reaching for a defensive trench player.

The Chargers signed former 49ers left tackle Jaylon Moore to a massive deal in hopes he'll be their long-term starter at left tackle. I didn't like that deal in the slightest and it should not stop them from taking a shot at one of the draft's best tackles, either. If either of them hit, you've still built your depth up, which is something that was tested quite a bit throughout the entire 2024 season.

If it wasn't for an injury that cut his season short, Simmons could have been considered the top tackle in the draft. That's not bad at all for a team picking second-to-last on Day 1.

Even after winning the Super Bowl, the Eagles' luck continues to roll as they have one of the most athletically gifted edge rushers in the draft fall to them at No. 32. Pearce blazed a 4.47 in the 40-yard dash at 6'5 and 245 pounds. That's special for a guy who will be chasing quarterbacks as a part of one of the top defenses in the NFL from this past season.

At one point last year, Pearce was mocked as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. That's how much hype this guy had after recording 10 sacks and 15 tackles for loss in 2023. Those numbers took a slight step back to 7.5 and 13, respectively, and scouts still feel like he needs to add mass and strength for the next level. Still, this is nonetheless another luxury pick for the reigning Super Bowl champions.

Filed under:

These are the best team fits for Ashton Jeanty in the 2025 NFL Draft.

Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty is one of the best overall players in the 2025 NFL Draft. He's a bowling ball of a back who combines some impressive tackle-breaking skills with a savvy ability as a pass catcher as well. Jeanty's compact 5'9 frame gives him a low center of gravity, which helped him have the most yards after contact in college football last season. In fact, his total yards after contact were more than the second leading rusher in the country had TOTAL.

Despite being the third player on my top 50 big board, there are spots where Jeanty's talent probably wouldn't be the best. So, which teams are the best fit for the Doak Walker Award winner? Here are some of my favorites.

The Raiders hold the sixth pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, and are widely seen as the first likely landing spot for Jeanty. I like the fit for Jeanty largely because of who will be calling plays in Vegas. In the offseason, Raiders' head coach Pete Carroll hired former Ohio State offensive coordinator Chip Kelly to do the same thing for the Raiders, and something I loved about watching the Buckeyes this season was their run game that Kelly designed, getting his guys downhill with gap scheme runs. Jeanty can fit a gap or zone scheme offense but when he gets going downhill on counter or duo it's a beautiful sight to see. 

The Raiders' offensive line is still coming along, but according to Sports Information Solutions, they had the ninth-lowest Blown Block Rate in the NFL. With young left guard Jackson Powers-Johnson and Kolton Miller on the left side and a right side of the line that's still growing, it's easy to see how Jeanty can fit into this formula for a team like Vegas.

After a flurry of moves to fortify the offensive line, the Bears are in a prime spot to draft Jeanty with the 10th overall pick. Chicago traded for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson, then added center Drew Dalman in free agency. With head coach Ben Johnson running the offense, it makes a lot of sense why Jeanty would be a good fit in Chicago. D'Andre Swift is a ... freestyle jazz style of runner, one that doesn't really mesh with the offense Johnson is running in Chicago now. RB Roschon Johnson is a fine player, but clearly lacks the juice to be more than a singles hitter at the position.

Jeanty's home run ability and vision make him a really nice fit in Chicago, giving the Bears another weapon for QB Caleb Williams and a run game that will actually be competent.

You know we had to put a Jim Harbaugh-led team on this list. Despite signing Najee Harris in the offseason, I think still adding a rookie RB like Jeanty makes a lot of sense for the Chargers. With as much gap scheme runs the Chargers like to deploy, Jeanty can be much more explosive than Harris, while not having to carry the ball as often. The Chargers are still putting together the interior of the offensive line, but with two bookend tackles and Harbaugh designing the run game it would make a lot of sense.

With the 22nd pick in the draft, the Chargers probably won't be in position to take on a guy like Jeanty, and more than likely will add a RB later in the draft. However, if Jeanty were to fall here, it would be so much fun to see Jeanty in powder blue.

Sean Payton loves to run his offense through versatile backs. A thing that I think gets undervalued in Jeanty's game is how good of a pass catcher he is. He didn't do it much in 2024 because of how dominant he was as a runner, but in 2023 his 3.9 Yards per Route Run were among the best in college football at the position. The Broncos need a versatile player at the position, and with QB Bo Nix's continued emergence, someone who can be more explosive than what the Broncos were trotting out last season. Denver finished 2024 24th in DVOA in the run game, per FTN Fantasy, and according to SIS, they finished with the 24th in Yards After Contact in the NFL on RB only runs.

At 20, this feels like the absolute limit of where Jeanty could go, but this would be perfect for the Broncos and Jeanty. Behind an offensive line that's really good, and a playcaller that's one of the best in the business.

If there's an explosive skill position player available, the Cowboys should be in on it. The current Cowboy RB room is Javonte Williams, Miles Sanders and Deuce Vaughn--which is saying a lot ab out what their intentions might be come April. This is another commonly mocked spot for Jeanty, and it makes a lot of sense. With new Cowboys OC Klayton Adams coming from Arizona where a lot of gap scheme runs were used in their offense, Jeanty would make a lot of sense here. RG Zack Martin's retirement throws a temporary wrench into things, but with how special Jeanty is as a runner and receiver, and Javonte Williams able to spell him for carries during the game, it would make a lot of sense here.

Christian Craig will return to action this weekend in Round 10 of the Monster Energy Supercross season at Protective Stadium in Birmingham, Alabama.

Craig sat out the first half of the Supercross season to recover from ACL surgery. He suffered the injury in the SuperMotocross World Championship finale in Las Vegas, Nevada, saying at the time: “Not the news I want to share but also not the end of the world. In the very last race of the year, I went off the track after the sand section and when I was reentering the track, I slid and dabbed my leg. Didn't even fall. Unfortunately, surgery was the best option to get it fixed up the right way.”

This marks a return to Yamaha after two seasons with Husqvarna, during which his best championship effort netted an eighth in last year's Pro Motocross season. Craig made only six rounds of the 2024 Supercross season before he was sidelined following a 12th-place finish in Glendale, Arizona. His best result in the playoffs was a pair of 14th-place finishes at zMax Dragway in Concord, North Carolina, and Texas Motor Speedway in Forth Worth, Texas.

Craig signed a two-year agreement with Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing last October as a 450 rider and coach for the 250 team.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Afootball365.com","England: Thomas Tuchel is on a hiding to nothing; it really is the 'impossible job'","https://www.football365.com/news/thomas-tuchel-england-hiding-nothing-impossible-job-john-nicholson","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 08:06:02 GMT","

So here it is, the start of yet another era for England. This one is more unusual in that we know it will end in 18 months, unless we win the World Cup (which remains unlikely except in the minds of those suffering from nationality bias).

This presents a bit of a problem for the notorious and widely mocked, pathetic English press, already looked upon with disdain by Thomas Tuchel in answering the inevitable question about the captaincy from the usual self-feeding, clammy, sports news pigs.

Given the tenure is already defined, it robs them of the sack calls in faux-moral outrage that is one of their defaults after a poor performance. But even so, I don't suppose it will stop them. They're nothing if not predictable. England are never as good as these peculiar pigs knowingly pretend they are; it is simply better to decry them from a very high horse.

If you are young enough to think this is a modern condition, it isn't. It's been passed down the grubby press for 50 years or more. And it's exhausting because you know how it's going to go. Even those who have built up Tuchel have only done so to knock him down and make composite pictures of him in leather shorts under xenophobic headlines.

But this sh*te sells. There is always an audience for it. If England are not free flowing and beating everyone 4-0, it'll be because the ones that have not been picked should have been picked and the ones that were picked obviously should not have been. It's already started. Look at the cynicism about him.

It doesn't seem to occur to anybody that there is never any proof that the choices not taken would have led to more success, so can never be accurately judged, which is why shouting such opinions is so popular for those who don't ever want to be proved wrong.

(To be fair, he did name a very curious squad – Ed)

It won't be long before the ‘he's supposed to be one of the best, but he doesn't know what he's doing' comments start. Like there's a league table of managerial talent and you just pick the one in the highest position, didn't you know? Gareth Southgate proved the folly of that apparent notion.

It's obviously not that simple; many other elements – some nothing even to do with football – come into play. But when it comes to England, the nuance of thought is abandoned and replaced by shouting 'why doesn't he just play ?' like it's obvious and the manager just hasn't thought about it.

It's called ‘the impossible job' because some of the press and public make it so. It never lets up. It's never good enough for England critics. I've come to the conclusion that even if we won the World Cup, it still would not be won in a good enough way. With England, I think it's a free hit for some. Want to be right and look clever? Here's an inadequate England for you to prove your expertise.

For those searching for approval for their football knowledge, we've created the perfect national side. Players that are regularly lavished with praise by broadcasters seeking to sell their coverage of the league as a big super duper best-in-the-world-so-pay thing, have been established in some minds as better than they are, disregarding the context within which they play.

Then they all come together and play worse than imagined, all their faults exposed as well as their qualities. It must be true because the majority of England's games are disappointing one way or another. It's not a blip.

Tuchel, unless he transforms England into consistent world-beaters, which seems unlikely, is on a hiding to nothing. Although he'll have seen the sports news pigs snouting up close before, the febrile England attack dogs are something else, even less rational. This early period will be largely positive, with seeds of discontent about selections, where he lives, how he works, then tactics deployed being sown, ready to bloom in 12 months, when they will begin to eviscerate him and some will call for one of their mates to step in and take to them to the tournament.

How can he fail with the players at his disposal? The negativity is easy and endless. The critics pathway is thus: he picks someone I don't like, he's paid too much, is unimaginative, picks players from a club I don't like, hasn't picked someone I like for some nefarious reason, has big ideas, is German. It's all already there with the ‘he's going to be sh*t, isn't he?' brigade. Just like they were with Gareth and they had to keep refining the negativity as he kept proving them wrong until we outperformed ourselves, or got lucky, or any of football's ornery variables and arrived at an ‘undeserving' final.

This is all predicated on the brilliance of the players, whoever you put your faith in. And that's the first mistake. They're good for their clubs, but put them all together without the support of the world's footballing talent, they're inconsistent. You can't argue that they're not; they've shown us their true nature for decades and it's always the same. The rest is just marketing by vested interests.

It's always said it's the manager's fault, to excuse the players, but that's delusion. Imagine having 15 full-time managers over 51 years and every single one is the wrong man at the wrong time. It's not credible. We always have a puncher's chance, same as anyone, of course we do, but Tuchel will be the latest to be a victim of the players and the press in an unholy alliance. Put your money on it.

Metabolic and hormonal effects

Bone and cardiovascular health
Neuropsychiatric considerations
Future research and clinical implications
Conclusion 

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were initially developed to regulate blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their therapeutic effects extend beyond glycemic control, particularly in weight management and metabolic disorders. Recently, GLP-1 RAs have gained prominence for their role in weight loss, leading to their approval for obesity treatment.1

Beyond diabetes and obesity, GLP-1 RAs exhibit a broad spectrum of physiological effects that significantly impact women's health. These include cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, and metabolic regulation, which can influence conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and osteoporosis.

Emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs modulate hormonal balance, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways, offering potential therapeutic benefits in reproductive health and menopause-related metabolic changes. Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have shown promise in reducing cancer risk, particularly in hormone-related malignancies such as breast and ovarian cancer.1
This article explores the unexpected effects of GLP-1 RAs on women's health, highlighting their impact on metabolic, reproductive, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric health while identifying gaps in research and future clinical implications.

GLP-1 RAs have emerged as promising therapeutic agents in managing metabolic and hormonal disturbances in PCOS. Originally developed for T2D, these agents enhance insulin sensitivity by reducing insulin resistance, as demonstrated by significant declines in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores.

Improved insulin sensitivity is closely linked to favorable changes in body composition, such as decreased BMI and waist circumference, which are critical for PCOS patients who often present with obesity.2

Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have been shown to modulate the hormonal milieu in PCOS. They contribute to a mild reduction in androgen levels, evidenced by decreases in total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), while simultaneously increasing sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. These shifts help to restore a more balanced hormonal profile, potentially mitigating the hyperandrogenism that underlies many PCOS symptoms.2

In addition to metabolic and androgen improvements, GLP-1 RAs appear to influence menstrual cyclicity positively. Enhanced insulin sensitivity and direct effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis may promote more regular ovulatory cycles and improved fertility outcomes.2

GLP-1RAs have demonstrated benefits in restoring ovulation, particularly in women with PCOS, by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels. However, their impact on endometrial receptivity and implantation remains unclear.2,3

GLP-1RAs influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, enhancing gonadotropin secretion and improving ovarian function. While this supports fertility, concerns persist about their effects on early pregnancy.

Limited data suggest GLP-1RAs may alter endometrial receptivity, potentially affecting implantation success rates. Animal studies indicate GLP-1RA treatment improves ovarian morphology in PCOS models, but human data are sparse.2,3

During pregnancy, GLP-1RAs may impact fetal development due to their metabolic effects. Current guidelines advise discontinuation before conception due to unknown teratogenic risks. Furthermore, their influence on placental function and fetal growth requires further investigation.3

Overall, GLP-1RAs offer promise in reproductive medicine, particularly for obesity-related infertility. However, their safety and efficacy in pregnancy require more research to determine optimal use in fertility treatments and assisted reproduction technologies (ART).3

Who Should Take Weight Loss Injections, and Who Shouldn't?

GLP-1RAs influence bone metabolism by promoting bone formation and reducing resorption, potentially mitigating osteoporosis risk. However, some studies indicate an increased risk of fractures, possibly due to weight loss-associated reductions in bone mineral density (BMD).4

Postmenopausal women, already at heightened risk for osteoporosis, may benefit from GLP-1RAs' anabolic effects on bone, yet data on long-term fracture risk remain inconclusive.

The cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs are well-established, with clinical trials demonstrating reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), improved endothelial function, and lower blood pressure. These benefits are particularly relevant for women who often present with atypical cardiovascular symptoms and higher heart failure risk.4,5

Despite these advantages, concerns about potential adverse effects, including gastrointestinal intolerance and possible cardiovascular adaptations that may influence bone health, warrant further investigation.

A personalized approach considering individual bone and cardiovascular risk profiles is essential when prescribing GLP-1RAs to women, particularly those with osteoporosis or high cardiovascular risk.4,5

Emerging reports indicate potential neuropsychiatric effects of GLP-1RAs, including mood changes, appetite suppression, and cognitive function implications. Patients have reported both positive and negative mood alterations.

Some individuals experience improved well-being, reduced anxiety, and better emotional stability, potentially linked to weight loss and metabolic improvements. Conversely, others report increased depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has begun monitoring these concerns.6

GLP-1RAs significantly reduce appetite, which may help control compulsive eating behaviors. Notably, some users report a reduction in cravings for not just food but also substances like alcohol and nicotine, suggesting a potential role in managing addictive behaviors.6

Preliminary evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs may influence cognitive function by modulating neurotransmitters and inflammation. Some users report clearer thinking and improved focus, while others experience brain fog or fatigue, potentially linked to hypoglycemia.

While GLP-1RAs offer substantial benefits, their psychological impact requires further investigation to ensure long-term safety.6

Are GLP-1 Drugs the Future of Alcohol Addiction Treatment?

Current studies focus on short-term efficacy, but gaps persist regarding the impact on reproductive health, hormonal balance, and bone density over prolonged use. Ongoing research aims to assess GLP-1 RAs' influence on menstrual irregularities, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes.

Given their appetite-suppressing properties, concerns arise about potential nutritional deficiencies and their consequences on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, their effects on postmenopausal women, especially regarding osteoporosis risk, warrant further investigation.7

The metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs are evident, yet sex-specific responses remain unclear. Women's hormonal fluctuations may alter drug efficacy and side effect profiles, necessitating gender-stratified trials. Furthermore, the psychosocial impact, particularly in those with eating disorders, requires careful evaluation.7

Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to determine safety and effectiveness in diverse female populations.

Tailored dosing and monitoring guidelines must be developed to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring that GLP-1 RAs serve as a safe and effective intervention for women's metabolic health.7

Current evidence supports the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in managing T2DM and obesity, with additional benefits for cardiovascular and renal health. However, specific considerations are necessary for women, including reproductive health, pregnancy, and long-term metabolic outcomes.

While GLP-1 medications show promising weight loss effects and glycemic control, their safety in pregnancy remains uncertain, necessitating alternative therapeutic approaches for women of childbearing age.

Emerging research focuses on optimizing GLP-1 therapies through combination treatments, novel oral formulations, and personalized medicine approaches. Investigations into sex-specific metabolic responses, hormonal influences, and potential long-term adverse effects are crucial for refining treatment guidelines. Moreover, research into GLP-1's impact on PCOS, menopausal metabolic shifts, and osteoporosis risk is gaining attention.

Clinicians should adopt an individualized approach, considering patient-specific factors such as age, reproductive plans, comorbidities, and tolerance. Ongoing trials and real-world data will further shape best practices, ensuring the safe and effective use of GLP-1 medications in women.

Collaborative, interprofessional care remains essential in maximizing benefits while mitigating risks associated with this drug class.

As Congress mulls potentially massive cuts to federal Medicaid funding, health centers that serve Native American communities, such as the Oneida Community Health Center near Green Bay, Wisconsin, are bracing for catastrophe.

That's because more than 40% of the about 15,000 patients the center serves are enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would be detrimental to those patients and the facility, said Debra Danforth, the director of the Oneida Comprehensive Health Division and a citizen of the Oneida Nation.

""It would be a tremendous hit,"" she said.

The facility provides a range of services to most of the Oneida Nation's 17,000 people, including ambulatory care, internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics. The tribe is one of two in Wisconsin that have an ""open-door policy,"" Danforth said, which means that the facility is open to members of any federally recognized tribe.

But Danforth and many other tribal health officials say Medicaid cuts would cause service reductions at health facilities that serve Native Americans.

Indian Country has a unique relationship to Medicaid, because the program helps tribes cover chronic funding shortfalls from the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans.

Medicaid has accounted for about two-thirds of third-party revenue for tribal health providers, creating financial stability and helping facilities pay operational costs. More than a million Native Americans enrolled in Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program also rely on the insurance to pay for care outside of tribal health facilities without going into significant medical debt. Tribal leaders are calling on Congress to exempt tribes from cuts and are preparing to fight to preserve their access.

""Medicaid is one of the ways in which the federal government meets its trust and treaty obligations to provide health care to us,"" said Liz Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, a nonprofit policy advocacy organization for 33 tribes spanning from Texas to Maine. Malerba is a citizen of the Mohegan Tribe.

""So we view any disruption or cut to Medicaid as an abrogation of that responsibility,"" she said.

Tribes face an arduous task in providing care to a population that experiences severe health disparities, a high incidence of chronic illness, and, at least in western states, a life expectancy of 64 years — the lowest of any demographic group in the U.S. Yet, in recent years, some tribes have expanded access to care for their communities by adding health services and providers, enabled in part by Medicaid reimbursements.

During the last two fiscal years, five urban Indian organizations in Montana saw funding growth of nearly $3 million, said Lisa James, director of development for the Montana Consortium for Urban Indian Health, during a webinar in February organized by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families and the National Council of Urban Indian Health.

The increased revenue was ""instrumental,"" James said, allowing clinics in the state to add services that previously had not been available unless referred out for, including behavioral health services. Clinics were also able to expand operating hours and staffing.

Montana's five urban Indian clinics, in Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls, and Billings, serve 30,000 people, including some who are not Native American or enrolled in a tribe. The clinics provide a wide range of services, including primary care, dental care, disease prevention, health education, and substance use prevention.

James said Medicaid cuts would require Montana's urban Indian health organizations to cut services and limit their ability to address health disparities.

American Indian and Alaska Native people under age 65 are more likely to be uninsured than white people under 65, but 30% rely on Medicaid compared with 15% of their white counterparts, according to KFF data for 2017 to 2021. More than 40% of American Indian and Alaska Native children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, which provides health insurance to kids whose families are not eligible for Medicaid. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

A Georgetown Center for Children and Families report from January found the share of residents enrolled in Medicaid was higher in counties with a significant Native American presence. The proportion on Medicaid in small-town or rural counties that are mostly within tribal statistical areas, tribal subdivisions, reservations, and other Native-designated lands was 28.7%, compared with 22.7% in other small-town or rural counties. About 50% of children in those Native areas were enrolled in Medicaid.

The federal government has already exempted tribes from some of Trump's executive orders. In late February, Department of Health and Human Services acting general counsel Sean Keveney clarified that tribal health programs would not be affected by an executive order that diversity, equity, and inclusion government programs be terminated, but that the Indian Health Service is expected to discontinue diversity and inclusion hiring efforts established under an Obama-era rule.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also rescinded the layoffs of more than 900 IHS employees in February just hours after they'd received termination notices. During Kennedy's Senate confirmation hearings, he said he would appoint a Native American as an assistant HHS secretary. The National Indian Health Board, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for tribes, in December endorsed elevating the director of the Indian Health Service to assistant secretary of HHS.

Jessica Schubel, a senior health care official in Joe Biden's White House, said exemptions won't be enough.

""Just because Native Americans are exempt doesn't mean that they won't feel the impact of cuts that are made throughout the rest of the program,"" she said.

State leaders are also calling for federal Medicaid spending to be spared because cuts to the program would shift costs onto their budgets. Without sustained federal funding, which can cover more than 70% of costs, state lawmakers face decisions such as whether to change eligibility requirements to slim Medicaid rolls, which could cause some Native Americans to lose their health coverage.

Tribal leaders noted that state governments do not have the same responsibility to them as the federal government, yet they face large variations in how they interact with Medicaid depending on their state programs.

President Donald Trump has made seemingly conflicting statements about Medicaid cuts, saying in an interview on Fox News in February that Medicaid and Medicare wouldn't be touched. In a social media post the same week, Trump expressed strong support for a House budget resolution that would likely require Medicaid cuts.

The budget proposal, which the House approved in late February, requires lawmakers to cut spending to offset tax breaks. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees spending on Medicaid and Medicare, is instructed to slash $880 billion over the next decade. The possibility of cuts to the program that, together with CHIP, provides insurance to 79 million people has drawn opposition from national and state organizations.

The federal government reimburses IHS and tribal health facilities 100% of billed costs for American Indian and Alaska Native patients, shielding state budgets from the costs.

Because Medicaid is already a stopgap fix for Native American health programs, tribal leaders said it won't be a matter of replacing the money but operating with less.

""When you're talking about somewhere between 30% to 60% of a facility's budget is made up by Medicaid dollars, that's a very difficult hole to try and backfill,"" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.

Congress isn't required to consult tribes during the budget process, Davis added. Only after changes are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state agencies are tribes able to engage with them on implementation.

The amount the federal government spends funding the Native American health system is a much smaller portion of its budget than Medicaid. The IHS projected billing Medicaid about $1.3 billion this fiscal year, which represents less than half of 1% of overall federal spending on Medicaid.

""We are saving more lives,"" Malerba said of the additional services Medicaid covers in tribal health care. ""It brings us closer to a level of 21st century care that we should all have access to but don't always.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Indiana lawmakers seek to forbid hospital monopolies, but one merger fight remains","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250319/Indiana-lawmakers-seek-to-forbid-hospital-monopolies-but-one-merger-fight-remains.aspx","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:36:00 GMT","

Union Health is making a new bid to Indiana regulators to buy its rival hospital in Terre Haute as the door looks poised to close on such deals.

The nonprofit health system is trying to leverage an existing state law to acquire Terre Haute Regional Hospital, the only other acute care hospital in Vigo County. After withdrawing its initial application in November amid pushback, Union has shifted its pitch to emphasize what it describes as Regional's ""declining position"" while offering more concrete promises, such as limits on price increases.

Union submitted its new application on Feb. 5 as Indiana lawmakers were attempting to nix such mergers in their state. Lawmakers then watered down a bill that threatened to forbid Union's deal altogether, with the amended legislation now barring mergers sought after Feb. 15, leaving an opening for Union. That means the proposed merger will next face a showdown with the administration of Indiana's new governor, which has signaled opposition to such deals.

Indiana is among the latest states reconsidering Certificate of Public Advantage laws that greenlight hospital monopolies. This year, Tennessee lawmakers introduced a bill to restructure state oversight of these mergers after an attempt last year to repeal its COPA law. In 2023, Maine repealed its COPA law, joining Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, and North Dakota.

""I would hope that they are reconsidering the laws because of the research on the long-run harms of COPAs,"" said Christopher Garmon, a University of Missouri-Kansas City economist who has studied COPA mergers.

Indiana is one of 19 states that still have COPA laws, which allow mergers that the Federal Trade Commission otherwise considers illegal because they reduce competition and often create monopolies.

In exchange for approval of these deals, the merging hospitals typically agree to meet conditions imposed by their state to mitigate the harms of a monopoly. But health care economists and the FTC have said that state oversight cannot replace competition and that these mergers ultimately harm patients.

Union Health's first application faced pushback. The state's Department of Health received hundreds of comments, with most opposing the deal, according to a review of documents KFF Health News obtained through a state public records request. Doctors, health economists, and the FTC were among those who called on state regulators to deny Union's proposal.

Union pulled its application in November, just days before the state was due to rule on the deal.

When Union filed its new application in early February, this time it promised a slew of concrete commitments and pledges to improve residents' health in the largely rural communities that surround Terre Haute. Among them were promises to keep both hospitals' emergency rooms open and inpatient services in operation, and to tie increases in hospital charges to the consumer price index for medical care, essentially establishing a cap so charges don't exceed medical inflation.

It also recast its pitch to describe Regional as a hospital in decline, which Union said puts the region at risk of losing access to services if the merger is not approved. Tennessee-based HCA Healthcare owns Terre Haute Regional.

In that scenario, Union warned, if Regional were to close, the health system would essentially have a monopoly anyway, ""without any oversight, terms, or conditions"" of a COPA. Instead, it argued, a green light from state regulators could avert a hospital closure and guarantee state oversight of the combined hospital system.

Union's first application did not argue that the merger was necessary for Regional to remain viable. In public comments submitted in September and March, the FTC argued to state regulators that both hospitals are ""financially stable,"" adding that Regional is ""part of the largest hospital system in the country with tremendous financial resources."" It also cited hospital financial reporting that showed Terre Haute Regional Hospital's profits were better than those of most other hospitals in the country.

""This repackaged COPA application presents the same problems as before,"" Clarke Edwards, acting director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, said in a statement on March 17 after the commission unanimously opposed the merger.

HCA did not respond to questions about Union's characterization that Regional is a hospital in decline.

Despite Union's assurances that the merger would benefit the region, an analysis of the first proposal found the opposite. Zack Cooper, a health economist and an associate professor at Yale University, estimated that the price of care would rise by at least 10%, 500 jobs would be lost, and nurses' pay would decline by at least 7%.

Despite the new application and new promises, ""the nature of the deal hasn't changed,"" Cooper said. He said that his findings remain unchanged and that Union stands to benefit — not the community.

""Life is easier for a firm if you face less competition,"" he said. ""There's less pressure to compete on quality. There's less pressure to compete on price.""

In January, state Sen. Ed Charbonneau, a Republican and a key architect of Indiana's 2021 COPA law, introduced the legislation to repeal the law, which would have foreclosed Union's chance at a possible second attempt at the merger.

In February, seated side by side at a state Senate health committee hearing, Union Health CEO Steve Holman, Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce President Kristin Craig, and state Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican representing the region, testified against the bill.

Holman told lawmakers the merger would improve the health of the region. He also noted that the hospital system had already spent $3 million on legal fees pursuing the deal. He said it seemed like lawmakers were attempting to cripple Union's chances. ""Why has this come up now?"" Holman asked.

The bill to repeal the COPA law advanced out of committee by a 7-4 vote. State Sen. Mike Bohacek, a Republican who represents a region a three-hour drive north of Terre Haute, said he voted against repealing the law out of deference to local officials.

""I have no dog in this fight,"" Bohacek said.

Charbonneau later amended his bill, winning support from Union and Goode. The new version sailed through the Senate. It is now backed by two powerful Republican representatives in the House: Brad Barrett, chair of the Public Health Committee, and Bob Heaton, House majority whip. Heaton represents parts of Vigo County.

Union Health spokesperson Amanda Scott said in an email to KFF Health News that Union and Regional Hospital ""recognize the significance of a final approval"" and that Union views this as its last chance to acquire its rival.

But Indiana's new governor, Republican Mike Braun, took office in January vowing to crack down on consolidation, especially in health care.

Earlier this year, Braun tapped Gloria Sachdev to lead a newly created Cabinet position overseeing the state's health care agencies, including the state Department of Health, which will decide on the merger.

As CEO of the Employers' Forum of Indiana, a coalition of businesses that has combated high hospital prices, Sachdev was an outspoken critic of the proposed merger in Terre Haute. In an October opinion piece in The Indianapolis Star, she urged regulators to consider how these mergers can crush communities.

Sachdev, now the state's secretary of health and family services, didn't answer questions on the new bid. After KFF Health News asked the governor's office whether Braun has final authority over the fate of Union's merger request, Department of Health spokesperson Greta Sanderson provided a joint statement from the agency and the office of the governor: ""Gov. Braun will expect to be informed, ask questions, and ensure that whatever decision is made is thoughtful and objective with the best interests of Hoosiers in mind.""

The state has until June 21 to review the merger application before rendering a decision, according to the Department of Health. The public can comment on the proposal through March 23.

Published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, the study aimed to provide robust insights into adolescent mental health trajectories in two different cultural contexts by comparing large samples of 11 to 16 years olds in London and Tokyo over time. The two studies are the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) and the Resilience Ethnicity and AdolesCent Mental Health (REACH) cohorts from South London. Both groups collected data in the period 2014 to 2020 and at three different time points as the teenagers grew older. 

Researchers used the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) to measure depressive symptoms. 

In both groups there was a difference between teenage boys and girls in the average level of depressive symptoms and this difference widened year-on-year. In the London sample the gender difference started slightly earlier (evident by 11-12 years) than in the Tokyo sample where it emerged between 11 and 14 years, and the average rate of change in depressive symptoms per year in London girls was around four times greater than among girls in Tokyo. By the age of 16 the difference in depressive symptoms between boys and girls in London was around twice as large as in Tokyo. The average level of depressive symptoms in teenage boys in Tokyo declined between ages of 11 and 16, whereas for boys in London it increased slightly over time, following a similar trajectory to that of teenage girls in Tokyo. 

Our study suggests that from around early adolescence onwards girls have higher levels of depression than boys in both Tokyo and London, but the disparity is larger, starts a bit earlier, and increases at a faster rate in London. The trajectory for boys in London closely mirrors the trajectory for girls in Tokyo. These findings suggest we need to rethink and challenge popular narratives around gender differences in mental health – for example, the idea that girls are naturally or inevitably more likely to struggle with their emotional health – and to understand the contexts and conditions that enable teenage girls and young people to thrive.""

Dr. Gemma Knowles, First Author, Lecturer in Epidemiology and Youth Mental Health at IoPPN, King's College London

Currently the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) - an index designed to measure gender equality - ranks UK 15th out of 149 countries while Japan is ranked 125th. However, insights from young co-researchers from both cities suggests there are social influences at play which are not captured in these indexes. For example, teenage girls may assume adult roles and responsibilities at a younger age in London and there are lower levels of violence and crime in Tokyo. There are also differences in socioeconomic and political trends between the two places that could contribute to differences, for example, the prolonged period of austerity in the UK. 

Dr Knowles said: ""This a complex area with a multitude of possible factors that may contribute to the difference between girls and boys and between the two places. We need to better understand the social contexts and experiences that give rise to gender inequalities in mental health and the conditions that support teenage girls to thrive. It's also important to understand how these social experiences interplay with young people's physical development at this age."" 

An important part of this study was to investigate the extent to which scores derived from the measure SMFQ can be meaningfully and appropriately compared across genders, ages, and contexts. While these tests are not perfect, they found no evidence of incomparable measurement, which suggests that any differences in SMFQ scores between groups are due to real differences in depressive symptoms rather than differences in reporting. 

The study was funded by the Invitation Program for Foreign Researchers at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the ESRC Centre for Society and Mental Health, the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science, and the European Research Council.

Is your TikTok health advice legit? A new study reveals that most cycle-syncing content lacks scientific backing—don't let viral trends shape your well-being!

Study: Sync or Swim: Navigating the Tides of Menstrual Cycle Messaging on TikTok. Image Credit: Krotnakro / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, researchers in the United States attempt to understand the views and knowledge shared by content creators on the social media platform TikTok. Specifically, they examine content creators' credentials, citations of scientific sources, messages and recommendations, and perceived benefits of individuals consuming such content.

Study findings revealed that while influencers and wellness coaches popularize menstrual cycle syncing as a means to enhance physical well-being and performance, very few (~30%) provide their credentials (expertise) while doing so, and far fewer (4%) cite scientific sources for their information.

Alarmingly, even those who cited scientific sources often did so in vague, unspecified fashions without providing publication titles, publication years, or authors. The study highlights that much of the content is anecdotal rather than scientifically validated, raising concerns about the accuracy of health claims.

Creators pushed specific workouts for each phase – like cardio during ovulation and weightlifting in the luteal phase – but rarely explained how these align with hormonal shifts.

Menstrual ‘cycle syncing' is the practice of adjusting one's daily routines to align with the four menstrual cycle phases – menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal. It is an increasingly popular practice promoted on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, and its supposed benefits include enhanced reproductive, mental, and physical well-being outcomes. Notably, on TikTok alone, more than 285 million views have been garnered for content carrying the hashtag #cyclesyncing.

While TikTok promotes four distinct phases, most scientific studies focus on two broad hormonal phases—follicular and luteal—when analyzing the menstrual cycle's effects on health and performance.

Unfortunately, scientific knowledge on the topic remains insufficient to validate most of cycle syncing's benefits conclusively. Existing research has not reached a consensus on how menstrual cycle phases affect exercise performance and dietary needs, with many studies yielding mixed results.

Given the diet and exercise alterations promoted by TikTok content creators, understanding the credentials and scientific material they use to back their claims would allow their viewers to make informed choices about the necessity and benefits that these routines may provide them.

“Social media platforms like TikTok can amplify oversimplified and potentially misleading information on cycle syncing. Video content may present exaggerated benefits and claims not strongly supported by scientific evidence, potentially leading to misconceptions and misguided reproductive health practices.”

The study evaluated cycle-syncing content on TikTok, focusing on four key aspects: content creator credentials, the use of scientific citations versus anecdotal claims, how cycle syncing is framed and promoted, and the benefits associated with it.

Researchers created a new TikTok account (set to a 22-year-old United States user) and downloaded the top 100 ranked videos related to cycle syncing for analysis. These videos were selected based on ranking and hashtags. To analyze the content, researchers categorized the data into two main groups: cycle-syncing content and creator information.

The first category examined how cycle syncing was discussed, including recommendations related to exercise, diet, and benefits, while the second focused on whether creators provided their credentials or cited scientific research.

To ensure accuracy, Gwet's agreement coefficient (≥ 0.70) was used to train and assess coders' performance.

Diet tips fixated on magnesium and iron without clarifying how needs vary across cycles or individual health profiles.

Summary statistics of the 100 videos downloaded revealed that they averaged 45,235.50 likes and were a mean of 1:07 min long (range = 0:06-1:52 min).

Creator credentials analysis revealed an alarming trend – only 30% of content creators (n = 30) using the hashtag #cyclesyncing provided their credentials. These included a mix of health coaches, clinicians, and fitness instructors.

Even more concerning, only 4% of content creators (n = 4) mentioned scientific research as the source of their beliefs or recommendations. When scientific research was referenced, it was often described in vague terms, such as 'studies show,' without providing publication details.

The study also identified patterns in the types of recommendations given.

57% and 54% of content creators recommended cycle-syncing exercises and diets, respectively. Exercise recommendations frequently included walking and yoga throughout the cycle, while higher-intensity activities such as cardio were most commonly suggested for the ovulatory phase and weightlifting for the luteal phase.

Dietary recommendations were less specific but included general mentions of magnesium, iron, and omega-3 consumption.

Overall, the top 100 videos promoted 15 total benefits of cycle syncing, with balancing hormones (11%), improving acne (10%), and reduced menstrual symptoms such as cramps (9%) being the most common.

However, 63% of videos promoted cycle syncing without citing any specific benefits.

Some creators framed hormonal contraceptives as harmful, reflecting broader 'hormonophobia' trends on social media.

TikTok's cycle syncing trend reflects a larger shift in online health advice. Researchers suggest that many young viewers rely on social media for wellness guidance, making it even more important to verify claims before adopting new health routines.

The present study suggests a substantial lack of credibility among TikTok content creators promoting cycle syncing, with much of the content being anecdotal rather than scientifically validated.

Furthermore, TikTok's content generally does not aim to tailor diet and exercise recommendations to individuals; instead, it suggests that the same approach should apply to all female viewers.

Given that the majority of viewers were identified in the 18-24 age group, the study suggests that future research should investigate how TikTok's cycle-syncing content influences young viewers' perceptions of reproductive health and whether it affects their decisions on contraception and wellness routines.

Additionally, while cycle syncing is sometimes framed as a method to “rebalance hormones” after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives, further research is needed to determine whether cycle syncing content actively discourages hormonal contraceptive use or simply reflects broader discussions about alternatives to synthetic hormones.

Since TikTok's algorithm prioritizes engagement-driven content, videos promoting cycle syncing without scientific references may still gain significant visibility, influencing user exposure to anecdotal health claims.

The researchers acknowledge that their sample of 100 videos may not fully represent all cycle syncing content on TikTok, as individual users receive personalized content recommendations based on algorithmic factors.

Furthermore, the study analyzed content rather than its actual influence on viewer behavior, highlighting the need for future studies on audience impact.

Former Bachelorette Katie Thurston is opening up about being diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at age 34.

""You're so devastated. It's so shocking,"" Thurston told ABC News' Eva Pilgrim in an interview that aired Wednesday on ""Good Morning America."" ""As a 34-year-old woman, it's just, you're not prepared.""

Thurston, who starred in season 17 of ""The Bachelorette"" in 2021, said the road to her diagnosis began when she noticed a small lump on one of her breasts, a symptom of breast cancer that she said she initially dismissed.

""When I felt my lump, it was sore, and as women were used to being told like, 'Oh, it's it's probably their time of the month,' or 'Oh, it's from working out,' so I brushed it off for a while,"" Thurston said. ""And then finally I decided to go to the doctor.""

After seeking medical care, Thurston said she was diagnosed with Stage 3 triple positive ductal carcinoma, a type of cancer where tumor cells have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 receptors on their surface, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.

For Thurston, the diagnosis meant she would need to undergo chemotherapy before she could have the cancerous tumor removed.

""You're on, like, survival mode. Like, you don't have a choice -- you show up, or you die,"" Thurston said of her experience being quickly thrust into the world of breast cancer treatment and appointments. ""And I hate to say it that way, but, like ... every day you have an appointment, every day you have to show up. You don't have a choice.""

Thurston received her diagnosis in February, just a few months after she became engaged to comedian Jeff Acuri. Instead of planning their wedding, she said she and Acuri began planning for their future in a different way.

""We thought we'd be planning a wedding. We thought we'd be trying for a baby,"" she said. ""And instead, we know that this year is really dedicated to just treatment and getting better.""

Thurston said she chose to harvest her eggs following her diagnosis in case she and Acuri try to have a child together in the future.

""We've done everything we can to be, you know, proactive for our future and our family plans,"" she said, adding that she and Acuri are also OK if their proactive steps ultimately don't work. ""But in the event that IVF didn't work out, in the event that chemo did impact me in a negative way when it comes to my reproductive health, we're also OK being a childless couple.""

Former 'Bachelorette' star Katie Thurston and Blake Moynes split

Thurston shared her breast cancer diagnosis publicly in an Instagram post on Feb. 15, writing that she found support and hope after her diagnosis in the stories of other women who also faced breast cancer.

Thurston told Pilgrim that she hopes sharing her story encourages people to be proactive about their own breast health.

""I think that's the biggest takeaway, is telling people like, 'Don't wait,' you know, 'Be proactive, get checked out,'"" she said. ""You could be doing yourself a favor in the future.""

Most women with average risk should start screening for breast cancer at age 40, and get screened every other year through age 74, according to guidance from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed group of experts whose conclusions guide medical decision making and determine some insurance policies.

Breast cancer screening tools include a mammogram, which is an X-ray of the breast.

Dense breast tissue may make a mammogram more difficult to interpret, and may make detecting cancer more difficult, according to the National Institutes of Health. Women with dense breasts may be called back for follow-up testing, including ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

Women at higher risk of getting breast cancer may also receive an MRI scan.

Throughout their lifetime, women should also watch for new lumps, skin changes and nipple changes, including unusual discharge, pain, and redness.

As Saskatchewan awaits details of the 2025-26 provincial budget, the state of health care in the province is front of mind for many.

The government will “continue to deliver better access to health care and deliver on our commitment to increase the number of surgeries performed annually to reduce wait times,” Premier Scott Moe said in a social media post Monday.

His post went on to say that his government will “build on investments,” like the $15-million recently announced for the expansion, renovation and equipment upgrades at Saskatoon's City Hospital, and shorten surgical wait times “by ensuring 450,000 surgeries are performed over the next four years.”

But the Opposition has its doubts.

Saskatchewan has “fallen to the back of the pack” when it comes to health care, the NDP said in a news release issued Tuesday.

“We need more doctors, nurses, and frontline health care workers — but instead of fixing the crisis, the Sask. Party is driving workers out and expanding the bureaucracy,” said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat in the release.

And the Opposition's critic for the status of women took issue with the fact that some Saskatchewan patients have had to go out of province for breast cancer screening.

“It shouldn't be too much to ask for a mammogram close to home,” Brittney Senger said in the release.

In late 2023, former health minister Everett Hindley said out-of-province mammogram referrals to a clinic in Calgary was a short term solution to cut down on surgical wait times. In February, the government renewed its contract with that clinic to continue referrals until March 31, 2026.

The province also announced multiple initiatives in 2024 relating to breast cancer care and screening, including a new Breast Health Centre in Regina, which is slated to open in spring 2025.

The 2024-25 budget allocated some $7.6-billion toward health. When released in March 2024, the government said that budget was intended to “stabilize” the health sector. But despite ongoing work through the province's Health Human Resources Action Plan (meant to recruit and retain health-care workers) and capacity pressure action plans put in place in Regina and Saskatoon, health-care unions have continued to ring alarm bells over staffing shortages, high patient numbers and overflowing emergency rooms.

The 2025-26 budget will be unveiled Wednesday afternoon.

Multiple staff members at Wales' biggest hospital are understood to be under investigation after claims that strangers were allowed in to watch surgery on unaware patients. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board is probing what it called ""deeply concerning"" allegations over practices at University Hospital of Wales' operating theatres.

In January we revealed the health board was undertaking a ""comprehensive service review"" of the hospital's theatres after claims of a toxic culture, racism, bullying and drug use. At that time we reported on sources' anger that the health board had not properly investigated concerns dating back to 2021 when staff members allegedly allowed their friends and family into theatres to watch surgery with no background checks. Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here.

A spokeswoman for the health board has now told WalesOnline: ""During the theatres service review and subsequent investigations, it was identified that previous concerns regarding unauthorised people in theatres had been raised but not thoroughly investigated or completed."" She went on to say: ""Following the deeply concerning allegations made around allowing members of the public to watch operations, the health board has launched an internal investigation."" We understand this is separate to the service review.

Andrew RT Davies, MS for South Wales Central and former leader of the Welsh Tories, said the Welsh Government should intervene to make sure the ""shocking"" allegations were investigated independently rather than in an internal probe. In response, a Government spokesman said: “Any concern about patient safety must be taken seriously. Cardiff and Vale UHB is undertaking a review of the reported incidents. It is important this is completed and the results considered.”

Speaking about the alleged surgery spectators, one hospital source claimed: ""They had no background checks and it was during Covid. The very little PPE [personal protective equipment] was being used by unnecessary people. They would have been a huge infection risk to not only staff but vulnerable patients."" They also alleged that staff were told not to speak about the matter and that it was ""brushed under the carpet"". WalesOnline understands multiple staff members are under investigation in connection to these allegations. When asked about this the health board spokeswoman told us they could not ""provide any information regarding ongoing investigations"".

When the service review began last October the health board told staff it would likely take 12 to 16 weeks. But the spokeswoman has now told us the review ""is taking slightly longer than the anticipated timeframe"" as there have been so many comments from staff.

WalesOnline has seen an internal letter sent by the health board's chief operating officer Paul Bostock in January stating: ""Over 60 people have come forward to share their experience and thoughts about working in UHW theatres and people have been very measured and very honest."" He added that ""the allegation about allowing the public to watch operations is of great concern"".

Mr Bostock also wrote that meetings with staff had made ""clear there are clearly deep-seated issues which we will address in order to make theatres an attractive place to work and which provides high quality care to our patients"". He asked employees to ""resist engaging in public commentary on social media but to use the correct channels for addressing concerns"".

One source claimed the concerns over operations being watched had been ""raised so many times"" since the pandemic, adding: ""It's only now being taken seriously and investigated after the WalesOnline article"". In response, the health board spokeswoman said: ""We take the allegations of all colleagues, and those reported in WalesOnline, extremely seriously and we are now in the process of completing the internal review and investigating all concerns raised, regardless of the historic nature of these allegations.""

The service review is investigating ""serious concerns"" over staff turnover, leadership, and ""values and behaviours"". A whistleblower claimed to WalesOnline that the health board was prompted to act after a staff survey revealed widespread anger over a toxic culture that had allegedly plagued the hospital's theatres for years. They claimed that recent staff turnover had been ""huge"" because of alleged bullying.

We previously reported allegations that one member of staff had been suspended after saying a group of Indian nurses needed name badges as they ""all looked the same"". Sources claimed the staff member returned from suspension and took diversity classes but was then suspended again over further allegations of bullying and racism.

One whistleblower claimed: ""The department since the start of Covid has turned into the wild west. A member of staff was caught with the drug speed in their locker, suspended, then allowed back, and is still there now. There's a big increase in 'never events' [serious, preventable safety incidents] as experienced staff have left due to the way [the theatres] are managed. There are no experienced theatre staff to teach juniors.""

The health board spokeswoman said ""all colleagues affected"" by the service review would receive the final report and recommendations when available, adding: “We are committed to providing a positive and equitable working environment for all colleagues. As part of our Speaking Up Safely process, we encourage all colleagues to speak up and raise any concerns they have with the confidence that their voices will be heard and suggestions acted upon.”

She continued: ""There are occasions when members of the public have viewed operations, instances include, filming for Saving Lives in Cardiff and for media packages, but we would like to reassure colleagues, patients and their families that these are subject to strict policies and protocols that are adhered to at all times, especially in relation to patient consent.""

University Hospital of Wales, in the Heath area of Cardiff, contains 12 theatres. The theatres department cares for children and adults undergoing surgery. Its work includes surgery and anaesthesia for emergencies, trauma and orthopaedics.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

The Shifting Gears finale could be throwing a major obstacle at Tim Allen and Kat Dennings‘ characters right as the onscreen father-daughter duo's relationship was getting better.

In Us Weekly‘s exclusive clip from the Wednesday, March 19, season finale, Riley's (Dennings) ex Jimmy (Lucas Neff) shows up at her and dad Matt's (Allen) house with big news.



“I have been asked to replace the bass player for the Foo Fighters,” Jimmy reveals. “I have been enlisted to fight the Foo. We are talking about a two-year tour.”

After Jimmy lists “Europe, Asia, North and South America” as some of his tour stops, Riley points out that it is a “huge step up from North and South Dakota.” Matt, however, isn't as thrilled about the development in Jimmy's life.

“Didn't we have a little discussion about you improving yourself and making a big change?” he asks Jimmy, who replies, “I did change my life. I am going to be successful. This is our dream. It is going to change our family's lives.”

Jimmy then gets down on one knee — only to take out a key.

“I got us an amazing rental. It has got a yard, a pool and they are throwing in the gnomes,” he tells Riley. “It is literally everything we have always talked about — plus, it is near your dad so we can all be together.”

Matt doesn't seem thrilled by the news, joking, “I am just a big gnome on this.” According to the official synopsis, Riley will find herself “torn between her past and her future” after Jimmy asks that they rekindle their romance and move back in together.

When Shifting Gears premiered in January, viewers were introduced to Matt and his estranged daughter as they found themselves living together and working to repair their relationship. Season 1 followed Riley and her kids — Carter (Maxwell Simkins) and Georgia (Barrett Margolis) — integrating themselves into Matt's life.

Offscreen, Dennings, 38, found herself building a bond with Allen, 71. “It clicked pretty fast. We had lunch after I accepted the role, and I felt immediately like I could trust him for some reason,” Dennings exclusively told Us in January. “And he opened up really fast to me. So I [was] like, ‘OK, this guy is like letting me in.'”

Dennings said her and Allen's “instant” connection had only gotten stronger.

“For some reason it worked pretty immediately — maybe because I've grown up watching him for so much of my life, but it just worked. It felt very organic,” she recalled. “And as [filming has] progressed, our scenes are so funny, if I do say so myself. The arguments are my favorite scenes to play because I have no fear. There's no fear for either of us. We just absolutely go for it, and it's so much fun.”

As fans await a season 2 renewal, Dennings couldn't help but praise the “magical situation,” adding, “I was having a talk with a friend and I wasn't sure what to do next. She was like, ‘Well, if you could just describe your dream project, what would it be?' I was like, ‘I'd love to do a sitcom again.' I just described this exact scenario. Then the next day, I got the call about this.”

She concluded: “It was shocking. I'm still weirded out about it because I feel like I wished for it and there it was. So that is how it happened. And I grew up watching [Tim's show] Home Improvement so I was very excited about the idea of being his daughter. It's just been so fantastic and I feel very lucky.”

Shifting Gears airs on ABC Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET before streaming the next day on Hulu.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos thinks the public is underestimating Meghan Markle — especially following the success of her With Love, Meghan series.

“I think Meghan is underestimated in terms of her influence on culture. When we dropped the trailer for the Harry & Meghan doc series [in 2022], everything onscreen was dissected in the press for days,” Sarandos, 60, said in an interview with Variety, published on Wednesday, March 19. “The shoes she was wearing sold out all over the world. The Hermès blanket that was on the chair behind her sold out everywhere in the world. People are fascinated with Meghan Markle.”

Serandos added that Meghan, 43, and her husband, Prince Harry, are “overly dismissed,” but not by the streamer.

“We're a passive partner in Meghan's company, and it's a big discovery model for us right now,” Serandos added, seemingly referring to her forthcoming lifestyle brand As Ever.



Meghan and Harry signed a deal with Netflix in 2020, initially appearing in the Harry & Meghan docuseries which premiered two years later. Late last year, Harry was named as an executive producer on the POLO reality series while Meghan stayed in front of the camera for With Love, Meghan, which debuted earlier this month.

A source teased the show to Us Weekly exclusively in August 2024, saying that the series would “be a take on her and the joy of living.” The eight-episode miniseries offered an inside look at Meghan's life in Montecito. While her family — Harry and kids Archie, 5, and Lilibet 3 — didn't make an appearance, they were referenced more than once.

The family even had some moments together offscreen, at least according to a crew member.

“Whenever Harry visited set, he was always super polite and friendly. But it was clear he wanted this to be Meghan's moment to shine,” the crew member told People in an interview published earlier this month. The insider went on to say that Meghan was “super attentive and doting” when Archie and Lilibet were on set.

“We would give them headphones so they could listen to audio,” they added.

Netflix renewed With Love, Meghan for a second season, which has already finished filming. Director Michael Steed is returning, and has spoken about working alongside the Duchess of Sussex.

“For me, imperfection is a wonderful thing,” he told People. “It was fun watching her trying to get used to the kitchen, because it's not her place, so we didn't hide that fact, and she's kind of walking and looking for things. I really wanted to embrace and celebrate all of the mistakes and mess and all that good stuff.”

Sami Sheen had an emotional reaction when the results of her nose job were revealed during the latest episode of Denise Richards and Her Wild Things.

“I'm just so nervous,” Sami, 21, admitted during the Bravo show's Tuesday, March 18 episode, as she drove to her doctor's office with mom Denise Richards. “What if it's too skinny, I don't know. I hope he did the right amount.”

She continued, “Getting my boobs done, I didn't need it. I did it because I wanted big boobs, but this is going to change my whole life.”

Denise, 54, was baffled by her eldest daughter's admission.



“Really? I loved your nose,” she said. Sami replied, “Well, it's gone forever. Thank God.”

When she was in the examination chair, Sami asked Denise to look at the results first.

“I need you to be so honest with me before I see it,” Sami said. “I'm so scared.”

Denise noted that her daughter's nose looked “amazing” before handing Sami a mirror. The OnlyFans model started crying immediately upon seeing the results.

“I've wanted this for so long. Oh, my God, it looks so good,” Sami said. “This is how I'd FaceTune it. I can't believe it's real life now.”

She added, “I feel so pretty now. Now I feel like I can finally get my headshots done to start modeling. This was the one thing holding me back. … Now I got a good nose.”

Sami called it “the best day of my life” following the bit post-surgery reveal.

Sami further discussed her nose transformation in her confessional.

“I would spend hours and hours and hours editing my nose and I would specifically not be able to post certain things because my nose looked huge,” she said. “I wouldn't let people post things because of my nose. Oh, my God, I wanted to rip it off myself.”

During her own confessional, Denise said that she was “happy” for Sami.

“It's so hard as a mom, because I definitely don't think that Sami knows how other people see her and how beautiful she is,” Denise added. “I had to go back to my 19-year-old self when I had surgery and remember how I felt at that time. I now really understand how much it means to her to have this done. I do think, for her, she made the right decision.”

Denise Richards and Her Wild Things airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Erika Jayne and Sutton Stracke shared personal details about their bodies on the latest episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

“Please excuse my butt in your face,” Sutton, 53, said as she and the RHOBH women were about to board a boat during their trip to St. Lucia's Windjammer Landing resort, on Tuesday, March 18, episode.



Erika, 53, followed up with a compliment to her fellow Bravo star.

“Actually, you look cute,” Erika said. “What are you weighing? 100?”

Sutton replied, “No, I weigh like 110-111.”

Erika said that was “good,” before sharing her own weight.

“I'm at 128,” the Pretty Mess author said. “I go from 128 to 130, and that's it.”

The women then helped each other onto the dock ahead of their boat ride. While it seemed like a pleasant interaction between Erika and Sutton at the start of the trip, things got rocky between them on the boat.

“Today, we are going to go on a catamaran ride,” Bozoma Saint John told viewers in her confessional. “There'll be some food, some sunbathing, some swimming.”

Garcelle Beauvais, rightfully, had a more cynical outlook on the boat ride.

“Could someone be thrown overboard?” she quipped. “Absolutely, I can't wait to see who.” (The Real Housewives are known to have some epic fights on the high seas.)

During this particular boat day, Sutton brought up her apology to Dorit Kemsley from the RHOBH cast dinner the previous night.

“I was talking to Garcelle this morning about our conversation at the dinner table last night,” Sutton said. “My apology to Dorit. I really meant it, and I just wanted y'all to know that I meant it.”

She added, “It was a bad thing that I said and I really truly felt badly about it and it's not like me to say things like that. It was a terrible thing to say. I've beaten myself up about it.”

Sutton was referring to a past RHOBH episode where she told Dorit to “pick on somebody else whose wallet fits” while attending a lunch hosted by fellow cast member Jennifer Tilly.

During the boat ride, Erika chimed in with her thoughts about Sutton's apology.

“You know what I have noticed?” she stated. “I have noticed that you are very critical and sometimes very … not the most compassionate to women that are going through the worst time in their lives.”

Erika continued, “You pose as a friend and then oftentimes work as an enemy.”

Brittany Cartwright is firm in her stance about not getting back together with Jax Taylor — but that wasn't always the case.

“I've had, I'm not gonna lie, I've had like a couple of times where I was, like, lonely and was, like, ‘Whoa, what might happen?'” she revealed on the Tuesday, March 18, episode of the “I Do, Part 2” podcast. “But we never got back together and we will never ever get back together.”

Cartwright, 36, noted that there are times “where you feel weak” around your ex following a split, especially in situations like hers — she had been with Taylor, 45, for nearly a decade.

“You miss them and you feel lonely. And that's happened to me a lot,” she explained. “But I know I'm worth so much more and I can do so much better than what he put me through. That's a confidence that I never had before.”



While discussing her decision to end her marriage, Cartwright admitted she “would feel so dumb” going back to Taylor.

“I feel like I've gained so much more strength and I'm getting into such a better headspace. I'm so much happier and so much more confident since I've left him,” she continued. “If I went back to that, I feel like my peace would be all messed up again.”

Bravo viewers have had a front row seat to Cartwright and Taylor's ups and downs since they started dating on Vanderpump Rules. After documenting their 2019 nuptials for the show, the pair announced their departure one year later and took a break from reality TV before returning on The Valley.

Shortly before the spinoff premiered in early 2024, Cartwright and Taylor announced they were separating.

“So many of you guys have been asking me about Jax and I and our relationship. I just think it is important to be real and honest with you guys because we have shared so much of our life with you guys,” Cartwright said on a February 2024 episode of the “When Reality Hits” podcast. “I don't want it to seem like I am lying or anything like that. So I think it is important for me to say this.”

She continued: “With all the speculation online and stories running rampant, I wanted to be transparent with you. Yes, marriages are very hard, and I had a particularly rough year. Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health. I won't get into too many details right now because this is still really hard to talk about.”

Cartwright subsequently filed for divorce after Taylor checked himself into a mental health facility later that year. He recently revealed that he has been battling substance abuse issues for more than two decades.

“I've been dealing with this on and off since I was 23 and now I'm 45. There were times where I would stop doing it, but then there were times where I'd go heavy on it,” he said on the “Hot Mic” podcast earlier this month. “This year was probably the hardest year of my life.”

Taylor admitted his addiction “got worse” amid his divorce. “I've been doing it for a long time but the addiction got worse during my divorce and during my separation,” he continued. “I literally lost control. I hit rock bottom and I had to go to rehab.”

Cartwright subsequently defended her knowledge of Taylor's addiction struggles, as well as her attempts to get him help.

“His addiction unfortunately has done irreparable damage to my son and I,” Cartwright, who shares 3-year-old son Cruz with Taylor, wrote via Instagram. “I've spent years trying to help him. I wish more than anyone I could say how proud I am of him today but I'd be lying. His actions will speak for themselves.”.

Cartwright also addressed criticism of her staying with Taylor. “And to those asking why I stayed if I knew he had a problem all these years,” she concluded. “You can't help who you fell in love with. I've done absolutely everything in my power to get him the help he desperately needed. Unfortunately, I was naive and believed his empty promises and his pleas to change for years.”

QVC program host Mary Beth Roe is bidding a fond farewell to the shopping network with one final celebration.

“There are some things planned that I have no idea about, and that's what scares me because I don't like a lot of surprises,” Roe, 65, exclusively shared with Us Weekly ahead of her retirement celebration on Friday, March 21. “But I'm sure there'll be good surprises. However, I went to the person who's planning that show and said, ‘Here are some of the people that I want there.'”



For starters, Roe wanted her longtime friend and QVC's resident home decorator Valerie Parr Hill to showcase a product in her final show appropriately titled My Time with Mary Beth — Retirement Celebration.

Every item viewers will see promises to come from a brand or guest Roe adores.

“It will all be products that I'm familiar with, that I like the brand, I like the person who is the guest,” she said, adding that the purpose of the curation would be “so that I would be surrounded by people I love.”

While Roe was asked if she wanted to have a live studio audience for her final show, she politely declined just in case she gets a little emotional during the farewell.

“I love our customers and I love meeting our customers. But then I started thinking about how I may just have a meltdown, an emotional breakdown, and I thought, ‘I don't want to do that from an audience,'” she said with a laugh.  So anyway, I said, ‘No, let's not.'”

In June 2024, Roe first announced she would be retiring after nearly 37 years with QVC. While it was a “tough decision” to make, the program host relied on her strong faith to guide her. After her close friend unexpectedly died at 71, Roe was also reminded that life is too short.

“I have four grandkids, and I don't want to regret missing out on their lives because I spent another year or two working,” she explained. “Plus, I always said to myself I will never leave my team until I feel like my team is strong and cohesive and just a great team of hosts, and it is right now.”



A post shared by QVC+ HSN+ (@qvchsnplus)



Over the weekend, dozens of past and present QVC hosts gathered with producers and vendors to celebrate Roe at her retirement party. Soon after, several QVC stars paid tribute to their longtime coworker and friend.

“TY MB bc ur retirement party was a beautiful, bonding reunion with so many since departed QVC hosts and guests,” host Shawn Killinger wrote via Instagram on Monday, March 17. “To encounter a peer who is entirely pure of spirit, heart, intention … one who always has time for a kind word, encouragement, a laugh, a cry, a prayer…is rare. Special.”

As the celebrations continue all week long with special prime-time shows, Roe hopes she will be remembered by her coworkers and viewers as a “heartfelt host” who lived by the motto that product is king, customer is queen and hosts come third.

“I always wanted to be a team player, and that's what I would hope they would think of: hard worker, but team player,” Roe shared with Us. “And I always wanted to be a light in the darkness, and whatever the darkness might be, just to lift up people's days.”

My Time with Mary Beth — Retirement Celebration airs on QVC Friday, March 21, at 8 p.m. ET.

Bozoma Saint John was quick to offer Kyle Richards a “full report” after seeing Kyle's estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, at SoHo House with a new woman.

During the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills episode that aired on Tuesday, March 18, Bozoma, 48, noted that she had “made progress” in her friendship with Kyle, 56, — which resulted in “a really nice conversation” between the two. (A flashback showed Bozoma saying she was “ready for war” if Kyle needed her.)

“From that moment I was like, ‘Look, whatever I gotta do to help Kyle, I will.' God answered my prayer when I went to SoHo House a few days later and just happened to be seated across the table, I'm talking about as far as maybe Sutton [Stracke] is from me,” Bozoma said. “There is Mau with his girl.”

Kyle clarified that it was “a girl” — seemingly downplaying his relation to the woman.



“I texted Kyle in the moment,” Bozoma continued. “Then, afterwards, I gave her a full report.”

Kyle noted that she was sent a “three-and-a-half-minute voice note,” which Bozoma then played during her confessional.

“Hey babe, OK so, full report. She is definitely not cute. I mean, look if you're gonna do this, you need to get, like, the cutest girl on the planet, right,” Bozoma said in her voice note. “Actually, the entire time that I was sitting there, they were there. I was just dreaming up scenarios where I could push him into the water. Let me know what you want me to do because I will run up on a man.”

After her audio recording played, Bozoma looked at the camera adding: “And there you have it. Now, that's being a girl's girl.”

Us Weekly confirmed in July 2023 that Kyle and Mauricio had split after 27 years of marriage. The duo is currently living separately, something that was hard for Kyle to swallow during last week's RHOBH episode — especially after he was photographed with another woman.

Bozoma seeing Mauricio at SoHo House came after he was photographed kissing a mystery woman in a Greek airport. (Multiple outlets published the photos in July 2024.)

“Greece, now Malibu. Who knows where else,” Garcelle Beauvais said during her confessional. “It doesn't sound like it's a random girl. Sounds like it's his girl.”

Days after featuring his daughter North West on a controversial track with jailed rap mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, Kanye West is putting another of his four children in the spotlight.

West, 47, dropped three different versions of a film titled Bully, set to music from a forthcoming album of the same name, early Wednesday, March 19. The film features his son, Saint, 9, in a starring role.

The different cuts of the film range in length from 22 minutes to 45 minutes and feature Saint inside a wrestling ring. The youngster can be seen wielding a mallet as he faces off against various wrestlers.

“EVERY VERSION OF THE BULLY FILM,” West wrote via X, sharing links to three different versions of Bully, labeled “Screening Version,” “Post Hype Version” and “Post Post Hype Version.”



In February, West said the new album's title was inspired by Saint's behavior. “My son was playing with some kid, and then he kicked him. And I asked my son, I said, ‘Why did you do that?' and he said, ‘Cos he weak,' and I was like, ‘This man is really a bully,'” the rapper said during an interview with Justin LaBoy.

West shares daughters North, 11, and Chicago, 7, and sons Saint and Psalm, 5, with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

On Saturday, March 15, West released a song featuring North and Diddy, 55, titled “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” despite Kardashian's apparent attempts to stop its release.

In an alleged text message exchange between Kardashian and West, the Skims CEO told her ex-husband North could not be featured on the song because her name is trademarked. “I asked you at the time if I can trademark her name. You said yes. When she's 18, it goes to her. So stop,” Kardashian reportedly wrote, according to screenshots shared via TMZ.

“I sent paperwork over so she wouldn't be in the Diddy song to protect her,” Kardashian reportedly added, referencing the disgraced music mogul who was arrested in September 2024 and indicted on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. (Diddy has denied the allegations against him.)

In a tirade shared via X on Saturday, West claimed that the “Kardashian mob” was responsible for his alleged loss of parenting rights.

“Yes I have beef with people that froze my account took my kids away and tried to put me in jail AND ITS STUCK,” West wrote.

“I DONT WANT TO JUST ‘SEE' MY KIDS. I NEED TO RAISE THEM,” he added. “I NEED TO HAVE SAY SO OF WEAR THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND WHOS HOUSES THEY SLEEP OVER WEATHER MY DAUGHTERS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PERFUME ALL THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME BY THE KARDASHIAN MOB HULU AND DISNEY AND THE BIGGER AGENDA TO USE THE SELECTIVELY BRED BLACK CHILDREN TO BE PLATFORMS TO INFLUENCE BLACK PEOPLE.”

Us Weekly reached out to representatives for Kardashian and West for comment.

Christina Hendricks had mere hours to prepare to play Natalia Grace‘s third adoptive mother Cynthia Mans in Good American Family.

“I got cast 30 hours before I was on set. So I had to work very, very quickly,” Hendricks, 49, exclusively revealed in this week's issues of Us Weekly. ” I had an opportunity to read the scripts and I did watch Investigation Discovery's The Curious Case of Natalia Grace series that's out there to try and get as much information as possible. Then I worked with a dialect coach because we wanted Cynthia to stand out in a little bit of a different way from the [Barnetts]. So I did all of the big fittings and everything in 30 hours and then I was on set.”

Hendricks called it a “fast and furious” process. “But I digested as much as I could in that amount of time,”she said. “I actually was unfamiliar with the story. Then when they reached out to me, I turned to my husband [George Bianchini] and I was like, ‘Oh, this is this wild script.' And he was like, ‘I know all about that.' So I think there's a fair amount of people who do know about it.”

Grace, now 21, was originally born in Ukraine before being adopted at age 7 by Kristine and Michael Barnett. She was diagnosed with dwarfism but one year after moving in with the Barnetts in the U.S., they successfully changed Grace's birth year from 2003 to 1989 after allegedly suspecting she was a woman pretending to be a child. Despite their claims, Grace was later confirmed via DNA test to be eight years old when her adoptive parents abandoned her.



Following five-year investigation, the Barnetts were charged with multiple counts of neglecting a dependent in 2019. Michael was later found not guilty while the case against Kristine was dismissed.

While awaiting a trial, Grace was taken in by Mans (who Hendricks portrays on the series) and her family, which is explored in the second half of Hulu's Good American Family limited series.

“I don't come until the second part of the story. So Imogen Faith Reid [was already playing Natalia] for a while and she had her rhythm and she knew the character. For me, I was the newcomer and I was like, ‘I'm the new kid. What are you guys doing here? Show me the ropes,'” Hendricks recalled. “So even though Imogen was newer to the business, I was newer to the project. So it was really nice to be able to work with her because she was in it and her creative juices were going. I really got to show up and react to her and what she was doing, which was already so fantastic.”

Hendricks was thrilled to allow her scene partner to “lead the way.”

“It was incredibly easy. She was very open and trusting. Her and I hit it off right away,” she noted. “As dark as this material can be and how difficult it can be to play, we did have good laughs in between. We got to let loose and brighten the mood in between. And we stay in contact and we're excited to see each other soon.”

Despite not joining the series at the beginning, Hendricks felt welcome as soon as she was cast, adding, “I trusted [the cast and the crew]. I knew they'd been doing their research and it was a well-oiled machine by the time I got there.”

Hendricks also had the opportunity to do something “really different” artistically.

“I've never played a character like this and it is a very different kind of story than I played in the past. I've been working on very different things this year,” she shared with Us. “I went from a Victorian piece [with The Buccaneers] to a comedy in Ireland [Small Town, Big Story] to this. So it was a fun year to just try on all these different people and all these different experiences. It was just a way to keep my artistic drive going, try something new and show people that I'm open to something new. That was something really lovely and unexpected.”

New episodes of Good American Family premiere Wednesdays on Hulu.

While Love Is Blind star Sara Carton has publicly denied that she's dating costar Joey Levielle, his ex-fiancée, Monica Danús, says differently.

“I'm so sick of the lies. Just own up to it at this point,” Monica, 28, told Elite Daily in an interview published on Tuesday, March 18. “I texted Sara [before the reunion], ‘I'm hearing a lot of things about you and Joey. Is there anything you need to tell me?' And she called me and said, ‘Nothing's official, but we are seeing each other.'”

According to Monica, Sara, 29, allegedly revealed that she and Joey, 36, “didn't want to make anything official until any online hate dies down.”

“She told me this started a month ago, so that's at least two months ago now. I wouldn't be surprised if it was longer,” Monica alleged. “All this time when I was venting to her about Joey and she was saying she had my back, she was actually with him.”



Sara, meanwhile, has publicly denounced the dating speculation on multiple occasions.

“To be clear, me and Joey are not dating,” Sara said on the “Viall Files” podcast earlier in March, noting she only started speaking to Joey five months after production wrapped. “[Joey] and five other people visited me in Nashville and we called ourselves the ‘Yee-Haw Crew,' like, it's such a good time. We grew really, really close with each other just because of the support for each other, knowing what we've all been through and being able to be there for one another. It's been super important to me.”

She added, “This whole situation, I've felt very close with Joey. I'm fond of our relationship, but I [also] feel very well-supported by all those involved. I'm just very grateful that I've met him, but, yeah, we definitely have a friendship. We're definitely not dating.”

While Sara played coy about whether she'd date Joey down the line, she stressed that she had “no capacity to even think about” being in a relationship at the moment. (Sara similarly shut down the dating rumors in a since-expired Instagram Story upload on Tuesday. Joey also denied the reports during a Sunday, March 16, appearance on the “Curious Crossroads” podcast, noting he and Sara “discussed” if there's any dating potential. “Ultimately, we just decided, I don't think either of us are in the capacity to do that right now,” he added. “We're not dating.”)

Monica, however, believes Sara and Joey are in a secret romance, claiming to the outlet that it is a “betrayal.”

“It's very hurtful,” Monica told Elite Daily. “It's no surprise from Joey — I don't think very highly of him, and I don't want him in my life. But I'm hurt that Sara would do this to me.”

Monica and Joey were engaged throughout the duration of Love Is Blind season 8, ultimately breaking up on their would-be wedding day. Sara, meanwhile, similarly called it quits with fiancé Ben Mezzenga at the altar. According to Sara, she and Ben, 28, tried to date post-show before he ghosted her. He denied the accusations.

The rescheduled wedding of Katie Gaudreau and her fiancé, Devin Joyce, is on the horizon after their original date was canceled following the tragic deaths of Katie's brothers, Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau. 

Katie showed off a save the date for the ceremony via her Instagram Story on Tuesday, March 18, which is set for July 11 in Philadelphia. She placed her hand over the details of the big day, which served as an excuse to show off her diamond engagement ring and wedding band. 

The couple was originally supposed to get married on August 31, 2024, but were tragically forced to postpone after Johnny, 31, and Matthew, 29, were struck and killed by an alleged drunk driver while riding bicycles in Oldmans Township, New Jersey the night before the ceremony. 

Katie and Devin celebrated their ninth year of dating last week, with Katie acknowledging what a difficult time it's been for the Gaudreau family. 



She shared via Instagram, “9 (official) years full of love and laughter and I couldn't be more grateful to have you by my side. This past year has tested us in ways we never could have imagined, but our love has always come out stronger. You've shown up in ways that mean more than I can put into words, and I know I wouldn't have gotten through it without you.”

Katie then turned a hopeful eye to the future and the life she looks forward to building with Joyce. 

“Since high school I've been waiting for the day I get to call you my husband….even though I call you my husband now I can't wait for July 11th to officially be your wife,” she wrote. “No matter what life throws our way, I'll always be up for singing off-key and dancing terribly with you — whether it's in a bar or our little kitchen — forever and more.”

The post concluded, “I thought last year would be our last time celebrating March 12, 2016 but I guess this year has taught me to celebrate our love everyday, every minute. I love you and love celebrating our love, husband.”

Days after Johnny and Matthew's deaths, Katie reflected on the moment she heard the news while preparing for her wedding.

“That day,” she wrote via Instagram on September 5, less than a week after she was supposed to walk down the aisle. “Right in the middle of getting ready for the best day of my life the unthinkable happens that will change my life forever. I remember a week ago being in the hotel sitting with family and texting Devin about how we forgot to practice our dip. To think that was our biggest worry at this moment when in just a split second and a phone call later our lives would forever change.”

Katie added, “Remember to tell your people you love them. I would do anything to tell my big brothers I love them one more time.”

Johnny was set to enter his third season with the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets and welcome his third child with his wife, Meredith Gaudreau. Matthew was getting set to move on from his coaching job with the North American Hockey League's Philadelphia Rebels and welcome his first baby with his wife, Madeline Gaudreau. Baby Tripp Matthew was born in December 2024.

Good American Family sets up a dramatized version of Natalia Grace‘s childhood with Imogen Faith Reid at the center of the scripted series — but what is there to know about the actress?

Hulu released the first two episodes of the series on Wednesday, March 19, which introduced Us to Reid as Grace, who was adopted at age 7 by a U.S. family. Despite Grace being diagnosed with dwarfism, her adopted family — the Barnetts — ultimately accused her of secretly being an adult masquerading as a child.

The Barnetts were charged with multiple counts of neglecting a dependent in 2019. The charges were the result of a five-year investigation, where they accused Grace of lying to them while maintaining their innocence. (Michael was later found not guilty and the case against Kristine was dismissed.)

Before Good American Family, Grace spoke out in a three-season Investigation Discovery series The Curious Case Of Natalia Grace. Now Hulu is expanding the story with a scripted version starring Ellen Pompeo and Mark Duplass as the Barnetts, Christina Hendricks as Grace's third adopted mother and more.



“As Natalia, my version is very manipulative and always one step ahead and things like that. And we move onto my POV where we see her struggle, the abandonment, and I think that was, as an actor, fun to play with both,” Reid told TV Insider in March. “I mean, the first four episodes were so much fun, and I just unleashed that image, just ready to come out … my villain era. It was so much fun to play, but I do prefer Natalia's point of view because it was so heartbreaking, and that's a nuanced story. It's hard to get to the truth.”

Keep scrolling for everything to know about Reid amid her leading role on Good American Family:

Before Good American Family, Reid appeared as a double on The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and HBO's The Third Day. Good American Family is Reid's first official TV role.

“I can't believe I've just filmed my first ever TV series and I happen to be playing the main character 🤣💖 this experience has been honestly the best experience I have ever had! Every single person was so so supportive and I remember being soo nervous on my first day as it was all soo new to me!!” she wrote via Instagram in August 2024. “Thank you to everyone for always being the best everyday, for putting up with my singing and singing along, dancing with me on set when I had my zoomies 🤣🤣 and just always making me feel so loved and special it meant a lot💕.”

Reid continued: “I still can't believe I got this opportunity, I still pinch myself everyday about what I've just done for the last 5 months I'm soo lucky and grateful. Thank you for giving me this role and believing in me this story is for Natalia Grace 💖💖 Thank you and I miss all of you even though it's been a month 🤣.”

Disney set Reid up with an acting coach after she was cast. “From there, we broke down the script, broke down the character and I talked with the directors, EPs and a dialect coach to find my own version of Natalia,” Reid told Variety in March 2025.

Co-showrunner Sarah Sutherland praised Reid, adding, “I mean, she not only has to play over a wide range of years, she also plays Natalia from two different ages and different people's perspectives. Imogen blew everybody away. As soon as everybody saw her tape, it was clear she was the one.”

In real life, Grace was 7 when she was adopted from Ukraine after being diagnosed with a rare form of dwarfism known as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Reid, who was 27 when filming the show, has a different form of dwarfism.

“What she won't say is she's not speaking in her native dialect. The type of dwarfism that Natalia has is different than Imogen,” Duplass said about Reid during a panel in March 2025. “She has to figure out all these different movements — she has a movement coach. She's doing all of these things in her first speaking role. This is something you shouldn't do until you're 70 f–king years old and she just knocked it out of the park.”

Good American Family is Pompeo's first TV role after nearly two decades playing Meredith Grey on ABC's Grey's Anatomy. Luckily for Pompeo, her costars were already a fan of her work before she boarded the Hulu project as the lead and executive producer.

“I don't have words NONE I'm so EXCITED to not only be starring in my first series or going to L.A but working alongside Ellen Pompeo, the fact that I'm obsessed with greys anatomy and now get to work with Meridith Grey I'm so excited, nervous, anxious ahhhh,” Reid wrote via Instagram in August 2022. “I guess I'm going to L.A😭😭❤️❤️.”

“I didn't personally reach out to Natalia,” Reid told Entertainment Tonight before the show premiered. “But I wanted to make sure that in my version of Natalia that I embodied such empowerment, and I made my version be seen with so much light and my voice heard, and just fight for justice really.”

Ellen Pompeo is explaining a little more about her thought process during her last full seasons at Grey's Anatomy that caused her to reduce her role on the show.

If you don't know, in 2023, she stepped away as a full time cast member, but still does appear in a handful of episodes per season and provides Meredith Grey's iconic voiceovers.

On ""Call Her Daddy,"" Ellen shared that she felt she needed to step away at a certain point, due to feeling like an animal at a zoo.

She shared, “I didn't know what I was going to do. I just knew that I really couldn't do ‘Grey's' anymore. It was to the point where I really just felt like an animal at the zoo. I'm a big believer in destiny. I thought, if there's something else I'm meant to do, it's gonna find me. But I know I have to leave this.”

The current season of Grey's did see Ellen having an increased presence.

Ted Lasso is coming back for another season, but not every actor will be returning. 

The Apple TV+ comedy series was confirmed for a fourth season earlier this week, and Jason Sudeikis confirmed he will be reprising his titular role.

Also set to come back are Brett Goldstein (who played Roy Kent) as a writer and executive producer along with fellow EPs Brendon Hunt (who played Coach Beard), Joe Kelly, Jane Becker, Jamie Lee, Bill Wrubel, and Leanne Bowen.

However, we have now learned that one actor, with a recurring role, is set to be recast for the next installment.

The role of Ted's son Henry is reportedly being recast for season four, according to Deadline. Gus Turner has portrayed the character in 11 episodes throughout the first three seasons. 

While the character was a soccer fan in the past, he is now becoming a skilled player himself, which could be the reason for the recasting. It's unclear if the soccer skills or another reason are behind the recasting. It's also unclear if Andrea Anders, who played Henry's mom Michelle Lasso, will be returning or not.

Gus' last appearance was in the season three finale, ""So Long, Farewell,"" where Henry welcomed his dad home after Ted returned home to Kansas.

The new season will also reportedly film the first episode in Kansas before returning to the UK, with a start date in July being eyed.

Bella also revealed how the diagnosis came about, sharing, ""a crew member with an autistic daughter assumed that Ramsey had [autism], setting [Bella] off on a journey that ended in a formal psychiatric assessment and diagnosis.""

They added, “The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that's helped me to understand myself, but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I'm putting myself into a box. I feel trapped.”

“We were both crying… And the scene was so uncomfortable and awkward, and he didn't wanna do that. I didn't wanna do it. And when we filmed it, it was so bad. And then the network said there was too much thrusting,"" she went on to reveal.

“In your worst nightmare, [you] have to do it one time,” she continued. But “we had to reshoot that s—t… and do it twice.”

“I've never watched that scene,” she admitted. “I don't know how it was shot or covered or… edited, but I'm full-on in tears, the whole entire scene. And those are real tears.”

She also admitted a line she didn't want to say on the show!

“I didn't wanna say [to Derek], ‘Pick me, choose me, love me,'” she admitted. Luckily, series creator Shonda Rhimes “knew that was gonna pop. I was like, ‘Why would I beg?' And you know, you have to just suck it up and do it.

“And it ended up being [one of] the most iconic things ever,” she added. “So I'm not always the best judge of what's gonna [work].”

She also explained why she felt the need to step away from the show.

Shonda Rhimes is looking back at her wildly successful series Grey's Anatomy, which is now on season 21 on ABC.

However, there is a moment that she thought would ""kill"" the entire show, and it happened way back in 2007.

Keep reading to find out more...

THR asked if she had a ""rose"" and ""thorn"" for her time with the medical drama, and she elaborated on the thorn moment.

""I think the thorn was having the bubble of joy burst so early on Grey's [with the Isaiah Washington incident] and not having anybody interested in helping us deal with it, because that really shaped a lot of how we looked at the world going forward — and a lot of how [creative partner Betsy Beers] and I processed working with other people going forward. I mean, that was the thing we thought was going to kill the show. And it's funny, every Grey's actor I talk to who was there during that time is still traumatized by that incident. People still talk about it. So, that was the thorn. But I also think that there were so many roses that the thorn stopped mattering. I mean, that was the thing we thought was going to kill the show.""

If you don't know, Washington was fired from Grey's Anatomy back in 2007 after playing Dr. Preston Burke on the series after he used a homophobic slur.

In the Golden Globes press room back in 2007, Washington famously addressed the rumor that he used a derogatory term and said, “No, I did not call T.R. [Knight] a f—-t. Never happened, never happened.”

According to Deadline, the new series will be titled Stuart Fails To Save The Universe, putting Kevin Sussman's Stuart Bloom at the center. 

Along with Kevin, Brian Posehn, Lauren Lapkus and John Ross Bowie are set to reprise their characters Bert Kibbler, Denise and Barry Kripke.

Big Bang co-creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre will serve as creator and writer, along with fellow franchise co-creator Bill Prady and Zak Penn.

Heather Thomas experienced the dark side of Hollywood after her time on ""The Fall Guy.""

Thomas revealed on the ""Still Here Hollywood"" podcast that after her time on the hit show, she was bombarded with scary situations involving stalkers.

Thomas was on ""The Fall Guy"" from 1981 until the series concluded in 1986. She took on a few other roles after the show ended, such as in the films ""Red Blooded American Girl"" and ""Against The Law,"" but she decided to leave Hollywood behind in the '90s.

""I was just getting so many stalkers,"" she said before explaining that it was ""really bad."" It got to the point where Thomas was dealing with two stalkers a week, she told podcast host Steve Kmetko.

""I had tons of restraining orders. I had two little girls, and a guy was jumping our gate with a giant buck knife. In those days, I don't know if this is true now, but people would fixate. You could be in a soap commercial, and they would fixate on you. There weren't a lot of stalker laws, and I just needed to be home anyway,"" Thomas said.

She described her experience as being ""scary"" and even received some threatening items in the mail.

""Someone sent me a box of bullets, and people would send me funeral wreaths they stole from a graveyard,"" the actress shared.

Thomas continued, ""I always had a bodyguard in the house because that's where I didn't want to come home to a dark house.""

She explained that things turned violent when a man attempted to break into her bedroom.

""I had one guy one night cut my screen in my bedroom and got in, and I shot him,"" she said while clarifying that she had rock salt in her firearm. Thomas is still unsure if the intruder ever went to jail.

Thomas said that she has not been open about her stalkers in the past because she did not want to be labeled as ""the lady that was stalked.""

During the podcast episode, Thomas also discussed being sexualized in Hollywood.

""I think there's a certain amount of disassociation,"" she said of the industry. ""It was really my business. It would be like a woman who sold bathing suits. It was the way I sold things.""

Thomas said she was ""happy"" with her body because she ""worked hard"" for it.

When Thomas made her debut in Hollywood, she was a student at UCLA and wanted to focus on writing and directing, but she quickly learned it was ""rough"" for women.

She ultimately chose to be on-camera as opposed to being behind-the-scenes because of the paycheck. Thomas said she was ""making so much money"" that she chose the path of ""least resistance.""

CHICO, Calif. – Known for its thriving art scene and colorful murals, Chico is set to host a street fair this weekend that will not only add more vibrant artwork to the city but also celebrate the talent behind it.

Four top muralists are competing in the event, each transforming blank walls along Orange Street into striking works of art. The competition, held as part of an art festival organized by Maker Radio 94.5 FM, will allow attendees to vote for their favorite mural, with the winner receiving a $500 prize.

Dylan Tellesen, one of the participating artists, is putting the finishing touches on his mural titled Pulling Your Eyes Out.

“You know, sometimes people are frustrated and don't know what to do with the state of the world, so you've got to pull your eyes out sometimes,” Tellesen said.

While each artist brings their own unique style, one name stands out among the competitors: Shane Grammer, who gained national recognition for his artwork following the Paradise Camp Fire and is now bringing his talent to Orange Street with his piece, Robinhood.

Behind the artwork, the event is set to be a lively festival featuring live music, comedy performances, art galleries, and local artists showcasing their work.

“Our whole goal is to create opportunities for artists and creative folks to have a platform to show what they do and share their talents,” said Erin Banwell of Maker Radio 94.5 FM.

Tellesen emphasized the importance of public art, noting that murals make art accessible to everyone.

“I think public art is important. I think it's for everybody. You don't have to pay an admission fee or feel like you have to belong to enjoy it. So more public art, please, for everybody,” he said.

The event will take place on Orange Street between 6th and 7th Streets, which will be closed from noon to 10 p.m. on Saturday. Organizers anticipate a crowd of around 1,000 attendees.

Pete Davidson has a new girlfriend, and her identity has just been revealed. 

The comedian has dated his fair share of female stars, but his current partner is not a celebrity. An insider recently told Page Six that Davidson's new flame is ""very different from anybody else he's ever dated."" 

""She respects Pete and his desire for privacy. Although things are new for Pete, he really likes this woman,"" the source noted, in addition to unveiling that both the comedian's mother, Amy Waters Davidson, and sister, Casey Davidson, ""approve of this relationship and love seeing Pete so happy."" 

So, who is Pete Davidson's new girlfriend? 

That would be 29-year-old model Elsie Hewitt. But there's more. 

The model has dated celebs before and has been romantically linked to producer Benny Blanco, who is currently engaged to Selena Gomez, and actor Jason Sudeikis in the past, Page Six confirmed. 

According to the outlet, Hewitt dated Blanco in 2019, and the former pair split after a year. She allegedly dated Sudeikis in 2024, but the couple have since called it quits. 

Photos captured by Daily Mail show Davidson and the model packing on the PDA during a Wednesday (March 19) outing in Palm Beach, Florida. The Pete Davidson: Alive from New York standout, who has been romantically linked to Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, and Kate Beckinsale (to mention only a few of his former relationships), has yet to comment on his new connection as news of her identity surfaces.

NEW YORK (AP) — The new Paramount+ series “Happy Face” has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.

“I was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,"" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. ""I just feel like we've seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.”

“Happy Face,” which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.

Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.

A female point of view

Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, “Happy Face” is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.

“There's a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It's either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it's all about kicking in doors. I've written on those shows and they're fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,” Cacicio says.

“What is it like for the rest of the family when there's this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?”

Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in “Sweeney Todd,” plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.

“It's one of the worst nightmares,” she says. “The worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you're a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?”

The TV pitch for ‘Happy Face'

Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, “Shattered Silence” and the 2018 ""Happy Face"" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.

Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: “If you want someone who's a straight-up journalist, who's just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,” she told her. “There's also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that's asking some questions about true crime.”

Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives — Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.

“Obviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn't talk about and it was something I didn't want my friends to know,” says Cacicio.

“A lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that's what made her trust me — that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn't necessarily understand the specific circumstances.”

Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also “Happy Face” isn't that kind of show.

“This is told from Melissa's point of view, and I think it's actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,” he says. “I think he shows emotions like a little boy who's trying to talk himself out of a whipping.”

Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.

“Are we obsessed with these stories because we're trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?” she asks. “I read somewhere that it's an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it's whatever you're watching is worse than what's happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.”

Led by London-based agents Shelby Schenkman and Beth Heard, the burgeoning U.K. unit continues to add creators across such topic areas as books, news, and celebrity news.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Global talent, entertainment, sports and advisory company UTA has signed popular U.K. creators Jack Edwards, Madame Joyce, and Lewis Goodall for global representation in all areas.


	The deals fit into UTA's expansion of its U.K. Creator division which is part of its international growth strategy. The agency is looking to provide digital, gaming/e-sports, and audio talent and groups access to a wider network across unscripted and scripted TV, audio, live touring, publishing, news, and broadcasting.




	The three new signings have a combined audience reach of more than 5 million people across their social channels and broadcast platforms.

	Madame Joyce is a podcaster, presenter, and media personality with a combined audience of more than 2 million people whose podcast Cocktails & Takeaways delves into celebrity news, gossip, and discussions over drinks. She is being co-represented with Jackie Eyewe, manager and director of Makers Agency.

	Jack Edwards is considered the world's most influential BookTuber with an audience of more than 3 million across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.


	And journalist, presenter, broadcaster, and writer Lewis Goodall has emerged as a new voice in U.K. news and politics, since 2022 hosting The News Agents, which became the UK's biggest daily news podcast. He is a UTA Creator unit co-signing with the agency's literary arm Curtis Brown.


	Led by London-based agents Shelby Schenkman and Beth Heard, UTA's burgeoning U.K. Creator division has brought in a broad array of talent, including Madeline Argy, Jamie Laing and Sophie Habboo, Lissie Mackintosh, and Grace Campbell. 


	Its practice also represents such clients as Dave Portnoy/Barstool, Mr. Ballen/Ballen Studios, Emma Chamberlain, Alix & Ashtin Earle, Charli D'Amelio, Jake Shane, Kai Cenat, and Alex Cooper.


	UTA opened its creator practice in 2006 and says it became the first agency to have its own audio and digital talent division. It also led the way in launching a dedicated gaming and e-sports unit.

	A recent Statista forecast predicted that U.K. advertising spending in the influencer space would reach $1.31 billion this year. Marketing agency Digital Voices sees the global creator economy reach $480 billion in value by 2027.

	











	“Our U.K. Creator offering is an extension of the premium services we provide in the U.S, offering clients access to a vast global network, helping them scale their careers beyond local markets,” Ali Berman, partner & head of digital at UTA, tells The Hollywood Reporter.


	“The media and entertainment landscape is rapidly evolving, and UTA remains the go-to resource for connecting top talent with media and brand partners to navigate these shifts and continue building upward in the growing creator economy,” adds Oren Rosenbaum, partner & head of Audio, UTA. “Our global approach allows us to unlock opportunities that ensure long-term success for our clients.”

	Madame Joyce is set to embark on a U.K.-wide live tour in the coming months. She has struck collaborations with such brands as Sony Music, Cadbury, Spotify, Amazon and JD.  Edwards has collaborated with such brands as Valentino, Audible, and the BBC. Goodall is a former senior political journalist and presenter at the BBC and Sky News, and a former policy editor at BBC Newsnight, the public broadcaster's flagship political and current affairs show.

Jonathan Majors secretly married Meagan Good, he confirmed Wednesday while on Sherri.

After host Sherri Shepherd said she was shocked to hear reports about their alleged nuptials Tuesday, he responded, ""I said to Meagan yesterday, I said, 'Today might be the happiest day of my life.'""

""I love that woman so much,"" Majors continued. ""So how it had happened — well, Lord, Sherri, thank you. We fell in love. We finally got to do it, but it was always the plan.""

According to Majors, he asked Meagan's father for her hand in marriage and received his blessing. His mother officiated the ceremony, where they exchanged rings they had engraved in Hawaii.

Jonathan and Meagan were first connected in May 2023 and confirmed they were engaged at the EBONY Power 100 Gala in November 2024. She stood by his side as he faced a legal battle, was found guilty of two counts of misdemeanor assault and harassment, and was sentenced to complete one year of an ""in person batterers"" intervention program in LA.

Jonathan is promoting his new movie, Magazine Dreams, while also making headlines for an unearthed audio clip that reportedly captures him admitting to strangling ex Grace Jabbari ""in the aftermath of a days-long fight,"" per Rolling Stone.

“I'm ashamed I've ever – I've never [been] aggressive with a woman before. I've never aggressed a woman – I aggressed you,” Majors said in the clip obtained by RS.

“You strangled me and pushed me against the car,” Jabbari replied, to which Majors said, “Yes, all those things are under ‘aggressed,' yeah. That's never happened to me.”

Magazine Dreams comes out on Friday.

Meagan divorced her former husband, pastor DeVon Franklin, in June 2022 after nine years of marriage.

Jonathan Majors and Meagan Good have reportedly tied the knot. 

According to Entertainment Tonight, Majors and Good married on Tuesday (March 18) during a ""small private wedding"" at their home in Los Angeles.

The couple reportedly exchanged vows in front of their mothers. Major's mother, a pastor, was the officiant, while Good's mother was the witness, according to reports. They were reportedly the only family members who attended the private ceremony.

Reports of Majors and Good tying the knot come after the pair announced their engagement four months ago at the Ebony Power 100 Gala at NYA Studios West in Los Angeles. Good showed off her diamond ring on the carpet at the November event.

The couple told E! News they wanted to make their engagement public at the gala because it's where they first met two years ago.

""EBONY Power 100 is the event that we met at in the bathrooms, in the unisex bathroom,” Good said at the time.

Majors and Good, who finalized her divorce from pastor DeVon Franklin in June 2022, were first romantically linked in May 2023 after they were spotted watching a movie together. 

Their romance was thrust into the public eye as Majors faced trial and was found guilty of assault and harassment in December 2023 in connection to a domestic dispute with his ex-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari. In April, Majors was sentenced to one year of an ""in-person batterers"" intervention program in Los Angeles.

Earlier this week, Rolling Stone released a bombshell audio recording during which Majors admitted to strangling Jabarri during a separate domestic dispute in September 2022.

“I'm ashamed [as] I've ever [been] …,” Majors said in the audio, per the outlet. “I've never [been] aggressive with a woman before. I've never aggressed a woman — I aggressed you.” 

“You strangled me and pushed me against the car,"" Jabbari responded.

“Yes, all those things are under ‘aggressed,' yeah,” the actor replied. “That's never happened to me.”

Christina Applegate recently revealed that she was hospitalized over ""30 times"" and suffered repetitive symptoms. 

The Bad Moms actress zoomed in on her Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis and the uncomfortable ailments attached to the autoimmune disease in the latest episode of her iHeartRadio podcast MeSsy with co-host Jamie-Lynn Sigler. 

The standout addressed a comment from a listener who was also diagnosed with MS and endured frequent diarrhea and vomiting. Applegate unveiled that nearly every time she goes to relieve herself, she also throws up. These symptoms, along with ""excruciating"" stomach pain, have landed the star in the hospital more than 30 times, and doctors are still unsure whether it has something to do with the disease despite Applegate having undergone ""every test known to man."" 

The Anchorman sensation has a colonoscopy scheduled to determine if the symptoms are related to MS, and advised listeners battling the condition to ""Always have a little trash can next to your toilet. Because you can do both without it being messy.""

Applegate was diagnosed with the disease in 2021, per TMZ, and has since been very open about her struggles. In December 2024, the standout shone a spotlight on a health complication she experienced while filming Netflix series Dead To Me in 2019. Applegate would constantly fall and lose her balance on set, only to find out years later that this was the ""first sign"" of the life-altering disease.

Phoebe Dynevor is to star alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in new movie Pendulum.

The motion picture, which will be produced by Darren Aronofsky and directed by Black Swan writer Mark Heyman, is a ""terrifying new genre film"", according to Deadline.

Bridgerton actress Dynevor and Gordon-Levitt will play young couple Abigail and Patrick, who head to a retreat in New Mexico following a traumatic event.

However, things take a turn for the worst when Abigail falls under the spell of the new-age retreat's leader.

It's one of many upcoming films for Dynevor, who will appear in thriller Beneath the Storm later this year, and she is to star opposite Diane Lane in thriller Anniversary.

What's more, the Fair Play actress recently wrapped on another thriller movie, Famous, which will see her star opposite Zac Efron, and she has joined the cast of M. Night Shyamalan's next film alongside Jake Gyllenhaal.

In January, Dynevor starred in Neil Burger's spy movie Inheritance, which was filmed entirely on an iPhone, and she admitted the process was a ""daunting"" challenge.

Speaking to Collider, she said: ""I was very confused and baffled by it.

""I think we had to have a few Zooms before I really understood what he was trying to do, but then I became really excited about the guerrilla style of shooting and the fact that we could go to all these places and steal footage from all of these places, whether it was on aeroplanes or an Apple store, at the pyramids.

""It was such an exciting, very daunting prospect, so I was ready. I was really at a point where I wanted to challenge myself, and it really was that. It was a great challenge.""

Jon Batiste's wife is in remission from leukaemia.

The 'Freedom' singer's spouse, Suleika Jaouad - who was first diagnosed with the disease in 2010 before relapsing in December 2021 and again last summer - is currently ""doing great"" and the couple are feeling ""very inspired"" by the positive turn in the writer's health battle.

Jon told E! News: ""She's doing great. Now she has this beautiful remission. That's been the case for the last few months and we're just hoping that it remains that way. She's been taking everything in stride and gracefully dealing with all of the things that are going on.

""She's able to continue to paint, continue to write. All this is happening after this crazy recurrence, and it's just the best-case scenario. She's feeling healthy. The treatment is working and we're very inspired.""

But the 38-year-old singer and his spouse - who married in secret after her second diagnosis - are aware things won't always be plain sailing with her health.

He said: ""It's just a process. It goes through these different moments of treatments that are indefinite for her, it won't stop. It will continue until there's some innovation. We know that.

""Sometimes the cancer will be gone, other times, we'll have to deal with what comes when it comes back and that's just a part of our life. I support her in that.""

And Jon believes the 36-year-old author's struggles have made them stronger as a couple.

He said: ""It tests you. We all have these things that challenge us to build our character and strengthen our relationships.

""It's actually strengthened our relationship and connection because we already were close.""

In December, Suleika reflected on the ups and downs they have experienced and expressed her gratitude for the ""joys"" that have brightened the days during the ""hardest"" times.

Sharing a selection of photos from 2014, she wrote on Instagram: ""When you learn for the third time you have cancer, it's easy to feel hopeless.

""But my photos showed me that even in the hardest moments, there were so many joys. That life is not a monolith. That our forever work is to learn to hold the brutal and beautiful in the same palm.”

Gwyneth Paltrow thinks the #MeToo movement has ""changed"" Hollywood.

The 52-year-old star has recently returned to her acting roots in order to shoot 'Marty Supreme', a new sports drama movie, and Gwyneth believes that the #MeToo movement has helped to change the culture of Hollywood.

Speaking to Vanity Fair magazine, Gwyneth explained: ""There are no meetings set up in hotel rooms, from what I understand, or if there are, it's multiple people in the room. That bubble has definitely burst.

""I'm sure people still abuse power in Hollywood because they do everywhere, but it has definitely changed.""

Gwyneth filmed some sex scenes with Timothee Chalamet for their new movie. But the Oscar-winning star opted against having an intimacy coordinator, because she feared that it could stifle her performance.

The actress shared: ""We said, ‘I think we're good. You can step a little bit back'.

""I don't know how it is for kids who are starting out, but … if someone is like, ‘Okay, and then he's going to put his hand here'?I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.""

Gwyneth previously admitted that she achieved most of her acting ambitions before she turned 30.

The film star has largely focused her attention on her lifestyle brand in recent years, and Gwyneth confessed that she ""doesn't love acting that much"".

The movie star - who is the daughter of filmmaker Bruce Paltrow and actress Blythe Danner - told SiriusXM: ""I think that when you hit the bullseye when you're 26 years old, and you're a metrics-driven person - who, frankly, doesn't love acting that much, as it turns out ...

Ormax has released the list of top 10 actors by sharing a post on its Insta account. The caption with this post read, 'Ormax Stars India Loves: Most Popular Male Stars in India February 2025. The interesting thing is that in Ormax's list of top 10 stars, South stars have dominated Bollywood actors. 7 superstars of the South are included in this list while only 3 Bollywood actors could make it to the list. Among them, Prabhas is in the number one position. This is the list of top 10 stars:

Four South stars are in top 5 with just one Bollywood star

Let us tell you that Prabhas has also defeated Bollywood's Badshah i.e. Shah Rukh Khan in popularity. There are four stars from South in the top 5 and only SRK from Bollywood has managed to secure the third position. However, this list changes every week and its listing is done according to the buzz.

Prabhas Work Front

Talking about the most popular actor Prabhas, last year he created a ruckus at the box office with the film Kalki 2898 AD. His upcoming films now include Raja Saab which can be released by April 2025. At the same time, the work of Part 2 of Kalki 2898 AD has also started.

Calvin Harris has bought his favourite pub.

The 'Feel So Close' hitmaker - who is married to DJ Vick Hope - used to drink at the Coach + Horses inn in Dumfries, Scotland, before he found fame and now the producer, who no longer drinks alcohol, and his best friend Mark Irving have splashed out on the bar, with his pal taking over as landlord.

A source told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: “Calvin and Mark have gone into business together and created a company called To The Nines. They've now taken over the Coach Horses and Mark is in place as the landlord.

“It's a gorgeous pub with a great atmosphere. It's a great grass-roots music venue too, which is something they're both really proud of.

“Calvin used to drink there before he got famous and there is a signed poster for his first album on the wall.

“It's a hard time for pubs but the Coach + Horses Inn is thriving.”

The old landlord, John Owens, previously spoke of how Calvin - whose real name is Adam Wiles - would still go the pub when he visited his family.

He said: “Calvin, or Adam, is a pleasant chap, always has been. We're all proud of him. When he's home he'll pop in if he gets the chance.”

The 41-year-old star also owns a farm in Ibiza and a townhouse in north London.

A year ago, firefighters were called to his home in the US after a huge blaze broke out.

A major fire erupted on one of the upper levels of the DJ's three-story mansion in Beverly Hills, California and emergency services rushed to the scene with TMZ reporting fire trucks ambulances and helicopters were all spotted at the house.

The website states firefighters had to cut through the roof of the building's second floor to get to the fire, which is said to have broken out close to the mansion's cinema room and they spent almost an hour working to get the blaze under control.

The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical problem and caused around £100,000 in damage but no one was hurt.

Calvin - who is said to have been renting the house for the last few years - was not at home at the time of the incident.

Kesha felt ""pretty isolated"" when she was questioning her sexuality.

The 38-year-old singer - who has dated both men and women - has always wanted her concerts to be somewhere that people felt free to be themselves because of her own experiences witnessing a ""lack of inclusion and a lack of acceptance"" at a young age.

She told People magazine: ""I remember saying when I began, if I have to tour the world, I'm going to make sure that my shows are a place where people can come be in their sexuality, because growing up as a woman or a girl, questioning my sexuality, I didn't find community in that. I felt pretty isolated.""

The 'Rainbow' singer found herself looking to suppress parts of herself to be accepted but soon realised that wasn't the right thing to do.

She said: ""I decided that actually I might not be the best, I might not be for everybody, but I'm going to be the f****** best at being myself.

""And I think that was a beautiful lesson.""

And Kesha argued sexuality shouldn't be ""shrouded in shame"".

She said: ""Sexuality should not be something that's shrouded in shame. I am a really big proponent of just be who you are and give yourself the permission to be proud and authentic in that.""

The 'TikTok' hitmaker insisted authenticity is much more ""attractive"" than perfection.

She said: ""The most attractive vibration a human being can give off is not perfection, it's authenticity. Sometimes you look at pictures that have been photoshopped, and everything is so symmetrical and so airbrushed, and it just looks weird.

""That's because perfection is actually quite unnatural.""

Kesha recently declared she is on the hunt for a ""sugar daddy"" to take care of her.

She told 'On the Red Carpet': ""I have explored non-monogamy. I've been in love with many, many men and many, many women, and currently where I'm at is I am looking for a sugar daddy.

""I love being able to just be open and honest about it, because I'm f---ing into somebody taking care of me, putting me on a pedestal, taking me on their yacht and flying me on their plane. I'm just into it, and I will not feel shame about that.

""I've dated a lot of very cool, very broke hipsters with very bad attitudes, and so I'm trying to swing the pendulum 180 degrees and go in the entirely opposite direction.

""I want someone that goes to an office building because they own the office building.""

Ryan Reynolds has rubbished Justin Baldoni's defamation lawsuit.

The 48-year-old actor has filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni's lawsuit, insisting that the 'It Ends With Us' director's allegations have no merit.

Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson, Reynolds' attorneys, said in a statement: ""The entirety of Mr. Baldoni's case appears to be based on Mr. Reynolds allegedly privately calling Mr. Baldoni a ‘predator,' but here's the problem - that is not defamation unless they can show that Mr. Reynolds did not believe that statement to be true.

""The complaint doesn't allege that. In fact, it suggests the opposite: that Mr. Reynolds genuinely believes Mr. Baldoni is a predator.""

Reynolds's legal team insist that the actor is entitled to ""express his opinion of Mr. Baldoni"".

They said: ""Mr. Reynolds has a First Amendment right to express his opinion of Mr. Baldoni, which should be comforting to a group of people who have repeatedly called Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds ‘bullies' and other names over the past year.""

What's more, the director has been accused of trying to shame Reynolds ""for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be"".

A spokesperson for the actor said: ""The claims filed against Mr. Reynolds are simply a list of grievances attempting to shame him for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be - a man who is ‘confident enough to listen' to the woman in his life.""

Blake Lively, Reynolds's wife, previously launched a lawsuit against her 'It Ends With Us' director and co-star, accusing him of harassing her while making the romantic drama film.

The actress accused Baldoni of causing her ""severe emotional distress"".

The Hollywood star - who played Baldoni's on-screen love interest in 'It Ends with Us' - previously told the New York Times newspaper: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""

Baldoni later denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as ""categorically false"".

Justin Baldoni's attorney insisted they may not be open to a settlement with Blake Lively.

The actress, 36, and 41-year-old filmmaker have been embroiled in a bitter labyrinthine legal dispute for months after she accused him of harassment while they made domestic abuse movie ‘It Ends With Us'.

Appearing on Matthew Belloni's podcast 'The Town', Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman was asked ""what it would require for this to go away"", as he referred to the ""potential for the circus and the damage to both sides"".

But Freedman argued: ""You keep referring to it as a circus and I get it. You see a lot of cases.

""You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this.

""I've represented a lot of people in the worst moments of their career, the worst moments of their life. Justin has been destroyed by this.""

Freedman suggested ""the only way"" to really attempt to prove his client's innocence could be in court.

He continued: ""In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that's what we're actively working to [do].

""That may only be able to be done in a courtroom.""

Justin, 41, completed filming on 'It Ends With Us' in early 2024 and started a press tour in August, and after fans noted Blake did not participate in interviews with him or attend the film's premiere.

Blake then filed a sexual harassment complaint against Justin – alleging that he and his agents conducted a smear campaign against her.

Her lawsuit against him is set to go to trial in March 2026, following her initial filing in New York Federal Court.

Blake - who played Justin's on-screen love interest in the movie - previously told the New York Times newspaper: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""

Justin - who also directed the 2024 romantic drama film - has denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as ""categorically false"".

Bryan, who is acting as a lawyer for the actor and his Wayfarer Studios production company, told Variety: ""These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.""

Drake's record label are seeking to have his lawsuit against them dismissed, arguing he ""encouraged"" his feud with Kendrick Lamar.

The Canadian rapper sued Universal Music Group (UMG) for releasing and promoting Kendrick's diss track 'Not Like Us' but in their response to the defamation case, they argued the 38-year-old star ""lost a rap battle that he provoked"" and ""sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.""

In documents obtained by People magazine, UMG claimed that although 'Not Like Us' features hyperbolic insults, including referring to Drake and his friends as ""certified paedophiles"", the 'God's Plan' hitmaker had used their platform to ""promote tracks levelling similarly incendiary attacks"" on his rival.

The filing added: “Drake encouraged the feud.

""For example, when he felt that Lamar was taking too long to respond, Drake released a second recording in which he goaded Lamar to continue the public rap battle. Lamar did just that, and collectively Drake and Lamar released a total of nine tracks taking aim at each other.""

The motion notes Drake was ""pleased"" to see UMG promote tracks that accused Kendrick of engaging in domestic abuse and ""that one of Lamar's business partners and managers is the true father of Lamar's son.""

The filing noted: ""But now, after losing the rap battle, Drake claims that ‘Not Like Us' is defamatory. It is not.""

The response also criticised Drake's claim 'Not Like Us' constitutes ""second-degree harassment"" and promoting the song goes against general business law in New York.

The document stated: ""Less than three years ago, Drake himself signed a public petition criticising 'the trend of prosecutors using artists' creative expression against them' by treating rap lyrics as literal fact. As Drake recognised, when it comes to rap, '[t]he final work is a product of the artist's vision and imagination'.

""Drake was right then and is wrong now. The complaint's unjustified claims against UMG are no more than Drake's attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle with Lamar. The court should grant UMG's motion and dismiss the Complaint with prejudice.""

Drake's attorney, Michael J. Gottlieb, accused UMG of trying to use a ""desperate ploy"" to ""avoid accountability.

He told People magazine: “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence.

""This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG's long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.”

Taylor was the big winner at the iHeartRadio Music Awards 2025.

The 35-year-old pop megastar was honoured with nine prizes at the ceremony in Los Angeles' Dolby Theater on Monday night, with her haul including Artist of the Year.

Swift didn't attend the event, but she pre-recorded an acceptance speech for the Tour of the Century prize for ‘The Eras Tour', in which she marked the two-year anniversary of the mammoth jaunt starting in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023.

Swift admitted the global trek – which broke the record as the highest-grossing tour of all time and spanned 149 shows in 51 cities - was “the most challenging thing” she's ever done.

She began: ""I really can't tell you how much this means to me because I accept this on behalf of all my tour mates, my band, everyone who toured with us, our crew.""

Swift continued: ""People often say that sometimes the greatest challenges in life end up being something that you are so proud of or end up being the most gratifying feeling in the end if you can rise to the occasion. And this tour was absolutely the most challenging thing I've ever done in my life.""

The 'Fortnight' hitmaker insisted it wouldn't have been possible for her to ""take on those challenges"" without the support of her Swifties.

She said: ""It's a three-and-a-half-hour show, more shows than I've ever done on a tour and it really was the most gratifying thing I've ever done. I think about that tour constantly. I'm so proud of it.

""And the only reason I was able to take on those challenges, among others, the ambition of the production, the length of the show, the amount of shows in all the different countries we played in, that's all because of the fans.""

Thanking her fans, she concluded: ""You had the passion and the generosity to care about travelling to see us on tour in all these places all over the world.

""It blows my mind.

""I'm never gonna stop being grateful for it. And I appreciate it more than you know.""

Karlie Kloss is pregnant.

The 33-year-old model - who already has Levi, four, and 19-month-old Elijah with husband Joshua Kushner - took to Instagram to show off some photos of her growing baby bump, as well as pictures of her sons.

She captioned the post: ""Three's a party (sic)""

And Karlie admitted she is ""incredibly grateful"" to be expecting again.

She told Vogue.com: “Family is everything to me. Josh and I are incredibly grateful for this blessing.”

Karlie previously admitted that motherhood has changed her entire outlook on life.

The model described motherhood as a ""profound experience"" and confessed that she had ""no idea"" what to expect before she became a mom for the first time.

The catwalk star - who has been married to Joshua since 2018 - said on the 'Today' show: ""I just had this moment of like, ‘Wow, every woman who has a child, every parent goes through this'. It's just the most profound experience that I had no idea until having a kid.""

Karlie also revealed that motherhood has made her much more ""efficient"" and time-conscious, as her children are now her number one priority in life.

The model explained that she's ""actually on time everywhere now"".

She shared: ""Priorities change. Everything changes. I think the last few years have changed us as well. I have become, first of all, so much more efficient with my time. I'm actually on time everywhere now.""

“To actually see my friends and share this exciting, good news in person – and be able to see their reactions – was really special.”

Youngbloods frontman Jesse Colin Young has died at the age of 83.

The music star and social activist - whose real name was Perry Miller - passed away on Sunday (16.03.25) surrounded by family at home in South Carolina.

A statement from his publicity team read: ""It is with deep sadness that we announce music legend Jesse Colin Young, who left a unique mark on the intersecting worlds of folk, blues, jazz, country, and rock and roll, died in his home in Aiken, South Carolina yesterday afternoon.""

No cause of death was given.

The singer found fame as the lead vocalist and bassist of the '60s folk-rock group Youngbloods, who are best known for 1967 cover of 'Get Together', which became a symbol of peace and unity.

The song was originally penned by Chet Powers (also known as Dino Valenti) in the early ‘60s.

Upon its release, it failed to set the charts alight and peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard Hot 100.

However, it was re-released two years later and after it featured in a public service announcement promoting brotherhood by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, it made it all the way to No. 5.

Before forming The Youngbloods, Young released solo records, including 1964's 'The Soul of a City Boy' (1964) and 1965's 'Young Blood'.

The group went their separate ways in 1972, however, Young continued to release solo albums.

He was diagnosed with chronic autoimmune condition Lyme Disease in 2012 and subsequently retired from music. However, he began performing again in 2016 with his son Tristan and released the album 'Dreamers' in 2019.

Nickelback will play their first concert on Vancouver Island in 20 years this summer — one that has the potential to set an attendance record in the region.

The veteran Vancouver group, which is among the bestselling rock acts of all-time, is appearing at the newly named Laketown Amphitheatre in Lake Cowichan on Aug. 9. Nickelback has not performed on Vancouver Island since Aug. 19-20, 2005, when the How You Remind Me and Photograph hitmakers played two shows at the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre in Victoria.

At the site near Youbou known as Laketown Ranch Music and Recreation Park, the summer concert will have a capacity of 15,000, according to organizers Wideglide Entertainment, which owns and operates the property. In the event of a sellout, Nickelback would set the record for the largest paid concert attendance in Vancouver Island concert history, breaking the 2018 record of 13,500 attendees set by Eric Church at Sunfest.

Mike Hann of Wideglide Entertainment said the band is aware of the potential for a record-setting performance and is aiming to wow audiences. “The production values Nickelback are bringing to the stage will be more than any other concert ever held at our site. It will be a level up, production-wise.”

The concert, Hann said, is part of a new vision for the venue. The Duncan-based live event company announced in January it was rebranding the 260-acre site and moving in a direction that pairs the annual Sunfest country music festival (which runs July 31-Aug. 3 this year) with larger one-off events. The timing could not have been better for the switch, Hann said. “We're not reinventing the wheel. There are permanent venues across North American doing the exact same thing. But we are playing to our strengths. This is an example of why we made that change.”

Opening acts for the Nickelback concert on Aug. 9 are the Glorious Sons and Sam Roberts Band, with a kick-off party headlined by Campbell River resident Garret T. Willie on the site's Flats Stage set for Aug. 8.

Nickelback (originally from tiny Hanna, Alberta) has been maligned for its radio-friendly and ballad-heavy output in recent years, though the band remains a sales and streaming juggernaut, with over 50 million records sold during its career, more than four billion views on YouTube and more than 10 billion streams on platforms such as Spotify, in addition to nominations for six Grammy Award nominations and 40 Juno Awards, of which they've won 13.

The band enjoyed a rebirth of sorts with the 2023 documentary, Hate to Love: Nickelback, which appeared to shift the public perception of singer-guitarist Chad Kroeger, drummer Daniel Adair, bassist Mike Kroeger, and guitarist-singer Ryan Peake.

The band cut its teeth in small bars on Vancouver Island starting in 1996, shortly after their formation. A pair of Nickelback concerts at the former Memorial Arena in 2002 were among the last ever at the Victoria venue, prior to its demolition in 2003. The band has not given a local concert since joining the ranks of the top concert draws in North America.

“Nickelback was asking why they hadn't played the Island is 20 years,” Hann said. “They were expressing a curiosity and desire to get back on the Island, because a big part of their origin story was playing out here.”

Tickets and camping passes go on sale Friday, March 21, at 9 a.m. through laketownamphitheatre.com.

A New Mexico court granted a temporary restraining order Monday against the release of certain records related to the investigation into the recent deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.

The order is in response to a request by Julia Peters, a representative for the couple's estate. She urged in a motion filed last week that the court seal records in the case to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Peters emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.

A hearing has been scheduled for later this month to argue the merits of the request. For now, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the state Office of the Medical Investigator cannot release photographs and videos showing the couple's bodies or the interior of their home, autopsy reports or death investigation reports.

Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home in late February. Authorities have confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — a rare, rodent-borne disease — took the life of his wife.

The request to seal the records notes that the couple placed “a significant value on their privacy and took affirmative vigilant steps” to safeguard their privacy over their lifetime, including after they moved to Santa Fe and Hackman retired. The state capital is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.

“The personal representative seeks to continue to preserve the privacy of the Hackmans following their tragic death and support the family's constitutional right to remembrance and desire to grieve in peace,” the document states.

New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased. Experts also say that some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.

Still, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.

Privacy likely will play a role as well as the couple's estate gets settled. According to probate court documents filed earlier this month, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that same year directed her estate to him in the event of her death. With both of them dying, management of the estate is in the hands of Peters, a Santa Fe-based attorney and trust manager.

A request is pending to appoint a trustee who can administer assets in two trusts associated with the estate. Without trust documents being made public, it's unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.

Attorneys who specialize in estate planning in New Mexico say it's possible more details could come out if there were any legal disputes over the assets. Even then, they said, the parties likely would ask the court to seal the documents to maintain privacy.

Jon Batiste's wife is in remission from leukaemia.

The 'Freedom' singer's spouse, Suleika Jaouad - who was first diagnosed with the disease in 2010 before relapsing in December 2021 and again last summer - is currently ""doing great"" and the couple are feeling ""very inspired"" by the positive turn in the writer's health battle.

Jon told E! News: ""She's doing great. Now she has this beautiful remission. That's been the case for the last few months and we're just hoping that it remains that way. She's been taking everything in stride and gracefully dealing with all of the things that are going on.

""She's able to continue to paint, continue to write. All this is happening after this crazy recurrence, and it's just the best-case scenario. She's feeling healthy. The treatment is working and we're very inspired.""

But the 38-year-old singer and his spouse - who married in secret after her second diagnosis - are aware things won't always be plain sailing with her health.

He said: ""It's just a process. It goes through these different moments of treatments that are indefinite for her, it won't stop. It will continue until there's some innovation. We know that.

""Sometimes the cancer will be gone, other times, we'll have to deal with what comes when it comes back and that's just a part of our life. I support her in that.""

And Jon believes the 36-year-old author's struggles have made them stronger as a couple.

He said: ""It tests you. We all have these things that challenge us to build our character and strengthen our relationships.

""It's actually strengthened our relationship and connection because we already were close.""

In December, Suleika reflected on the ups and downs they have experienced and expressed her gratitude for the ""joys"" that have brightened the days during the ""hardest"" times.

Sharing a selection of photos from 2014, she wrote on Instagram: ""When you learn for the third time you have cancer, it's easy to feel hopeless.

""But my photos showed me that even in the hardest moments, there were so many joys. That life is not a monolith. That our forever work is to learn to hold the brutal and beautiful in the same palm.”

Calvin Harris has bought his favourite pub.

The 'Feel So Close' hitmaker - who is married to DJ Vick Hope - used to drink at the Coach + Horses inn in Dumfries, Scotland, before he found fame and now the producer, who no longer drinks alcohol, and his best friend Mark Irving have splashed out on the bar, with his pal taking over as landlord.

A source told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: “Calvin and Mark have gone into business together and created a company called To The Nines. They've now taken over the Coach Horses and Mark is in place as the landlord.

“It's a gorgeous pub with a great atmosphere. It's a great grass-roots music venue too, which is something they're both really proud of.

“Calvin used to drink there before he got famous and there is a signed poster for his first album on the wall.

“It's a hard time for pubs but the Coach + Horses Inn is thriving.”

The old landlord, John Owens, previously spoke of how Calvin - whose real name is Adam Wiles - would still go the pub when he visited his family.

He said: “Calvin, or Adam, is a pleasant chap, always has been. We're all proud of him. When he's home he'll pop in if he gets the chance.”

The 41-year-old star also owns a farm in Ibiza and a townhouse in north London.

A year ago, firefighters were called to his home in the US after a huge blaze broke out.

A major fire erupted on one of the upper levels of the DJ's three-story mansion in Beverly Hills, California and emergency services rushed to the scene with TMZ reporting fire trucks ambulances and helicopters were all spotted at the house.

The website states firefighters had to cut through the roof of the building's second floor to get to the fire, which is said to have broken out close to the mansion's cinema room and they spent almost an hour working to get the blaze under control.

The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical problem and caused around £100,000 in damage but no one was hurt.

Calvin - who is said to have been renting the house for the last few years - was not at home at the time of the incident.

Kesha felt ""pretty isolated"" when she was questioning her sexuality.

The 38-year-old singer - who has dated both men and women - has always wanted her concerts to be somewhere that people felt free to be themselves because of her own experiences witnessing a ""lack of inclusion and a lack of acceptance"" at a young age.

She told People magazine: ""I remember saying when I began, if I have to tour the world, I'm going to make sure that my shows are a place where people can come be in their sexuality, because growing up as a woman or a girl, questioning my sexuality, I didn't find community in that. I felt pretty isolated.""

The 'Rainbow' singer found herself looking to suppress parts of herself to be accepted but soon realised that wasn't the right thing to do.

She said: ""I decided that actually I might not be the best, I might not be for everybody, but I'm going to be the f****** best at being myself.

""And I think that was a beautiful lesson.""

And Kesha argued sexuality shouldn't be ""shrouded in shame"".

She said: ""Sexuality should not be something that's shrouded in shame. I am a really big proponent of just be who you are and give yourself the permission to be proud and authentic in that.""

The 'TikTok' hitmaker insisted authenticity is much more ""attractive"" than perfection.

She said: ""The most attractive vibration a human being can give off is not perfection, it's authenticity. Sometimes you look at pictures that have been photoshopped, and everything is so symmetrical and so airbrushed, and it just looks weird.

""That's because perfection is actually quite unnatural.""

Kesha recently declared she is on the hunt for a ""sugar daddy"" to take care of her.

She told 'On the Red Carpet': ""I have explored non-monogamy. I've been in love with many, many men and many, many women, and currently where I'm at is I am looking for a sugar daddy.

""I love being able to just be open and honest about it, because I'm f---ing into somebody taking care of me, putting me on a pedestal, taking me on their yacht and flying me on their plane. I'm just into it, and I will not feel shame about that.

""I've dated a lot of very cool, very broke hipsters with very bad attitudes, and so I'm trying to swing the pendulum 180 degrees and go in the entirely opposite direction.

""I want someone that goes to an office building because they own the office building.""

Gwyneth Paltrow thinks the #MeToo movement has ""changed"" Hollywood.

The 52-year-old star has recently returned to her acting roots in order to shoot 'Marty Supreme', a new sports drama movie, and Gwyneth believes that the #MeToo movement has helped to change the culture of Hollywood.

Speaking to Vanity Fair magazine, Gwyneth explained: ""There are no meetings set up in hotel rooms, from what I understand, or if there are, it's multiple people in the room. That bubble has definitely burst.

""I'm sure people still abuse power in Hollywood because they do everywhere, but it has definitely changed.""

Gwyneth filmed some sex scenes with Timothee Chalamet for their new movie. But the Oscar-winning star opted against having an intimacy coordinator, because she feared that it could stifle her performance.

The actress shared: ""We said, ‘I think we're good. You can step a little bit back'.

""I don't know how it is for kids who are starting out, but … if someone is like, ‘Okay, and then he's going to put his hand here'?I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.""

Gwyneth previously admitted that she achieved most of her acting ambitions before she turned 30.

The film star has largely focused her attention on her lifestyle brand in recent years, and Gwyneth confessed that she ""doesn't love acting that much"".

The movie star - who is the daughter of filmmaker Bruce Paltrow and actress Blythe Danner - told SiriusXM: ""I think that when you hit the bullseye when you're 26 years old, and you're a metrics-driven person - who, frankly, doesn't love acting that much, as it turns out ... I sort of felt like, well, now, who am I supposed to be? What am I driving towards?""

Ryan Reynolds has rubbished Justin Baldoni's defamation lawsuit.

The 48-year-old actor has filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni's lawsuit, insisting that the 'It Ends With Us' director's allegations have no merit.

Mike Gottlieb and Esra Hudson, Reynolds' attorneys, said in a statement: ""The entirety of Mr. Baldoni's case appears to be based on Mr. Reynolds allegedly privately calling Mr. Baldoni a ‘predator,' but here's the problem - that is not defamation unless they can show that Mr. Reynolds did not believe that statement to be true.

""The complaint doesn't allege that. In fact, it suggests the opposite: that Mr. Reynolds genuinely believes Mr. Baldoni is a predator.""

Reynolds's legal team insist that the actor is entitled to ""express his opinion of Mr. Baldoni"".

They said: ""Mr. Reynolds has a First Amendment right to express his opinion of Mr. Baldoni, which should be comforting to a group of people who have repeatedly called Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds ‘bullies' and other names over the past year.""

What's more, the director has been accused of trying to shame Reynolds ""for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be"".

A spokesperson for the actor said: ""The claims filed against Mr. Reynolds are simply a list of grievances attempting to shame him for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be - a man who is ‘confident enough to listen' to the woman in his life.""

Blake Lively, Reynolds's wife, previously launched a lawsuit against her 'It Ends With Us' director and co-star, accusing him of harassing her while making the romantic drama film.

The actress accused Baldoni of causing her ""severe emotional distress"".

The Hollywood star - who played Baldoni's on-screen love interest in 'It Ends with Us' - previously told the New York Times newspaper: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""

Baldoni later denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as ""categorically false"".

Justin Baldoni's attorney insisted they may not be open to a settlement with Blake Lively.

The actress, 36, and 41-year-old filmmaker have been embroiled in a bitter labyrinthine legal dispute for months after she accused him of harassment while they made domestic abuse movie ‘It Ends With Us'.

Appearing on Matthew Belloni's podcast 'The Town', Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman was asked ""what it would require for this to go away"", as he referred to the ""potential for the circus and the damage to both sides"".

But Freedman argued: ""You keep referring to it as a circus and I get it. You see a lot of cases.

""You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this.

""I've represented a lot of people in the worst moments of their career, the worst moments of their life. Justin has been destroyed by this.""

Freedman suggested ""the only way"" to really attempt to prove his client's innocence could be in court.

He continued: ""In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that's what we're actively working to [do].

""That may only be able to be done in a courtroom.""

Justin, 41, completed filming on 'It Ends With Us' in early 2024 and started a press tour in August, and after fans noted Blake did not participate in interviews with him or attend the film's premiere.

Blake then filed a sexual harassment complaint against Justin – alleging that he and his agents conducted a smear campaign against her.

Her lawsuit against him is set to go to trial in March 2026, following her initial filing in New York Federal Court.

Blake - who played Justin's on-screen love interest in the movie - previously told the New York Times newspaper: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""

Justin - who also directed the 2024 romantic drama film - has denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as ""categorically false"".

Bryan, who is acting as a lawyer for the actor and his Wayfarer Studios production company, told Variety: ""These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.""

Drake's record label are seeking to have his lawsuit against them dismissed, arguing he ""encouraged"" his feud with Kendrick Lamar.

The Canadian rapper sued Universal Music Group (UMG) for releasing and promoting Kendrick's diss track 'Not Like Us' but in their response to the defamation case, they argued the 38-year-old star ""lost a rap battle that he provoked"" and ""sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.""

In documents obtained by People magazine, UMG claimed that although 'Not Like Us' features hyperbolic insults, including referring to Drake and his friends as ""certified paedophiles"", the 'God's Plan' hitmaker had used their platform to ""promote tracks levelling similarly incendiary attacks"" on his rival.

The filing added: “Drake encouraged the feud.

""For example, when he felt that Lamar was taking too long to respond, Drake released a second recording in which he goaded Lamar to continue the public rap battle. Lamar did just that, and collectively Drake and Lamar released a total of nine tracks taking aim at each other.""

The motion notes Drake was ""pleased"" to see UMG promote tracks that accused Kendrick of engaging in domestic abuse and ""that one of Lamar's business partners and managers is the true father of Lamar's son.""

The filing noted: ""But now, after losing the rap battle, Drake claims that ‘Not Like Us' is defamatory. It is not.""

The response also criticised Drake's claim 'Not Like Us' constitutes ""second-degree harassment"" and promoting the song goes against general business law in New York.

The document stated: ""Less than three years ago, Drake himself signed a public petition criticising 'the trend of prosecutors using artists' creative expression against them' by treating rap lyrics as literal fact. As Drake recognised, when it comes to rap, '[t]he final work is a product of the artist's vision and imagination'.

""Drake was right then and is wrong now. The complaint's unjustified claims against UMG are no more than Drake's attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle with Lamar. The court should grant UMG's motion and dismiss the Complaint with prejudice.""

Drake's attorney, Michael J. Gottlieb, accused UMG of trying to use a ""desperate ploy"" to ""avoid accountability.

He told People magazine: “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence.

""This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG's long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.”

Taylor was the big winner at the iHeartRadio Music Awards 2025.

The 35-year-old pop megastar was honoured with nine prizes at the ceremony in Los Angeles' Dolby Theater on Monday night, with her haul including Artist of the Year.

Swift didn't attend the event, but she pre-recorded an acceptance speech for the Tour of the Century prize for ‘The Eras Tour', in which she marked the two-year anniversary of the mammoth jaunt starting in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023.

Swift admitted the global trek – which broke the record as the highest-grossing tour of all time and spanned 149 shows in 51 cities - was “the most challenging thing” she's ever done.

She began: ""I really can't tell you how much this means to me because I accept this on behalf of all my tour mates, my band, everyone who toured with us, our crew.""

Swift continued: ""People often say that sometimes the greatest challenges in life end up being something that you are so proud of or end up being the most gratifying feeling in the end if you can rise to the occasion. And this tour was absolutely the most challenging thing I've ever done in my life.""

The 'Fortnight' hitmaker insisted it wouldn't have been possible for her to ""take on those challenges"" without the support of her Swifties.

She said: ""It's a three-and-a-half-hour show, more shows than I've ever done on a tour and it really was the most gratifying thing I've ever done. I think about that tour constantly. I'm so proud of it.

""And the only reason I was able to take on those challenges, among others, the ambition of the production, the length of the show, the amount of shows in all the different countries we played in, that's all because of the fans.""

Thanking her fans, she concluded: ""You had the passion and the generosity to care about travelling to see us on tour in all these places all over the world.

""It blows my mind.

""I'm never gonna stop being grateful for it. And I appreciate it more than you know.""

In the fan-voted categories, Swift won Favourite Surprise Guest for bringing out her Kansas City Chiefs player boyfriend Travis Kelce at Wembley Stadium.

Karlie Kloss is pregnant.

The 33-year-old model - who already has Levi, four, and 19-month-old Elijah with husband Joshua Kushner - took to Instagram to show off some photos of her growing baby bump, as well as pictures of her sons.

She captioned the post: ""Three's a party (sic)""

And Karlie admitted she is ""incredibly grateful"" to be expecting again.

She told Vogue.com: “Family is everything to me. Josh and I are incredibly grateful for this blessing.”

Karlie previously admitted that motherhood has changed her entire outlook on life.

The model described motherhood as a ""profound experience"" and confessed that she had ""no idea"" what to expect before she became a mom for the first time.

The catwalk star - who has been married to Joshua since 2018 - said on the 'Today' show: ""I just had this moment of like, ‘Wow, every woman who has a child, every parent goes through this'. It's just the most profound experience that I had no idea until having a kid.""

Karlie also revealed that motherhood has made her much more ""efficient"" and time-conscious, as her children are now her number one priority in life.

The model explained that she's ""actually on time everywhere now"".

Nickelback will play their first concert on Vancouver Island in 20 years this summer — one that has the potential to set an attendance record in the region.

The veteran Vancouver group, which is among the bestselling rock acts of all-time, is appearing at the newly named Laketown Amphitheatre in Lake Cowichan on Aug. 9. Nickelback has not performed on Vancouver Island since Aug. 19-20, 2005, when the How You Remind Me and Photograph hitmakers played two shows at the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre in Victoria.

At the site near Youbou known as Laketown Ranch Music and Recreation Park, the summer concert will have a capacity of 15,000, according to organizers Wideglide Entertainment, which owns and operates the property. In the event of a sellout, Nickelback would set the record for the largest paid concert attendance in Vancouver Island concert history, breaking the 2018 record of 13,500 attendees set by Eric Church at Sunfest.

Mike Hann of Wideglide Entertainment said the band is aware of the potential for a record-setting performance and is aiming to wow audiences. “The production values Nickelback are bringing to the stage will be more than any other concert ever held at our site. It will be a level up, production-wise.”

The concert, Hann said, is part of a new vision for the venue. The Duncan-based live event company announced in January it was rebranding the 260-acre site and moving in a direction that pairs the annual Sunfest country music festival (which runs July 31-Aug. 3 this year) with larger one-off events. The timing could not have been better for the switch, Hann said. “We're not reinventing the wheel. There are permanent venues across North American doing the exact same thing. But we are playing to our strengths. This is an example of why we made that change.”

Opening acts for the Nickelback concert on Aug. 9 are the Glorious Sons and Sam Roberts Band, with a kick-off party headlined by Campbell River resident Garret T. Willie on the site's Flats Stage set for Aug. 8.

Nickelback (originally from tiny Hanna, Alberta) has been maligned for its radio-friendly and ballad-heavy output in recent years, though the band remains a sales and streaming juggernaut, with over 50 million records sold during its career, more than four billion views on YouTube and more than 10 billion streams on platforms such as Spotify, in addition to nominations for six Grammy Award nominations and 40 Juno Awards, of which they've won 13.

The band enjoyed a rebirth of sorts with the 2023 documentary, Hate to Love: Nickelback, which appeared to shift the public perception of singer-guitarist Chad Kroeger, drummer Daniel Adair, bassist Mike Kroeger, and guitarist-singer Ryan Peake.

The band cut its teeth in small bars on Vancouver Island starting in 1996, shortly after their formation. A pair of Nickelback concerts at the former Memorial Arena in 2002 were among the last ever at the Victoria venue, prior to its demolition in 2003. The band has not given a local concert since joining the ranks of the top concert draws in North America.

“Nickelback was asking why they hadn't played the Island is 20 years,” Hann said. “They were expressing a curiosity and desire to get back on the Island, because a big part of their origin story was playing out here.”

Tickets and camping passes go on sale Friday, March 21, at 9 a.m. through laketownamphitheatre.com.

A New Mexico court granted a temporary restraining order Monday against the release of certain records related to the investigation into the recent deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.

The order is in response to a request by Julia Peters, a representative for the couple's estate. She urged in a motion filed last week that the court seal records in the case to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Peters emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.

A hearing has been scheduled for later this month to argue the merits of the request. For now, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the state Office of the Medical Investigator cannot release photographs and videos showing the couple's bodies or the interior of their home, autopsy reports or death investigation reports.

Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home in late February. Authorities have confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — a rare, rodent-borne disease — took the life of his wife.

The request to seal the records notes that the couple placed “a significant value on their privacy and took affirmative vigilant steps” to safeguard their privacy over their lifetime, including after they moved to Santa Fe and Hackman retired. The state capital is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.

“The personal representative seeks to continue to preserve the privacy of the Hackmans following their tragic death and support the family's constitutional right to remembrance and desire to grieve in peace,” the document states.

New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased. Experts also say that some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.

Still, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.

Privacy likely will play a role as well as the couple's estate gets settled. According to probate court documents filed earlier this month, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that same year directed her estate to him in the event of her death. With both of them dying, management of the estate is in the hands of Peters, a Santa Fe-based attorney and trust manager.

A request is pending to appoint a trustee who can administer assets in two trusts associated with the estate. Without trust documents being made public, it's unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.

Attorneys who specialize in estate planning in New Mexico say it's possible more details could come out if there were any legal disputes over the assets. Even then, they said, the parties likely would ask the court to seal the documents to maintain privacy.

Ace filmmaker Shekhar Kapur's film Bandit Queen's name is included in the list of the most controversial movies in the history of Hindi cinema. The story of dacoit Phoolan Devi was shown in this movie. After running for some time in theatres, the censor board and the government banned this movie. However, the makers knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court of India and fought for his rights. After such a run and glorious years of recognition, the director of this film, Shekhar Kapur took to his X profile to express disappointment over its digital version.

For the unversed, Bandit Queen is available to watch on the OTT platform in today's time. Recently, Shekhar has watched his film online and has expressed his displeasure over it. The reason for this is the editing of the film and cutting of some scenes without his consent in the OTT version. 'I wonder if OTT platforms would let me make #BanditQueen the way I made it years ago. The Bandit Queen on #AmazonPrime is unrecognisable from my film. Someone has cut it beyond recognition. And yet it carries my name as Director. And no one asked me! Are we lesser beings than Western Directors? Would they have the guts to cut a Chris Nolan film without his permission?'



In this way, Shekhar Kapur lashed out at the OTT platform Amazon Prime Video for tampering with his film.

Hansal Mehta reacts

Another award-winning director, Hansal Mehta also reacted to Kapur's tweet and wrote, 'It is sad to know that a film that should always be India's pride gets treated this way. But then what's new? We've become so used to being treated as slaves of the West. No protest. No pushback. Total submission. Because they are doing us a favour. Our integrity as artists is neither protected by us nor by a guild that could potentially protect us. The so-called ‘association' is busy behaving like a political party or stoking divisive propaganda. In the meanwhile directors are rendered powerless and bereft of any support system. Maybe your status as one of the country's foremost artistic spokespersons to the world and as a government-decorated Padmabhushan will help bring about change. Until then back to our submissive selves? Members of the new content-driven colony that creates cattle feed to drive subscriptions while fulfilling the artistic ambitions of its Western masters.'

Bandit Queen was a box-office success

Of course, Bandit Queen was banned across the country. But Shekhar Kapur was praised for the courage he showed in making this movie. This movie was on the big screen for only a few weeks, and in that time it rocked the box office in terms of earnings and achieved success. The film Bandit Queen was released in theatres in 1994. Actress Seema Biswas played the role of Phoolan Devi in ​​this movie. Veteran actor Manoj Bajpayee made his debut in Hindi cinema with this film.

Calvin Harris has bought his favourite pub.

The 'Feel So Close' hitmaker - who is married to DJ Vick Hope - used to drink at the Coach + Horses inn in Dumfries, Scotland, before he found fame and now the producer, who no longer drinks alcohol, and his best friend Mark Irving have splashed out on the bar, with his pal taking over as landlord.

A source told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: “Calvin and Mark have gone into business together and created a company called To The Nines. They've now taken over the Coach Horses and Mark is in place as the landlord.

“It's a gorgeous pub with a great atmosphere. It's a great grass-roots music venue too, which is something they're both really proud of.

“Calvin used to drink there before he got famous and there is a signed poster for his first album on the wall.

“It's a hard time for pubs but the Coach + Horses Inn is thriving.”

The old landlord, John Owens, previously spoke of how Calvin - whose real name is Adam Wiles - would still go the pub when he visited his family.

He said: “Calvin, or Adam, is a pleasant chap, always has been. We're all proud of him. When he's home he'll pop in if he gets the chance.”

The 41-year-old star also owns a farm in Ibiza and a townhouse in north London.

A year ago, firefighters were called to his home in the US after a huge blaze broke out.

A major fire erupted on one of the upper levels of the DJ's three-story mansion in Beverly Hills, California and emergency services rushed to the scene with TMZ reporting fire trucks ambulances and helicopters were all spotted at the house.

The website states firefighters had to cut through the roof of the building's second floor to get to the fire, which is said to have broken out close to the mansion's cinema room and they spent almost an hour working to get the blaze under control.

The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical problem and caused around £100,000 in damage but no one was hurt.

Calvin - who is said to have been renting the house for the last few years - was not at home at the time of the incident.

Ben & Jerry's has said its chief executive, David Stever, was being removed by its parent company, Unilever, in a growing dispute over the ice cream company's political activism.

The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that says Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its ""social mission"".

Unilever did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. 

It comes a month after the ice cream company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump.

""Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission,"" the filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said. 

Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social issues since it was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.

It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

The ice cream maker was bought by Unilever in 2000 through a merger agreement that created an independent board tasked with protecting the ice cream brand's values and mission. 

But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank.

The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza.

In November, the ice cream company filed a lawsuit saying Unilever had tried to stop it from expressing support for Palestinian refugees.

Last month, in another court filing, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever had tried to ban it from publicly criticising Donald Trump.

Mr Stever has been with Ben & Jerry's since joining the firm in 1988 as a tour guide. He was appointed chief executive in 2023. 

Ben and Jerry's court filing said the decision to oust Mr Stever was made without any consultation, as required in the merger agreement between the two companies.

""Unilever...attempted to force the independent board into rubberstamping the decision,"" it added.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was leaving interest rates unchanged — but warned of rising uncertainty about the direction of the economy, in part due to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.  

The Fed said its key federal funds rate, which serves as a benchmark for interest rates throughout the economy, would remain at approximately 4.5%.

Though it said current economic conditions were solid, the central bank lowered its forecast for gross domestic product, a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within the U.S., for the rest of the year to 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. It also warned that a key measure of inflation would now be closer to 3% than 2%.

Eighteen of 19 policymakers now say there's increased risk that GDP will fall, compared with just five in December. Meanwhile, 11 policymakers say the unemployment rate could climb to as much as 4.5% this year, up from five previously.

""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" the Fed's statement said.

In a press conference following the release of the statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the dynamic between Trump's tariffs and stronger near-term price growth wasn't totally clear given other trends in the economy. But the tariffs are certainly a factor in rising expectations that price hikes will accelerate, he said — though for now, firmer inflation would likely be ""transitory.""

“Inflation has started to move up now, we think, partly in response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress in the course of this year,” Powell said.

Stocks surged on the news — but bond purchases also increased, the latter reflecting concerns about future growth prospects. Investors seek out bonds when they believe they can get a better return on them than other assets. 

“The Fed is as lost in the wilderness as the rest of us trying to decipher the continual shifts in economic policy from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” Omair Sharif, managing director of Inflation Insights consultancy, said in a note to clients following Wednesday's rate decision.

A host of indicators, not to mention comments from Trump administration officials themselves, suggest that consumer spending and employers' hiring are both slowing. After an initial burst of optimism upon Trump's election, growth now looks to be more subdued. Meanwhile, federal workforce cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have also raised concerns about pressure on local economies, not to mention the ability of newly jobless workers to receive unemployment assistance.

Sweeping White House policy changes have already unnerved investors. Last week, the S&P 500 slipped into correction territory, marking a 10% drop from its latest peak, for the first time in three years.

As surveys suggest consumer and business confidence are declining, Trump and senior officials have changed their messaging since the campaign, warning consumers to brace for potential economic pain and declining to rule out the possibility of a recession. Trump has signaled the economy may be in for a period of “transition” as his policies take effect, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the U.S. must “detox” from its reliance on public spending.

The upheaval has created new difficulties for the Fed to navigate as it sets borrowing rates. The central bank is charged by Congress with helping keep unemployment and inflation low. Right now, both are fairly subdued. Yet multiple analysts noted Wednesday that the Fed's latest outlook signals the prospect of stagflation — higher inflation despite lower overall growth — albeit far short of the 1970s' shock caused by that decade's oil crisis.

""Revisions to [policymakers'] projections had a somewhat 'stagflationary' feel with forecasts for growth and inflation moving in opposite directions,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Whitney Watson said in a note Wednesday afternoon. ""For the time being the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious.”

That has drawn multiple interpretations among analysts looking for signs of the Fed's thinking.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the revised projections indicate the central bank may soon start paying closer attention to the labor market, wary of letting unemployment rise too high. Fed policymakers are still indicating that they expect ""rate cuts will be necessary in the near future — they just need a full set of information to give them the green light,"" she said.

Inflation Insights' Sharif, by contrast, said the fact that the Fed still foresees no more than two rate cuts this year suggests a more ""hawkish"" stance, with policymakers focusing more on controlling price growth than on keeping unemployment in check.

He said the situation was reminiscent of 2022, when the Fed decided to not signal rate cuts were forthcoming because inflation remained elevated.

""The Fed saw downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment, but they continued to power ahead with rate hikes,"" Sharif said of policymakers' approach at the time. ""They're saying now that they will err on the side of making sure inflation does not get out of hand again.""

Oops, something went wrong

Ben & Jerry's says its CEO was unlawfully removed by its parent company, Unilever (UL), in retaliation for the ice cream maker's social and political activism.

In a federal court filing late Tuesday, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever informed its board on March 3 that it was removing and replacing Ben & Jerry's CEO David Stever. Ben & Jerry's said that violated its merger agreement with Unilever, which states that any decisions regarding a CEO's removal must come after a consultation with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry's board.

The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with London-based Unilever on Wednesday.

Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry's in 2000 for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry's said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.

But lately, the marriage hasn't been a happy one. In 2021, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop serving Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli business to a local company that said it would sell Ben & Jerry's under its Hebrew and Arabic name throughout Israel and the West Bank.

Last May, Unilever said it was planning to spin off its ice cream business — including Ben & Jerry's — by the end of 2025 as part of a larger restructuring. Unilever also owns personal hygiene brands like Dove soap and food brands like Hellmann's mayonnaise.

But the acrimony continued. In November, Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever in federal court in New York, accusing it of silencing Ben & Jerry's statements in support of Palestinians in the Gaza war.

In its complaint, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever also refused to let the company release a social media post that identified issues it believed would be challenged during President Donald Trump's second term, including minimum wages, universal health care, abortion and climate change.

Tuesday's filing was an amendment to that lawsuit.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}"

Ramsey Solutions financial expert George Kamel weighs in on Americans working past retirement age and provides advice for investors.

It isn't always easy to save for retirement, in part because for many people it is so far away that there's no sense of urgency.

New research suggests a solution: Make the future feel closer.

""People struggle to save for the future, and part of the reason why is people struggle to connect with the future,"" says Katherine Christensen, an assistant marketing professor at Indiana University and the study's lead author. ""We wondered, based on past research, if people felt more connected to their future selves, would they be more likely to save?""

After conducting and analyzing a series of 20 experiments to test this hypothesis, Christensen says the answer is yes.

The research found that when we think about the future, more than 80% of the time, we actually start off by thinking about the present. 

""What we did is essentially flip that,"" Christensen says. Start the thought process by imagining that future before you turn your thoughts back to the present and the savings goals you need to meet to make it happen.

THIS MIDWESTERN STATE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO RETIRE, NEW STUDY SAYS: SEE THE LIST

While the difference is subtle, it has been shown to motivate people to save more. In one experiment carried out by the research team with more than 6,700 customers of a Swedish fintech company, people with low-balance savings accounts were 14% more likely to invest in a long-term savings product when they received a notification with language prompting them to think about the future first.

Hal Hershfield, professor of marketing, behavioral decision-making and psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the study's authors, says the prompts were designed with deliberately simple verbiage. ""[We] had language along the lines of: ‘The year is 2034…rewind back to 2024 and consider saving for 2034 you,' "" he says. 

While the research was tailored to give institutions like banks insights into how to make customers save more, Hershfield says individual savers can apply their findings using similar wording. 

""The key here is to start in the future and rewind back,"" Hershfield says, ""rather than the traditional approach of only starting now and zooming ahead to the future.""  

SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS TO INCREASE FOR PUBLIC PENSION RECIPIENTS

The authors of the new study based their hypothesis on earlier findings that people perceive trips to unfamiliar locations as lengthier than return trips of identical duration. In other words, we perceive traveling home as quicker than journeying to an unknown destination.

This cognitive quirk takes place because uncertainty creates mental distance, Christensen says. That is, people perceive the unfamiliar as being further away than the familiar. This ""going home effect,"" as scientists call it, holds true for how we think about years as well as miles—which is where the connection to saving for future events or life stages comes in. 

POLITICS SHOULD BE DIVORCED FROM INVESTING

You're more likely to save for a future that feels imminent, Christensen says. ""Since the present is more certain than the future, we're reducing the feeling of uncertainty"" by anchoring subjects with a mental destination of familiar present-day reality, she says. ""In our nudge, you basically move towards certainty.""

Carina Castagna founded her startup business, Pesto Joe, while participating in the
                                          Pirates LaunchPad Summer Accelerator.

Do you have a business startup idea that you are serious about pursuing and turning
                                    into a real business? Have you already launched a startup and are seeking assistance
                                    to propel your venture to the next level? Have you competed in startup contests, and
                                    seek further guidance? Are you focused on a social or community problem and are working
                                    on an innovative startup business solution?

If you answered ""Yes"" to any of those questions, Pirates LaunchPad may be right for

                                    students to apply to participate in the fifth annual Pirates LaunchPad Summer Accelerator
                                    Program and earn up to $2,000 in investment seed funding for their venture.

What Pirates LaunchPad Accelerator graduates say about the program: 

""The Pirate Accelerator gave me the tools and the support to launch Pesto Joe LLC,
                                       which was barely an idea when I initially signed up. Following the program, I was
                                       able to complete a proof of concept at local farmers markets and quickly gained a
                                       following. That was when I knew I had a viable business. I took the following months
                                       to learn about the food industry, build my network and attain my food handler's certificate.
                                       It is crazy to look back and remember where I was two years ago. I simply had an idea,
                                          and I am already leaps and bounds ahead of where I was when I started the accelerator.
                                          I am currently preparing for a busy farmers market season and recently began to sell
                                          my products online. Nothing can stop a Pirate when they are on a mission, and I am
                                          grateful for the accelerator for pointing me in the right direction!"" - Carina Castagna,
                                           ‘21/M.P.A. ‘22, founder & CEO, Pesto Joe.

 

Brooke and Madison Loza, founders of One Stop Eco-Shop, expanded their business during
                                             the Pirates LaunchPad Accelerator.

""Pirates Launchpad provides a great network and formula to turn your ideas into reality.
                                       The program  helped to guide us as we embarked on a major business expansion last
                                       summer and opened an One-Stop Eco-Shop retail store in Toms River. The store supplements
                                       our online consumer products businesses."" – Brooke and Madison Loza, founders of One-Stop
                                       Eco-Shop and seniors studying nursing and winners of the Pirates Pitch Startup Competition
                                       and NJIT New Venture Competition.  

 

""My goal when I entered Pirates LaunchPad was to expand my existing online business,
                                       including revamping my website. I was able to accomplish these goals and more."" -

The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker found 48 cases of journalists being detained or arrested in 2024 alone. The Tracker also chronicles incidents of assaults on journalists. The recent list includes accounts of a TV reporter in Colorado being tackled and choked outside the station, a California reporter being aggressively grabbed by a sheriff's deputy while covering a county board meeting, a sports columnist being shoved by a professional basketball player over an unfavorable article, and the list goes on. In Nevada, investigative reporter Jeff German was horrifically murdered by an elected public official who sought revenge for German's reporting.

Leonard Woolsey knows how these physical and online threats can take a toll on a news organization. Woolsey is the president of Southern Newspapers, the president and publisher of The Daily News in Galveston, Texas, and the president of America's Newspapers for 2024-2025. “Recently, we had a public official send us a photo of our newspaper with a handgun sitting across our front page,” he told E&P. “We get threats against our reporters, editors and newspapers in volumes never experienced before — and always the result of us reporting truthful facts. And, in each case, our team comes together, takes care of each other, and forges on in the name of our service to the community.

“This happens when your newspaper is engaged with the community and is committed to telling hard truths versus happy news all the time,” he continued. “Our duty is to inform our community, even if those in power find it uncomfortable. At the end of the day, we hold our heads high, knowing our calling as truth-tellers is critical for our communities and nation. Journalists who uphold the tradition of service to their community and use the truth as their beacon are rock stars in my eyes.”

Though Southern Newspapers hasn't had any reporters arrested or detained by police, Woolsey is ready should that happen. “We work closely with an attorney who has ink in his blood. His dad was a former newspaper publisher, and this makes all the difference,” he said.

At Trib Total Media, based in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, the staff has ongoing discussions about how to defend its journalists who may be unlawfully arrested or detained — and about the personal safety of the newsroom team. Jennifer Bertetto, president and CEO, said they have a meeting coming up where they'll talk about the complexities of crime scenes and “high-pressure situations.” She wants to ensure that the team understands their rights, best practices when interacting with law enforcement and appropriate responses to threats of arrest.

Safety is paramount for their reporters, Bertetto stressed.

“A significant concern among our staff is the potential for being identified as members of the media in public, both on and off duty,” she added. “Many have opted to avoid wearing company attire to minimize the risk. To enhance safety measures, we're implementing a buddy system to cover potentially volatile events, like protests or demonstrations. This ensures reporters and photographers work in pairs, minimizing the risk of isolating someone.”

——————-

Fortunately, in the communities we report in, we have very few problems, even in our search for the truth. But, sometimes, we are on the receiving end of threats (both physical and online) as we recently experienced in one of our communities.

We have taken steps in the last few years to strengthen our security in the office. If you have been by any of our offices, you know you have to ring the doorbell to gain entrance because our doors remain locked during business hours. We still welcome our guests, but we have more control over who enters.

Our reporters are not afraid of being identified outside of work – we proudly wear our nametags and branded items out and about. We are just more aware of our surroundings.

And we wholeheartedly agree with Leonard Woolsey when he says, “God help us if the truth is suppressed by our fear…” We will continue to report the truth without fear of retribution or attack. It is our currency, it is our duty and it is the cornerstone of our reporting. We won't stand down.

Wix's launch of Wix Functions represents a strategic enhancement to their SaaS website building platform, enabling customers to implement sophisticated business logic without writing code. This significant product addition addresses a critical gap in Wix's offering by allowing businesses to create customized workflows and real-time business rules through a visual interface.

The feature introduces considerable value by enabling dynamic pricing rules, conditional checkout processes, and tailored loyalty rewards across six major Wix applications (Stores, Bookings, Restaurants, Donations, Forms, and Loyalty Program). From a competitive standpoint, this capability reduces a key friction point that often forces growing businesses to migrate to more technically advanced platforms as their operational needs become more complex.

Financially, Wix has implemented a freemium monetization strategy for this feature - offering basic functionality at no cost while reserving unlimited actions and premium capabilities for paid upgrades. This approach creates new upsell opportunities within Wix's existing customer base while potentially improving customer retention by eliminating technical limitations.

This product launch strengthens Wix's position against competitors by elevating its platform beyond basic website building into more sophisticated business operations territory. By empowering non-technical users to implement complex business logic that previously required developer resources, Wix is expanding its addressable market and reducing a key pain point that drives customer churn to more technically advanced platforms.

Wix Functions empowers users to create customized business flows, automate pricing and checkout rules, and tailor app behavior

NEW YORK – Wix.com Ltd. (NASDAQ: WIX), the leading SaaS website builder platform globally1, today launched Wix Functions, a no-code interface that allows users to customize outcomes for various business scenarios, enabling businesses to operate more smoothly and effectively. With an intuitive visual function builder, businesses can define custom business logic, such as adding dynamic pricing rules, enforce checkout conditions, and tailor loyalty rewards, ensuring their operations adapt to their specific business needs.

With Wix Functions, users can define custom outcomes using conditions, variables, formulas, and dynamic values. Users can start from scratch or customize a template designed for a specific Wix app. By selecting input data from an app, such as cart and checkout details in Wix Stores, users can then apply the  logic to create conditions. The builder visually represents the logic, helping users understand how different criteria affect the function's output. For example, users can apply location-based fees, trigger a discount for returning customers in the checkout based on purchase history and implement custom form validations. The function then outputs the desired action, which the Wix app executes in real-time. This enhanced customizability of business flows is particularly beneficial as it allows users to implement more custom steps when rendering checkout or validating forms.

Wix Functions ensures that checkout, rewards, and other workflows wait for the function's output before proceeding. Users can choose from pre-built function templates or create custom rules from scratch. Functions are triggered by app activity, process the required logic, and return a result that immediately impacts the business flow—whether it's adjusting a fee, displaying a discount, or restricting a purchase.

“Wix Functions lets businesses extend and customize Wix apps to fit their unique needs—without writing a single line of code,” said Tomas Petras Rupšys, Head of Wix Functions at Wix. “Building on top of our new Automation builder, Wix Functions gives businesses even more control over their operations, enabling them to customize more workflows, further automate processes and implement advanced business rules. The function's output directly influences how the Wix app behaves in real-time, ensuring that businesses can seamlessly adapt their operations to meet unique needs, further empowering business owners to operate more efficiently and scale with ease.”

Wix Functions complements Wix Automations by enabling real-time customization, while automations manage ongoing tasks. Together, they provide a comprehensive suite of tools to help businesses automate and optimize their operations effortlessly.

Wix Functions is now available on Wix and Wix Studio for Wix Stores, Wix Bookings, Wix Restaurants, Wix Donations, Wix Forms, and Wix Loyalty Program, with free access and optional premium upgrades to access business solutions such as checkout and payments. Users can unlock unlimited actions through premium upgrades.

After previously collaborating with the House of Mouse, the Hundreds co-founder will now oversee merchandise and licensed products for the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations.

E-Commerce Writer


Bobby Kim, better known as Bobby Hundreds in the fashion world, is heading to the House of Mouse.


	The Hundreds co-founder has been named vp of creative for the Americas at Disney Consumer Products. The author revealed the news Tuesday on Instagram following the announcement that his apparel label closed its longtime flagship on streetwear corridor Fairfax Avenue. Kim is also stepping down as creative director of the 22-year-old company, which will continue to sell online and at other retailers. 




	Kim, who previously led The Hundreds' Disney collaborations through the years, will report to Marcus Rosie, Disney svp of global creative, and will oversee development of toys, apparel, books and more merchandise and licensed products sold at the Disney Store e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations, Disney theme parks and other retailers.

A post shared by Bobby Hundreds (@bobbyhundreds)


	“With more than 20 years of experience, Bobby's creativity and cultural influence transcends fashion,” Rosie said in a statement. “His commitment to innovation and authenticity makes him the ideal candidate to lead our Americas creative teams, as we continue to surprise and delight consumers through our licensed, theme parks and Disney Store businesses.” 


	Kim co-founded The Hundreds in 2003 with then-fellow Loyola Law School student Ben Shenassafar, and was known for his prolific blog posts under the brand, eventually landing a book deal. In 2019 he released a memoir, This Is Not a T-Shirt (MCD), about building the company — known for its “Adam Bomb” mascot — into a multi-million-dollar global brand. Kim also co-founded the fashion-meet-streetwear festival, Family Style, which was acquired in 2024 by Complex.


	At The Hundreds, Kim's handful of Disney collaborations included a 2008 collection that reimagined the Lost Boys of Peter Pan for a new audience. 


	He previously told The Hollywood Reporter, “I remember when I got my publishing deal, one of the things that I was pitching to the publishers is that I don't think they necessarily look at young teenage men, twenty-something guys, as an ideal audience. We had a lot of licensing and collaborative partners throughout the brand's history that felt the same way. I remember at that time [Disney] really only targeted children and female audiences. They said, ‘We have no inroads with men.' And I said, ‘If you work with us, I'll show you.' It opened up an entire new lane; more young guys were getting into Disney. It was the same thing with the book. I wanted to open up this world of young men really getting into literature, into books, into fiction or nonfiction.”

SAXONBURG, Pennsylvania — Small businesses have been the backbone of the United States since its founding. The Hotel Saxonburg, which has also been known as the Vogeley House, the Belvedere House, the Laube House and the Central Hotel, opened in 1835 and has lasted most of our nation's existence.

Yesterday, the new owners abruptly closed the hotel after purchasing it two years ago. This not only shuttered the historic restaurant and hotel that served as a cultural touchstone for nearly 200 years, but it also caused people to lose their jobs.

Because the business was small, those job losses, likely around 50 people total, were a statistic that didn't gain attention from the national press. However, when you consider that more people in the U.S. work for small businesses than any other sector, those numbers start to add up.

According to the Small Business Administration, which draws its data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 60% of U.S. businesses are small businesses. They range from employing a handful of people (think your favorite food truck) to 100 people (think a local machine shop).

Before 2020, most Americans worked for small businesses that employed under 500 people. The last four years have upended that number. Now, only 53% of Americans work for businesses with 500 or more workers.

In short, the U.S. is no longer a nation of small businesses. In February, the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau showed that shift. It also showed that the biggest change of all has been the increase in the number of people working for companies with 10,000 or more workers and the decrease in the number of people working at firms with under 100 workers.

Case in point: Last year, there was a story about a local independent grocery, Ferri's, that closed after 70 years in a snowball effect that began with the unexpected shuttering of the small independent pharmacy located inside the grocery.

The beloved family grocery posted a note on the building's large glass front windows and on Facebook, saying they were closing “with a heavy heart” after serving as “a cornerstone of our community and … fostering connections that have spanned generations.”

Ferri's general manager, Gary Silvestri, said the loss of rent and traffic from the pharmacy had a significant impact, as it was 20% of the grocer's business.

Another factor was the economic pressure of Target being located a couple of miles to the east, Walmart a few miles to the west, and Giant Eagle, a massive local grocery store chain, within a half mile of Ferri's. All three of those companies employ well over 10,000 people and have the buying-power advantage to lower prices over a mom-and-pop grocery.

Jeff Hastings of Wholesale Central, the leading publisher of content for the wholesale merchandise industry, wrote that ever since the dawn of the big-box store in 1962, the year Walmart, Kmart and Target all opened their doors, small local businesses, from hardware stores to clothing and shoe stores to pharmacies and groceries, have struggled to compete.

He cited the 2006 Walmart move into the west side of Chicago as an example. Eighty-two local stores went out of business and cost an estimated 300 retail jobs in neighboring ZIP codes.

It isn't just groceries, restaurants or hotels that are falling to larger entities with 10 to 100 employees. Small local gas stations, clothing stores and even small insurance companies that either close or merge with larger companies are also losing ground as big companies expand.

Locals in Saxonburg were sad that the hotel closed and that people lost their jobs, but they also felt confident that someone would come along and revive the historic hotel and restaurant as a gathering place for the community and visitors.

The good news for small businesses, and why many economic experts expect a turnaround, is the surge in construction, manufacturing, retail and service industries in January of this year. Optimism levels exceed the 51-year average, according to the latest Small Business Economic Trends survey from the National Federation of Independent Business Research Center.

That quarterly report revealed that the overall small business population is signaling renewed confidence despite persistent economic challenges. That just might turn around this current trend.

Golf Ireland is to launch a new campaign aimed at helping golfers and clubs fully understand the World Handicap System.

Ahead of this initiative, golfers across Ireland may already start noticing one change, as new options relating to Playing Handicap allowances become available to clubs, introducing greater flexibility to club competitions.

The measure, which gives clubs options to increase or decrease the Playing Handicap allowance in their competitions, is being rolled out following feedback from club officials and golfers, including through a tracking survey conducted by Golf Ireland in 2024.

While the options will be available from April 1, clubs will have ultimate discretion in whether they adopt a change – and may decide to retain the current Playing Handicap allowance for their club competitions. Likewise, a club may decide not to introduce a change immediately, but on another date following 1 April.

In singles counting competitions, the current 95% allowance for Playing Handicaps can be increased to 100%, or decreased to as low as 85%, at the club's discretion. In this regard, the measure responds to feedback Golf Ireland has received through its annual tracking survey which strongly suggests that golf clubs want additional options to address local issues they might have with the application of the WHS, and that in a number of cases clubs have found that lower handicappers are struggling to compete in club competitions – and in some cases playing less competitive golf at club level as a result. 

The change is being rolled out in Ireland with the agreement of the other Home Nations – England, Scotland and Wales – with a decision to follow ahead of the 2026 season on whether to roll it out across GB&I fully in 2026, potentially with additional options depending on feedback received.     

The option to amend the Playing Handicap allowance can also be applied to four-ball competitions.

Mark Wehrly, Championships & Rules Director of Golf Ireland, said: “The options which clubs will have from 1 April are being rolled out in response to two things we've heard fairly consistently – that clubs want more choice in how they apply the WHS within their club and that in a number of cases there is a concern that lower handicappers are struggling to be competitive in club competitions.

“We've looked at these concerns with an open mind and considered them in light of the data and guidance available to us, in close and detailed consultation with our colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales as well as with The R&A.”

This measure also comes during a period in which Golf Ireland has introduced a significant change to the handicap eligibility rules for inter-club competitions, which resulted in the adjustment of the Handicap Index of 159 players for eligibility purposes ahead of the 2025 season.

Wehrly continued: “We've done a considerable amount of work in sifting through the data, both in terms of club competitions but also in our own competitions, where we have acknowledged that a substantial number of rounds are played in non-counting formats and may therefore be contributing to concerns that some might raise about the fairness of handicapping in our inter-club competitions.

“We'll continue this data-driven approach, as well as kicking on with our annual handicap awareness campaign in the coming weeks, which will address a wide range of issues including player responsibilities and – in particular – addressing actions which give rise to handicap manipulation, another issue on which we've received plenty of engagement from clubs and golfers. We're also very grateful to be working with our colleagues in the other Home Nations, and with The R&A, on a joint communications campaign which will be rolled out over the coming months and which will reinforce these messages.”

The UK Golf Federation has announced that GolfBIC is returning in 2025 with two exciting events, the first of which, sponsored by inrange, takes place at the RAC Club, Pall Mall on Wednesday, 30th April

The PGA of GB&I has announced the first PGA Excel awardees of 2025, with four PGA Members achieving Advanced Fellow status and 12 others earning designations within the membership categories of Professional, Coach and Manager.

The Loop, the newly formed PR and Marcomms agency, has unveiled its initial client list of 18 social media influencers and creators which cover a wide range of content niches in the game.

Oops, something went wrong

By Kylie Madry

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S.-based fintech Tala, which grants small-sized loans to clients in emerging markets, has secured a $150 million debt facility to expand its business in Mexico, it said on Wednesday.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Many of Tala's clients in Mexico are small-business owners, chief executive and founder Shivani Siroya said, and the lender plans to allocate a portion of the fresh funds to better serve them.

According to Mexico's statistics agency, some 99% of firms in the nation are defined as micro, small or medium-sized businesses.

KEY QUOTES

""This capital is for the growth of our Mexico business,"" Siroya told Reuters ahead of the announcement. ""As we think about how to widen access, it's ... starting to talk about different platforms, embedded partnerships.""

""The second piece is, how do we provide more value?"" she said. ""So whether that's higher (credit) limits, more dynamic pricing, starting to think about specific credit products.""

CONTEXT

The debt facility, which starts at $75 million and allows Tala to draw up to $150 million, was issued with funds managed by U.S. investment firm Neuberger Berman, Tala said in a statement.

BY THE NUMBERS

Tala - which has more than 10 million clients globally - has more than 3 million clients in Mexico, Siroya said, and signed off on more than $500 million in loans in the country in 2024.

Tala's average loan size in Mexico comes in around 2,300 pesos ($115.41), she added.

WHAT'S NEXT

Siroya said there was ""more to come this year"" for Tala's operations elsewhere in Latin America. At the moment, Mexico is the firm's only Latin American market, though it also operates in Southeast Asia and East Africa.

($1 = 19.9298 Mexican pesos)

				Marketing & PR 

The Loop, the newly formed PR and Marcomms agency, has unveiled its initial client list of 18 social media influencers and creators which cover a wide range of content niches in the game.

While a number of household names will be known via their social media profiles, an eclectic mix of presenters, writers, photographers and videographers will give partners the opportunity to engage with different audiences and a wider demographic of golfers.

Among the latest signings by the new start-up company is PGA Professional James Robinson, whose profile The Loop will help elevate and develop new commercial partnerships in a wide variety of areas, from equipment and apparel to travel and consumer brands.

Robinson, a PGA Professional based in Sheffield, has amassed a dedicated audience that reaches over 270,000 subscribers on YouTube, delivering over 2.5 million views per month from his channel.

Authoritative, but always fun and engaging, Robinson is one of the most trusted voices when it comes to long-form video, providing regular content that encourages people to play better. Instruction advice is delivered in an easy-to-follow manner, while there are few creators who bring as much product knowledge to the table, with his trusted equipment reviews undoubtedly a unique-selling point. Travel will also play a huge role in his content for 2025, with a focus on course Vlogs.

Robinson said: “After speaking with the team at The Loop, it became clear that they have the connections and the passion, as well as a creative eye, to help drive greater awareness of my social channels and in turn open up more commercial opportunities. It has been a great start to our relationship, and I am looking forward to what lies ahead in 2025.”

Signing alongside Robinson is Golf Mates – a YouTube channel with over 230,000 subscribers that is fronted by Liam Harrison, which brings a light-hearted community of golfers together to highlight new products and destination reviews.

Also joining The Loop's roster of creators is Eloise Feely, an elite amateur charting her journey on Instagram and TikTok as she attempts to move into the professional ranks, and popular golf couple Beth Roberts and Russ Chrystie – CoupleaGolfers – who work across multiple social platforms in a bid to enhance the golfing experience for younger players at all levels, with a focus on promoting and showcasing a pathway for couples to enjoy the game via travel content.

Mike Harris, joint partner at The Loop who will assume day-to-day management overseeing the company's portfolio of creators, said: “Signing James is a big statement for our new company as he is undoubtedly one of the most recognised faces in the golf influencer space. He has built a fantastic reputation and is highly respected in his field, and with his expert knowledge in equipment reviews, his profile is as high as ever.

“At The Loop we believe dynamic social media creators have the ability to help bring products and destinations to life with engaging and relatable content that reaches clearly defined audiences and in turn offers exciting partnership opportunities.”

The Loop's content creator signings include:

Black British Golfers and Ray NyabolaAs the founder of Black British Golfers (BBG), Ray Nyabola is reshaping the sport's culture by fostering a community where growth and opportunity thrive.

Josh AntmannA popular member of the fantastic Sky Sport's Golf team and an established face in golf media, Josh is now looking to grow his profile outside of the game and his laconic and likeable nature – not to mention his close relationship with the team at The Loop – will see him perfectly placed to do so.

His mastery of club-fitting combined with his passion and personality has allowed him to share his expertise through his YouTube and social channels.

Kevin MurrayKevin has built a reputation for being one of the most respected golf course photographers in the business. He has shot over 500 courses worldwide, worked with the industry's top brands and players, and has built a reputation for producing great creative stills and video content.

Rich WolfendenRich is a presenter and content creator who lives in London.

Independent movies make up the bulk of projects selected to receive tax credits, reflecting major productions increasingly opting to shoot in other regions with more generous incentive programs. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	A record 51 films will receive tax credits to shoot in California amid a historic downturn in production in the state fueled by an increasingly tit-for-tat incentives race to host Hollywood.


	The total marks the highest number of titles selected in a single round of the state's film and TV tax incentive program, according to the California Film Commission. The productions are estimated to employ 6,490 cast and crew, paying nearly $347 million in wages, and generate roughly $578 million in economic activity.




	“While other states try to chase California's on-screen success, everyone knows the Golden State is the entertainment capital of the world – built through decades of innovation and hard work,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. “Today's awards are vital to keeping production where it belongs – generating thousands of good-paying jobs ‘below the line,' and supporting the local businesses that rely on a thriving film and television industry.”

	The upcoming, yet-to-be-titled film from Everything Everywhere All At Once directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert headlines the projects tapped for this application window. NBCUniversal is expected to receive $20.8 million in tax credits.


	The only other major studios chosen to receive incentives this round are Twentieth Century Studios for Business Women and Warner Bros. for Cut Off, which will get $5.7 million and $10 million in credits respectively.


	The bulk of this allocation round was directed toward a slate of 46 independent movies, reflecting big budget productions increasingly opting to shoot in other regions with more generous tax incentives, like Georgia and the U.K. The majority of those films are projected to shoot in regions outside of Los Angeles, with plans to film more than 360 days in Contra Costa, Oakland, Ojai, Merced, and San Diego Counties, among others, according to the film commission.


	Independent films chosen to receive tax credits include Animals, Not Her, TBTN, Phantom, A Bobby Thing, and Reenactment.


	In a statement, California Film Commission director Colleen Bell stressed the disruption in production caused by Los Angeles' wildfires earlier this year. “These disruptions have impacted employment for thousands of cast and crew members, affecting everything from production schedules and financing to housing and location access,” she said. “Now more than ever, this program is a critical tool to help productions recover, keeping jobs and investment here in our state, all while ensuring that California remains the heart of the entertainment industry.”

	











	Kwan and Scheinert underscored the significance of the state film and TV tax incentive program to keeping production in California. “We are LA filmmakers, with very dear LA friends, who happen to be some of the greatest creative talents we've worked with,” they said in a statement. ““On ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once' we received the California tax credit, and had we not, it would have been utterly impossible to make that film.”


	Last year, Newsom unveiled plans to double California's current cap for the state's film and TV tax incentive program from $330 million to $750 million a year. It's an aggressive bid to revitalize production across the state after it was decimated by the strikes and curb the yearslong flight of production away from the region. Details are still being ironed out.

Morgan Stanley is preparing to reduce its 80,000-person workforce by 2,000 employees later this month, marking the bank's first significant round of layoffs since CEO Ted Pick took over in January 2024.

The workforce reduction will affect divisions across Morgan Stanley, except for its 15,000 financial advisers, per Bloomberg. The cuts are meant to keep costs down as executives face low attrition, or a low rate of employees leaving an organization through resignations, terminations, or retirements.

Some employees impacted by the layoffs will be let go due to performance issues, while others will be cut because AI and automation have replaced their roles within the bank. A source told Bloomberg that the bank expects to make more job reductions due to AI in the coming years.

Morgan Stanley isn't the only major bank planning to cut roles due to AI. A Bloomberg Intelligence report released earlier this year surveyed chief information and technology officers at 93 major banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and found that executives expect to lay off an average of 3% of their workforce within the next three to five years as AI takes over tasks. That means up to 200,000 jobs on Wall Street are at risk of being cut due to automation.

Morgan Stanley has released several internal AI tools for employees. In September 2023, the bank rolled out an AI knowledge assistant tool that quickly finds information within Morgan Stanley research for financial advisers. In June 2024, the bank released another AI tool that takes notes and finds action items for financial advisers during their video meetings with clients.

Pick told investors in June that the AI tools could save employees between 10 to 15 hours per week.

""This is potentially really game-changing,"" he stated at the time, per Reuters.

Morgan Stanley executives credited the new AI technology with helping the bank report record revenue and profits. Pick told CNBC in October that AI makes the bank more cost-effective and productive. In 2024, Morgan Stanley achieved record net revenues of $61.8 billion, up from $54.1 billion in 2023.

Morgan Stanley is the latest bank to plan layoffs. One of its rivals, Goldman Sachs, is aiming to cut 3% to 5% of its 46,500-person workforce in the coming months. Goldman will reportedly ask some managers located in major hubs like New York City to move to emerging locations like Salt Lake City and Dallas.

				Training & Education 

The PGA of GB&I has announced the first PGA Excel awardees of 2025, with four PGA Members achieving Advanced Fellow status and 12 others earning designations within the membership categories of Professional, Coach and Manager.

The following PGA Members have been recognised in the following categories:

Advanced Fellow ProfessionalPaul Booth – General Manager, Troon International – Al Hamra Golf ClubNicky Lawrenson – Owner and founder of Nicky Lawrenson Golf and Women in Golf & Business

Advanced Fellow ManagerPaul Wilson – Managing Director, Laguna Phuket, Banyan Group

Advanced Fellow CoachNeil Harvey – PGA Lecturer, The PGA National Training Academy

Fellow ProfessionalGary Dingwall – Head Teaching Professional & Golf Operations Manager, Royal Dornoch Golf ClubJason Dransfield – Golf Operations Supervisor, Heswall Golf ClubRichard Swords – Head Professional, Golf & Country Club Basel

Fellow CoachMark Heinemann – Head Professional, Killarney Golf & Fishing ClubJames Jankowski – Putting Coach, JJ GolfMark McGeehan – Head Teaching Professional, McGeehan Golf

Advanced ProfessionalDanny Spillane – Club Manager, Rothley Park Golf ClubMatthew Jacques – Assistant Professional, Paul Anderson Golf Ltd, Berkshire Golf ClubGuy Wills – Head Professional, Fulford Golf ClubAndrew Blunt – Head Professional, Seaham Golf ClubMaria Efimenko – Director of Golf, Pestovo Golf & Yacht Club

Advanced CoachHarry Smith – PGA Professional, Cowdray Park Golf Club





Each awardee has been recognised for their impact and achievements within the industry. Through the PGA Excel framework, they have showcased their expertise which will now enhance their professional reputation and demonstrated their impact to employers and the wider industry.

Nicky Lawrenson is one of four individuals to earn Advanced Fellow status — a recognition that reflects her career trajectory since her time on the PGA training programme, where she placed third in the Trainee of the Year Awards.

“It was great news to receive Advanced Fellow status. I was delighted and very honoured,” she said. “I've been very fortunate to have had the support and guidance of some great people and mentors who have been instrumental throughout various stages of my career, including my early years, which has served as a great stepping stone for my future.”

In an ever-evolving industry where progression is key to maintaining high standards, PGA Excel provides a clear model for recognising and rewarding professional development. Lawrenson highlights its impact: “I believe PGA Excel can play a significant role in career progression and recruitment. It enables employers to recognise individuals who have invested in their development and are ambitious to progress their career. It raises standards and, in turn, enhances the overall golfer and facility experience.”

Lawrenson — who furthered her coaching career at The Emirates Golf Club in Dubai under leading Tour coach Peter Cowen — has been a driving force behind ‘Women in Golf & Business.' She sees her new designation as a reinforcement of her mission.

“I have a great passion to support and champion women in embracing the wider benefits that golf can offer, professionally & personally. This led to the development of ‘Women in Golf & Business'- with a mission of positive change, impact, empowerment, greater inclusivity, and believing what's possible both on and off the golf course.''

Neil Harvey, PGA Coach and Lecturer at the PGA National Training Academy, also received Advanced Fellow status. Reflecting on what it means to his own coaching journey, he said: “In a role where developing clients and students has always been my focus, this is a nice moment for me to reflect on my own personal journey, and it makes me proud to be recognised by The PGA. I've always been committed to continuous learning, and this designation reinforces my professional status, providing evidence of industry expertise, achievement, and learning.

“I believe I'm in a unique position, which only a handful of coaches have enjoyed. The exposure to academic research and the need to defend my position as a coach in my lecturing role, combined with my own workplace experience, provides me with constant opportunities to reflect on my own practice.

“It also demonstrates how The PGA values personal development, learning, and achievement for its Members and staff. I've enjoyed a huge amount of support during my coaching-to-lecturing transition, and this is a recognition of a positive working environment at The PGA, as well as my own achievements.”

Tristan Crew, the PGA's Executive Director – Membership, commented: “Congratulations to the 16 PGA Members who have achieved their new PGA Excel designation. This recognition highlights their impact, achievements, and dedication to continuous professional development. 

“The PGA Excel framework provides a platform for Members to showcase their expertise, enhance their career prospects, and elevate industry standards. It's great to see so many awardees in the first quarter of 2025, and we encourage all Members to engage with PGA Excel as a valuable tool for professional development and career advancement.”

The Club Management Association of Europe (CMAE) has announced the launch of CMAE Scotland, marking an exciting new chapter for club management professionals in the region.

Formerly known as the Scottish Golf & Club Managers Association (SGCMA), the organisation recently voted with an outstanding majority at its Annual General Meeting to transition to CMAE Scotland, aligning itself more closely with the broader CMAE brand, while maintaining its strong regional identity.

CMAE Scotland will serve as the regional arm of the CMAE, dedicated to delivering high-quality education, professional development, and networking opportunities for club managers and industry professionals across Scotland. Through a series of regional educational events, workshops, and networking forums, CMAE Scotland will provide valuable support and resources to members, ensuring they stay at the forefront of best practices and industry trends.

“I am delighted to support the announcement of SGCMA's rebranding as CMAE Scotland, marking an exciting new chapter for club management professionals in the region,” said CMAE Commercial Director Craig Cotterill. “This evolution strengthens the collaboration between Scotland and the wider CMAE family, ensuring enhanced access to quality education, professional development, and broader networking opportunities.

“The commitment of the CMAE Scotland board has been instrumental in driving this progressive change, and I extend my sincere thanks for their vision and dedication in shaping a stronger future for their members. This step forward will not only benefit club managers in Scotland but also contribute to the ongoing growth and connectivity of CMAE professionals across the UK, Europe and MENA.”

David Addison, Chairman of CMAE Scotland, added: “We are delighted to rebrand SGCMA to CMAE Scotland and excited for what the future holds for our members. Becoming closer aligned with CMAE furthers our commitment to education, development and support to our club managers in Scotland.”

				Course Development 

Faced with the challenges of sandy soil and bunker erosion, Kings Lynn Golf Club in Norfolk has employed synthetic bunker experts EcoBunker to meet their ongoing maintenance challenges. 

Now in the third phase of a 40-bunker renovation project, the team and members at Kings Lynn are already enjoying the benefits that the EcoBunker system brings to their course.

“We're a sandy course which can cause real structural problems with the bunkers,” said Michael Fahy, Deputy Head Greenkeeper at Kings Lynn. “Our bunker walls erode very easily, and we have had several occasions where they've collapsed completely. With EcoBunker we are getting that strength and integrity along with a sharp looking finish. The members love the looks and the playability, and the team love how easy they are to maintain.”

With a mix of high wall and low edged bunkers, and several significant height transitions leading into greens, the bunkering at Kings Lynn poses a variety of maintenance challenges. But whatever the type of bunker – all of which EcoBunker offer ultra-low maintenance solutions – the local surroundings pose consistent challenges across the course. 

“We have a real problem with soil erosion and rabbit scraping and burrowing, which quickly contaminates the bunker sand,” continued Michael. “To counter this, we have fitted EcoTec bunker liners alongside the synthetic walls to create a fully closed system. This requires virtually no maintenance and eliminates all contamination. 

“Previously we could spend half a day picking out stones, weeding walls and topping up sand on a single bunker, but now we simply brush the faces, knock the sand off and strim the top edge. We're saving time and budget with every bunker we replace.”

Now in the third phase of renovations, all the par-3 holes have been completed and the team is moving on to those bunkers next most in need of attention. Having been trained by EcoBunker during the first installation, Michael and his colleagues, Tim Race and Mason Bernstein, use the EcoBunker system to renovate the bunkers themselves and plan the schedule of work accordingly.

“We re-build a few bunkers each winter, knowing that by the time we get to the last phase, the first EcoBunkers we built will still have many years life left in them, even though it could be a 10 year project. The club are investing for the long term which makes so much more sense than the continual rebuilding and patching of the traditional bunkering on the course.”

A business that sits right at the entrance of the Sunriver Business Park thinks the newly announced and unique roundabouts coming to Sunriver are a ""great idea."" Deschutes County Road Department says the roundabouts are needed due to the congestion and safety issues that arise, especially on…

SUNRIVER, Ore. -- Sunriver is getting three new roundabouts and some locals say it's needed at one intersection in particular. Some of the designs for that location aren't ones drivers see all that often.

All three roundabout locations are on South Century Drive. Construction is already set for one standard roundabout at Huntington Road in July, but Deschutes County is asking for public input on the designs for the two others.

The largest project is planned at the intersection of South Century Drive and Venture Lane, which is right at the entrance to the Sunriver Business Park, and it comes with some unusual design suggestions.

Fly & Fields Outfitters in the business park overlooks the intersection.

""It's a great idea,"" Fly & Fields guide and retail manager Jordan Romney said. ""This intersection is just not very controlled with the stoplight and the confusion of which way people are turning. Who has to stop where. We constantly see people almost in accidents, if not in accidents.""

The intersection is also a road many use to drop off and pick up their kids from Three Rivers School. 

""That intersection, along with an adjacent intersection, internal to the business park doesn't function that well as a signalized intersection. They're way too close together. During school, pickup, drop off, during other times when there's a lot of business activity, there's safety and congestion issues,"" Deschutes County Road Department Director Chris Doty said.

Those adjacent intersections are just about 100 feet away from each other and form a sort of ""I"" shape. The section between the two intersections is narrow and creates a blind corner for drivers turning left out of the business park to get onto South Century Drive.

""It's not a typical solution, so it's going to take an atypical solution to solve those problems,"" Doty said.

The designs for the planned roundabout are unique, with the road department calling one of the concepts a ""peanut,"" and the other a ""teardrop."" There's also a ""barbell,"" which is two separate roundabouts, and a roundabout plus a turn lane.

Despite the potential impacts construction could bring to the foot traffic coming into the business park, Romney says he's not concerned.

""I think the people who want to come down here to shop for fishing goods or come see the tap house are going to come anyway. I think in the long run it's just gonna help traffic move better through this intersection,"" Romney said.

There is also a standard roundabout going in at the intersection of South Century Drive and Spring River Road. The two projects are currently estimated to cost $7 million.

An online open house is available through April 17 at this link. Viewers can see conceptual alternatives for the improvements at Venture Lane and Spring River Road, information on how it will improve traffic flow and a chance to provide feedback.

A human resources consulting firm announced Tuesday it will open a new corporate center in metro Atlanta that will employ 750 workers by the end of this decade.

Dublin, California-based TriNet will open its 150,000-square-foot office in Dunwoody, according to a news release. The city is within the Central Perimeter submarket, one of the largest clusters of office space in metro Atlanta and one that has struggled to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic's upheaval of the office sector.

The office's location was not disclosed in the release, and company representatives did not immediately respond to requests for more information. The project is estimated to be a $15.4 million investment and will act as a national hub for the company.

“We are excited to partner with Atlanta's strong universities and thriving small business ecosystem as we expand our local team and establish a hub where TriNet colleagues from across the country can come together for training, development and collaboration to better serve our customers,” Mike Simonds, TriNet president and CEO, said in the release.

Founded in 1988, TriNet is part of the publicly traded TriNet Group and provides HR consulting and other technology services to small and medium-sized businesses. The company said it will hire its 750 new positions based at the Dunwoody office over the next five years.

“TriNet's services for small businesses will further that network while creating meaningful jobs and investment for the Dunwoody and DeKalb County community,” Gov. Brian Kemp said in the release.



Since the 2020 pandemic, metro Atlanta's office market has faced a record amount of vacant and unwanted space. The region ended 2024 with 32.9% — nearly a third — of all office square footage being advertised to rent, according to real estate services firm CBRE.

The Central Perimeter submarket, which includes Dunwoody, Sandy Springs and Brookhaven, is the region's largest office submarket with nearly 25 million square feet of workspace. About 35.5% was available to rent at the end of December, roughly in line with Midtown and Buckhead. Central Perimeter also commands significantly cheaper average rents than those other submarkets.

The specific terms of TriNet's office lease were not disclosed.

A Georgia Department of Economic Development spokesperson said the state did not provide a grant or other discretionary incentives to TriNet to recruit the new corporate center.

TriNet will likely qualify for statutory incentives including tax credits for newly created jobs.

      Comparison advertising is getting more confrontational as brands work harder to catch consumers' attention, while the general tone of social media lowers the barrier to trading insults.


     
      Attack ads, of course, are almost as old as advertising itself. But the back-and-forth, and often taunting edge of today's online discourse is increasingly seeping into advertising, both in its digital and traditional forms.


     
      Home-rental company Vrbo, for example, this month put up billboards describing itself as “Airbnb's hotter, cooler, friendlier long-lost twin that never has hosts."" One of the billboards was placed within view of Airbnb headquarters in San Francisco.


     
      The ads were an escalation in a continuing Vrbo campaign that showcased uncomfortable rental properties with standoffish hosts—but hadn't previously called out Airbnb by name.


     
      The ads addressed frustrations that travelers associate with all vacation rentals, not just Airbnb's, according to a spokesman for Vrbo, part of Expedia Group.


     
      Whether the ad made an impression on consumers or not, Airbnb noticed. CEO Brian Chesky shared a photo of the billboard on his Instagram account along with an image of a laughing face.


     
      “Vrbo just spent millions on ads that appear to be as confused as they are desperate,"" an Airbnb spokesman said when asked for comment, “even giving Airbnb more visibility than their own name.""


     
      Attack ads have a long history. From early 20th century tobacco sellers to the makers of personal computers more recently, companies have battled for market share by trading insults through paid media, according to Pinar Yildirim, professor of marketing and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and co-author of a 2022 report on the effects of negative campaigns.


     
      Famous examples include the long-running “Pepsi Challenge,"" begun in 1975, which depicts consumers choosing Pepsi over Coca-Cola in blind taste tests, and the “Get a Mac"" campaign in the 2000s, which portrayed Apple computers as cooler and more powerful than their nerdy PC competitors.


     
      Attack ads can help newcomers establish a presence by associating themselves with a better-known name—even if it's in a negative way, said Yildirim. The practice might be intensifying as brands work harder to reach consumers in digital spaces, though it comes with reputational, financial and, in some cases, legal risks, she said.


     
      Last year, for instance, Mondelez International sued Dutch chocolate brand Tony's Chocolonely for violating its intellectual property rights by mimicking the Milka brand's signature purple wrapper in a campaign insinuating that other, larger chocolate makers use underpaid cocoa farmers.


     
      A Hamburg court granted a preliminary injunction, and the two companies later reached an agreement to resolve the suit, according to a Tony's Chocolonely representative.


     
      But the brand didn't drop the issue. In January, Tony's Chocolonely mocked a “Made to Share"" campaign by Mondelez's Cadbury by again implying that the packaged-food giant profited from exploitative practices in the cocoa industry.


     
      In challenging its larger rivals, Tony's Chocolonely aims to raise awareness of key issues in the cocoa industry, such as forced and child labor and deforestation, according to the representative. Mondelez didn't respond to requests for comment, but has said that “No amount of child labor in the cocoa supply chain should be acceptable.""


     
      Attack ads are more heavily regulated in Europe than in the U.S., where the Federal Trade Commission states that “the use of truthful comparative advertising should not be restrained by broadcasters or self-regulation entities.""


     
      Elsewhere in the world, attack ads can descend into viral free-for-alls. Last month, McDonald's China went after market leader KFC with a campaign for “CFC,"" or cage-free chicken, insinuating that McDonald's chicken was more ethically raised and of higher quality. Like Vrbo in San Francisco, McDonald's China placed its “CFC"" ads directly outside KFC locations.


     
      KFC fought back, with social-media posts underscoring the K in its name to reinforce its own brand. But dozens of companies in unrelated sectors, ranging from cars to toothpaste, quickly jumped in with their own twist on the campaign. Subway China, for example, posted “NFC = no fried chicken"" on RedNote, a Chinese photo and video app similar to Instagram.


     
      History shows that extended fighting between brands can damage consumer perception of entire categories, according to Yildirim. Building on past research, her study found that “negative advertising wars reduce demand for all involved parties,"" since consumers grow weary of battling brands with similar products.


     
      Advertising tear-downs in the U.S. have come to more closely resemble the contentious comment threads that often accompany social-media posts and online news articles, according to Chris Danton, co-founder of brand consulting firm In Good Co.


     
      The shift reflects “the normalization of social-media behavior, where people tend to kind of go after one another and be nastier than they might be face to face,"" Danton said.


     
      Sometimes it means literally sniping in the comments.


     
      Rival prebiotic soda brands Poppi and Olipop had a social-media brawl last month after Poppi delivered vending machines to some TikTok creators as part of a campaign timed to coincide with the Super Bowl. A number of TikTok users knocked the campaign for focusing on well-to-do influencers, while Olipop criticized Poppi in comments on several posts, with some claiming that the machines cost $25,000 each.


     
      Poppi co-founder Allison Ellsworth swiftly took to TikTok, describing the comments as “misinformation being spread out there by one of our competitors.""


     
      “The unhinged brand is just the norm now,"" said Ashley Rutstein, a freelance creative director who runs the popular @StuffAboutAdvertising account. “It's not novel anymore, and for younger generations I think is the expected tone for brands. They like the honesty.""


     
      Some advertisers are asking AI to do their dirty work.


     
      Allegra, an antihistamine from Opella, in January released a “Drowsy Prompts"" campaign built around TikTok clips of celebrities asking ChatGPT to describe the side effects of competing products such as Benadryl, sold by competitor Johnson & Johnson.


     
      The AI obliges, telling Broadway actor Mary Kate Morrissey a detailed story about “a blur of surreal moments and unintentional comedy"" as exhaustion takes over.


     
      By letting the AI develop copy on its own, the Opella team hoped to give Allegra more personality and avoid the tedious language of traditional pharmaceutical marketing.


     
      “It's about making sure we're breaking through the clutter,"" said Alberto Hernandez, chief growth officer at Opella.


     
      One small brand even took a shot at a household name that isn't a competitor. Hatch, a maker of bedside devices designed to help people sleep, this year went viral on TikTok for its billboards blaming Apple iPhones for unwanted late nights.


     
      One ad noted that the new Hatch Restore 3 “Doesn't have your ex's number,"" then, with an arrow pointing at a nearby iPhone billboard, says the other device “Will let you text your ex at 2 AM.""


     
      Hatch's goal was less to attack Apple than to define its own brand in a concise and conversational way, said Executive Creative Director Rinee Shah.


     
      “If we're doing a challenger campaign, who is the enemy? The enemy is phones and doom-scrolling, because it's very detrimental to sleep,"" said Shah. The video has racked up more than nine million views on TikTok since January.


     
      Hatch succeeded in raising its profile by highlighting an issue all too common among anxious sleepers without going truly negative.


     
      More marketers will attempt to strike this balance, according to Danton of In Good Co.


     
      “A brand's ability to cut through is pretty minimal these days,"" Danton said. “They can't do it without being sensational.""

European Union Lays Out How Apple Must Open Its Tech up to Competitors Under Bloc's Digital Rules

LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday outlined the steps that Apple must take to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to work better with competing technologies.

It's the first time the EU has moved to compel a technology company to comply with the bloc's digital Digital Markets Act — a wide-ranging set of regulations designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies from cornering markets. 

After the DMA took effect a year ago, the EU's executive Commission moved swiftly to open a raft of investigations into Big Tech companies. 

Brussels also opened two “ specification proceedings ” in September to spell out what Apple needs to do under the DMA, which aims to make digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable” by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company's products or services. 

In its legally binding decision, the commission detailed measures that the iPhone maker has to take involving nine connectivity features for its iOS operating system. 

The measures will give device and app makers better access to iPhone features that work with devices. For example, iPhone users will have “enhanced possibilities” to receive notifications on non-Apple smartwatches, including receiving pictures and the ability to reply to them. Users could also benefit from more seamless pairing of wireless headphones from other brands. 

Access to Apple's wireless file transfer technology would let third-party developers create apps similar to the AirDrop feature. 

The commission also laid out a second set of measures to make the process for software developers requesting access to iPhone features more transparent and effective. Among the changes are better access to technical documentation not yet available to third parties, it said. 

With its decision, Brussels is ""providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers,” the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera said in a press release. 

“Effective interoperability"" for will mean “better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices,” she said. 

European consumer group BEUC hailed the decision. 

“For too long, Apple has operated a walled garden around its products and prevented interoperability,"" Director General Agustin Reyna said. 

Apple, however, voiced its unhappiness, saying it's bad for the company's products and for European users.

“Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,” the company said in a statement. 

Apple said it will continue to work with the European Commission to ""help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”

The Commission also said Wednesday that Google wasn't doing enough to comply with DMA. Despite making changes, including removing flight listings, Google was still giving preference to its own services in search results, it said. 

Google is also failing to let app developers steer users to cheaper options outside its Google Play Store app marketplace, the commission said in preliminary findings. While it's acceptable for Google to charge a fee for downloading an app in its app store, the company is charging fees that ""go beyond what is justified,"" for every purchase of digital goods or services, it said. 

Google said the EU findings will require the company to make even more changes to how it displays some search results, “which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses. This is, quite simply, misguided.”

The commission's app store findings, meanwhile, “create a false choice between openness and security"" and risk exposing Europe users to more “malware and fraud,” it added. 

Google now has the chance to reply to the findings. 

If the commission decides Google is in “non-compliance” with the DMA, it can issue a fine of up to 10% of the company's annual global revenue. But officials have said that they want to avoid issuing blockbuster fines and instead negotiate with companies to get them to comply. 

The EU's crack down on the global tech industry has irritated President Donald Trump, who recently blasted the bloc's hefty antitrust fines for U.S. tech companies. Vice-President JD Vance, meanwhile, has railed against excessive AI regulation, in a rebuke aimed at the EU's sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act.

However, both companies have been under pressure in the U.S. too. Apple is facing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit accusing it of engineering an illegal smartphone monopoly. Meanwhile, federal antitrust regulators are seeking to break up Google after a federal judge ruled Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.

China is advancing in the AI race at an accelerating rate. The most recent development is tech giant Baidu's launch of two new AI models that it claims outperform offerings from domestic challenger DeepSeek and Western leader OpenAI in several benchmark tests.

On March 16, 2025, Baidu made its latest multimodal foundational model, Ernie 4.5, and its first multimodal reasoning model, Ernie X1, available on Ernie Bot's official website. The Beijing-based company's announcement marks an escalation of the competition between Chinese AI developers, who are now challenging one other's achievements and, increasingly, positioning themselves as alternatives to Western AI powerhouses.

According to a statement from Baidu on WeChat, Ernie 4.5's multimodal capabilities – covering images, audio, and video – outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o on benchmark platforms, including CCBench and OCRBench.

The company further claimed that, based on several benchmarks, Ernie 4.5's text capabilities surpassed those of DeepSeek V3 and “roughly matched” OpenAI's GPT-4.5. Perhaps most notably, Baidu asserts that its new reasoning model Ernie X1 “delivers performance on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price” – a strategic pricing move that could accelerate X1's adoption in price-sensitive markets.

Reasoning models represent an evolution in AI development, as unlike standard large language models that excel at generating conversational text, reasoning models are designed to handle complex problem-solving tasks that require logical thinking, planning, and use of online tools.

DeepSeek's R1, launched in late 2024, has become the new standard for AI model makers to beat on price and, arguably, performance. This was particularly impressive, considering the company spent only a fraction of what larger competitors invest in training models.

Pricing has become a key battleground in the industry. Baidu has set business access to Ernie X1's API at 2 yuan (US$0.28) per million token inputs and 8 yuan per million token outputs. That significantly undercuts DeepSeek, which charges US$0.55 per million token inputs and US$2.19 per million token outputs for its DeepSeek-reasoner service powered by the R1 model. The Hangzhou-based startup recently raised its API prices amid surging demand, creating an opening for Baidu's competitive pricing strategy.

The shift toward open-source development represents another pivotal change in China's AI landscape. Baidu's founder, chairman, and CEO, Robin Li Yanhong, announced last month that Ernie 4.5 would become open source on June 30, a dramatic reversal from his previous advocacy for closed-source AI development. “One thing we learned from DeepSeek is that open-sourcing the best models can greatly help adoption,” Li said during an earnings call with analysts in February.

“When the model is open source, people naturally want to try it out of curiosity, which helps drive broader adoption,” he said.

The pivot toward open-source development suggests a new phase in the competitive dynamics of the Chinese AI market. Competitive intensity in China's AI market escalated in March 2023, when Baidu became the first Chinese Big Tech firm to launch an LLM following OpenAI's ChatGPT release.

However, in the last two years, other Chinese AI players have challenged Baidu's early-mover advantage. The South China Morning Post reported that DeepSeek has championed the open-source movement, while companies including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance have been “galloping ahead in grabbing business and consumer users for their models,” the publication's editorial read.

Despite technological advances, Baidu continues to face business challenges. The company reported that total revenue for the fourth quarter fell 2% year-on-year, with full-year revenue declining 1%. This indicates that even with cutting-edge AI capabilities, monetisation remains challenging, given the costs associated with training and running AI models.

The implications of China's advancing AI capabilities extend beyond corporate competition. The global AI landscape reshaping as Chinese AI models achieve performance metrics comparable to their Western counterparts, and offer lower prices. Intense competition offers benefits for global AI users: more capable models at lower prices, with options spanning proprietary and open-source approaches.

The proliferation of high-performing models creates new opportunities for businesses building on AI yet complicates decisions about which AI infrastructure to adopt. As Baidu's latest announcement demonstrates, China's AI race is not merely about catching up to Western innovation – it's increasingly about setting competitive terms through aggressive pricing, open-sourcing, and specialised capabilities like reasoning models.

The rapid development cycles and fierce competition among Chinese tech companies suggest that the pace of AI innovation will continue, with potentially significant implications for the global AI ecosystem.

Exail has secured its first sale of the Gaps M3 compact USBL (Ultra-Short Baseline) positioning system to a major offshore construction group in Asia. The system will be deployed for a subsea cable laying project, providing precise underwater positioning in a dynamic coastal environment.

The Gaps M3 was selected for its ability to deliver subsea tracking while remaining cost-effective. Integrated with a vessel's existing attitude and heading reference system, the Gaps M3 will provide the same accuracy as Exail's high-end Gaps USBL models, offering a solution for operations that require subsea navigation at a lower cost.

Designed for both permanent and opportunistic installations, the Gaps M3 is ideal in coastal and nearshore projects, where space, budget, and operational flexibility are crucial. Its ability to track targets at high elevations makes it particularly well-suited for dynamic offshore environments, such as subsea cable laying, pipeline installation, and marine construction.

CANTON, Ohio — A press conference was held Tuesday just miles from where the remains of a man were found, several years after his Michigan family reported him missing.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Stark County Sheriff Eric Weisburn released the identity of a John Doe whose remains were found in Canton in December 2001.

The skeletal remains had likely been in the southeast part of Canton for many years. They were identified as belonging to 24-year-old Anthony Bernard Gulley from Pontiac, Michigan. 

Gulley's sister reported him missing on Sept. 11, 1994. 

His remains were originally identified as a Black man between 21 and 44 years old. A couple years ago, a clay model was created by the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and they worked with experts from The Ohio State University to create digital images of the reconstruction, but the case remained unsolved.

It wasn't until sheriff detectives reached out to the DNA Doe Project that they made a break in the case. The nonprofit, which works to identify unidentified remains, made a DNA match using DNA genealogy sites. That led them to Gulley's hometown.

“There's the excitement, of course, of accomplishment … decades long investigation can now be closed. At the same time, it's a sobering reminder that behind every cold case is a family; a victim that had friends, loved ones,” said Yost.

According to the Stark County Sheriff, it's believed Gulley was the victim of a homicide. He was killed by Frederick Washington, who died by suicide after a shootout with police in 1994.

It will be 31 years this September since Gulley was reported missing. His family, including four children, live in Michigan.","{'href': 'https://spectrumnews1.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News 1'}"

NEXT GEN: JCI displayed its line of R-32 heat pumps at the AHR Expo in Orlando. (Staff photo) 


HVAC has had a wild ride on the legislative front for the past few years. From the Inflation Reduction Act and its electrification incentives to its sudden reversal on Trump's first day of office, manufacturers have worked to produce up-to-date equipment that meets Americans' heating and cooling demands and optimizes their comfort and spending power. 

At AHR Expo 2025, four HVAC manufacturers shared how the IRA has impacted their product design, and what's next for the electrification movement. 

 

There's no question the IRA has influenced HVAC product design. Many manufacturers at AHR showed off their latest models alongside signage for the relevant tax credits. 

“When we set about redoing our portfolio for A2L and being 2025 ready, we took into account the CE tier levels and the level of 25C incentives for customers. … We specified the product for engineering to meet specific ratings with specific split-system matchings,” said Charles Hurd, director of residential product management at Johnson Controls. 

JCI's York HH8 18-SEER side-discharge modulating heat pump is targeted to maximize that rebate incentive, as it gets a qualifying rating with a 97% two-stage furnace. Later this year, they'll be releasing the YH9 vertical discharge 19 SEER product, “again, getting loose coil ratings, as well as pairing with furnaces that'll come out later this year.” On the non-furnace or lighter-weight furnace end, JCI offers a staged YH6 that gets 25C-eligible credits with an air handler, allowing customers in a more southerly climate, or who aren't looking for a dual-fuel solution, to get a more optimized price point. 

The push for electrification also brought a push for high-performance heat pumps that work well in cold climates. LG has focused on designing all-electric and dual-fuel products for climate extremes, both geographically across North America (like Alaska and Canada) and for extreme heat/cold within the same climate. 

“Being able to have a product like our award-winning heat pump allows us to not only provide heating down to -30° and beyond, but it also provides cooling to extremely high ambients — and that swing is not abnormal, if you start to think about things like snowing in Florida,” said Steve Scarbrough, senior vice president and general manager for LG Air Conditioning Technologies USA. Looking ahead, he said, “everything that we focus on will operate on clean, efficient renewable energy to be highly effective and highly efficient in all climates.” 

When Midea designed this year's flagship high-performance system, the Evox G3, in addition to incentivizing homeowners through designing to meet the rebates, the company also introduced features designed specifically for installers. 

“We asked contractors, ‘What do you want different from other products on the market?'” said David Rames, senior product manager at Midea America Corp.

One of the responses was it needed to be easier to move. 

“Instead of a 250-pound tech hauling a 150-pound air handler up rickety attic stairs, our system, within a couple of minutes, breaks down into three easier-to-move pieces,” he said. “On average, it's about 30 seconds per piece up the stairs or down the stairs. So in a minute and a half, we can have the whole thing up or down and put back together.” It's just safer — not to mention, workman's comp claims are expensive. 

The other contractor request was dealing with the pricey electrical upgrade required to swap a gas furnace for a high-performance heat pump. So Midea designed the Evox G3 with auto voltage detection. 

Gas furnaces run off of 115 voltage, while most air handlers work off of 208/230 voltage. 

“We can take that same 115V circuit from the gas furnace and hook it into our air handler,” Rames said. “It senses it and runs off of the same circuitry that the gas furnace ran off on. This will help save [the customer] money to transfer into electrification and get the gas furnace out, and they don't have to pay for the expense of electrical load.” 

 

How much has the IRA helped contractors sell? Manufacturers reported a mixed bag, largely because not all HVAC contractors are down for double-duty as tax advisors. 

The IRA was “a little bit of a late add” to Rheem's high-efficiency product, so they did some redesigning to make sure it qualified for the incentive. However, the response from contractors was less than anticipated. Randy Roberts, vice president of residential a/c at Rheem. said he's met with a lot of large HVAC contractors who were not comfortable discussing tax credits or the IRA because they didn't understand them. 

“They were buying it at a larger amount, but not at the amount that we thought they would have,” he said. “At this point, we are still seeing the vast majority of sales going into base efficiency, which the whole industry pushing 85+% today in base. 

“I think we still absolutely have a massive education shortfall in contractor understanding,” he concluded. “There's a whole lot of contractors [who] were not comfortable giving tax advice to consumers and promising them credits a year or so out, and I think a lot of times, they just didn't push it.” 

Roberts reported that a larger chunk of electric HVAC sales are coming from products that are easy to install without changing the fuel source, like dual-fuel heat pumps. Rheem's dual-fuel product is the RD18, and it works with nearly any R-454B HVAC system. 

“We're going to give the market what the market wants, and we're going to give heat pump solutions, but we also would highly encourage and push folks: Put a heat pump on a gas furnace and get the best of both worlds that way,” Roberts said. “It gives flexibility for the consumer and the contractor to provide comfort, which is the key thing here.” 

All this being said, homeowners will still invest in electric HVAC if it means cost savings. 

“Investing in your home, and investing in your operating costs that you can control, is something near and dear to homeowners' hearts — something they're always willing to consider and willing to do the math on and think about for themselves,” Hurd said. 

 

As of January 20, funding for the IRA is on pause after an executive order from President Trump that halted major funding initiatives tied to the clean energy movement. (Homeowners in states that have already received funding can still get the credit.) 

What happens long-term? One thing's for certain, Hurd said: Federal energy efficiency mandates under the Trump administration will probably not get stronger.  

But that might not matter. 

“What we've been hearing from the market is, regardless of 25C credits, the majority of activity — what homeowners ask about and what contractors push — is local utility incentive rebates from your power and gas company, and those will survive,” he said. “That's still part of the mandate of local utility companies trying to … not have to build more generation capacity and live within the existing constraints of their capital equipment.” 

The CE levels will likely get adopted by those entities, perhaps with minor revisions, he said. 

Rames hopes local rebates can be based on efficiency rather than BTUs or system capacity — otherwise, oversizing could inadvertently be incentivized. That creates another problem: short cycling in the summer, which leads to humidity issues. 

States may actually wield more power than the feds to accelerate the heat pump movement, Scarbrough asserted, because they have more sway with public perception than a national program that quickly got politicized. 

“There's a lot of fantastic programs — you have the Mass Save program, the Maine heat pump program, Vermont's program — and no big shock … it's those states that were looking towards displacing fossil fuels,” he said. 

Whether it's called “the IRA,” “electrification,” “decarbonization,” or something else, the movement is here to stay, said Scarbrough — and that's regardless of what any given White House has to say. 

“We know we can't keep drilling and excavating,” he said. “The oil is going to run out, the coal, all this stuff is going to run out, whether it's our lifetime, our children's lifetime — it's not an endless supply. We know we have to find other alternatives. And I don't care which side of the political fence you sit on, those are just sheer facts.” 

Decarbonization goals aren't going anywhere, either. 

“2030 is the first benchmark. It doesn't matter which administration … those are things that we already are moving forward to,” he said. “I always say the toothpaste is already out of the tube … and I can promise you LG and probably every other manufacturer in this exhibit hall is going to continue to look at ways to improve efficiency, to maximize electrification, and find those areas to be more conscious of our people and our planet.”

The podcast ""Closing the Round"" has reached the middle of its fifth season, covering topics from investments to technology. Guests
included Mykhailo Fedorov and other influential figures.

The technology podcast ""Closed Round"", partnered by the IT company FAVBET Tech, has reached the middle of its fifth season, reports UNN.

Behind us are 26 episodes and dozens of hours of conversations about investments, startups and technologies, as well as an overview of popular culture phenomena and interviews with people who are changing the Ukrainian technology market. Let's recall the most popular and resonant ones.

The first episodes of the season began with deep analyses of cases of global and Ukrainian companies and iconic personalities: how Sam Altman turned OpenAI into a commercial phenomenon, why startups vitally need creativity (says Ihor Finashkin from I AM IDEA), and what happens when technology giants like Google become too influential.

Next, the hosts of ""Closed Round"" analyzed in detail how the largest venture fund Softbank ""drained"" 100 billion dollars, how Victoria Tigipko created a successful investment portfolio of TA Ventures, and also talked about the influence of Peter Thiel on the American elections and the phenomenon of the popularity of vertical micro-series of Ukrainian production.

Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov on the podcast ""Closed Round""

One of the most popular episodes of the season was an exclusive with Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, who shared details of the Ministry of Digital Affairs' work, the development of the ""Diia"" project, and his own productivity secrets. Viewers were no less actively watching releases about startup niches according to Y Combinator, investment strategies of Andriy Fedoriv, as well as about the success of a neobank for cryptocurrencies and the case of Stripe - the most expensive fintech in the world.

HOW MYKHAILO FEDOROV MANAGES THE MINISTRY OF DIGITAL AFFAIRS

""In the fifth season, we decided to talk not only about traditional technological projects, such as SoftBank, or investments in the industry, but also about how the technological world affects classic industries, such as the creation of vertical series or how social networks made Formula 1 popular again. It is very interesting to understand this,"" says co-author Ilya Kabachinsky.

The latest episodes are dedicated to the hottest technology news and trends: the big deal to acquire Uklon and Tabletki.ua by Kyivstar, the phenomenon of the Chinese AI giant DeepSeek, and the impact of popular podcasters on US politics (""How Joe Rogan and podcasters brought Trump to power""). In addition, they talked with Alna Mysko about the success of the Ukrainian startup Fuelfinance and with the ex-president of Kyivstar Petro Chernyshov about his approach to technology investments.

""In the new season, we started inviting guests who talk about niches, for example, how payments work. It turned out that the audience is interested in this, the views are large, and most importantly, organic,"" adds podcast co-author Anton Poleskov.

Anton Poleskov and Ilya Kabachinsky assure that even more interesting guests and unexpected topics await the viewers. ""We already have so many guests ahead, our editor is already working even on weekends. It seems that we have not covered even 3% of those we can call"" - say the presenters.

The constant partner of the podcast is the IT company with Ukrainian DNA FAVBET Tech, a developer of solutions for the entertainment industry and an active participant in the technological community of Ukraine. The company is a resident of Diia.City, a member of the IT Ukraine Association. FAVBET Tech is among the top 50 product IT companies in Ukraine.

With a market capitalization of $18.6 billion, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON is a leading global semiconductor company specializing in high-performance energy-efficient solutions. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company designs and manufactures a diverse portfolio of power management, sensing, and connectivity solutions that cater to key industries, including automotive, industrial, and communications.

Companies valued at over $10 billion are often categorized as “large-cap stocks,” a distinction ON Semiconductor fits this category through its strong market position. Renowned for its innovations in electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and power efficiency technologies, ON Semiconductor plays a critical role in driving the next generation of intelligent and sustainable electronics.

However, it hasn't been smooth sailing, as the stock has plummeted 45.8% from its 52-week high of $80.08, which it reached on July 29 last year. Over the past three months, the stock has dropped 33.1%, compared to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLK 3.9% decline over the same time period.  

ON Semiconductor has been caught in a relentless downtrend, plunging 41.2% over the past year and 38.5% in the last six months, a stark contrast to XLK, which dipped a mere 2.3% in six months and even managed a 2.8% gain over the year.

The stock has also exhibited sustained bearish momentum, trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since early December. 

ON Semiconductor, a key player in analog chips and silicon carbide for EVs, saw strong growth post covid but is now facing headwinds. The EV and industrial markets are slowing, leading to a 14% revenue decline in 2024 and a 23% drop in earnings. While the company remains confident in its long-term strategy, its weak price action suggests investors may want to stay cautious amid market uncertainty.

In early March, ON Semiconductor made a $6.9 billion all-cash acquisition offer for Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. ALGM at $35.10 per share, a 31% premium over its prior closing price. Allegro's board rejected the bid, deeming it inadequate. Following the rejection, Allegro's stock surged 8%, while ON's shares dropped more than 5% to a three-year low. Analysts expressed skepticism over the deal's profitability due to interest expenses, while speculation remains on whether ON will return with a higher offer.

In a similar downtrend, ON's competitor, STMicroelectronics N.V. STM, has also struggled, with its stock falling 8.3% over the past six months and plunging 42.5% over the past year, reflecting broader weakness in the semiconductor sector.

Despite its recent slump, ON Semiconductor is still catching analysts' attention, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. The stock holds a consensus ""Moderate Buy"" rating from 31 analysts, and with a mean price target of $61.16, it suggests a compelling 40.9% upside from current levels.

The European Union's law enforcement agency cautioned Tuesday that artificial intelligence is turbocharging organized crime that is eroding the foundations of societies across the 27-nation bloc as it becomes intertwined with state-sponsored destabilization campaigns.

The grim warning came at the launch of the latest edition of a report on organized crime published every four years by Europol that is compiled using data from police across the EU and will help shape law enforcement policy in the bloc in coming years.

“Cybercrime is evolving into a digital arms race targeting governments, businesses and individuals. AI-driven attacks are becoming more precise and devastating,” said Europol's Executive Director Catherine De Bolle.

“Some attacks show a combination of motives of profit and destabilization, as they are increasingly state-aligned and ideologically motivated,” she added.

The report, the EU Serious and Organized Crime Threat Assessment 2025, said offenses ranging from drug trafficking to people smuggling, money laundering, cyber attacks and online scams undermine society and the rule of law “by generating illicit proceeds, spreading violence, and normalizing corruption.”

The volume of child sexual abuse material available online has increased significantly because of AI, which makes it more difficult to analyze imagery and identify offenders, the report said. “By creating highly realistic synthetic media, criminals are able to deceive victims, impersonate individuals and discredit or blackmail targets. The addition of AI-powered voice cloning and live video deepfakes amplifies the threat, enabling new forms of fraud, extortion, and identity theft,” it said.

States seeking geopolitical advantage are also using criminals as contractors, the report said, citing cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure and public institutions “originating from Russia and countries in its sphere of influence.”

“Hybrid and traditional cybercrime actors will increasingly be intertwined, with state-sponsored actors masking themselves as cybercriminals to conceal their origin and real disruption motives,” it said.

Polish Interior Ministry Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk cited a recent cyberattack on a hospital as the latest example in his country.

“Unfortunately this hospital has to stop its activity for the hours because it was lost to a serious cyber-attack,” boosted by AI, he said. AI and other technologies “are a catalyst for crime, and drive criminal operations' efficiency by amplifying their speed, reach, and sophistication,” the report said.

As the European Commission prepares to launch a new internal security policy, De Bolle said that nations in Europe need to tackle the threats urgently.“We must embed security into everything we do,” said European Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration Magnus Brunner. He added that the EU aims to provide enough funds in coming years to double Europol's staff.

	IT services firms Wipro, TechMahindra, and L&T Technology on Wednesday announced individual partnerships with chipmaking giant Nvidia for AI-based solutions for various industries.


	These software firms are showcasing the solutions leveraging Nvidia technologies at the US-based chip major's ongoing annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in California.


	Tech Mahindra has unveiled an autonomous pharmacovigilance (PV) solution powered by Nvidia AI software to enhance drug safety management. By leveraging agentic AI and automation, the solution improves the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of PV processes, addressing challenges like manual delays and data overload.


	It integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise tools, including NeMo, NIM microservices, and AI Blueprints, to optimise case intake, data transformation, quality control, and compliance.


	The AI-driven PV solution instantly flags prioritises, and processes the request by eliminating human intervention that could potentially lead to delays and errors.


	The solution reduces turnaround times by up to 40 per cent, enhances data accuracy by 30 per cent, and cuts operational costs by 25 per cent.


	""As the pharmaceutical industry navigates volumes of data during trials and post-launch, our collaboration with Nvidia leverages generative AI and multi-agent systems to streamline the pharmacovigilance process,"" Nikhil Malhotra, Chief Innovation Officer & Global Head of AI and Emerging Technologies of Tech Mahindra, said.


	Wipro has introduced new Agentic AI services aimed at enabling nations worldwide to harness their unique infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks to develop and implement artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.


	The solution integrates Wipro's WeGA Studio with Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an Agentic AI-powered ecosystem. This ecosystem supports diverse applications that can revolutionise citizen experiences in sectors like banking and financial services, emergency response, healthcare, and education. By driving public sector innovation, it aims to stimulate economic development.


	Additionally, the solution offers pre-built responsible AI accelerators, allowing clients to swiftly create tailored use cases and high-performance models aligned with their specific goals.


	""Organisations are seeking AI solutions that are not only effective but also ethical and transparent.


	""By working together with Nvidia, we will be able to quickly deploy AI agent systems and technologies while addressing the increased concerns many government agencies and organisations have over data privacy, security, and national sovereignty,"" said Nagendra Bandaru, President and Managing Partner, Wipro Technology Services.


	L&T Technology Services (LTTS) announced the launch of TrackEi -- an AI-powered railway track inspection solution.


	The solution uses the Nvidia Jetson platform to deliver real-time defect detection and support predictive maintenance, enhancing safety for rail networks worldwide.


	TrackEi will be showcased at the Nvidia GTC 2025 AI Conference.


	""Traditionally, rail inspection involved manual processes or slow-moving trolleys, which are time-consuming and sometimes fail to detect critical flaws in time to prevent derailments.


	""TrackEi addresses this challenge by automating high-speed inspections at over 60 Miles Per Hour, utilising high-resolution cameras and laser profiling to identify issues, such as broken rails, cracks, track misalignments, and other structural defects,"" a company statement said.


	Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference is being held in San Jose, California, from March 1721, 2025. It is a premier event to showcase the latest advancements in AI and accelerated computing.

A comical video experiment intended to test the capability of Tesla's AI has exposed a huge flaw in the system.

A viral video experiment has exposed flaws in Tesla's camera-based “Autopilot” driver assistance system.

American YouTube presenter Mark Rober published a video examining the difference between camera and laser – or LIDAR – based driver assistance features in cars.

MORE: EV tech changing 4X4s forever

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is a famous proponent of camera-based technology, believing that if visual processing is good enough for human eyes and minds to process their environment, then it can also work for cars.

But other companies ranging from Volvo to Google's Waymo insist that more sophisticated radar and laser rangefinding sensors are necessary for vehicles to assess their surroundings.

MORE: Tesla sales drop by 70 per cent

Rober put the cars to the test by setting up a fake wall inspired by “Roadrunner” cartoons.

In his experiment, a Tesla Model Y relying on cameras for its cruise control and auto emergency braking systems did not detect the obstacle, smashing through it spectacularly. 

But a prototype Lexus fitted with an expensive LIDAR scanner accurately recognised the wall and stopped in time.

MORE: Musk on verge of tears as Tesla losses mount

That's because the LIDAR sensor does not rely on shapes and colours to “see” its environment. Instead, it fires laser beams and measures how long it takes the signal to bounce back from surrounding objects, giving the car a better sense of its surroundings.

Rober said people should “never underestimate the power of freakin' lasers!”

“I can definitively say for the first time in the history of the world, Tesla's optical camera system would absolutely smash through a fake wall without even a slight tap on the brakes.”

“Turns out my Tesla is more Wile E Coyote, and less Roadrunner.”

The video attracted more than 10 million views in two days and sparked controversy on social media.

The video did not feature Tesla's latest car or its latest driver assistance technology – known as “Full Self Driving” – instead relying on an the brand's simpler “Autopilot” assistance suite.

People accused Rober of making a “very misleading” video “attacking Tesla and Elon Musk”, and asked “did you rig the test”.

Others found it informative, and said it “explains all the kid shaped dents on the front of my Tesla”.

A B.C. crowdfunding company that facilitates fractional investments as low as $1 per share in real estate developments has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine to the B.C. Securities Commission for unregistered trading.

Since July 2018, Addy Technology Corp. had not been registered in any capacity — including as a securities dealer — but commission investigators found it to be engaging in activities similar to a registrant, by soliciting investors through its online platform, email and social media.

Addy was also conducting what the commission described as ""intermediating"" trades and also receiving compensation in the form of fees.

Addy agreed to the fine in a March 17 settlement agreement after voluntarily providing information to investigators and admitting to the misconduct.

The platform matches small-scale investors to the likes of real estate investment trusts (REIT) and developers across Canada, known as issuers in legal terms.

For example, an issuing company in Victoria recently obtained financing for an 18-unit, purpose-built rental complex from 420 Canadians, according to addyinvest.ca.

Between July 9, 2018, and Feb. 14, 2025, Addy traded in approximately $26 million of securities of the issuers using the Addy platform. The average amount invested in the issuers was approximately $700 per investor, according to the settlement.

Addy charges investors $50 annual membership fees for early access to certain properties and additional features on Addy's online platform.

Addy tried to use exemption rules but was not eligible.

For instance, some of the issuers Addy was promoting were owned by Addy principals, according to the agreement, and this negated Addy's ability to utilize national crowdfunding rules that exempt those registration requirements, which otherwise provide a level of investor protection in the alternative lending space.

“By engaging in the above conduct, Addy engaged in the business of trading securities without being registered and without an exemption, contrary to the [B.C. Securities Act],” the agreement stated.

Addy has since made an application for registration as a dealer of securities, according to the commission.

Ubisoft is banking on the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows to fight its way out of financial troubles as the French videogame publisher grapples with falling revenue, a sinking stock price and takeover speculation.

The title, which will be launched on Thursday, marks a return to the company's best-selling franchise after a string of high-profile flops including Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws cast doubts on its strategy of licensing new intellectual property to create games.

Ubisoft's stock took a beating last year, falling more than 40 percent last year and drawing interest from an activist investor. The company's founding Guillemot family, its largest shareholder, has also been exploring talks with Tencent and other investors on a buyout deal that would let them preserve control.

Ubisoft declined to comment on speculation of selling the company's intellectual property.

The launch of the latest game, however, has been marred by criticism on social media including from Elon Musk over its diverse set of characters, as backlash against diversity efforts gains momentum in the US following President Donald Trump's election.

""The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows is a bit of an existential moment for Ubisoft,"" said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer at NYU's Stern School of Business.

""If it does really well, it could go a long way toward repairing its financial position.""

After two delays and multiple leaks, the newest entry in the best-selling franchise transports players to feudal Japan, a fan-favorite setting for gamers. It features two protagonists: Naoe, a stealthy female assassin, and Yasuke, a heavily armored African samurai inspired by the real-life eponymous figure.

Ubisoft has refined the series' core mechanics of parkour and stealth to enhance the dual-character system. ""They're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but they really hope that what they tried with the previous games still works right now,"" said Jordan Van Andel, who has played the game and whose YouTube channel JorRaptor has over one million subscribers.

Van Andel, whose content has in the past been sponsored by Ubisoft, said the game offered a more polished experience than recent titles in the franchise but its story was disappointing.

He added that the game needs to attract a player base beyond core fans to match the financial success of ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"" the last big release in the series that came out in 2020 and the first game in the franchise to make over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,652 crore) in revenue.

Diversity Conundrum 

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes the current US political climate could also pose challenges to the game, saying that Trump ""has made it okay to be anti-DEI.""

Since its reveal more than two years ago, ""Assassin's Creed Shadows"" has faced criticism from groups over its creative choices such as having a black samurai and a female assassin.

""We could argue that the people that voted for him (Trump)... they would have hated the game anyway, but I think that they would have been less vocal,"" Pachter said.

North America accounted for over 53 percent of Ubisoft's total videogame bookings in its fiscal year 2024, as many of the company's franchises such as ""Far Cry"" have a broad appeal to the American audience.

Games with diverse characters have seen strong success in the past such as Sony's ""Horizon"", which features a female protagonist and is one of the company's most successful franchises.

Van Dreunen believes the controversy could work in Ubisoft's favor. ""It's free press this only makes the game more interesting to a lot of players, I'm sure,"" he said.

Recently installed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight. (AP: Justin Tang)

Canada was always meant to follow the United States in acquiring world-leading Australian radar technology but ""things moved quickly"" after Donald Trump won the US presidency.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the $6.5 billion JORN purchase overnight, after a conversation with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Defence Minister Richard Marles says there are still some hurdles to clear, but the sale of the technology would be the biggest defence export in Australia's history.

For months, senior officials have been discussing exporting Australia's world-leading radar technology JORN to the United States, but after Donald Trump's return to the White House, Canada saw an opportunity and leapt.

Overnight, new Canadian leader Mark Carney spoke to his counterpart, Anthony Albanese, then flew to his country's Arctic territory of Nunavut to announce a $6.5 billion high-tech Australian military purchase.

""Today, I'm announcing that our government will be working with our long-standing defence and security partner Australia to build a new, long-range, over-the-horizon military radar system,"" he said.

""[It] will enable Canada to detect and respond to both air and maritime threats over our Arctic both faster and from further away. It will most fundamentally keep all Canadians safe.""

Following President Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada and Greenland, Ottawa is purchasing the Australian-developed technology known as the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN) to build its new Arctic Over-the-Horizon Radar system.

The Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN) has been in service for more than three decades. (BAE Systems)

Ottawa has been under pressure from Washington to step up its defence spending and the new radar system will support ""NORAD"", the joint US-Canadian initiative that detects incoming threats.

Now in its fourth decade of service, the high-frequency, sky-wave, over-the-horizon (OTHR) system is considered the most advanced in the world, providing wide-area surveillance of ships and aircraft out to 3,000 kilometres.

Unlike traditional radars that were limited by line of sight, Australian scientists designed JORN to beam a high-frequency radio signal skywards towards the ionosphere above the earth's surface, which then refracted the signal down to illuminate a target.

The echo from the target then travels by a similar path back to a separate receiver site and the data received is processed into real-time tracking information — a capability crucial to monitoring Australia's vast northern maritime approaches.

With the United States continuing its campaign of tariffs on foreign nations, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was good for Australia to ""diversify"" its trade relationships.

""[Mark Carney] certainly spoke to me about the over-the-horizon radar technology that Canada is interested in purchasing from Australia, it's important that we diversify our trade relationships,"" Mr Albanese said.

""It's important that we develop that diverse series of relationships and Canada is a very important one, we have so much in common.""

In recent meetings, senior Australian officials have continued discussing exporting and installing the JORN technology on the United States' west coast, but the massive project faces uncertainty under the Elon Musk-led DOGE audit of Pentagon spending.

For well over a year, American military officials have privately expressed interest in purchasing Australia's JORN technology because of its potential to monitor military movements as far away as China's mainland.

One senior Australian official confirmed to the ABC that ""the Canadians were always going to follow the US purchase and slipstream off that"" but circumstances changed and ""things moved quickly"".

Ottawa is purchasing Australia's Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar (JORN). (Department of Defence)

Following Canada's announcement, Defence Minister Richard Marles talked up the potential of the final JORN deal, which could end up being Australia's largest military export on record.

""There's a little water to go under the bridge, but what's in prospect here is potentially the biggest defence industry export that Australia has ever been a part of,"" he told ABC News Breakfast.

""That would obviously be very good for Australian industry.""

The ABC has confirmed the United Kingdom, where the parent company of BAE Systems Australia is based, has also expressed interest in purchasing the JORN technology, but is yet to approve the idea.

Ether (ETH) zoomed nearly 7% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among majors as traders await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.

ETH's gains were coupled with a 4% gain in memecoin dogecoin (DOGE), which historically tends to act correlated to the asset's movements. Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.

Elsewhere, majors XRP, BNB Chain's BNB, Solana's SOL and Cardano's ADA rose 3%. Tron's TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a no-fee update in the Sunpump platform.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.

The widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.

Ether rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).

Testing began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.

“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won't attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”

“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.

Meanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.

“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its ""digital gold"" role,” Lee added.

 BTC price pressures are everywhere as risk-asset traders wait for what they hope will be hints of positivity from the US Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell. 

Bitcoin (BTC) passed $84,000 into the March 19 Wall Street open as markets geared up for the US Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed local highs of $84,358 on Bitstamp.

Risk assets were on edge ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the Fed expected to hold rates steady until at least June, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

The nature of subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell was of more concern to traders. Already hawkish, Powell faces pressure from US trade tariffs as inflation markets only just begin to fall.

“Tonight's FOMC meeting is highly likely hold rates steady. However, we will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers on the day. 

While holding above $80,000 throughout the week, Bitcoin's fate hung in the balance as US stocks saw notable downside.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index traded down 4% and 8.7% year-to-date at the time of writing compared to 10% for BTC/USD.

“TC has found some support at the $80k, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” QCP continued.

Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter identified a potential silver lining in the form of increasing equities allocation by US retail investors.

“Retail net inflows into Nasdaq 100 index stocks as a percentage of market cap have reached 0.1%, the highest in at least a year. Retail flows have DOUBLED in just a few weeks,” it wrote in a post on X.

Analyzing BTC price action, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital hoped that the upside gap in CME's Bitcoin futures market would be fully “filled” with a spike to $87,000.

Such gaps, as Cointelegraph reported, continue to act as short-term price magnets.

“Bitcoin continues to successfully retest the CME Gap as support (orange box, $78k-$80.7k),” Rekt Capital explained alongside an illustrative chart.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, meanwhile suggested that a dovish Powell could have a clear impact on price momentum.

“A dovish tone that reduces recessionary fears could send Bitcoin price above the 200-Day and 21-Day MAs, and avert what seemed like an imminent death cross between those two key MAs,” part of an X post stated.

Alan referred to two nearby simple moving averages, with the 200-day and 21-day MA sitting at $84,995 and $84,350, respectively.

Bad news, on the other hand, could spark a retest of multimonth lows at $76,000, he warned.

HELLO, HOODI: ETHEREUM WELCOMES A NEW TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week that will be used to carry out the blockchain's upcoming “Pectra” upgrade. Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Ethereum's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum's other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

MICROSOFT RAISES ALARM OF MALWARE TARGETING COINBASE, METAMASK WALLETS: Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension. Microsoft's Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post. The malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet. While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

HALLIDAY RAISES $20M FOR AI PROTOCOL TO ELIMINATE WRITING SMART CONTRACTS FOR DEFI: Artificial intelligence (AI)-focused blockchain protocol Halliday said it raised $20 million to help fund development of its Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP), which aims to speed development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and avoid the need for programmers to write smart contracts. The Series A funding round was led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) crypto arm.

SAM ALTMAN'S WORLD NETWORK AND RAZER WANT TO DEFEAT GAMING'S BOT PROBLEM: Sam Altman's blockchain project, World Network, is teaming up with gaming hardware firm Razer on a suite of features designed to weed out bots from video games. “Razer ID verified by World ID” is a single sign-on mechanism that will verify real human gamers from bots. It's built atop Razer ID, Razer's existing login service, and will help guarantee there's ""a real person behind every Razer ID account,” according to a statement shared by Razer and World. The collaboration between the two firms comes as artificial intelligence (AI) tools are seeping into every corner of online life — including inside of video games, which have been plagued by non-human AI ""bots"" since long before the rise of Altman's ChatGPT. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) prices face resistance around their key levels; a firm close above indicates recovery on the cards, while Ethereum (ETH) price finds support at its critical level, suggesting a bounce ahead.

Bitcoin price has faced resistance around the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,496 since Friday and trades below it. This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the Bitcoin price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.

If bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

Ethereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.

If XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC will drop its appeal against Ripple. The victory follows rumors of Ripple's lawyers negotiating more favorable terms than the company got in Judge Torres' ruling last August.

Dogecoin price hovers around $0.168 on Wednesday after bouncing off its 200-week EMA last week. Santiment's data shows that DOGE's utility and whale wallets are rising, hinting at a potential rally for the dog-themed memecoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $83,300 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing resistance around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,500 since last week, with a break above this level suggesting a potential recovery. 

XRP open interest and funding rates have remained largely negative in recent weeks. Investors remained calm despite the high bearish sentiment in the futures market, likely due to their large profits.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

An analyst from multinational bank Standard Chartered believes that crypto exchange Coinbase “proactively sold” 12,652 Ethereum (approximately $37 million) throughout Q4 2024. They explained that Coinbase's layer-2 network Base drives demand for Ethereum but the company's profit taking is hurting the underlying blockchain's price action.

Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000 earlier this week. At the time, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the bank, claimed that layer-2 network Base had removed $50 billion from ETH's market cap—now, he's saying this is because of profit taking.

“My view is that increased activity on Base increases demand for ETH in the first instance,” Kendrick shared with Decrypt. “But then all of Base's profits (which are circa 80% of all Base revenue) are sold (ETH-USD selling) to effectively repatriate profits back to Coinbase.”

To back up his claim, the analyst points to Coinbase's quarterly Ethereum holdings for investments and operations which Kendrick then subtracted from the Base profits.

“This tells me that in Q4 2024 Coinbase proactively sold 12,652 ETH,” he explained. “Over the 3 quarters the net proactive selling was 1,558 ETH. So while there are only 3 quarters of relevant post-Dencun data so far, I think we can conclude that Coinbase is not in the business of HODLing Base's ETH profits.”

Taking the average price in Q4 2024, using the quarter's open and close, this works out to approximately $37.68 million sold by Coinbase.

Ethereum's Decun upgrade went live in March of last year and significantly reduced the gas fees on layer-2 networks. Since then, the analyst believes, Coinbase has shown its intention to sell as part of a “normal risk adjusted decision process.”

A spokesperson for Coinbase told Decrypt that Base, ""earns ETH from sequencer fees, and the ETH we earn is primarily held for long term investment or used for operational expenses, including tax liabilities and reinvesting in growth via things like salaries, grants, acquisitions, and public goods funding.""

They added that, ""Separately, we also hold some ETH for long-term investment, and Coinbase reports our crypto assets specifically held for long -erm investment as part of our public quarterly earnings filing."" Citing the firm's 10K, the spokesperson noted that, ""crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term...we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them,"" adding that, ""Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024.""

In the Standard Chartered analyst's note from earlier in the week, he argued that making transactions via layer-2 networks negatively impacts the underlying blockchain because Ethereum receives less fees overall. In turn, this lowers the “GDP” of the Ethereum blockchain and the amount of gas fees it collects from transactions, meaning the Foundation mints more new coins to pay expenses.

Created by Coinbase, Base is a layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum that aims to help extend the capabilities of the underlying blockchain, as well as offering a bridge off of the popular centralized exchange.

The Standard Chartered analyst believes that looking at Coinbase's Ethereum holdings over the past three quarters reveals even more about its goals as a company.

“The fact they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick added.

Despite Standard Chartered's target price for Ethereum being slashed, the cryptocurrency is up 5.6% on the day and 4.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko, while Bitcoin has traded mostly flat during the same time.

As a result, over 70% of users on decentralized prediction market MYRIAD—launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN—believe that Ethereum's relative price to Bitcoin will be above $0.023 by the end of the week.

Global M2 money supply is at an all-time high — so why isn't Bitcoin surging? Is something broken, or is a delayed breakout coming?

Table of Contents

Markets are heading into the Federal Reserve's Mar. 18-19 meeting with mounting uncertainty as economic conditions remain volatile. Stock markets have stumbled, inflation remains persistent, and investors are reassessing their expectations for interest rate cuts.

Adding to the unpredictability, President Trump's tariff policies and federal layoffs have raised fresh concerns about the broader economic outlook, injecting further instability into an already fragile market.

Despite the turbulence, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25-4.5%, with CME Group's FedWatch tool assigning a 99% probability to no immediate adjustments.

However, the real focus is on the timing of the first rate cut. Current projections suggest a potential reduction in June, with a 55% chance that rates will move to 4-4.25%. 

Overall, investors anticipate a cumulative reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point in 2025, which could bring the Fed's benchmark rate down to 3.5-3.75%.

Amid this uncertainty, financial markets have responded sharply. The S&P 500 has dropped more than 8% from its Feb. 19 all-time high, while the Nasdaq plunged 4% on Mar. 10 — its worst trading day since 2022. 

Meanwhile, the volatility index has surged to its highest level since August, reflecting the difficulty investors face in maneuvering shifting policies, particularly Trump's tariff hikes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has also struggled to find its footing, remaining range-bound around $82,300 as of Mar. 18 — down nearly 25% from its all-time high of $109,114 in January.

The question now is: What comes next? How will markets react if the Fed signals a shift in policy? And what does all of this mean for crypto in the coming weeks?

Global liquidity is surging, and history suggests that risk assets like Bitcoin may soon react. As of Mar. 10, global M2 money supply reached an all-time high of $108.2 trillion, marking a 3.5% increase from its 2025 low of $104.5 trillion recorded on Jan. 6.

Yet, in this cycle, Bitcoin's price action has shown inconsistencies despite the rise in liquidity, raising questions about whether a delayed response is at play.

M2 money supply serves as a broad measure of global liquidity, encompassing cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money assets.

When M2 expands, liquidity typically finds its way into high-yielding investments, leading to rallies in stocks, commodities, and Bitcoin. Conversely, contractions in M2 often coincide with risk-off periods, where assets struggle to find upside momentum.

Keep an eye on changes in global liquidity – it's one of the most important long term factors driving Bitcoin.In fact, using data from 2013 to 2024, BTC has a 94% correlation with global M2. Now you know why so many people are begging for an end to QT & even a return of QE. pic.twitter.com/E27bkhS5Vx

A closer look at historical data highlights Bitcoin's strong correlation with M2 growth. Bitcoin's most significant bull runs have occurred during periods of rapid liquidity expansion, whereas downturns in M2 have preceded price declines or prolonged consolidations.

However, a key observation is that Bitcoin does not react immediately to liquidity surges. Research suggests an average lag of approximately 10 weeks before Bitcoin fully reflects changes in M2 growth.

The above M2 chart further supports this narrative. Bitcoin's recovery from its 2022-2023 lows coincided with a significant uptick in M2 growth. Similarly, in mid-2024, a renewed expansion in M2 was followed by Bitcoin reaching new highs.

However, in early 2025, Bitcoin entered a period of consolidation despite M2 continuing its ascent. The missing ingredient appears to be the rate of change in liquidity rather than its absolute level.

A deeper analysis of Bitcoin's year-on-year returns relative to the YoY change in M2 reveals a clearer pattern — Bitcoin's strongest bull runs tend to emerge when liquidity growth accelerates rapidly rather than when it remains steady.

Hence, mere liquidity expansion isn't enough to trigger a breakout — acceleration in M2 growth is the critical factor.

The Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) program, which has been running since June 2022, may be approaching its final stretch.

As of Mar. 18, over $6.2 million has been wagered on Polymarket, with traders assigning a 100% probability that the Fed will end QT by Apr. 30.

At its core, QT is the opposite of quantitative easing (QE). Instead of injecting liquidity into the system by purchasing bonds, the Fed has been allowing assets to mature off its balance sheet, effectively pulling money out of circulation.

This policy, alongside aggressive rate hikes, helped curb inflationary pressures but also created liquidity constraints that have weighed on markets. While stocks and crypto assets managed to rally despite QT's tightening effects, concerns have emerged that continued balance sheet reduction could drain liquidity at a time of rising economic uncertainty.

The minutes from the January FOMC meeting revealed that several policymakers were open to either slowing or pausing QT, largely due to uncertainties surrounding the federal debt ceiling and evolving money market conditions, Reuters reported.

Analysts note that the Treasury Department's extraordinary measures to keep government operations funded have been injecting temporary liquidity into the system. 

This has made it harder for the Fed to accurately assess true reserve levels, creating a risk that it could withdraw too much liquidity too quickly, increasing financial market volatility.

Despite rising expectations of a near-term end to QT, not all analysts agree on the timing.

Barclays maintains its projection that QT will conclude between September and October, arguing that pausing in March or May only to restart reductions later would be inefficient.

Meanwhile, Wrightson ICAP analysts believe the Fed is more likely to slow the pace of asset runoffs rather than halt them entirely, noting that a full stop could force the Fed to resume asset purchases later, creating communication challenges for policymakers.

Others, like research firm LH Meyer, caution that any pause in QT could risk turning into a full stop, as resuming the process later could prove difficult — especially if market conditions remain fragile.

The Fed's ability to gauge the right stopping point has been complicated by mixed signals from liquidity indicators.

A survey of major banks and money managers conducted before the last policy meeting suggested QT could conclude between June and July.

Fed holdings, which have already declined to $6.8 trillion from a peak of $9 trillion in 2022, are expected to fall further to around $6.4 trillion by the end of the process.

However, estimates suggest that bank reserves will only dip to $3.125 trillion from the current $3.3 trillion, while the Fed's reverse repo facility — a measure of excess liquidity — has remained below $100 billion throughout February, indicating that financial conditions may already be tighter than intended.

Historically, unwinding QT has been a delicate process, and if the Fed signals a stop in the coming months, it may effectively mark the end of the program.

If that happens, the implications could be broad—lower long-term interest rates, a weaker dollar, and potentially increased demand for risk assets like Bitcoin and equities.

While rising M2 money supply has been a strong precursor to Bitcoin bull runs, on-chain indicators and institutional developments suggest that the short-term outlook may not align with this trend just yet.

Despite global M2 reaching a record high, Bitcoin's price action has shown signs of exhaustion. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, warns that “every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” pointing to fresh liquidity drying up and new whales offloading BTC at lower prices.

His analysis, which applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to various metrics, suggests that Bitcoin's price may not immediately react to rising liquidity.

One of the key metrics is MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which compares Bitcoin's market value to the price at which coins last moved, helping to determine whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued.

Another critical metric is SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which measures whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a profit or a loss.

Additionally, NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) tracks the overall profitability of Bitcoin holders based on unrealized gains and losses across the network.

Based on these indicators, Bitcoin may be entering a 6–12 month consolidation phase — a pattern historically seen after major bull runs. 

If this holds true, Bitcoin's reaction to rising liquidity could be delayed rather than immediate, mirroring previous cycles where liquidity expansions took months to translate into bullish price action.

At the same time, institutional headwinds are mounting. The U.S. recently adopted a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, marking a key shift in how the government views Bitcoin as an asset.

However, this move has not been well received by global financial institutions. Max Keiser, a longtime Bitcoin advocate and senior Bitcoin advisor to El Salvador's government, notes that the IMF and credit rating agencies have begun lowering the U.S. credit rating, citing Bitcoin's “destabilizing influence.”

The IMF (and various credit rating agencies) are lowering US credit rating citing the destabilizing influence of Bitcoin. They recommend the US to immediately liquidate their BSR (Bitcoin Strategic Reserve).

Keiser adds that the IMF is now recommending the immediate liquidation of the BSR, raising concerns about potential political pressure on the U.S. Bitcoin holdings.

If the U.S. government begins selling its Bitcoin reserves under such pressures, it could introduce additional downward momentum, at least in the short term.

Investors should remain cautious of near-term volatility while closely monitoring liquidity trends and government actions. Bitcoin's movement in the coming months may require patience before the next major move takes shape. 

Trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

The crypto market remains in a downtrend. Its cap rose 0.2% over the past 24 hours to $2.72 trillion and generally remains in a very tight range with a short-term ceiling of $2.75 trillion. Just over a month ago, similar local resistance was half a trillion higher.

While almost all altcoins combined have been broadly stable at 30% market share since July 2023, Ethereum has been giving away its share since July 2024, falling to 8%, a five-year low. BTC's share has been growing for more than two years, reaching 60.7%. Interest from institutional traders and governments has so far not extended beyond the first cryptocurrency, which they see as a strategic reserve asset rather than the practicality offered by altcoins, including ETH.

Bitcoin reversed to the downside again on Tuesday, touching its 200-day average. Nevertheless, it gained around 2% from the start of the day to $83.3K on Wednesday. Ultimately, it is worth paying closer attention to the dynamics of the crypto market after the Fed's comments, as this could be the start of a longer trend.

Standard Chartered downgraded its 2025 Ethereum forecast from $10,000 to $4,000. One of the reasons is the growing influence of L2 solutions, especially the Base platform. The changes made to Ethereum in recent years, ""while perhaps necessary, have damaged its value"".

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is set to relax storage requirements for crypto assets. Current SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda has ordered a review of a proposal to tighten storage rules for cryptocurrencies.

The GMCI Meme Coin Index, tracked by The Block, is down 90% from its peak in December, indicating a cooling of interest in this type of risky asset.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $83,300 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing resistance around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,500 since last week, with a break above this level suggesting a potential recovery. 

XRP open interest and funding rates have remained largely negative in recent weeks. Investors remained calm despite the high bearish sentiment in the futures market, likely due to their large profits.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

 Investor sentiment hinges on the FOMC meeting and Fed Chair Powell's signals, which may sway Bitcoin's next price move, according to crypto analysts. 

Bitcoin may stage a recovery above the key $90,000 psychological mark amid easing monetary inflation concerns in the world's largest economy.

Bitcoin's (BTC) over-two-month downtrend has raised numerous alarms that the current Bitcoin bull cycle may be over, defying the theory of the four-year market cycle.

Despite widespread investor concerns, Bitcoin may be on track to a recovery above $90,000 due to easing inflation concerns in the United States, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research.

“We can see some counter-trend rally as prices are oversold, and there is a good chance that the Fed is mildly dovish,” Thielen told Cointelegraph, adding:

Investor confidence may also be improved by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments indicating that the Fed will “remain on hold amid rising uncertainty among households and businesses,” wrote 10x Research in a March 17 X post, adding:

Meanwhile, investors are eagerly awaiting today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting for cues on the Fed's monetary policy for the rest of 2025, a development that may impact investor appetite for risk assets such as Bitcoin.

Traders and investors will be watching for any hints about the ending of the Fed's quantitative easing (QT) program, “a move that could boost liquidity and risk assets,” according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at Nexo digital asset investment platform.

“The upcoming Fed decision could be a major catalyst for further movements,” the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“However, persistent inflation concerns or a reaffirmation of tight financial conditions, such as elevated interest rates or continued liquidity tightening, could limit upside potential,” added the analyst.

Markets are currently pricing in a 99% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Still, investors have slashed their exposure to US equities by the most on record by 40 percentage points between February and March, according to Bank of America's latest survey, raising concerns that recession fears may hurt Bitcoin's price action.

In this Sept. 9, 2014, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Faced with a federal judge's order to help investigators break into an iPhone allegedly used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters, Apple may well argue that the request would place an unreasonable burden on the company. In fact, doing what the government asks is not likely to be a tough technical feat for Apple. But doing so might have dramatic consequences on the data security of the millions of iPhone users around the world. 

 

A Pennsylvania House committee approved a consumer data privacy bill Tuesday that would set rules for how companies collect, store and sell individualized information from people's online activities. 

Though the bill, HB78, was approved unanimously, Republicans on the committee indicated there would likely be changes proposed to it before a final House vote. 

“I do think that there is a tension with this legislation,” said Rep. John Lawrence, R-Chester, the committee's minority chair. “Certainly, we don't want to see more onerous regulations on business, but we also want to respect the fact that people are entitled to be secure and safe with their own data privacy.” 



The bipartisan legislation, which follows an industry-friendly model enacted by 17 other states, was approved by the House last year but did not win Senate consideration before the end of the 2023-24 legislative session. 

California and Maryland are the only states with substantially more robust protections that put the onus on companies to limit the data they collect rather than on the consumer to manage their data with each company separately. Maryland also bans companies from sending targeted ads to minors. 

HB78's sponsors, Reps. Ed Neilson, D-Philadelphia, and Stephenie Scialabba, R-Butler, said they hope the bill moves quickly to avoid being delayed or tied up by the summer's budget negotiations. 

Regulating cryptocurrency transfers

Pennsylvania lawmakers are again trying to regulate transfers of virtual currency, which include cryptocurrencies. 

The House Commerce Committee considered HB881, which would require companies that transfer virtual currencies to obtain a license. Twenty-six states already regulate these transfers.

The bill passed out of the Commerce committee on a party-line vote Tuesday with Democrats for and Republicans against. 

Indira Ridgeway, the committee's executive director, answered questions from Republican lawmakers about whether people's individual virtual wallets would require licensure. 

“Self-hosted wallets would not be required to be licensed under the bill, only transmission of a third party for a fee would require licensure,” Ridgeway said, referring to guidance from the Department of Banking and Securities. 

Lawmakers indicated the bill was likely to face amendments before the vote on the House floor. 

A similar bill passed unanimously out of the Senate Banking & Insurance Committee on Feb. 3. The Senate also unanimously passed the legislation last in the session, but the proposals didn't make it out of the House by the end of 2024.

Cryptocurrency markets are seeing a significant surge, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all posting notable gains following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady.

Amid the announcement, Bitcoin was up 4% in the past day at $84K, News.Az reports, citing foreign media.

Ethereum has also gained 8%, trading at $2,034, while XRP is leading the surge after soaring 10% to $2.47 in the same period.

The central bank slashed growth expectations, while inflation forecasts have been revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from policymakers.

Additionally, the institution also announced plans to slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another layer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed's latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7% in 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.

Growth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed, reflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other global economic risks.

Oops, something went wrong

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech National Bank board member Jan Kubicek is ""sceptical"" about the inclusion of bitcoin among the bank's hefty reserves, wary of legal uncertainties and concerns around volatility of the digital currency.

CNB Governor Ales Michl put bitcoin up for consideration earlier this year, and the bank has begun an analysis looking into broadening the asset classes it holds in its reserves portfolio.

""We will assess different classes of assets. Bitcoin is just one of them,"" Kubicek said in an interview on Tuesday. ""My position is rather sceptical about bitcoin.""

He said bitcoin's legal status was one concern, and that direct ownership would mean developing many new processes in accounting or auditing, for example.

Volatility was another worry and assessing market price developments was difficult, he said.

""We cannot be certain that bitcoin's volatility in the coming years will mirror the patterns observed over the past decade because I suspect that, if more institutional investors accept bitcoin as an investment asset, it will start to behave differently from what we have seen so far.""

The bank's study on new asset classes could come by October, Kubicek said.

Holdings of international corporate bonds could be explored, he said, as well as the possibility of investing in more targeted equity indices, such as for technology, and property investment funds.

CNB Vice Governor Eva Zamrazilova has said bitcoin is not a suitable asset for reserves, while European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde has also said Europe's central banks are not the place for it.

The Czech central bank's reserves - at 142.8 billion euros ($155.75 billion) - are around 45% of gross domestic product, and it has diversified holdings in recent years, gradually purchasing gold, and shifting a larger portion of the portfolio into equities.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 12 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) stands against other best bitcoin stocks to invest in.

Bitcoin was the top-performing asset of 2024, driven by the launch of new ETFs and optimism about potential deregulation under a new US administration. However, the cryptocurrency remained volatile, with significant price swings throughout the year. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin had more than doubled in value from its starting price of around $40,000, reaching nearly $94,000, according to a report by CNBC. The most significant surge occurred in the weeks following the US presidential election. By mid-December, Bitcoin surpassed $108,000 for the first time, fueled by expectations that President Donald Trump's victory over former VP Kamala Harris would lead to clearer regulations and increased investment in the crypto space.

​​One of the main factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements is the halving mechanism, a fundamental feature of its network. Bitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism in the Bitcoin network that reduces the rewards miners receive for processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This event occurs roughly every four years, or after 210,000 blocks are mined, gradually slowing the introduction of new bitcoins into circulation. Its main purpose is to regulate Bitcoin's supply, ensuring it remains limited to a maximum of 21 million coins. Halving can influence Bitcoin's value by reducing the number of new coins entering the market. The first halving took place on November 28, 2012, cutting the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoins. This was followed by a significant price increase, a trend observed in later halvings. The most recent halving occurred on April 20, 2024, at block 740,000, reducing the reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, halvings have been linked to price increases as the reduced supply can boost demand. This scarcity strengthens Bitcoin's role as a digital store of value, often compared to gold. Additionally, market anticipation around halving events tends to drive investor interest and trading activity, further impacting Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin's growing influence is also reflected in broader financial markets and institutional investment trends. By the end of 2024, global investable assets surpassed $200 trillion, with cryptocurrencies accounting for over $3 trillion, or 1.5% of the market. Institutional investors increasingly embraced Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), with inflows surpassing $34 billion as Bitcoin gained wider acceptance in multi-asset portfolios. Bitcoin has solidified its status as both a benchmark for the crypto market and a measure of investor risk appetite. Its fixed supply and decentralized structure set it apart from traditional investments, making it an alternative growth asset in today's changing economic environment. This view is further supported by the US proposal to classify Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The proposal comes as the US faces rising debt and borrowing costs. President Trump's “America First” policies which combine tax cuts and tariffs could add to inflation concerns, which are already evident in bond markets, where 30-year yields neared 5% in early 2025.

Despite the cryptocurrency sector's volatility, some billionaire investors remain optimistic about its future. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of a leading business intelligence firm, was the top crypto billionaire gainer by percentage on Forbes‘ 2024 list. The software company he founded in the 1990s has since transformed into a major Bitcoin investment entity. By 2024, it held approximately 193,000 bitcoins, making it the largest corporate bitcoin holder globally, according to its CFO. Tech billionaire Mark Cuban is also investing in crypto. He believes its value could rise as adoption increases and it becomes more integrated into the global financial system. In fact, he has even speculated that it could one day replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.

To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of billionaires' stock holdings and picked the top 12 companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry with the highest number of billionaire investors in Q4 of 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Billionaire Investors: 3

Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT), a New York-based company, focuses on bitcoin mining, treasury management, digital asset staking, and Ethereum staking. It is one of the best bitcoin stocks to monitor. On February 10, the company announced a colocation agreement with a major AI hardware firm. The partnership will be managed through WhiteFiber, Inc., its rebranded high-performance computing division, which offers cloud services and operates the Enovum Data Centers platform.

In the third quarter of 2024, Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) reported a revenue of $22.7 million, a 96% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by contributions from its high-performance computing business, though partially offset by lower mining revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the company held approximately $106 million in cash and restricted cash, while its digital assets were valued at around $118 million. By the end of the third quarter, total assets stood at $376 million, with shareholders' equity reaching $315 million.

On January 21, Craig-Hallum began coverage of Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) with a Buy rating and a price target of $6. Analysts at the firm view Bit Digital as being in the early stages of a major transformation, one that could pave the way for a more stable and profitable business model.

Overall, BTBT ranks 11th on our list of the best bitcoin stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of BTBT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BTBT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

 Several crypto executives have told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is moving as expected given macro conditions, with the market just waiting for a new narrative. 

Bitcoin's correction from its January peak is a typical cycle pullback and is not out of the ordinary, with a price top still on the horizon, crypto analysts and executives tell Cointelegraph.

“I don't think the bull run is over; I think the peak of the cycle has been pushed back due to macro conditions, and global liquidity isn't pretty, which isn't helping crypto,” Collective Shift CEO Ben Simpson told Cointelegraph.

“It is only the third or fourth correction we've had over 25% we've had in Bitcoin this cycle compared to 12 last cycle,” Simpson said. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 24% from its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 amid uncertainty around US President Donald Trump's tariffs and the future of US interest rates, but Simpson called it “a normal correction.”

“Things got overheated, and they needed to cool down, and the market needed to find a new foundation, and now we're waiting for the next new narrative,” he said.

Derive founder Nick Forster shared a similar view, telling Cointelegraph that Bitcoin “is likely in a normal correction phase, with the cycle peak still to come.” 

“Historically, Bitcoin experiences these types of corrections during long-term rallies, and there's no reason to believe this time is different,” he said.

After Trump's election in November, Bitcoin surged almost 36% over a month, hitting $100,000 for the first time in December. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $82,824, according to CoinMarketCap.

However, Forster added that the six-month fate of Bitcoin seems increasingly tied to traditional markets. Similarly, Independent Reserve CEO Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph that it isn't just Bitcoin being impacted by the macroeconomic conditions.

“This is pervading all asset classes and may lead to a spike in global inflation and a contraction in international growth,” Przelozny said.

Forster said Bitcoin's current price trend aligns with past behavior before a price rally, even though it appears “tumultuous” at the moment.

Collective Shift's Simpson said the next narrative will likely revolve around US rate cuts, easing quantitative tightening, and increasing global liquidity.

However, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said he isn't so sure if the Bitcoin bull run is over or not.

The odds are “50:50, in my opinion,” Edwards told Cointelegraph.

“Yes, from an onchain perspective at present, but that could change quickly if the Fed starts easing in the second half of the year, stops balance sheet reduction, and dollar liquidity grows as a result, which I think has decent odds of happening,” Edwards explained.

The comments come a day after CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju declared that the “Bitcoin bull cycle is over.”

“Expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action,” Ju said.

The price of major cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTCUSD saw a sudden surge during today's trading session. What is interesting is that today is FOMC day, and the price of Bitcoin saw a sudden surge of optimism that pushed its price up by 1.5%. 

As a result, BTC is now trading back at $84,000, right where the 200-day moving average on the daily price chart of the largest cryptocurrency currently stretches.

This mention of the moving average is necessary to outline that the current price point for Bitcoin is very important, as the 200-day MA usually represents a crucial resistance and support level for the asset on any financial market. TradingView"">

Even though Bitcoin has soared, the key is that it has soared right up to an important resistance price point, which in fact currently serves as a ceiling for the major cryptocurrency, preventing it from further growth. 

You can see for yourself on the price chart that Bitcoin has tried to break above this curve several times in recent days, and its only success so far has been to print higher lows. 

Death cross threat for Bitcoin BTCUSD

Adding to the skepticism is an emerging death cross on the daily time frame for the BTC price chart. An ominous pattern is believed to precede a downtrend, and in this case, it is represented by the 23-day moving average crossing its 200-day counterpart from the upside to the downside. 

According to textbook technical analysis dogmas, this could mean that Bitcoin is poised for short-to-medium-term losses, and the fact that it is now trying to break through the important price resistance ideally fits into this outlook. 

Concluding all of these price chart indications of what the near future holds for Bitcoin, one could say that recent growth is nothing more than a bull trap, and if it is the rule of technical analysis, then BTC is more likely to dump than pump.

By Isabella Flores

Key Takeaways:

As investment products surrounding crypto-assets see a global surge and Japan embraces a new regulatory environment, South Korea is considering its next steps towards Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Now, South Korea is reportedly monitoring its neighbor closely. Traders speculate that Seoul is likely to follow Tokyo's decision on crypto ETFs.

Japan, which had been extremely skeptical of digital assets, is now contemplating a major policy overhaul. In February, Nikkei reported the FSA is considering designating cryptocurrencies as financial products alongside traditional securities, and possibly allow crypto ETFs.

News of the potential policy change is drawing attention across Asia. Japan's move is reportedly influencing South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which has shared its analysis of Japan's legislative trends on digital assets with relevant institutions in South Korea. This indicates a significant level of interest in Japan's policy changes. Given the close economic and financial ties between the two nations, it is not surprising that South Korea is closely monitoring Japan's next move. Historical patterns suggest that South Korea often aligns its financial policies with major regional players to ensure competitiveness and market stability.

Japan's talks are expected to drag into the first half of 2025 before a legislative plan is drafted and submitted to the National Assembly in 2026, but even the mention of them is enough to rouse debate in South Korea.

Amid the excitement, South Korea is keeping its guard up. “I have continued to say that I would carefully review (spot Bitcoin ETFs), and it is similar in the broader context. There are countries that have not yet introduced it. There are England and Japan,” Kim So-young, vice chairman of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, said after a virtual asset committee. Some nations, such as England and Japan, have yet to introduce this.

Of course, there's South Korea's track record with strict crypto regulations. In the meantime, last year, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) imposed restrictions on asset managers offering ETFs linked to crypto-related companies, such as Coinbase. This more cautious stance is somewhat in line with South Korea overall's outlook on cryptocurrency, which has seen both excitement from the public and skepticism from officialdom.



Regulatory headwinds in South Korea are still amajor hurdle. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju likened South Korea's cautious approach to crypto regulation to that of the US SEC, where Gary Gensler stalled the approval of crypto ETFs for a decade until 2024.

The government has thus to walk a tightrope between encouraging innovators and protecting asset owners, with more than 30% of South Korean citizens investing in crypto assets. While it offers potential risks, regulators are carefully evaluating the impact of a volatile crypto market.

The Financial Services Commission previously announced that the universities and charities will be able to sell cryptocurrency donations starting from the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was also served with a suspension notice for possible Know Your Customer violations. Upbit has apparently also lodged a complaint against South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit to rescind the business penalties. It illustrates an ongoing struggle to gain control of the industry.

To revive its capital markets, South Korea's Exchange Chairman, Eun-Bo Jeong, is keen on launching crypto-based ETFs this year.

South Korea's financial markets lagged global peers as the domestic economy was contracting and export growth had been slowing, Jeong pointed out. The soaring success of Bitcoin ETFs worldwide has led to a quest for solutions to these challenges, including cryptocurrency-based ETFs.

South Korea is at a crossroads. While pushing an ETF has proven to be an uphill battle, the global momentum behind Bitcoin ETFs and potential regulatory changes in Japan have pressured Seoul to reconsider its stance. It is worth noting just how influential other countries' decision-making processes are within the South Korean government. Other countries have significantly influenced various sectors of the South Korean economy. For instance, many believe that the early development of South Korea's auto industry was shaped by the American auto sector.

 To start accepting BTC payments, small businesses can use a crypto payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions and ensure compliance.  

And it's not just a rehash of old news. For years, you might have seen luxury brands like Gucci and telecommunications companies like AT&T accepting Bitcoin. But today, crypto payments are much more than an easy bit of PR — they're seamlessly integrating into e-commerce, hospitality, travel and even your neighborhood coffee shop.

What started as a niche trend in the early 2010s has accelerated over the years. As of 2025, over 659 million people worldwide — roughly 1 in 13 individuals — are using cryptocurrency. Moreover, approximately 15,000 businesses globally accept Bitcoin (BTC), including around 2,300 in the United States.



While there are considerations to keep in mind, many view accepting BTC and other cryptocurrencies, even as a small business, as a win-win. The benefits often outweigh any challenges, with minimal downsides and significant potential rewards.

The following sections explore the whos, the whys and the hows.

As briefly touched upon, it's not only niche crypto-specific sectors that are accepting Bitcoin payments. Here are some sectors that you might not have considered, with accompanying case studies.

Did you know? The first-ever real-world transaction using Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Today, those 10,000 BTC would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, making it one of the most expensive pizza orders in history. This event is now celebrated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day in the crypto community.

So, all the big brands are in. But what's driving this trend, and can small businesses benefit, too?

One of the most significant advantages is lower transaction fees. Traditional payment processors and credit card companies typically charge businesses between 2% and 4% per transaction, while crypto payment gateways often reduce this to less than 1%. For businesses processing high volumes of transactions, these savings can be substantial.

Another key factor is the ability to access a global market without the restrictions of currency exchange rates and international banking fees. Cryptocurrency payments enable seamless cross-border transactions, allowing businesses to serve international customers without friction. This is especially beneficial for industries like travel, luxury goods and digital services, where cross-border commerce is common.

Security and fraud prevention also play a role. Cryptocurrency transactions are final, eliminating chargebacks — something that costs businesses billions of dollars annually in fraudulent disputes. This makes crypto payments particularly appealing to merchants in industries where chargebacks are common, such as e-commerce and online services.

Did you know? In 2025, chargeback fraud, particularly friendly fraud, has become a significant concern for merchants. Notably, a recent survey revealed that 55% of Generation Z and 49% of Millennials earning over $100,000 annually admitted to engaging in digital shoplifting — a form of first-party fraud where consumers falsely claim issues with online orders to secure refunds or avoid payments. 

Additionally, businesses recognize that accepting cryptocurrency aligns with the preferences of a growing demographic of crypto users. Companies integrating crypto payments position themselves as forward-thinking and innovative, appealing to solvent, tech-savvy consumers who prefer digital transactions over traditional banking systems.

Finally, some businesses are drawn to the potential of holding crypto as an asset. While many use payment processors that instantly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency to avoid volatility, others see it as an opportunity to gain exposure to a growing asset class. With major corporations like Tesla and MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, smaller businesses are following suit, recognizing the potential long-term value.

Small businesses stand to benefit the most here, as accepting crypto payments is an easy way to carve out a niche for the brand, reaching far more customers than would be possible by offering only fiat payments. The strategy might well mean the difference between failure and success in a competitive startup environment.



Did you know? A survey by Deloitte found that 85% of merchants see crypto payments as a way to reach new customers.

While accepting crypto payments is often seen as a win-win, businesses must also be aware of potential risks in doing so on their own, without proper accounting systems and crypto processing partners.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are known for significant price fluctuations. For example, in early 2025, Bitcoin's price dropped from $109,071 to around $80,000 — a nearly 25% decline within a short period. Such volatility can impact the value of received payments if not promptly converted to stable currencies.

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies by jurisdiction and is continually evolving. For example, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, which introduces complexities in tax reporting and compliance. Businesses must stay informed about applicable regulations to ensure adherence to tax obligations and avoid potential legal issues.

Accepting cryptocurrencies necessitates the use of digital wallets and exchanges, which can be susceptible to cybersecurity threats.Without robust security measures, businesses risk unauthorized access and theft of digital assets. Implementing strong cybersecurity protocols is essential.

Integrating cryptocurrency payment systems requires technical knowledge that some small business owners may lack. Establishing digital wallets and navigating digital currency exchanges can be challenging, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies or errors. Investing in employee training or consulting with experts may be necessary to overcome these hurdles.

Despite growing adoption, cryptocurrencies are not universally accepted or understood. Some customers may be hesitant to use digital currencies due to concerns about security or unfamiliarity, potentially limiting the perceived benefits of offering crypto payment options. Businesses should assess their customer base to determine if accepting cryptocurrencies aligns with their clientele's preferences.

It's unlikely that, as a small business, you'll take this road alone — especially when leading crypto payment processors offer zero up-front integration costs:



The next section will explore a number of crypto processing providers that you may wish to choose from as a small business.

Founded in 2011, BitPay is a pioneering cryptocurrency payment processor. As of 2024, it holds a 6.26% market share in the Bitcoin payment processing sector, serving over 523 customers. 

BitPay caters to a diverse clientele, including retailers, investment banking firms, and nonprofit organizations. The company offers direct crypto-to-fiat settlements, helping businesses avoid volatility while ensuring seamless integration with existing accounting systems. 

Its security infrastructure includes two-factor authentication (2FA) and encrypted transactions, making it a trusted option for enterprises looking to accept cryptocurrency payments.

Established in 2014, CoinsPaid has grown into a comprehensive crypto payment gateway, processing over 41 million transactions worth 23 billion euros. The company facilitates approximately 8% of all onchain Bitcoin transactions, making it a major player in the crypto payments sector. 

Supporting over 30 cryptocurrencies, CoinsPaid serves industries such as IT, marketing, financial services, real estate and gambling. The platform offers a business wallet, an over-the-counter (OTC) desk for large-volume transactions and software-as-a-service solutions tailored for crypto integration. 

CoinsPaid is licensed in Estonia and complies with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations while undergoing regular independent security audits to maintain its reputation for secure and compliant processing.

Launched in 2018 by Coinbase, Coinbase Commerce enables merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet. It provides seamless integration with major e-commerce platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce, allowing businesses to accept ETH, Litecoin (LTC) and USDC (USDC). 

Notably, in February 2024, Coinbase Commerce ended support for Bitcoin and other unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based coins. To make Bitcoin payments, users will need a Coinbase account. The decision comes as Coinbase faces challenges in implementing updates to its Ethereum Virtual Machine payment protocol for Bitcoin.

While specific market share data is limited, Coinbase Commerce is widely used by small to mid-sized businesses across sectors such as computer software, utilities and telecommunications. 

The platform offers a straightforward setup with no transaction fees apart from standard network costs, making it an attractive option for businesses looking for a simple crypto payment solution without intermediaries.

Binance Pay, introduced by Binance, is a cryptocurrency payment solution that enables merchants and users to conduct transactions using various cryptocurrencies. It supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH and BNB (BNB), allowing for versatile payment options. 

The platform offers zero transaction fees for both merchants and users, making it an attractive option for businesses aiming to integrate crypto payments without incurring additional costs. Binance Pay also emphasizes security by incorporating features such as 2FA and encrypted transactions, ensuring safe and reliable payment processing.



Despite a run-in with the Lazarus Group last year, CoinsPaid continues to operate as a major crypto payment gateway, maintaining competitive setup costs and fees. As such, this section will walk you through the steps you'd be expected to take when integrating any crypto payment processor, using CoinsPaid's flow as an example.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate CoinsPaid into your business, offering your customers the option to pay with cryptocurrencies. 

With lower transaction fees, access to a global customer base and protection from chargebacks, crypto payments provide clear advantages over traditional payment methods.

The risks associated with crypto payments — such as volatility, regulatory compliance and security concerns — are easily mitigated by using a trusted payment processor like CoinsPaid, BitPay or Coinbase Commerce. These platforms handle everything from instant fiat conversion to security and compliance, making the transition to crypto seamless and low-risk.

With major brands already embracing digital currencies, there's no reason for small and medium-sized businesses to be left behind. Crypto payments are fast, borderless and cost-effective, making them a no-brainer for any forward-thinking business. 

Whether you're a startup looking to gain a competitive edge or an established company seeking new revenue streams, integrating cryptocurrency payments is an investment in the future.

North Carolina has joined over a dozen other states in pursuing the creation of a state Bitcoin reserve, introducing a bill on Tuesday to position the state as a “leader in state-level cryptocurrency adoption.”

Senate Bill 327 (SB327) calls for North Carolina's State Treasurer to allocate up to 10% of public funds to Bitcoin.

Introduced by Republican Senators Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash, and Timothy Moffitt—the bill envisions Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina's economic standing.

Under SB327, the Treasurer should ensure Bitcoin will be stored in multi-signature cold storage and subject to monthly audits for transparency and security.

The bill enforces strict controls on the use of Bitcoin, limiting liquidation only to instances of a “severe financial crisis” and requiring approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly for any sale.

It further mandates the creation of a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board, tasked with providing ongoing guidance on the reserve's management.

The three senators also included the possibility of Bitcoin mining operations in the bill as a way to increase the state's holdings at a lower cost.

Any sale of Bitcoin holdings will require the approval of at least two-thirds of both chambers of the General Assembly, says the bill.

SB327 authorizes the State Treasurer to engage in Bitcoin-backed investment strategies, including staking, lending, and other regulated yield-generating activities.

The introduction of SB327 is part of a larger push in North Carolina to incorporate crypto into state policy.

Alongside SB327, the state's lawmakers recently proposed House Bill 92 (HB 92), to allow the State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs).

HB92 proposes to allocate up to 10% of public funds and retirement systems into these ETPs, which must track digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $750 billion over the past twelve months, with the only asset fitting the criteria being Bitcoin.

The state-level push for Bitcoin as a reserve asset comes as President Donald Trump unveiled plans earlier this month for a national Bitcoin reserve, aiming to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world.”

Several states are already in the race, but a few others have rejected such proposals at the outset.

Arizona is currently one of the frontrunners in this movement, with three Bitcoin reserve bills under discussion.

On Tuesday, the state's Bitcoin 'Legal Tender' Bill SB1062 passed the House Commerce Committee by a vote of 6 - 4.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Senate Bill 21 (SB21) seeks to establish a state-managed investment fund dedicated to Bitcoin and other high-market-cap cryptos.

Utah was initially poised to become the first U.S. state to establish a Bitcoin reserve, but its bill, HB230, underwent significant amendments.

While the bill still provides protections for Bitcoin custody and mining, the provision for a state-managed Bitcoin reserve was removed in the final stages of the legislative process.

The bitcoin (BTC) price showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Wednesday, a decision that aligned with market expectations, as policymakers assessed the potential impact of U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump on Japan's export-driven economy.

The BOJ highlighted “high uncertainties” surrounding trade policies, with Governor Kazuo Ueda emphasizing the need to monitor how the tariff plans could ripple through global and Japanese markets.

The decision comes ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, where rates are also expected to remain steady as Trump's tariff policies loom large.

Japan's monetary policy and bond yields have often influenced BTC markets. A stronger yen and rising yields tend to weigh on bitcoin by attracting capital to traditional assets while a stable or weaker yen supports the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative store of value.

 That said, when the bank raised rates in January, the bitcoin price held steady because attention was focused on potential policy developments under Donald Trump's residency.

Wednesday's rate decision keeps Japanese bond yields in check, limiting pressure on bitcoin's price.

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal-Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin, Boxford Police said in a news release.

The adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors has accelerated in recent years, reshaping the financial landscape. Institutions, including banks, hedge funds, and asset managers, are engaging in crypto institutional lending, a process where institutions lend out their idle crypto assets through specialized platforms to earn interest, facilitating liquidity and capital efficiency in the market. This enables capital efficiency, liquidity provisioning, and yield generation. Alongside lending, they are also participating in trading and custody services. This shift is driven by various factors, such as regulatory clarity, market maturity, and technological advancements.

One of the catalysts for institutions' adoption of digital asset is the establishment of clear regulatory guidelines. Governments and financial authorities worldwide are developing frameworks that facilitate compliance and risk management. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Union's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations aim to provide legal clarity, reducing uncertainties for institutional investors. Regulatory compliance in crypto ensures transparency, security, and legitimacy, encouraging large-scale participation.

The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, offering institutions robust trading platforms, liquidity solutions, and reliable price discovery mechanisms. The emergence of crypto institutional trading platforms provides secure and regulated environments for institutional investors to engage in digital asset markets. Moreover, enhanced liquidity and sophisticated risk management tools have reduced volatility concerns, making crypto a more attractive asset class.

A key barrier to institutional investment in crypto has been the security of digital assets. The development of institutional-grade custody services, provided by reliable firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, has significantly reduced these risks. These solutions offer secure, insured, and compliant storage for digital assets, allowing institutions to manage large crypto holdings safely.

Traditional banks have started integrating blockchain technology for institutions, leveraging its benefits for efficiency, security, and cost reduction. Some notable examples include:

The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions has facilitated institutional access to cryptocurrencies without requiring direct ownership. These financial instruments have bolstered crypto market growth, attracting institutional investors looking for regulated and easily accessible investment tools.

As mentioned earlier, secure custody solutions tailored for institutions have significantly improved the landscape. By addressing security concerns, these custody services have enabled hedge funds, asset managers, and banks to participate in the crypto space more confidently.

The tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, stocks, and bonds, is revolutionizing financial markets. By leveraging enterprise blockchain solutions, institutions can enhance liquidity, reduce settlement times, and provide fractional ownership opportunities. Companies like BlackRock and HSBC are exploring tokenization to improve efficiency and accessibility in traditional finance.

The rise of decentralized finance solutions for institutions, increasing corporate treasuries' crypto allocations, and partnerships between fintech firms and traditional banks indicate a strong institutional commitment to the crypto ecosystem. These institutional crypto trends highlight the continued integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.","{'href': 'https://www.finance-monthly.com', 'title': 'Finance Monthly'}"

A Bitcoin bill has been presented to the Minnesota state senate that proposes allowing investments in Bitcoin and promotes cryptocurrency use in certain areas.

In a March 18 statement, Senator Jeremy Miller, who introduced the bill, said the Minnesota Bitcoin Act (SF2661) aims to modernize the state's financial landscape and position Minnesota as a leader in digital assets.

Under SF 26661, the Minnesota State Board of Investment would be allowed to allocate state funds to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, treating them similarly to traditional investments like stocks and bonds.

Further, state employees will have the option to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their retirement plans.

The legislation would also allow residents to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin, following in the footsteps of states like Colorado and Utah. 

Additionally, the bill includes tax incentives for cryptocurrency earnings, allowing certain gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be subtracted from taxable income.

“I believe global digital currencies are here to stay, and it's inevitable that they become more and more mainstream,” Miller said.

According to him, cryptocurrencies would benefit Minnesota by providing “new financial opportunities” and giving the state a “strategic position to take advantage of being on the forefront of this digital revolution.

“Crypto is a versatile digital asset that can be used in multiple ways, including as investments, global currency, or a hedge against inflation,” he added.

Minnesota follows over a dozen other U.S. states that are mulling state cryptocurrency investments. Some states like Arizona and Texas have introduced multiple bills.

On March 11, Texas state lawmakers presented House Bill 4258, which allows Texas' chief accountant and financial watchdog to invest up to $250 million of the state's economic stabilization fund balance in Bitcoin or other kinds of crypto assets.

The following day, Senator Cynthia Lummis presented an updated version of her July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which allows the government to hold more than 1 million Bitcoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news","Minnesota senator proposes Bitcoin Act after going from skeptic to believer","https://cointelegraph.com/news/minnesota-senator-miller-bitcoin-act-skeptic-to-believer","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:53:04 GMT","

 Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller has made his state the latest to float investing in Bitcoin after he went “from being highly skeptical” to a crypto believer. 

Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller has introduced the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, which he drafted after completely changing his stance on Bitcoin.

“As I do more research on cryptocurrency and hear from more and more constituents, I've gone from being highly skeptical to learning more about it, to believing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Miller said in a March 18 statement.

Miller said the bill aims to “promote prosperity” for Minnesotans by allowing the Minnesota State Board of Investment to invest state assets in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, just as it invests in traditional assets.

Several other US states have introduced similar Bitcoin-buying bills, with 23 states having introduced legislation to create a Bitcoin reserve, according to Bitcoin Laws.

A total of 39 different bills related to state investments in Bitcoin have been introduced across 23 US states. Source: Bitcoin Laws

Under Miller's bill, Minnesota state employees would be able to add Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their retirement accounts.

It would also give residents the option to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin. Colorado and Utah already accept crypto for tax payments, while Louisiana allows it for state services.

Investment gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would also be exempt from state income taxes. In the US, up to $10,000 paid to the state can be deducted from federal taxes under the state and local tax deduction, but any amount beyond that is subject to both state and federal tax obligations.

The increasing number of US states proposing Bitcoin reserve bills follows Senator Cynthia Lummis' July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which directs the federal government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years, totaling 1 million Bitcoin.

However, on March 12, Lummis proposed a newly reintroduced BITCOIN Act, allowing the government to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin as part of its newly established reserve.

Bitcoin has shown significant gains compared to traditional assets in recent years. From August 2011 to January 2025, Bitcoin posted a compound annual growth rate of 102.36%, compared to the S&P 500's 14.83%, according to Curvo data.

Key Points

If you're patient enough, it's feasible to set and forget your investment in Bitcoin (BTC 4.14%), though it's probably a better idea to pay attention to it from time to time than it is to fully zone out.

There's quite a lot going on with this coin at the moment, between new government policies, deepening integrations with the traditional financial sector, geopolitical intrigue, and the continuing global adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. That means investors are exposed to opportunities for profit, as well as to pitfalls -- and panic-selling isn't the only pitfall to be concerned about here. There's one mistake in particular that's especially appealing to make these days, so let's examine it and make sure you aren't at risk.

Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a powerful motivation for investors, especially in cryptocurrency. When you see an asset's price rise day over day, or even hour over hour, it's enormously tempting to smash a big wad of your cash into a new investment so that you capture the upside of the move rather than being left behind.

Short-term and highly emotional thinking like that is usually a mistake. With Bitcoin, buying on a whim is an understandable mistake to make, as a handful of significant catalysts are playing out, and more could be on the way.

The U.S. government is, at least for the moment, pursuing the formation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), and, per the president, the country will be oriented toward holding its coins rather than selling them, though that could easily change in the future. As the details of how the SBR will be implemented trickle out, assuming it is ever actually created, the coin's price may rise. More importantly, other countries may opt to follow the same path, forming repositories of the coin that they intend to retain indefinitely. It's easy for investors to jump at speculation on that front and buy a lot of Bitcoin, even if they're ultimately proven to be false or ungrounded.

Another tantalizing trend is tokenizing, tracking, and trading real-world assets (RWA) on Bitcoin's chain. That's doubtlessly exciting because it means it's possible to create records of ownership that will live on the blockchain. But it isn't an urgent reason to buy the coin.

There is simply no rush for any investor to accumulate Bitcoin, even given that it's a high-quality asset that's worth buying and holding a lot of. There is no new policy, new buyer, new feature, or other new thing that demands your dollars to be invested before or within any specific period. Committing too much of your capital in a lump-sum investment might leave you underwater for years if the price declines.

In fact, the coin's core supply dynamics, wherein it becomes scarcer and more difficult to mine over the long term, only suggest that it's better to buy the coin sooner rather than later in the grand scheme of things, not that you need to buy it soon to capture some kind of rapidly eroding upside. Nor do Bitcoin's supply dynamics guarantee that its price will actually go up at all over any period, especially not over the short term. The upside is the greatest for those who invest and hold it for the longest, not for those who took on the biggest amount of financial risk at the moment of their purchase.

So, don't over-commit. Don't be cajoled by investing more than you'd normally be comfortable with to chase the returns supposedly offered by the coin's many new happenings over the next few months. Resolve to allocate up to 5% of your portfolio's total value to buying it, and then dollar-cost average (DCA) your funds slowly but surely until your position reaches your target size. Don't be afraid to rebalance your position by selling some of your coins if you end up taking on more risk than you initially intended.

The DCA strategy isn't going to give you an emotional rush like buying a lot of Bitcoin all in one day will do. Nor will it give you the same upside as if you happened to time the market correctly, which isn't possible to do reliably anyway.

What it gets you is a much higher probability of winning the long game, when the coin's supply will become more and more constrained, and when late buyers will be realizing its upward trajectory over the long term and over-investing in an ill-advised attempt to catch up. At that point, you'll likely be sitting pretty, so don't worry too much about whether you buy Bitcoin today or a few months from now.

The Bitcoin price was placid early Wednesday after the Bank of Japan decided ""by unanimous vote"" to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.5%.  Now, traders are waiting to see if the Federal Reserve will do the same.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver his remarks today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin had gained 1.7% on the day and was changing hands for roughly $83,765, according to CoinGecko data.

But it's still the case that not much BTC is changing hands at all. Trading volume over the past 24 hours was $25 billion—a far cry from the $42 billion daily volume average it saw last week.

Users of decentralized prediction market MYRIAD, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are confident that Bitcoin will manage to maintain this price level through the weekend—with over 68% expecting that Bitcoin will still be above $83,000 by the end of the week, up from 52% at the start of the day.

Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has lost 2 points since yesterday, leaving it stuck in ""Fear."" It had been coasting along in ""Neutral"" territory as recently as last month. Since the start of the year, the index—which ranges from 0 for extreme fear to 100 for extreme greed—has reached as high as 84 two days after President Donald Trump's inauguration. But it's experienced a bumpy descent since then as geopolitical tensions and global trade tirades have plagued markets.

Traders are waiting to see whether Powell will offer any hope of a rate cut later this year. They seem to have already given up hope that he will announce a surprise rate cut later today, with 99% of traders expecting the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

But BRN analyst Valentin Fournier thinks they're looking to DC for a different reason—and perhaps, with more optimism.

""The dominant narrative driving this cycle is Bitcoin accumulation at a national level,"" he wrote in a market note Wednesday. ""While immediate actions are awaited, their potential impact is expected to be sudden and significant.""

This comes after Bo Hines, executive director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, told several participants at a closed-door roundtable hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute on last week that the White House is intent on acquiring as much Bitcoin as it can.

Oops, something went wrong

Ahead of a much-anticipated phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's president Vladimir Putin, Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) price action remains closely tied to the outcome of a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.

What Happened: According to Polymarket data, a ceasefire in Ukraine has a 61% chance of being announced until July and a 76% chance of being announced until the end of the year.

Vladimir Putin has signaled openness to the idea of a 30-day ceasefire, but voiced conditions that would first have to be fulfilled.

The outcome of ceasefire negotiations could have a significant impact on Bitcoin:

A successful ceasefire might stabilize global markets, boosting investor confidence and driving Bitcoin higher.

If sanctions on Russia are eased, Russia's need for Bitcoin in trade might decrease, potentially reducing demand and exerting downward pressure on price.

A failed agreement could increase volatility, with additional sanctions potentially pushing Russia toward greater Bitcoin adoption while dampening broader market sentiment.

An escalation might trigger risk-aversion among investors, leading to sell-offs in Bitcoin, as seen during the initial stages of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, when Bitcoin prices dropped below $40,000.

Thus, the impact on Bitcoin demand remains mixed.

What's Next: Market observers will be closely watching the outcome of the Trump-Putin negotiation call, as it could significantly impact Bitcoin's price action and broader market sentiment.

If geopolitical tensions ease, Bitcoin could find a strong bid from institutional investors, while continued uncertainty may heighten short-term volatility.

While the likelihood of a ceasefire remains uncertain, its potential market effects underscore Bitcoin's evolving role in the global financial landscape.

The tennis world now looks somewhat different since the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

For the better part of two decades the pair's rivalry and sustained excellence captivated millions of fans and took the game to new heights.

The pair pushed one another to raise their games and having a solid friendship despite their fierce rivalry was something to behold.

Since November 2024 the ATP Tour has been without both players and the World Number 15 Grigor Dimitrov explains why it feels different.

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, along with Novak Djokovic, dominated tennis perhaps longer than any other players before them.

They broke numerous records and provided fans with plenty of spectacular moments that will live long in the memory.

But since two members of the iconic trio have hung up her rackets, the game has had to adjust without them, and Dimitrov explains what that process looks like and how the tour is now different. 

“For me it's just different. I remember playing Berdych first round, Ferrer [second] round, to play you [Del Potro], Roger, Rafa and someone else in the final. Superman could not do that,” Dimitrov said during a Lacoste roundtable discussion on YouTube.

“So that whole part there were more steadier players, I think the gaps are bigger now in my opinion. Overall I guess I am saying is that the ball park of how everyone is, the gaps [are bigger].

“The aura was also very different, not only from these guys, but the guys who were seven, eight, nine,10, 11. They were players who it requires from you to do well. But I feel like the gaps are way different.

“Of course, the young generation are faster and stronger. I even remember back in the day when I got to the quarters of the Masters it was a huge thing.

“Now you have bigger gaps because the consistency isn't the same. But for me the different part is how different the game that everyone has is, I like that a lot as well.”

Dimitrov struggled against both Federer and Nadal during their illustrious careers.

Between 2009 and 2021, the Bulgarian played against the 14-time French Open winner on 15 occasions, and claimed just one victory.

That came at the 2016 China Open, when Dimitrov beat Nadal 6-2, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals.

Between 2013 and 2019, Dimitrov, who was nicknamed ‘Baby Fed' early in his career due to his playing style mimicking the Swiss Maestro, played Federer eight times.

Federer won seven successive matches, until Dimitrov claimed victory in their final meeting at the 2019 US Open, which went to five sets.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Eliot Spizzirri felt completely empty. The dream that he and his University of Texas teammates had poured their hearts and souls into — winning a national championship — was dashed by their in-state rivals, TCU, in a narrow 4-3 battle last May. Spizzirri knew there would not be another chance to capture that elusive title.



It was a painful defeat, but nearly a year later, and the 23-year-old recognises that moment as a profound shift in perspective. Often, the toughest lessons in life teach us the most, and Spizzirri's pivotal moment came at a crucial time, just before launching his pro career.



Spizzirri recalls a lightbulb moment a week after the heartbreaking loss. Sharing a laugh with friends while golfing helped him see beyond forehands and backhands, wins and losses.



“It was like, ‘Wow, I'm still a happy guy. Yeah, I lost a national championship and that's what I wanted so bad… My results in tennis, of course I care about them and they're important, but at the same time, it's not everything',” Spizzirri told ATPTour.com at last week's Phoenix Challenger.



“I think maybe before having such a crushing moment or maybe even a defining moment, I was sort of too intense or taking things too seriously and now I just try to enjoy it and make sure that I don't judge myself based on my tennis results. I feel like I'm more than someone that just plays tennis and can have a bigger impact down the road.”





Since finishing a standout collegiate career for the Texas Longhorns, the American has surged from No. 738 to a career-high No. 134 in the PIF ATP Rankings in just 10 months. 



Spizzirri, who finished back-to-back seasons as the No. 1 player in the ITA singles rankings, will next make his ATP Masters 1000 debut as a wild card at the Miami Open presented by Itau. It is another milestone moment in what has been a whirlwind 12 months.



“I feel like I've learned more about myself in the past 12 months than in my previous entire tennis career,” Spizzirri said. “There's been a lot of crazy times in the past 12 months, but to sum it up, I've learned a lot.

 

“And in another way, I've enjoyed it a lot. It goes hand in hand, if you're enjoying the week to week journey and not focussed as much on the results, just enjoy playing pro tennis and living out my dream, then good things will happen.”



The sting of the national championship loss to TCU still lingers, but it ultimately reshaped Spizzirri's outlook on the game.





“I have come to terms with winning and losing is not everything,” said Spizzirri. “I would have preferred to learn it at a different time, maybe at a time when losing was something that just I had to handle, not a group of 14 of my best friends and coaches that I've been working with for four and a half years and care about deeply.



“But I think moments like that in life, big moments, big challenges can steer you in two ways, either learn from it or dwell on it and I choose to learn from those opportunities.”



The difficult lesson has already paid dividends this season. In January, Spizzirri was on the brink of winning his first ATP Challenger Tour title in Cleveland, but let slip a championship point to Colton Smith, a senior at the University of Arizona.



Exactly a month later, Spizzirri relished his milestone moment, capturing his maiden Challenger title at the San Diego Open. Sitting courtside was a mix of Spizzirri's supporters, teammates and friends, including Topper Guild, a YouTuber who boasts nearly 60 million subscribers. Guild drove from Los Angeles to watch Spizzirri.



“He's my godmother's stepson, he kind of feels like a cousin,” Spizzirri said. “He inspires me and I hope that I inspire him in different ways. It's fun to see each other grow in different realms. I'm just so happy for a guy like him to have the success he's had. He's someone that works as hard as I've seen and deserves everything that comes his way.”

Spizzirri is not the only one in his family celebrating recent victories. His twin brother, Nicholas Spizzirri, played a key role in helping the University of Pennsylvania defend their squash national championship this month.

While Nicholas continues to shine in the world of college squash and has aspirations of making the 2028 Olympics team, Eliot has been making strides of his own.

“I just feel like in general, since May I feel like I've learned a lot just being a pro and what it takes from week to week. I've learned a lot about myself, about my identity as a player, what I feel like helps me perform at my best level,” said the Greenwich, Connecticut native. “But above all, it's been really enjoyable and fun.”

Britain's No 2 put in a clean, composed display in Miami to roll into the second round 

Emma Raducanu enjoyed a dream start to her Miami Open with a composed 6-2, 6-1 win over Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii.

The British No 2 lost in the first round of Indian Wells earlier this month in her first match since a traumatic incident dealing with a stalker at a tournament in Dubai, who had followed her to three events across the Asian hard-court swing. 

She fell to a 6-3, 6-2 loss to Moyuka Uchijima and said she would aim to “improve everything” ahead of her appearance in Miami, which forms the second half of the ‘Sunshine Double' of combined ATP and WTA 1000 tournaments along with Indian Wells.

And improve everything she did, producing a brilliant serving performance and staying firmly in control of the match despite a wobble against Ishii in the early stages of the first set. Ishii, who is ranked 188th in the world, was let down by a litany of unforced errors and struggled to find consistency, although her powerful ball-striking occasionally troubled Raducanu in the first set.

The Brit moved up a gear however and steamrolled through the second to set up a stern second-round test against American 10th seed Emma Navarro. 

Relive all the action with The Independent's liveblog:

More from Raducanu as she chats to ex-pro and now Sky Sports pundit Laura Robson courtside.

“I think I was just so focused on every point and trying to compete, that was my main objective today, bringing some energy, bringing some competitiveness,” she tells Robson. “I think that's been missing the last couple of months so I'm proud of that.

“Especially today, my opponent, she loves big ball-striking, so that wouldn't have been the best way to play her. I got some success early on with [the slice], I'm pretty happy with how I played the match tactically.

“I think it is deceiving how hard she hits the backhand especially, she can do a lot with the ball, a lot of variety. I think in a way we're similar in terms of our build and our game. [It's] one that I don't have pressure on.

“Go Boults!” she adds, with Katie Boulter set to take on American Peyton Stearns later today. 

“I'm very pleased to have got through that, it's not an easy first round, playing someone a bit younger, dangerous and in good form,” she tells Sky Sports. “It hasn't been easy for me coming into this but I think I put out a good performance.

On her second round against Emma Navarro, she says, “It's going to be an extremely challenging match, she's probably in better form so I think I can just go out, try and express myself and compete for every point. 

“It's really nice [in Miami], I haven't won a match yet here in my professional career but I have great memories from playing junior Orange Bowl. It's a little bit different now!”

“Keep keeping on”, a smiling Raducanu writes on the lens in the now-traditional sign-off at the end of a match.

It's a muted celebration as she waves to the crowd, and she may have half an eye on her second-round match: a tough test against eighth seed and in-form American, Emma Navarro. 

Just as I say how great Raducanu's serve has been, her first serve disappears in this game.

But no matter, as another Ishii error - how else - brings an end to this match, with the wildcard firing long. 

A solid, composed performance by Raducanu. 

Another thumping unreturnable serve by Raducanu and Ishii can only net. The Brit's serve has been pretty immaculate in this match. 

But she puts a fraction too much on the ball in the next rally and leaves the door open for Ishii, 15-30. 

Ishii has a golden opportunity for break point but sends a forehand down into the net and looks visibly peeved, rolling her eyes at herself. A second serve return is even worse, launched way beyond the baseline, and Raducanu has match point.

Raducanu nets to give Ishii game point and then whacks a down-the-line return on a second serve just long to allow the 19-year-old on the board in this second set. 

Ishii is yet to get on the board in this set but things look more promising as she gets to 30-15.

But Raducanu is fully in control of the next point, pushing Ishii out wide and redirecting the ball smartly into the opposite corner for 30-30. 

Ishii has a chance to avoid a bagel but can't get the right angle on a difficult Raducanu slice, hitting tamely into the net for deuce. 

Ishii smacks a ball in frustration as she goes 30-0 down. Raducanu by contrast looks entirely composed and fires down another ace. 

She follows it up with a double fault and then goes long for 40-30, but another unreturnable serve swiftly gets her out of trouble.

Nine games in a row for Raducanu. 

Better from Ishii as she forces the error from Raducanu, outlasting her in a longer rally. 

Another wild, looping backhand from Raducanu and she opens the door for Ishii to get on the board in this set.

But the Japanese player has no luck, spraying another three balls wide for 30-40, and is staring down the barrel of a double break. Long again from Ishii and from 30-0 up, she's now down 4-0 in this set.

Raducanu is in full flow now, sending Ishii scrambling all over the court and finishing off a point with a neat volley with her opponent marooned at the baseline.

She's rapidly 40-0 up and another unforced error by Ishii means she's got a mountain to climb from here.

The victory was Emma Raducanu's first win as a professional in Miami

Emma Raducanu breezed into the second round of the Miami Open with a commanding straight-set win against Japanese teenager Sayaka Ishii.

The British number two took just over an hour to progress 6-2 6-1 and will next face American eighth seed Emma Navarro.

Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, lost in the first round of Indian Wells earlier this month in what was her first match since the traumatic experience of dealing with a stalker at a tournament in Dubai.

This was supposed to be her first full event with new coach Vladimir Platenik but the Slovakian was not on court for her match.

""I am really proud of how I competed. It hasn't been easy for me coming into this but I feel I put in a good performance,"" said Raducanu.

""I hadn't won a match here before in my professional career. I am just so happy to now be able to score a win.""

There was a little hesitancy early on from Raducanu but she broke her opponent at the first time of asking and became stronger from then on.

Unforced errors also did not help Ishii's cause, with the 19-year-old making 12 compared to six for Raducanu in the first set.

By then the damage was done and Raducanu made light work of her opponent, winning the next five games in a row before serving to seal the second set 6-1.

Great Britain's Emma Raducanu cruised to a 6-2 6-1 victory over Japan's wildcard Sayaka Ishii in the first round of the Miami Open on Wednesday.

Raducanu started fast by claiming the opening two games before Ishii found her rhythm and levelled at 2-2 but the Brit reeled off four successive games to take the first set 6-2.

The 2021 US Open champion continued her dominance in the second set, extending her streak of successive games won to nine as her 19-year-old Japanese opponent, ranked 188th in the world, struggled in the Florida sun.

Ishii avoided a whitewash in the second set by holding serve in the sixth game before Raducanu took her first match-point opportunity to claim victory in one hour and five minutes.

It is Raducanu's first victory in Miami and she will face the tournament's eighth seed Emma Navarro in the second round.

Raducanu's win over Ishii saw her improve on disappointment at Indian Wells in her previous tournament appearance, a first-round straight-sets defeat by Moyuka Uchijima.

Australian tennis player John-Patrick Smith was forced to have “a copious amount of his blood” drawn on the eve of an Australian Open match, it has been revealed in an explosive legal action launched by players, including Nick Kyrgios, against tennis' controlling bodies.

The Professional Tennis Players Association, which was co-founded by 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic, has lodged lawsuits accusing the sport's authorities of operating like an illegal cartel that colluded to suppress player earnings and disregarded player welfare.

Smith, a doubles specialist who was a finalist in this year's Australian Open mixed doubles event with compatriot Kimberly Birrell, is one of three individually named Australian plaintiffs in a US class action with Kyrgios and Anastasia Rodionova.

The 36-year-old is also used as a case study in documents filed with the US District Court Southern District of New York, with his globetrotting season in 2024 detailed to demonstrate a gruelling and unsustainable schedule faced by players.

Concerns were also raised about the circumstances of a drug test he was subjected to before he played at the Australian Open.

According to court documents, the left-hander was approached by investigators from the International Tennis Integrity Agency on the day before his opening match and required to provide a blood sample.

“Smith was given no reason for the sudden test,” the US court filing said. “Smith was forced to draw a copious amount of his blood, draining him of energy less than 24 hours before he was to begin playing in one of the biggest tournaments of his season.”

Smith was contacted for comment on Wednesday.

The plaintiffs also objected to a drug test that Czech teenager Jakub Mensik had to take midway through a match at the ATP Finals in December that he ended up losing.

The ITIA is listed as a defendant along with the ATP and WTA tours and the International Tennis Federation in antitrust suits filed in the US, United Kingdom and European Union, and came under fire for its anti-corruption and anti-doping processes.

“The ITIA's aggressive, unrelenting, and, at times, illegal investigative processes subject players to dozens of drug tests (both blood and urine), invasive searches of their personal cell phones, hours-long interrogations without counsel, and harassment by unaccountable and ill-trained investigators,” the US action claims.

The ITIA responded in a statement on Wednesday. “Credible international sport requires robust anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, and we are proud of our role in contributing to a clean and fair sport,” it said.

The lawsuit also takes aim at the handling of a doping case involving men's world No.1 and Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who had twice tested positive last year to traces of the prohibited substance clostebol.

The Italian told investigators his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara, had accidentally applied the steroid to his skin while massaging him after Ferrara had used a cream to treat a cut on his own hand.

Sinner was not suspended after an independent tribunal found he bore “no fault or negligence” and let him compete in the US Open, which he won. The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but last month agreed to a deal in which Sinner would serve three months on the sidelines before the French Open after accepting his explanation.

Kyrgios had been scathing of the leniency shown to Sinner and described the penalty as a “sad day for tennis”.

The class action claimed the Sinner affair showed the ITIA's heavy-handed approach was arbitrary and selective.

“There was no investigation that dragged for over a year into a prominent player who had not vocalised any issues with the cartel,” it was stated in the US court documents.

Djokovic himself was not listed as one of the 12 individual plaintiffs in the US but the players association he formed said the action was being taken to tackle a “corrupt” system in which the earnings of the stars were restricted, leading them to be paid far less than top athletes in sports such as American football, basketball and golf.

The ATP and WTA said they rejected the PTPA's claims and would defend their positions vigorously.

“ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game – towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans,” the ATP said.

The WTA said it was “fully committed to continuing to develop and evolve the structure and operations of professional women's tennis, listening closely as always to the views of our players”.

Tennis Australia, which manages the first major of the year, was not named as a co-defendant, but it was alleged players had been forced to play in excessive heat at the Australian Open, placing them “at risk of heat stroke and other harms”.

Matches stretching beyond midnight at the US Open and Australian Open were also raised as a welfare issue by Professional Tennis Players Association executive director Ahmad Nassar. Lleyton Hewitt famously took until 4.34am to finish off Marcos Baghdatis in a five-set thriller at Melbourne Park in 2008.

“I think that's a huge issue for the players because of the health effects of not only playing late into the night and early into the morning, but also actually waiting all day to play ... there is a much higher rate of getting injured,” Nassar told this masthead.

“There has to be a better system than going til 2am, 3am. There is no magic time … but I think we need to have something better than what we currently have, which is just kind of the show must go on.”

The legal bombshell does not question the Australian Open's spot in the tennis calendar. Nassar said most players liked starting the season in Australia and it was the seemingly “never-ending season” running until late in the year that was most problematic.

To address weather conditions, Tennis Australia has brought in a heat stress index and there are now three retractable roofs at Melbourne Park.

There were also changes made at this year's Australian Open to the number of matches in each session and to start times with an eye towards avoiding matches finishing too late.

The PTPA accuses the ATP, WTA, ITF and the ITIA of exploiting tennis players and jeopardising their health and safety.

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.

The PTPA, an independent players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action to end “monopolistic control” of the sport.

It said in a statement that, along with more than a dozen players, the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

“Tennis is broken,” Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the PTPA, said in the statement. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

“We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

In response, the ATP accused the PTPA of choosing “division and distraction” and having no meaningful role in the sport.

“We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,” the ATP said in a statement.

“ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game – towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for players, tournaments, and fans.”

The WTA defended its record of growing women's tennis, describing the lawsuit as “baseless”.

“Every decision taken at the WTA Board level includes the input of players via their elected Board representatives, and athletes receive substantial financial rewards and other benefits from participation in the WTA,” the organisation said.

Today marks a pivotal moment in the battle for fairness and integrity in tennis. I take pride in standing alongside a group of fellow players, both men and women, as one of the named plaintiffs in a comprehensive lawsuit targeting the ATP and WTA Tours, the ITIA, and the ITF.

Meanwhile, Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios believes the lawsuit marks a “special moment” and that it was high time players' voices were heard.

Former Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios, who is among 12 current and former players listed as plaintiffs along with the PTPA in the suit, said the group was determined to do something for the future of the game.

“I know that myself and many of the players aren't happy with the structures and everything that's going on in tennis at the moment,” Kyrgios told Sky Sports.

“This will be a special moment in tennis, for sure.

“Things needed to change. It's a big day for tennis.”

The PTPA was formally established by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2019 to advocate for players.

Pospisil said the PTPA had spoken to more than 250 players and had plenty of support, including from the top players.

“The ATP/WTA has spread so much fear over the years that it's not easy to put your name on this publicly. Player support for this initiative is undeniable,” he added.

While player associations are common in professional sports, tennis is different in that the players operate as independent contractors.

“We're the only sport in the world that doesn't have a players' association. That was the PTPA's first goal, to get the players to be heard,” Kyrgios said.

“The ATP just had so much power, they don't have to show anything to anyone. Now things will have to change, they'll have to show things, how things operate and that's when people really realise that it hasn't really been done correctly.

“I don't think players ultimately have been very happy with what they earn on the tour compared to other sports and I think that's definitely one of the main reasons.”

Describing the various governing bodies as ‘a cartel', the PTPA, which has also begun legal action in the United Kingdom and the European Union, accuses them of paying “artificially low compensation to professional tennis players” and imposing a “draconian” ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.

The lawsuit calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and often in the early hours of the morning, that tennis balls chosen by the tournaments are a factor in chronic injuries, and that players' privacy rights are being abused by random drug tests.

Before filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.

We used to wear tennis shoes when I was a kid, or we might call them gym shoes, because they're what we wore in gym class and at basketball practice.

We started out with Keds and PF Flyers, then Converse, Addidas and Puma, on to Nike and Reebok, and eventually, I tried New Balance, Saucony, Asics, Brooks, and all the rest … but to me, they were all tennis shoes. Now, tennis shoes are shoes you wear to play tennis, which are different than the ones for basketball, or walking or running, or skateboarding.

They're the shoes on the back wall at the sporting goods store, displayed on their own individual platforms. They also go by the name “sneakers,” though I never called them that, until about five minutes ago, which is what prompted me to write this column.

The word “sneakers” dates back to the 1880s. It refers to shoes with soft rubber soles, which are quiet, enabling the wearer to sneak around.

Whether I was wearing tennis shoes or, as was more often the case, boots, which I prefer, looks-wise, I've always valued “quiet walking,” being able to move down the hall or climb a flight of stairs without sounding like Godzilla, stomping along, shaking the ground and rattling the walls.

Until recently, I rarely wore tennis shoes out in the evening, or to non-sporting events, but that's been changing lately, since I broke a couple more bones in my foot — to go along with the other two from long ago, which still have never fused. And then there's the plantar fasciitis. I'm glad to know that pro- athletes, during their playing career, sometimes suffer from plantar fasciitis, otherwise, I might take it as a sign of aging.

I'm to a point where I have to change my shoes three or four times a day to relieve the throbbing and aching pain that kicks in, which makes traveling a bit more unwieldy, unless I'm driving, as it is easy to throw an extra couple of pairs of shoes in the car, but less so to pack them in a suitcase.

The weird thing is, what was uncomfortable two weeks ago is comfortable now, and vice versa. There's this one pair I pulled out from the back of my closet, which I bought the year I tried getting into tennis. They are, literally, tennis shoes, sold to me by a tennis pro in the pro shop. I've had them seven or eight years and have hardly ever worn them because they've always felt too small, but now they don't. I don't understand it. It's the same with my Justin Ropers; they were never flexible enough in the right places, but now, every couple of weeks, they're the most comfortable shoe or boot I can put on … and then, the next day, they're not. I'm glad to know I'm still changing because in change there is hope … and what is death but the cessation of change?

I know I'm not alone in this because I now see some of the old cowboys in town, my friends — the Western singer, the farmer and the construction worker, and even Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — wearing tennis shoes, and I'm guessing it's for the same reason as me. Their feet hurt.

Besides, there's less of a distinction now between tennis shoes and dress shoes. You see people wearing them with suits and dresses, in wedding parties and on the red carpet. I used to regard them as a distinctly, though not exclusively, American fashion, but not anymore. People all over the world are wearing them.

I hope there is some new and exciting footwear phase in store for me, but until then, I will keep wearing, and continue calling them, tennis shoes.

LEXINGTON, Ky. – The University of Kentucky men's tennis team is set to begin a four match road stretch—its longest of the season—in the Yellowhammer State this weekend, taking on Auburn on Thursday, March 20 at 4 p.m. ET and Alabama on Saturday, March 22 at 2 p.m. ET.

The Cats head down Interstate-65 after winning consecutive conference matches for the first time this season, taking down LSU and Vanderbilt at home to improve their record to 9-0 at the Hilary J. Boone Tennis Complex. Jack Loutit led the Wildcats with a 4-0 combined record across singles and doubles on the weekend, improving his dual match record to 12-2 in singles and picking up his second and third consecutive ranked wins in doubles alongside Eli Stephenson.

In the latest release of the ITA Rankings, the Cats moved up three spots to No. 30. Auburn checks in at No. 27 and Alabama enters the weekend at No. 33.

The Cats retained singles rankings for four players, led by Loutit at No. 49. Freshman Antoine Ghibaudo slots at No. 63, Jaden Weekes follows at No. 74, and Charlelie Cosnet rounds out the quartet at No. 121. Additionally, for the first time this season, the Cats feature a ranked doubles team, as Loutit and Stephenson rose from unranked to No. 21 in the last two weeks.

Auburn enters Thursday's contest on the heels of three straight wins, including SEC victories over No. 18 Oklahoma and Ole Miss. The Tigers are led in singles by Alexander Frusina, currently ranked No. 60 in the country. On the doubles court, the Tigers' top pair of Billy Blaydes and William Nolan check in at No. 10.

Alabama, sitting idle on Thursday, is looking to snap a four-match losing skid on Saturday. The Crimson Tide have yet to lose a match at Alabama Tennis Stadium and are led by 2024 NCAA Singles Champion and ITA No. 18 Filip Planinsek. Two other Alabama players—No. 83 Roan Jones and No. 119 Matias Ponce de Leon—also find themselves ranked on the singles court. In doubles, Planinsek—partnered with Matic Kirznik—rank No. 32 in the country and Andrii Zimnokh and Damien Nezar check in at No. 83.

The Cats will continue their road stretch next weekend, traveling to the Lone Star state to take on No. 4 Texas on Friday, March 28 and No. 12 Texas A&M on Sunday, March 30.

All home matches will be played at the Hilary J. Boone Tennis Complex, and admission is free to the public for all regular season contests. A live stream will be provided for all home matches on UKAthletics.com.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Ons Jabeur is a three-time Grand Slam finalist with more than $13 million in prize money by age 30, and as she looked out at the main court used for the Miami Open this week and next, she rattled off a lengthy list of things she thinks could be fixed in professional tennis to help all players.

“We need to improve the structure that we have. ... We can do better about the scheduling. The times of matches. There are a lot of tournaments, and health-wise, for the players, I don't think that helps. The balls changing every week is not a good thing. Players deserve to be paid better,” said Jabeur, a member of the executive committee of the Professional Tennis Players' Association, a group co-founded by Novak Djokovic several years ago. “Definitely a lot of things to work on.”

Those issues Jabeur mentioned were among those raised in a class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by the PTPA in federal court in New York on Tuesday, calling the groups in charge of the sport — the women's (WTA) and men's (ATP) tours, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the agency that oversees anti-doping and anti-corruption efforts (ITIA) — a “cartel.”

“The players really do demand to be heard, to have their issues taken seriously, to address these structural issues that plague tennis and really choke it as an international sport,” said PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar, “and to create a system that brings balance and equality and fairness to really the entire business of tennis.”

Here is a look at the lawsuit — and there are similar actions moving forward in Brussels and London — and what it could mean for tennis:




The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil and announced to the world just before the 2020 U.S. Open. The aim was to represent players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport; tennis does not have a full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements as in team sports. 

The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players — women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings — before going to court.

The lawsuit seeks more money for players, yes, and lays out a series of other complaints about the way the sport is run. 

That includes criticisms related to giving too little of the sport's revenues to players, limiting prize money each tournament can offer, preventing competition from rival tours or events, a “45-week-per-year schedule,” the increased number of combined WTA-ATP events that last 12 days apiece, match schedules that sometimes keep players on court well past midnight, a rankings system that restricts which events the athletes enter, and a “heavy-handed approach” by the International Tennis Integrity Agency that the lawsuit termed “arbitrary and selective.” 

“Player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,” Pospisil said.

The PTPA classified the four major events — Wimbledon, U.S. Open, French Open and Australian Open — as co-conspirators that fall under the ITF, rather than making them separate defendants. 

According to the filing, those four Grand Slam tournaments “generated over $1.5 billion collectively in 2024, while only paying between (10% to 20%) of revenue to players.”

But, Nassar said, “The Slams can't unilaterally fix the schedule. They can't fix anti-doping. They can't fix the medical issues. They can't fix the prize money conspiracy and price-fixing that exists at every other level at every other tournament.”

Pospisil is listed as a plaintiff — 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea, Varvara Gracheva, Reilly Opelka and Tennys Sandgren are some of the others — while Djokovic is not. 

“This is about much more than one player,” Nassar said, noting that Djokovic, as a member of the executive committee, is ”very involved, very up to speed.”

The WTA called the filing “regrettable and misguided.” The ATP said the case is “entirely without merit,” and added: “The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. ... The PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.”

As with many a lawsuit, it is hard to know what the long-term effects could be, of course, although this certainly puts in black and white the schism that exists between the sport's leaders and many of its athletes. 

Maybe there will be a settlement? Maybe the players will get nowhere and nothing will be different? Maybe there will be a court ruling that forces change? 

If the latter happens, PTPA lawyer Jim Quinn predicted, “It's going to require a restructuring.”

Austin – No. 4 Texas Men's Tennis freshman Timo Legout was named the SEC Men's Tennis Co-Freshman of the Week, the conference announced Wednesday. It marks the fourth weekly conference honor of the season for Legout and the third time he has been Freshman of the Week.

Legout posted two impressive and decisive wins over highly ranked opponents in leading Texas to a 4-0 sweep over No. 31 Alabama on Sunday. In his singles contest, Legout was first off the court with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Spring 2024 NCAA Singles Champion Filip Planinsek at No. 1. It was Planinsek's first singles loss of the season after starting 12-0. Legout was also first off the doubles court with partner Lucas Brown with a 6-1 win over the No. 42 pair of Planinsek and Matic Kriznik at No. 1. 

Legout is now 24-3 overall in singles this year, including 11-2 in dual matches, with 16 ranked wins, nine of which are in the top-50. In doubles, he is 18-7 overall with seven ranked wins and four in the top-30. As a team, the Longhorns are now 6-0 in SEC play and 15-3 overall.

TEMPE, Ariz. – The University of Indianapolis men's tennis team jumped to No. 12 nationally, per the latest ITA Poll released Wednesday, March 19.

UIndy's five-game winning streak dates back to the ITA Indoor Team Championship, where they defeated Columbus State, who was ranked No. 5 nationally at the time. The Hounds also hold ranked-wins over No. 19 Purdue Northwest and No. 36 Ferris State. 

Asier Ayllon Prado has won his last five singles matches, while David Simeonov and Tadeo Gaggiofatto have four-game win streaks in singles play.

EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. – Stefaniya Anikina and Margaux Guibal Britt have been selected as the Ohio Valley Conference Doubles Team of the Week.

This is the second time in the last three weeks that the Cougar duo have been honored. It also is third time overall that Anikina has been selected for weekly honors.

Anikina and Guibal Britt were 2-0 last week in doubles matches. Playing in Hilton Head, South Carolina, the duo defeated George Mason's Brooklyn Siegel and Mary Young 7-5 and dispatched South Carolina State's Nalanda Teixeira and Teodora Vujicic 6-1.

SIUE begins OVC play this weekend. SIUE Head Coach Adam Albertsen announced that Friday's matchup between the Cougars and Lindenwood will be played at the Edwardsville Y Meyer Center beginning at 2 p.m. due to expected heavy wind conditions. Sunday's 2 p.m. home match between SIUE and Southern Indiana is scheduled for the SIUE Tennis Courts.

			Top Picks:		

Class 5's race for second

As in most other sports, Hampton Roads tennis teams comprise about half of the state's Class 5 squads, and VHSL bracketing ensures that one of them will reach the state championship match — albeit as an almost-certain underdog to a Richmond or Northern Virginia team. Hickory (19-3 last year) returns its entire top six, led by Will Katchmark, from a team that lost 5-4 in the region final to Cox. The '24 state runner-up Falcons, paced by Sam Dixon moving up a spot; usual Region B boss Maury, led by John Felts; Ocean Lakes and Kellam are among the other top contenders. Junior John-Paul Zano, a two-time region singles runner-up, leads Great Bridge.

Bay Rivers District is stacked

Watch out for Bay Rivers-contending Tabb, which will have two freshmen at the top: John Sunstone, a four-star recruit according to Tennis Recruiting Network, and three-star Jack Hiotellis. Sophomore Neel Dharni, a region singles quarterfinalist last season, and seniors Zain Moussa and Daniel Cho return from a solid team that reached the Class 3 Region A semifinals. But 2024 Class 3 state runner-up Grafton brings back John Lee, half of the state champion doubles team last season, and a solid core alongside him. Lafayette qualified for the state tournament last season. The only problem for these quality Class 3 teams: Western Albemarle, which has won a state team trophy for seven years, looms at the end. Class 4 Jamestown can bring back reigning region singles champ Keean Buirski.

Can Norfolk Academy go even farther?

The Bulldogs seek not only to keep dominating the Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools, but also to contend for the VISAA Division I championship against the likes of Richmond-area power St. Christopher's. Joseph Hobbs returns as the conference's best player, and fellow seniors Will Howerton and Lucas Varverud are back in the lineup after all-conference seasons. Nathan Rafal, Davis Doummar and eighth-grader Atish Akkina also could be a factor against what coach Michael Duquette called “one of the strongest schedules we have had in years.” The Bulldogs, who were 3-5 in non-TCIS duals a year ago and lost in the state quarterfinals, don't shy away from tough competition. They plan to play Hickory, Maury and First Colonial, plus perennial Class 3 state champ Western Albemarle.

Triple Crown Christoph?

Bruton's Christoph Schweitzer, the Class 2 singles runner-up last season, could achieve a rare VHSL “triple crown” of singles, doubles and team trophies. Having won the state doubles last season with former Panther Max de Winter and having led the Panthers to their first team crown, Schweitzer is joined by Alek Rivera this year. Senior starters Talien Barnes and Simphiwe Matibini also are back, and juniors Fernando Moreno and Bryson Jones are set to move into the top six for the first time. “We have the pieces needed to repeat if we grow throughout the season,” coach James Barr said.

Kellam's enthusiasm

Coming off a season when the Knights set a school record with 13 wins but fell 5-3 in the Class 5 Region A first round to First Colonial, “we are going to make some noise this season,” second-year Kellam coach Patrick Conde said. Junior Luke Fraim, French native and sophomore Mael Poitrasson, sophomore Drew McEntarfer, senior first-year player Walker Kieran, junior Easton Ford, senior Garrett Austin and Reed Kindley figure to start. “I encourage my players to yell, scream and celebrate after every point,” Conde said. “High school tennis is too quiet and too posh. … I tell my players all the time, ‘We are not country club kids. We are not even tennis players. We are competitors.'”

Spring sports are underway. Follow along with our 757Teamz Extra newsletter.



___

John Felts, Maury

A junior rated a 2-star prospect by Tennis Recruiting Network, he has trained hard in the offseason and gained valuable experience after being the Class 5 Region B singles runner-up last year. Since he's a Commodore, he's a threat to win a region triple crown.

Joseph Hobbs, Norfolk Academy

The senior occasionally dabbles in other sports, but he's the top dog in the TCIS and was a state Co-Player of the Year last season in VISAA Division I. As good as Norfolk Academy is, he was last season's only all-state Bulldog. If individual VISAA championships existed (they don't), he'd contend for them.

John Lee, Grafton

After teaming with Class 3 state singles champ Rainer Christiansen for the VHSL doubles first-place medals last season, Lee is ready to play No. 1 for the Clippers in one of the state's better districts. In an era with few one-handed backhands, the senior has a good one.

Nolan Macedo, Landstown

Virginia Wesleyan men's basketball coach Dave Macedo's son is a TRN 2-star recruit and the area's best Class 6 and Beach District player, though it will be difficult for the senior to reach the state semifinals because Richmond-area stars stand in the way. Deep Run star Grant Kroodsma — part of the state champion doubles pair last season — beat him 6-3, 6-2 in a 2024 region semi.

John Sunstone, Tabb

He seems like the Peninsula's best freshman in many years, thanks to a national ranking of 119 in his class — he was 73rd in 2022 — and could be an immediate state singles championship contender in Class 3. He figures to give coach Jennifer Wornom's Tigers a quick 1-0 lead on many days by taking his singles match at No. 1.

___

Great Bridge looks for encore or more

Thanks to the area's best top two, senior Kayla Kennedy and junior Chase London, the Wildcats reached the Class 5 state final and were competitive in their 5-2 loss to Douglas Freeman, which is on a four-year title streak. Between singles and doubles, Kennedy and London usually bring three of the five team points needed to win. That means less pressure on other returning players such as Micah Williams, Sarah Allen and Carmen Lewis-Jackson. Freshman Leoni Jones, the expected No. 6, is “very talented,” according to Great Bridge coach Andrea Machesney. “We are hoping for another chance at the state title.”

Class 5 depth

Behind Great Bridge, the race for a second state berth from Class 5 Region A seems wide open. First Colonial upset Great Bridge for the region championship last season but is rebuilding with two seniors among 10 players. One of those seniors is valedictorian Jordan Baker. Hickory coach Ron Weber's Hawks are coming off a 14-2 season, advancing to the region semifinals, though they have to replace three starters. Kellam was 8-4 in the Beach District last year, and coach James Yermal said, “Though our team is young, we should be competitive against all the Beach District schools.” More teams could emerge, too.

Jamestown hopes to continue success

The Eagles won the 2023 state Class 4 title and were Region A champs and state quarterfinalists last year, when they were 13-2 and 9-0 in the Bay Rivers District. They hope to replace Julia Clark, who starred at No. 1 for four years and now plays for Trinity College in Connecticut. Coach Karen Johnson returns three starters and three reserves and brings in eight new players. Senior Scarlett Gamez, who joined Clark in winning the 2024 region doubles title, senior Lyla Smith and juniors Michelle Zhou and Ashley Zhao figure to be among the starters.

State tournament stays home

For the fifth consecutive season, the VHSL Class 4, 5 and 6 team finals for girls (and boys) are scheduled for Huntington Park's 20-court facility in Newport News, next to the James River Bridge. So are the singles and doubles semifinals and championship matches. Former Bethel athletic director and Hampton Roads Academy girls coach Ray Smith again will direct the event from June 12-14.

Rewinding to the fall

Unlike their male counterparts, most girls area private-school teams compete in the fall. Norfolk Academy overcame runner-up Cape Henry Collegiate for the TCIS championship before losing in the VISAA Division I quarterfinals. First-team Andersen Legum and second-team Nora Clingenpeel earned all-state honors for the Bulldogs. Cape Henry then took its second Division II team championship in three years, paced by first-team all-state selections Katie Tserediani and Lauren Yue.

___

Tori Epps, Menchville

Having recently committed to compete in college for Loyola Maryland, the 3-star senior seeks her third consecutive Class 5 Region B singles title with her two-handed laser groundstrokes on both sides. The 2023 Class 5 singles runner-up also could return to the state tournament in doubles with Erin Pridgen and as the leader of the Monarchs. Her top competition in region singles could come from Granby's Ariana Pazos Delaguila.

Kayla Kennedy, Great Bridge

The 3-star senior has featured consistency since she arrived on the scene as a freshman by surprisingly winning the Class 4 state singles title, and she has added more offense over the last two years while adding two more region singles crowns. Kennedy took the Class 5 Region A triple crown (team, singles and doubles) last year and will contend for it again, and the state tournament figures to overlap some with her graduation.

Chase London, Great Bridge

Athletic, competitive and featuring excellent shot variety, she usually dominates on line 2 singles while playing behind Kennedy in the Wildcats' lineup. London would be No. 1 at about any other area school. Those two have been state doubles runners-up in London's first two years of high school, in different classes. They hope to take the final step this year.

Chloe Samuels, Landstown

The Eagles' powerful No. 1 was among the Beach District's best players as a freshman, and she again should contend for Class 6 Region A honors after reaching the singles and doubles quarterfinals last season.

Deja Thomas, Grassfield

Savvy and fast afoot, the Tennis Recruiting Network 2-star player enjoyed a landmark freshman season, beating the top two players from Richmond-area power Deep Run to take the Class 6 Region A singles championship on her way to the state semifinals. She and Cayley Griffith were the region doubles runners-up, and the Grizzlies were the only Hampton Roads-area team to reach the Class 6 Region A semis.

Mumbai: Simmering fissures in the tennis world have been cracked wide open with a lawsuit filed by the Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA), co-founded by Novak Djokovic, against the various governing bodies of the sport which they accuse of running professional tennis as a “cartel”. 

Facing heat over the perceived preferential treatment to world No.1 Jannik Sinner in his doping saga, the ATP (it runs the men's tour) has now been taken to court alongside the WTA (women's tour), ITF (International Tennis Federation) and ITIA (International Tennis Integrity Agency) over various governance issues. The lawsuit, filed in New York federal court on Tuesday with a dozen current and former players as plaintiffs, also mentions the four Grand Slam organisers as “co-conspirators”. 

The PTPA, a players' association founded in 2020 by 24-time Slam champion Djokovic and former top-25 Canadian player Vasek Pospisil, claims to have spoken to more than 250 men's and women's players, “including a majority of the top 20 players”, who offered their support. 

“For too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation,” Pospisil, who is also one of the plaintiffs, wrote on X. 

The issues brought up in the 163-page lawsuit are varied, ranging from limiting player compensation, restricting a free market of tournaments and earnings, and “unsustainable” scheduling. It also mentions the ITIA being “arbitrary and selective”; pointing to Sinner being let off without a lengthy ban after testing positive. 

Player compensation 

The lawsuit mentions that the tours “split less than 20% of their revenue with players”. It also highlights the cap on prize money from tournaments which, although the tours and Slams increase frequently, comes with a cap. As an example, the lawsuit brought up an instance in 2012 when billionaire Larry Ellison, who owns BNP Paribas Open, sought to increase the tournament prize pool above the permissible amount of the tours. The proposal was rejected. 

No free market 

The PTPA also accuses the bodies of colluding to restrict opportunities for players to play and earn beyond the tours — in terms of unsanctioned tournaments, exhibitions and restricting sponsorship deals with only select companies for their racquets, bags and apparel. 

“If Louis Vuitton or Gucci, for example, offered a player a lucrative endorsement deal to arrive at center court at Indian Wells carrying a racket bag bearing their logo, the player would have to reject the offer,” the lawsuit states. 

Scheduling concerns 

The packed calendar, with over 50 tournaments in the season on the ATP and WTA tour and a greater volume on the second-rung Challenger and ITF level, is an issue that many players have publicly spoken about. Top players have to turn up for mandatory events, while the lesser-ranked players are compelled to grind week in and week out on the lower levels to barely be able to sustain a livelihood. 

The lawsuit highlights the fines for player pullouts (“the Tour permits players to withdraw from tournaments only twice per season before they are fined”) and the rankings system (Iga Swiatek, for example, was replaced by Aryna Sabalenka as No.1 while she missed three tournaments last year). “A player's ranking is not determined solely by his or her on-court performance at Tour events, but also by how often the player agrees to play,” the lawsuit states. 

‘Selective' Sinner case 

The lawsuit also targetted the ITIA, tennis' anti-doping and anti-corruption unit, for its “heavy-handed approach” towards dealing with players and certain cases. It also, however, brought out the “arbitrary and selective” way that Sinner, the Italian world No.1, escaped a lengthy ban after testing positive twice last year. 

“There was no investigation that dragged for over a year into a prominent player who had not vocalized any issues with the cartel,” the lawsuit reads. 

All the bodies named issued statements on Wednesday rejecting PTPA's claims.

After their season opener against Foss was rained out on Thursday, the Eatonville High School girls tennis team hit the road Friday and secured a 3-1 victory over Franklin Pierce at the Bruce Miller Courts.

The Cruisers won two singles and two doubles matches before rain once again cut play short. Eatonville's No. 1 singles player, Bailey Andersen, set the tone with a strong 6-2, 6-3 win. The No. 2 singles match saw Kate Marsh battle through a close first set before falling 5-7, 1-6.

In doubles action, Alayna Meyer and Isabel Volk dominated at No. 1, posting a 6-1, 6-2 victory. The No. 2 doubles team of Lillian Bickford and Tia Schanbeck followed suit with a 6-2, 6-3 win. The No. 3 doubles match featuring Megan Blake and Jennavieve Smith was left unfinished due to rain. The pair dropped the first set 3-6 but had gained momentum, leading 5-4 in the second set when play was called.

The Cruisers will face a busy schedule next week, with four matches lined up. They start with Annie Wright on Monday at Galbraith Tennis Center in Tacoma.

Philomath News


					Local • Independent • Trusted				

The Philomath High boys tennis team opened the season Tuesday on its home courts with a 7-1 loss to 5A Lebanon.

The Warriors posted their lone victory of the afternoon at No. 4 singles where sophomore Elijah Robinson defeated his counterpart, 6-4, 6-4.

The most exciting match occurred at No. 2 singles between Lebanon sophomore Chase Herb and Philomath sophomore Nate Houck. Herb was able to rally for the victory, 2-6, 7-6, 7-5. There was also a close match at No. 3 singles involving Lebanon senior Valentin Magana and Philomath freshman Cedric Gaskey. Magana pulled out the win, 7-6, 6-4.

Philomath will not see action again until after Spring Break when the Warriors play April 1 at Dallas.

Novak Djokovic is searching for a first title of the season at the 2025 Miami Open.

The Serbian star's form hasn't been the best in recent months, as Djokovic heads to Miami on a three-match losing streak.

Djokovic lost to Botic van de Zandschulp most recently at Indian Wells, 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, as he failed to advance to the third round.

He had lost one month earlier to Matteo Berrettini in his opening match at the Qatar Open, suffering his first career defeat against the Italian star.

The world number five will be looking for a much better showing at the Miami Open, as two mightily impressive records are within reach.

Djokovic could break two records at this year's Miami Open if he were to win the title, currently held by two of the ATP Tour's greatest-ever players.

Roger Federer is currently the oldest player to lift the trophy in Miami, doing so as a 37-year-old back in 2019.

If Djokovic wins in Florida later this month, he will do so 78 days older than Federer was when he beat John Isner in 2019. 

That's not the only record Djokovic can break, however, as a seventh title for Djokovic in Miami would see him edge ahead of America's Andre Agassi in the all-time leader board.

The pair are currently level on six, as Agassi dominated at the event during his time as a professional.

Djokovic could break two big records at this year's tournament, but there are several others that his fellow ATP and WTA Tour stars will be eyeing up before too long.

Serena Williams' record of eight singles victories in Miami is perhaps the most ‘unbeatable' of them all, considering just one active player has won multiple titles at the event.

Belarus' Victoria Azarenka is a three-time champion at the Miami Open but is highly unlikely to break the American's record as she approaches the latter stages of her career.

2022 champion and world number two Iga Swiatek looks like the biggest threat to Williams but will need to start racking up the wins if she wants to add another record to her glowing resume.

Only time will tell if she can do so, but she'll first focus on her first-round matchup against either Caroline Garcia or Anna Bondar.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Mary Jo Cagle's last day at Cone Health is May 31. The health system has not yet named her permanent successor.

The executive departs Cone less than a year after the Greensboro, North Carolina-based health system was acquired by Risant Health, Kaiser's nonprofit health system formed to acquire and operate nonprofit health systems.

Cagle was the first woman to serve as CEO of Cone, overseeing five hospitals and more than 13,000 employees. She shepherded the system through the COVID-19 pandemic and was a “driving force” behind the Risant Health deal, according to a press release.

“It has been a joy and privilege to lead this system. I'm incredibly proud of all we've accomplished to increase access to care, enhance patient safety and care quality,” Cagle said in a statement.

Upon departure, Sherry will temporarily take the reins. Sherry has more than 30 years of senior leadership experience and has held posts at Ascension Wisconsin and Saint Thomas Health, now known as Ascension Saint Thomas.

Cagle's permanent replacement will come aboard as Cone seeks to grow. 

When Risant acquired Cone Health, the system pledged to invest at least $1.4 billion into Cone over the next five years to develop Cone facilities and integrate the system into Risant. It also plans to invest up to $300 million more over 10 years to support Cone's growth.

Cone Health reported $364.8 million in excess of revenue over expenses for its 2024 fiscal year which ended Sept. 30, an increase compared with the $197.6 million reported in 2023.

Healthcare is a dynamic landscape. Opportunities to improve processes, address concerns and deliver exceptional care experiences are a patient expectation, a regulatory metric and at the heart of the reason many professionals choose to work in healthcare.

THE CHALLENGE

Oftentimes, when people encounter healthcare, this includes a surgical visit in an inpatient or outpatient setting. A recent cross-sectional study found more than 11% of respondents reporting that they'd had surgery in the past year. 

For many in healthcare and especially in the operative setting, surgery is an everyday event – it's their job, their expertise. But that is surely not the case for the patients.

""The genesis of our process improvement work and the focus and goal of our process improvement is to improve the patient experience, reduce anxiety and fear, and ultimately improve psychological readiness for surgery,"" said Anita H. Becker, DNP, RN, chief nursing officer at Steamboat Springs, Colorado-based UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center.

""Process improvement in the surgical setting often is focused on the efficiency and effectiveness of patient throughput from the time of scheduling until discharge to home or inpatient,"" she continued. ""In conversations with our patients and their families, certain themes around surgical readiness kept coming up with increasing frequency.""

Specifically, while conducting routine pre- and post-operative follow-up phone calls and visits, many patients and their caregivers expressed fears and anxieties related to their readiness for surgery. This feedback struck a chord with the organization's pre-operative and post-anesthesia care teams.

The feedback became the impetus for identifying a need for change and process improvement that was focused on the patient experience apart from the efficiency of time as a metric in a surgical encounter.

""Lastly, addressing psychological readiness for surgery became a strategic priority for our hospital,"" Becker explained. ""The challenge arose in defining 'readiness' and collecting data to analyze, support and foster meaningful change for the patient experience. We knew we wanted to hear the voice of the patient and realized each demographic would offer a different viewpoint.

""In an effort to duplicate best practices, a literature review was conducted by our team,"" she added. ""What they found was a paucity of literature available to address psychological readiness for surgery, and most of what was found addressed fear and anxiety. We knew we were on the right track, but we also knew we were in new territory.""

PROPOSAL

Initially this work was independent of work being done by Chris Whelchel. Whelchel is founder and CEO of Boulder, Colorado-based HealthTok, a healthcare consulting firm. He completed his doctoral practicum work at UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center and shared his passion for technology and innovation, demonstrating exceptional analytical skills and a deep understanding of complex healthcare systems, Becker said.

""Prior to the process improvement project, we had not considered leveraging AI tools or ambient technology in our workspace for tackling these types of large data collections or analysis,"" she explained. 

""With the tools Chris recommended, we were able to capture not only the data but the tone and themes of the conversations in our focus groups beyond just the dialogue. Chris' understanding and sharing of these tools offered the team a solution for the collection and analysis of the data we needed to find a workable solution to the challenge before us.

""The promise of AI, and the hope of its integration into this project, was to alleviate the burden of sifting through large data sets and patient narrative,"" she continued. ""Within minutes of the conclusion of our focus groups, we had first-pass workflows and work plans, including themes, key trends and strategies, generated through AI tools.""

Staff also found that through this technology, they were able to remove their initial bias toward planned solutions such as aromatherapy, healing touch, pamphlets, videos and music therapy, and really focus on what the focus groups said they needed to be better prepared for surgery.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE

Focus group participants provided candid feedback that helped staff define what ""readiness"" meant and outline a process for better preparing patients for surgery and beyond. The AI and ambient tools helped put actions in place that will address patients' needs moving forward.

""For example, two very strong themes identified during our focus groups were increased caregiver involvement in pre- and post-operative care and instructions; and, surprisingly, pet care during the surgical period and while in recovery,"" Becker noted. ""These were two themes that were not on our radar but were filtered and identified through the ambient technology tool.

""We were very excited by the speed in which this data was quickly pulled together as many of us were first-time users of this innovative approach to tackling complex and data-heavy information,"" she continued. ""What we gained was very valuable information and endless possibilities from AI-generated flowcharts, GPT-combined summaries, task lists and deeper insights without user bias – and it was accomplished in minutes versus hours.""

RESULTS

In the first quarter following implementation of new workflows and tools, the Quarter 3 patient experience (patient experience is measured quarterly) moved to 100%, Becker reported.

""We feel certain this was accomplished by implementing tools and processes that came directly from identified trends, themes and suggested AI workflows,"" she said.

""These include a new communication protocol, evaluation and renewed utilization of available EHR tools that were not being optimized, and significant change in workflows across the peri-operative departments driven by trends identified during our focus groups,"" she added. ""We are a work in progress and cautiously optimistic this improvement in patient experience will continue and become standard practice.""

ADVICE FOR OTHERS

Important considerations when choosing experts in this emerging field are many, Becker advised.

""First and foremost, it is important to choose an expert with healthcare experience,"" she said. ""A background in our industry allows for a deep understanding of healthcare's mission while also having the ability to navigate the complexities of our environment specific to regulatory compliance, patient privacy and data security.

""Other considerations when leveraging AI would be to: clearly define project goals; ensure data quality; evaluate the ability to adapt, scale and monitor any project implementation; and prioritize regulatory compliance,"" she added.

It's also important to factor in patient trust and experience, she advised.

""Prior to implementation of AI tools in this project, all focus group participants were informed of the plan, collection of data, and use and retention of all information gathered during each session,"" she explained. ""Participants were able to ask questions, determine their level of participation, view the AI output, and provide feedback on the session. All participants elected to continue to participate in our focus groups and were curious and awed by what the tools produced.

""Finally, I would strongly encourage users to seek guidance from their organization's policy and procedures specific to the use and integration of AI into their workspace,"" she continued. ""Be open to the possibilities of AI. These tools can and have increased productivity and efficiency, not just with this process improvement project, but in my everyday work. Truthfully, all team members involved in this project have integrated the use of AI tools into their work at some level.""

By using a strategic and patient-focused approach, organizations now have the ability to leverage AI responsibly, effectively and ethically to achieve operational efficiency and improve patient experience – and this applies to projects both big and small, she concluded.

The massive pharmacy benefit manager plans to stop requiring coverage reauthorizations for roughly 80 drugs used to treat migraines, multiple sclerosis, high cholesterol and more.

Prior authorization requires doctors to get approval from a patient's health or drug plan before providing a medical service, like performing surgery or prescribing a medication. Insurers and PBMs argue prior authorization is important to reduce nonessential healthcare costs and ensure treatment is safe and effective.

However, doctors say the process increases paperwork burden and delays care plans. Some patients have experienced severe health outcomes or even died following prior authorization holdups.

As a result, pressure has been rising on health and drug plans to roll back the policies. In the past few years, a number of major payers have walked back prior authorizations, including Optum Rx's sister company UnitedHealthcare and CVS-owned Aetna.

Still, physicians argue more reform is needed — especially as payers automate prior authorization processes, sparking concerns about algorithms driving improper denials.

Reauthorizations are occasionally necessary to ensure that the ongoing use of drug is safe, that the current dosage is appropriate and that a patient doesn't need additional testing, according to Optum Rx. But for many drugs, there is “minimal additional value” in reauthorization, the PBM said in its Wednesday release.

Nixing reauthorizations is meant to simplify patient experiences, expand access to medications and reduce work for pharmacists and doctors, Patrick Conway, the CEO of Optum Rx, said in a statement.

Drugs included in the program don't present an added safety risk for patients, have established long-term effectiveness and constant dose requirements, a spokesperson for the PBM said.

Patients using the drugs also have to have an established diagnosis of a chronic condition, and have considered alternative therapy for authorization to be waived.

Future drugs that will be considered for the program will follow the same clinical criteria, the spokesperson said.

Reducing prior authorizations is also a savvy PR move for Optum Rx, one of the so-called “Big Three” U.S. PBMs that have been targeted by antitrust regulators and lawmakers for their alleged role in driving up drug costs.

Critics of major PBMs point to opaque contracts, rebating practices and significant market consolidation in calling for Washington to curb the drug middlemen. However, despite rising momentum on the Hill resulting in a number of proposed bills and an ongoing legal spat with the Federal Trade Commission, concrete changes have yet to be imposed on PBMs.

Spurred by public pressure — and a rising number of upstart pharmacy benefits competitors — major PBMs including Optum have announced a number of internal changes that they say make them more straightforward and effective.

In doing so, they're likely seeking to protect lucrative businesses from external reform. Optum Rx, for example, brought in $5.8 billion in profit last year, almost one-fifth of UnitedHealth's overall operating earnings

In January, Optum Rx announced it would phase out models that allow it to retain savings from negotiations with drugmakers over the next three years.

Optum Rx and the other members of the Big Three — Cigna-owned Express Scripts and CVS-owned Caremark — have also launched “transparent” PBM models based on the net cost of drugs, a move analysts say is likely in response to client ire over confusing business practices and meant to offset political and regulatory scrutiny.

A new guide from Relatient offers a checklist for healthcare providers to identify data that matters most so they can make more informed decisions.

Operational efficiency relies on understanding the right data. Failing to ensure your healthcare practice is monitoring the correct data means that inefficiencies can go unnoticed, driving provider burnout, staff overload, patient dissatisfaction, and missed opportunities for growth.

A healthcare practice's contact center plays a crucial role to ensure that improvements translate into a frictionless patient experience. For example, the rate at which waitlisted patients are successfully scheduled into newly available appointment slots can mean the difference between wasted opportunities for both providers and patients, and ensuring that provider time isn't wasted and patients receive timely care.

A new report from Relatient offers a checklist designed to help healthcare organizations optimize their performance.

“Patients expect more control and convenience throughout their healthcare experiences,” observed Relatient Chief Product Officer David Dyke in the report. “Empowering them with easy-to-use self-scheduling demonstrates a deep understanding of patient perspective early in the care journey, laying the groundwork for high patient satisfaction and optimal practice efficiency by reducing back-and-forth of appointment management for which healthcare is sadly famous for.”

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transitioning from a futuristic concept to a tangible force reshaping the healthcare landscape. 

Buoyed by early successes, healthcare firms are aggressively increasing their investments in GenAI, particularly in areas like product innovation and customer service, signaling a shift in how the industry operates. 

A report from PYMNTS Intelligence, “Healthcare Firms Going Long on GenAI Investment,” reveals that these bets are already yielding significant returns, prompting a wave of further adoption among major players.

The report surveyed C-suite executives at healthcare firms with at least $1 billion in annual revenue to understand their GenAI strategies. 

The findings indicate a strong conviction in the technology's potential, with nine in 10 executives anticipating a positive return on their GenAI investments. Consequently, a majority of these leaders plan to further escalate their GenAI spending in the coming year, placing healthcare ahead of the cross-industry average in its bullish outlook. 

The report highlights the strategic prioritization of GenAI in crucial operational areas as businesses strive to stay competitive.

Key data points underscore this accelerating trend:

Beyond these core areas, the report also noted that a significant portion of healthcare firms are leveraging the technology for data visualization and reports (55%), search and access to information (55%), and workflow automation management (51%). 

Interestingly, the adoption of GenAI in high-stakes areas such as fraud detection and cybersecurity management remains relatively low, suggesting a cautious approach to these critical functions, at least in the short term. On average, healthcare executives expect GenAI to be fully embedded across their businesses within 7.4 years, aligning with cross-industry expectations.

DispatchHealth CEO Jennifer Webster will lead the combined company once the deal closes, which is expected in mid-2025.

Medically Home will become part of DispatchHealth when the deal closes, according to a press release. The combined company will employ more than 2,200 people, more than half of which will be frontline care team members, a Medically Home spokesperson told Healthcare Dive.

Jennifer Webster, CEO of DispatchHealth who joined the company in 2023, will lead the merged firm, the spokesperson said.

The merger is designed to help the systems expand care access, lower costs and improve capacity, according to Webster.

Founded in 2013, Denver-based DispatchHealth offers same-day medical care, recovery services after a hospitalization or serious health issue, and hospital-level care in the home.

The company has raised hundreds of millions in venture capital dollars, including a $330 million equity and debt financing round in late 2022. 

Boston-based Medically Home has also raised significant venture capital investment, including its most recent $110 million raise about three years ago. 

The startup provides a platform and support services for providers — including Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Yale New Haven Health and Cleveland Clinic — to deliver advanced care in patients' homes. More than 55,000 patients have received hospital-level services through the company's program, according to the company.

Delivering advanced healthcare at home isn't a new concept, but interest in the care model increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as an influx of patients strained hospital capacity. 

To boost available beds during COVID surges, the CMS created the Acute Hospital Care At Home program in 2020, which allowed approved Medicare-certified facilities to provide inpatient level care in patients' homes.

However, the program operates on a temporary waiver, and there's been uncertainty about whether flexibilities will continue indefinitely. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump signed a short-term government funding bill that extends the program through Sept. 30, along with telehealth flexibilities in Medicare.

Over 10 years, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability care providers. But intense pressures to turn a profit could harm quality, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.

Private equity firms have recently come under fire for their role in healthcare, including their management of hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

However, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says the financiers' inroads into disability care, which manages services including residential care, home health and personal assistance, is just as troubling, but has yet to garner attention.

Private equity firms are attracted to the industry because of growing demand for care, high levels of fragmentation across disability care, and its expected recession-resistant nature, according to the report.

But patients in disability care centers tend to be some of the most disadvantaged, and often have multiple comorbities, making them unable to stand up for themselves in cases of questionable management practices. The report accuses private equity firms of neglecting or abusing patients, adding that poor care is possible in part due to regulatory loopholes that allows for varying safety standards.

“Private equity firms are fundamentally altering these services in ways that put some of the most vulnerable members of our communities at risk,” said Eileen O'Grady, director of programs at PESP and lead author of the report, in a statement. “The private equity model prioritizes short-term financial gains, often at the expense of staffing levels, service quality, and even basic client safety.”

Investigations in Florida, Indiana, California and Illinois found cost-cutting measures by private equity firms led to problems that impacted patient care, including severe understaffing and improper use of restraints at some facilities. 

The watchdog organization said intense pressures to cut costs are in part to blame for the failures. In some cases, while the facilities were accused of neglecting patients, they were simultaneously funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to investors through debt-funded dividends. 

For example, Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group paid themselves more than $600 million in dividends from Sevita and Help at Home, even as the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says care standards declined.

In some cases cost-cutting measures resulted in direct harm to patients.

Regulators shut down Broadstep Behavioral Health group homes in Illinois after finding “significant deficiencies” in medication management, staff training and safety measures, including repeat violations in safety drills and deficient cleanliness. In Indiana, a patient reportedly died of neglect after weighing just 71 pounds at a facility run by Help at Home, according to the report.

“Home and community-based services are essential for hundreds of thousands of Americans with disabilities,” O'Grady said. “Private equity ownership imperils the effective delivery of these services and puts individuals with disabilities at risk.”

Both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly are pushing for healthcare reforms to provide price transparency and authorization efficiency for patients across the state, but questions remain about whether the House and Senate will unite in their proposals to approve health reform legislation during the 2025 session.

The Care First Act aims to eliminate red tape that causes delays in the authorization process that patients must endure in order to receive treatment. House Bill 434 requires timely decisions so that patients and doctors are not left wondering for weeks or months if the patient will receive the needed authorization for treatment coverage. 

The House proposal aims to reform the broken prior authorization process in North Carolina's healthcare system, which has become a major barrier for doctors and patients seeking timely care. During a recent press conference, the bill's sponsors and supporters from the medical community emphasized the need to restore doctors' authority in making medical decisions for their patients without unnecessary delays from insurance companies.

Representative Grant Campbell, R-Cabarrus, a practicing physician, highlighted that physicians currently spend an average of 13 hours per week navigating prior authorizations, which leads to delays and negatively impacts patient care. He shared a personal example of a six-week delay in surgery for a patient due to repeated authorization hindrances. Campbell pointed out that physicians sometimes have to appeal to out-of-field non-specialists, such as psychiatrists, for approval on treatments that require specialized knowledge in a different area of medicine.

“On one side, you have the doctor and the patient who have easily known each other for years,” explained Campbell. “That same doctor has examined them, discussed their options, looked at their testing; and on the other side, you have someone sitting in a cubicle in a corporate office that may be a physician, may not be a physician, may be in your specialty, may not be in your specialty, may be seeing patients anymore, and may not be seeing patients. The parade of people that are trying to interfere with the relationship with the patient and their physician has got to stop, and this is one of the great first steps to do that.”

The bill, supported by various medical organizations such as the North Carolina Medical Society and the NC Health Care Association, aims to streamline the authorization process. It also requires health insurers to consult with the doctors prior to a denial, in addition to setting time frames and minimum clinical standards.

The bill would purportedly save $1.8 billion annually, as the state health plan's reduces procedures requiring prior authorization from 2,600 to 1,600..

The House effort comes one day after senators introduced two bills targeting health care, which will be merged together during the committee process. Senate Bill 316, Lower Healthcare Costs, would help North Carolinians understand the costs and fees associated with their healthcare services by requiring disclosures for billable items. The price transparency would incentivize customers to shop around, say bill sponsors. 

The legislation takes other steps to reduce costs as well, such as tasking the state auditor with reviewing facility prices, deregulation to allow more dentists to practice more freely, and eliminating Certificate of Need review for inpatient rehab.

Senate Bill 315, More Transparency/Efficiency in Utilization Reviews, proposes reforms to prior authorization practices to keep costs down and ensure timely care. The bill requires urgent health care services to be reviewed in 24 hours or less, codifies the appeals process, and requires that any doctor conducting a review be actively licensed in that specialty for at least three consecutive years, according to a press release. 

“In order to make the best decisions for their care, patients need to have all of the information about their procedure at their fingertips,” said bill sponsor Sen. Amy Galey, R-Alamance. “Shedding light on the true costs of healthcare is good for patients and providers. These proposals will provide much-needed transparency for North Carolinians when they're making decisions about their health.”

The bills will be heard in the Senate Health Care Committee on Wednesday. While similar prior authorization legislation passed the House unanimously in 2023, the bill stalled in the Senate.

“We would like to applaud the efforts by both the House and Senate leadership to bring these issues to the forefront,” said a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina. “We support their efforts to work with stakeholders to hold everyone accountable for the costs and access to health care. We appreciate the efforts to respond to North Carolinians' frustrations with the health care system. We are committed to keeping health care affordable and look forward to working with anyone who shares that goal.”

Rep. Timothy Reeder, R-Pitt, expressed optimism that the Senate has acknowledged the issue of prior authorization in healthcare, but he also noted that the House bill includes several key provisions absent in the Senate's version, such as requirements for insurers to disclose authorization criteria, a shorter processing time, and a mandate for peer reviewers to be licensed in North Carolina. 

“There's a number of things that I'm hopeful that the Senate will consider as we debate both bills and move them forward,” said Reeder. “But I just really am happy and thankful that the Senate acknowledges that this is an issue that we need to deal with.”


						North Carolina could soon recognize November as Military Appreciation Month after the state House passed a bill unanimously on Tuesday aiming to honor those in the military.					


						With a little more than two months under his belt, North Carolina Democrat Gov. Josh Stein is in a strong honeymoon phase with approval ratings north of 50%. Stein is on par with previous governors at the beginning of their tenure, leading Cooper by five points, and trailing McCrory by one.					


						If a regulation created by officials in the executive branch is going to have significant economic impacts upward of $1 million, then the North Carolina General Assembly should have a statutory role in approving the proposed rule, said lawmakers on Tuesday. 					


						North Carolina Democrats are pushing to restore public access to General Assembly records, challenging Republican-led restrictions from 2023 that limited transparency in state government.

Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative


San Francisco, CA, March  19, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evinova, a global clinical trial technology company with proven published outcomes for sponsors, sites and patients, announced today an agreement with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative™ (QLHC) to incorporate Evinova's remote patient monitoring (RPM) solution into I-SPY 2.2. I-SPY 2.2 is the largest and longest-running 'platform' trial that provides a framework to study multiple novel therapeutic treatment arms for women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. Evinova's RPM module will be used to alert healthcare professionals of early symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), a potential adverse event for one treatment arm in the study.  

“One of the primary goals of I-SPY 2.2 is to get better treatments to patients faster and with fewer side effects. New bispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have the promise of eliminating traditional chemotherapy, but they too are associated with potential serious side effects. One of those complications is ILD, but early identification may be the key to preventing it from becoming a serious complication. Evinova makes it possible for us to monitor people using the drug every day, from the comfort of their home. Using Evinova's RPM solution in the study will help us, as providers, to identify and intervene early when ILD symptoms initially present. We are studying how this solution can improve the patient experience and minimize toxicity – that is what we all want to achieve,” said Dr. Laura Esserman, founder of the I-SPY trials and QLHC.

Evinova's RPM solution enables real-time monitoring of patients' health status and treatment intake between clinical visits and alerts healthcare providers of the potential onset or worsening of symptoms related to a potential toxicity, in this case ILD. With this information, healthcare providers can triage patients in need of further clinical evaluation and intervene promptly based on guidelines, potentially reducing the likelihood of progression to high-grade ILD and dose reduction, hold or interruption of treatment.

“With real-time alerts to both patients and sites, Evinova's RPM solution for toxicity monitoring enables care teams to review and take proactive actions based on guidelines” said Cristina Duran, President, Evinova. “At Evinova, we're passionate about accelerating better health outcomes through technology like RPM that enables global life science leaders to overcome critical research challenges and deliver a better clinical trial experience for both sites and patients.”

In addition to pulmonary toxicity monitoring, Evinova has RPM modules for gastrointestinal, stomatitis and oral thrush symptom monitoring, with more in development based on patient need and drug side effect profiles.

ATLANTA, March  19, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rimidi, a market-leading digital health company that supports healthcare providers in the delivery of remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management with EHR-integrated software, services, and connected devices, has introduced Rimidi 2.0, a next-generation platform enhancement designed to address the increasing complexity of healthcare delivery. 

While Rimidi's platform already enables clients to configure alerts, risk scores, and triage statuses to align with their specific protocols, care team structures, and clinical priorities — such as Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM) — Rimidi 2.0 takes these capabilities even further. With enhanced scalability, strengthened data security, expanded device integration, and a flexible framework designed for the rapid adoption of emerging technologies like AI, the upgraded platform provides both clinical and IT teams with a future-ready solution to optimize patient care, streamline workflows, and improve operational efficiency.

“Virtual care is evolving faster than ever, and healthcare organizations face mounting pressure to meet new demands while delivering excellent patient care,” said Lucienne Ide, MD, PhD, Founder and CEO of Rimidi. “Rimidi 2.0 supports today's needs and is designed to scale as the industry changes. This ensures providers can stay agile with expanding payment models, new workflows, and the rapid adoption of connected health devices.”

As the demand for more flexible and feature-rich healthcare platforms grows, Rimidi 2.0 meets the challenge by improving adaptability, cybersecurity, and overall performance. It is built on a microservices framework, a software architecture model that makes it easy to expand and enhance the platform over time. Instead of operating as a large static system, the platform is divided into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function. This means growing healthcare organizations can add capabilities quickly and efficiently without disrupting existing workflows — allowing them to get more value from their technology investments.

“The new framework is cleaner and more dynamic, allowing for rapid integration or adoption of emerging capabilities – whether that's AI, new advanced sensors or medical devices, or new policies surrounding reimbursable care models,” said Catriona Tarto, Vice President of Technology at Rimidi.

In addition to scalability, the upgraded platform supports several key pillars of healthcare, including:

Seamless Integration and Data Standardization with Connected Health Technologies





Enhanced Clinical Trial Support for Chronic Disease Research





Optimized Financial Sustainability through Reimbursable Care Models





With Rimidi 2.0, providers gain a more efficient, integrated, and future-proof solution designed to simplify workflows, enhance clinical decision-making, and improve care quality. The new version's launch underscores Rimidi's mission to equip healthcare organizations with the tools needed to thrive in a rapidly transforming industry.

The Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey (HFNJ) has awarded $534,762 in grants to five New Jersey nonprofit organizations in its first quarter of giving in 2025. All five of the awards are renewal grants of projects previously funded by HFNJ and reflect HFNJ's commitment to deepening its ties with grantees through year-after-year funding.

“One of the ways that The Healthcare Foundation of NJ makes a long-term impact is by cultivating continuing relationships with grantees and funding projects that have proven to be successful for additional years,” said Michael Schmidt, executive director/CEO of The Healthcare Foundation of NJ. “This quarter, we are delighted to provide another year of funding for five exemplary projects that have made significant impact in the communities we serve.”

Several of the projects funded this quarter share a theme of strengthening the capacity of nonprofit organizations to address critical needs in the community.

A $100,000 capacity-building grant to Ironbound Community Corporation will help this venerable institution in the Ironbound section of Newark build a strong financial base by expanding its Development Department, including bringing on a grant writer to help it pursue new funding opportunities. A $78,180 grant to JCC of Central New Jersey will fund the expansion of its Inclusion & Support Services Department, which works to ensure that children with physical, emotional and mental disabilities can be fully included in all programming and thrive. This grant will fund a third year of the Inclusion & Support Services Coordinator, who delivers hands-on support for children and specialized consultations with teachers and counselors. It will also add a new position for a part-time Administrative Coordinator.

New Jersey Citizen Action will receive $130,000 to support a continued targeted education and outreach project designed to help families access and retain affordable healthcare – whether through NJ Family Care (Medicaid) or other options. Since the end the COVID-era policy of automatic continuous coverage for NJ Family Care, NJ Citizen Action has helped individuals and families work through the redetermination process that requires annual approval to retain medical insurance coverage.

The largest grant of the quarter is a $141,582 award to Family Connections for a final grant to the Pride + program. This program provides peer support and therapy for young people and their families in schools throughout Newark and Essex County.

The first quarter of 2025 marks one year since the first awards were announced in The Healthcare Foundation of NJ's 2024 initiative to strengthen the behavioral health supports available to adolescents in the Jewish community of Greater MetroWest, NJ. This quarter saw the first of those projects receiving a renewal grant – an $85,000 award to Moving Traditions to continue the MetroWest Student Teacher Wellness and Inclusion Training Program. This targeted training program engages 20-30 teens who serve as student teachers/madrichim at Hebrew schools to develop their capacities to enhance the mental health of the hundreds of young people they will serve. The workshops include skill development to promote personal wellness and resiliency; peer-to-peer teen mental health first aid training; and opportunities to build their knowledge and skills around cultivating healthy cultures.

The full list of the grants awarded in the first quarter of 2025 is as follows:

Optum Rx has announced it will drop prior authorization for an estimated 80 drugs starting May 1. 

The program targets reauthorizations of drugs. For instance, once a genetic condition such as cystic fibrosis is confirmed through testing, there is minimal additional value in reauthorizing an effective, lifelong treatment, said Optum Rx. 

The list of drugs is expected to be expanded over time.

WHY THIS MATTERS

This initiative will eliminate up to 25% of all reauthorizations, or 10% of overall prior authorizations, Optum Rx said.
 
""Optum Rx is taking meaningful steps to simplify patient experiences and increase access to critical medications,"" said Dr. Patrick Conway, CEO, Optum Rx. ""These changes mean easier access to medications for consumers, less work for pharmacists and physicians, and a simplified system focused on clinical quality."" 

Some reauthorizations are necessary for drugs that have safety concerns, need ongoing monitoring for dose adjustments, require additional tests or may have alternative therapy considerations, according to UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy benefit manager. 

For example, new drugs developed for Alzheimer's disease carry risks for the brain, and long-term effectiveness is not clear, the company said. For these treatments, ongoing review is important for patients, payers and physicians, it said.

In February 2023, Optum announced that two new medications were in the drug pipeline for Alzheimer's disease, Lecanemab and Donanemab. The FDA granted traditional approval to Leqembi, and in June 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rolled out a plan to cover new Alzheimer's drugs when a physician and clinical team participates in a registry. The cost for Leqembi was estimated at around $26,500 per year.

Optum Rx also said it would continue to fight high drug prices set by pharmaceutical companies through both negotiation and cost-cutting tools.

Other savings programs touted by Optum Rx include:

THE LARGER TREND

UnitedHealthcare faced a backlash of anger over prior authorizations and claim denials after its CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot Dec. 4 as he walked to an investors conference in Manhattan.

Suspect Luigi Mangione faces a first-degree murder charge.

UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty addressed the vitriol against the company in an op-ed published in The New York Times in late December 2024.

""We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people's frustrations with it. No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It's a patchwork built over decades. Our mission is to help make it work better,"" Witty wrote, adding that the nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealthcare, was willing to partner with healthcare providers, employers, patients, pharmaceutical companies, governments and others to find ways to deliver high-quality care and lower costs.

Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital (HHMH) recently thought it was the victim of a ransomware demand, but it turns out the incident was actually an elaborate social engineering hoax.

Earlier this month, the hospital received correspondence implying that an outside organization had gained access to HHMH Information Systems over the past several weeks and demanded a ransom payment to keep the data unpublished.

Staff immediately contacted authorities and worked closely with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, along with hospital Cyber Security partners, to assess the validity of the threat, according to HHMH. 

The district confirmed that the mailed ransom notes were a social engineering hoax, with no evidence linking them to actual ransomware attacks. It was also verified that there were no IT compromises that occurred over that time.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

HHMH isn't the only entity targeted with fake ransomware demands. The American Hospital Association and the FBI have also received data extortion letters by mail, the AHA said earlier this month.

The letters mostly purport to be from the Russian ransomware group known as BianLian. They also contain a U.S.-based return address of ""BianLian Group"" originating from Boston, the FBI said.

The threat actors claim to have a large amount of sensitive patient health information and other personally identifiable information, and they threaten to publish the data unless a ransom is paid. But they offer no proof, only a ransom demand and payment method.

""It is highly unusual and highly unlikely that a real foreign ransomware group would send hard copy letters through the USPS,"" John Riggi, AHA national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, said by statement. ""I have personally reviewed the letters and discussed the situation with some of the victim organizations and the FBI. The consensus reached was that these extortion attempts were most likely hoaxes. If a healthcare organization receives such a letter, it is recommended that they contact their local FBI office and have a report filed with the agency. It is also recommended that the letter and accompanying envelope be handled minimally and preserved in a larger paper envelope for possible fingerprint and forensic examination by law enforcement. Further information on this issue is forthcoming by FBI."" 

THE LARGER TREND

As of October, 389 healthcare institutions in the U.S. were attacked with ransomware in 2024, which caused network shutdowns, offline systems, rescheduled appointments and delays in critical procedures, a Microsoft report found.

The report, which aggregated information from other reports and datasets, cited a Comparitech analysis showing that the attacks are costly – healthcare organizations lose up to $900,000 per day on downtime alone, the data showed.

According to a recent U.S. government interagency report cited by Microsoft, ransomware attacks have surged by 300% since 2015, largely because ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has lowered the barrier to entry for hackers who lack technical expertise, with other ransomware groups finding safe harbor in Russia.

Out of the 99 healthcare organizations that admitted to paying the ransom and disclosed the ransom paid, the median payment was $1.5 million, and the average payment was $4.4 million, according to the HIPAA Journal.

MISSOULA, Mont. – Concerns over healthcare funding brought dozens of protesters to the office of U.S. Senator Steve Daines in Missoula. The demonstration took place outside the Union Club, where activists gathered to express their worries about potential budget cuts.

Protesters held signs with messages like ""Save Medicaid"" and ""Care, Not Cuts."" The protest was in response to discussions on Capitol Hill regarding possible reductions in healthcare program funding.

Celeste Thompson, a home health worker who joined the protest, shared her concerns. ""My job is on the line because I do home health and Medicaid dollars pays my wages,"" she said. ""My clients and that... they... they will lose their hours, and then that will make me lose my hours.""

In response to the protest, a spokesperson for Senator Daines provided a statement. ""Senator Daines supports Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. He also supports efforts to address waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs – the same stance as President Trump. Senator Daines has been in close contact with the DOGE team and believes they are doing important work identifying instances of wasteful spending, and then the appropriate agencies are able to decide what to do from there.""

Protesters say they will continue to push for answers, while Senator Daines' office focuses on addressing waste in the system.

Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH recently announced that its subsidiary, Molina Healthcare of Illinois, has been selected as one of four organizations to provide a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) in Illinois. This contract, awarded by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, positions Molina Healthcare for strategic growth while enhancing its service offerings for dual-eligible beneficiaries.

This new contract will replace Illinois' existing Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative, which currently covers approximately 73,000 beneficiaries. With the go-live date set for Jan. 1, 2026, Molina Healthcare of Illinois stands to gain from the transition as it strengthens its foothold in the state's healthcare landscape.

In December 2024, MOH secured wins by expanding its services to dual-eligible populations in Michigan and Idaho. Contract wins like these are expected to increase the overall membership and drive premiums. Premiums remain the most significant contributor to a health insurer's top line. As of Dec. 31, 2024, MOH's Medicaid and Medicare membership grew 7.7% and 40.7% year over year, respectively. For 2025, management estimates Medicaid and Medicare membership to be around 5 million and 250,000, respectively.

By integrating care services more efficiently under the new D-SNP model, Molina Healthcare can enhance patient outcomes while streamlining operations, potentially driving cost savings and improved member retention. This latest success reaffirms Molina Healthcare's commitment to serving vulnerable populations and positions the company for continued expansion in the competitive healthcare market. It expects total revenues to rise approximately 8% year over year in 2025.

Shares of Molina Healthcare have gained 7.6% over the past three months compared with the industry's 3.1% growth. MOH currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

JPMorgan Chase mismanaged employee health benefits, resulting in past and present employees paying inflated prices for prescription drugs and other health care costs, a lawsuit filed last week alleges.

Filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the lawsuit accuses central Ohio's largest private employer of failing its employees by agreeing to overcharges in prescription drugs by the company's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), CVS Caremark. As a PBM, Caremark sets the drug prices for JPMorgan Chase's employee health plans.

JPMorgan Chase employs roughly 20,000 people in central Ohio. The lawsuit is being brought by both current and former employees across the country.

The consequence, according to the lawsuit, is JPMorgan Chase itself and employees and their families paying an average of over 200 times the cost for hundreds of generic prescription drugs available at drastically cheaper prices, even for the uninsured.

One example includes the plan's purchase of the multiple sclerosis drug teriflunomide, which was allegedly bought at a price of $6,229. At retail pharmacies, the drug can be purchased for around $30 without insurance. A drug price like this paid by a health plan can result in higher out-of-pocket costs and higher premiums for participants, while much of the money is pocketed by a PBM.

The lawsuit further alleges that any lack of oversight by the company is ""willful"" and violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

ERISA is a federal law that aims to protect the interests of participants in a health plan, by setting industry standards and the fiduciary responsibilities of employers and others who control health plans. The lawsuit accuses JPMorgan Chase of abandoning that ""fiduciary responsibility"" by agreeing to inflated drug prices to the detriment of their employees, even though less expensive options and health plan models were available.

""No prudent fiduciary would agree or allow for its plan and participants/beneficiaries pay a price that is more than two hundred times higher than the price available to any individual who just walks into a pharmacy and pays out-of-pocket, and five hundred sixty times higher than the price available with just a few clicks online,"" the lawsuit reads.

JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit.

The profusion of artificial intelligence tools in clinical practice is leading to the development of new health system roles such as the chief health AI officer. In one such move, the University of California San Francisco has named an inaugural executive director of AI monitoring in clinical care.In this new role within the Division of Clinical Informatics and Digital Transformation (DoC-IT), Jinoos Yazdany, M.D., M.P.H., will spearhead the development of the foundational components of the Impact Monitoring Platform for Clinical Care (IMPACC), a real-time AI monitoring platform designed to continuously evaluate the efficacy, safety, fairness, and overall value of AI tools deployed at UCSF Health. A central focus of her role will also be to expand access to data on AI implementations, ensuring that UCSF's research community can leverage these data to drive innovative research.Yazdany serves as chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and is the UCSF Alice Betts Endowed Professor of Medicine. As a rheumatologist specializing in systemic lupus, she practices at ZSFG and co-directs the UCSF Health Lupus Clinic.In her new role, she will work closely with Sara Murray, M.D., UCSF's chief health AI officer; Julia Adler-Milstein, Ph.D., chief of DoC-IT; and Hossein Soleimani, Ph.D., senior data scientist.“AI is no longer just hype—it's fundamentally transforming the way we deliver healthcare,” Yazdany said in a statement. “For example, the AI scribe I use in the clinic feels like a leap forward, freeing me from my keyboard so I can be fully present with my patients. What excites me most is ensuring we strategically deploy AI tools and evaluate whether they improve patient outcomes and increase the joy of practicing medicine.”

As AI becomes more deeply embedded in healthcare, we must take an active approach to monitoring,”  she added. “IMPACC will be essential to ensuring these technologies are not only safe but also fair and truly beneficial for both patients and our health system. Our team aims to set the gold standard for AI oversight, ensuring these tools earn our trust and truly enhance patient care.”In the near term, UCSF said IMPACC will deploy robust, readily implementable metrics to ensure AI tools are safe and effective, while simultaneously building a research pipeline to pioneer new monitoring approaches. Beyond UCSF, the open-source AI-monitoring metrics developed by the IMPACC team will enable institutions nationwide to learn from and tailor evidence-based strategies to their own needs.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Chang Robotics, an autonomous technology and engineering leader, is excited to introduce Curabotics, a new company dedicated to improving healthcare through automation, robotics, and AI. Curabotics seeks to transform hospital systems by addressing critical healthcare challenges, including labor shortages, burnout, inefficiencies, rising costs, and patient outcomes.

In response to inquiries regarding their new company, Chang Robotics' president and Curabotics co-founder, Kate McAfoose, shared, ""Curabotics will focus exclusively on healthcare automation. In addition to our already proven Nurse-Assist robots and robotic pharmacy, Curabotics offers a comprehensive range of technology to improve efficiency, diagnostics, and patient outcomes.""

""We have invited the best technology providers in the industry to participate in our platform,"" McAfoose added. ""My mom is a career RN, so using our robotic capabilities to get this right is personal for me.""

The name Curabotics, derived from the Latin word ""Cura"" (meaning ""care""), reflects the company's mission to enhance patient care through robotics and automation.

Proven Results: The Need for Automation in Healthcare

The demand for hospital automation has never been more urgent. Staff shortages reached critical levels in 2024, with replacement costs exceeding $53,250 per nurse. When we examine the issues of staff shortages, burnout, early retirement, and turnover among licensed professionals (such as technicians, nurses, physician assistants, and doctors), the costs are staggering: each major hospital loses between $21 million and $43 million annually due to workforce issues. Conversely, every gain in operational efficiency creates significant additional revenue and opportunities.

A two-year pilot study conducted by Chang Robotics at a leading U.S. hospital demonstrated the impact of automation on nurse workload and patient care. The study identified a time savings of up to 40% when hospitals implement multiple robotic functions, allowing healthcare professionals to dedicate more time to direct patient care. 

Thus far, Curabotics has achieved the following use cases:

Use Case 1 - the Nurse-Assist Bots resulted in:

Use Case 2 - the Robotic Pharmacy resulted in:

Use Case 3 – the ""autonomous building"" resulted in robotic control of:

In all, we anticipate the Curabotics solutions will have a massive impact on efficiency and profitability gains in the coming seasons for healthcare organizations of every size.

A Holistic Approach to Healthcare Innovation

Curabotics will leverage deep engineering expertise and successful track record to develop and deploy innovative automation solutions tailored to the healthcare industry. The company offers a comprehensive suite of technologies to streamline hospital workflows and improve patient care. Key offerings include:

Process Automation:

Diagnostic & Surgery Innovation:

These solutions allow hospitals to improve operational efficiency and lessen the burden on providers, while unlocking new data insights.

Leadership Spotlight: Riyad Twahir, Managing Director of Curabotics

Riyad Twahir will lead the new company as the managing director of Curabotics. With a background in process transformation, enterprise technology solutions, and autonomous robotic systems, Twahir brings a vision for scaling automation to enhance healthcare efficiency. ""I'm very excited about this opportunity to address the systemic issues in healthcare. These are universal problems, and I look forward to collaborating with healthcare partners to provide business-driven solutions that improve patient care,"" said Riyad Twahir.

Oops, something went wrong

As the Q4 earnings season comes to a close, it's time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the healthcare providers & services industry, including Pediatrix Medical Group (NYSE:MD) and its peers.

The healthcare providers and services sector, encompassing insurers to hospitals to outpatient care facilities, benefit from the consistent demand for healthcare services. Stable or even recurring revenues can be earned through insurance premiums, patient care contracts, and testing services agreements. However, the business models face challenges such as high operational costs especially if significant labor is involved. Reimbursement pressures from public and private payers can impact margins and an evolving regulatory landscape adds uncertainty to it all. Looking forward, this sector is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as the aging population, which means rising prevalence of chronic diseases. There is also broad demand for value-based care models, which emphasize cost efficiency and patient outcomes. Advances in telehealth, data analytics, and personalized medicine are likely to create new revenue opportunities for companies that can successfully digitize. However, headwinds abound, including labor shortages in clinical settings, continued reimbursement cuts, and regulatory scrutiny over pricing and care quality.

The 40 healthcare providers & services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts' consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line.

In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.

With a network of approximately 2,620 affiliated physicians caring for some of the most vulnerable patients, Pediatrix Medical Group (NYSE:MD) provides specialized physician services focused on neonatal, maternal-fetal, pediatric cardiology and other pediatric subspecialty care across 37 states.

Pediatrix Medical Group reported revenues of $502.4 million, up 1.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts' expectations by 3.6%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' same-store sales and EPS estimates.

“Our strong fourth quarter results reflect continued top-line outperformance versus our expectations, the completion of our portfolio restructuring, and the related overhead expense reductions,” said Mark S. Ordan, Chief Executive Officer of Pediatrix Medical Group.

The stock is down 2.9% since reporting and currently trades at $13.71.

Transforming how doctors care for seniors by shifting financial incentives from volume to outcomes, agilon health (NYSE:AGL) provides a platform that helps primary care physicians transition to value-based care models for Medicare patients through long-term partnerships and global capitation arrangements.

agilon health reported revenues of $1.52 billion, up 44.2% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a softer quarter as it posted full-year EBITDA guidance missing analysts' expectations significantly and a significant miss of analysts' EPS estimates.

agilon health delivered the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company added 2,000 customers to reach a total of 527,000. Interestingly, the stock is up 19.3% since the results and currently trades at $4.32.

Serving approximately 66,000 clients across 22 states with a focus on ""dual eligible"" Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, Addus HomeCare (NASDAQ:ADUS) provides in-home personal care, hospice, and home health services to elderly, chronically ill, and disabled individuals.

Addus HomeCare reported revenues of $297.1 million, up 7.5% year on year. This print surpassed analysts' expectations by 2.7%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter as it also put up an impressive beat of analysts' sales volume estimates and a decent beat of analysts' EPS estimates.

The stock is down 15.5% since reporting and currently trades at $91.92.

With over 80% of its revenue derived from federal government contracts, Humana (NYSE:HUM) provides health insurance plans and healthcare services to approximately 17 million members, with a strong focus on Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.

Humana reported revenues of $29.2 billion, up 13.5% year on year. This result topped analysts' expectations by 1.1%. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also logged full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts' expectations but a significant miss of analysts' EPS  estimates.

The company lost 11,000 customers and ended up with a total of 16.35 million. The stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $268.55.

Image source: United Imaging 

Situated in Patras, Greece's third-largest city, Agios Andreas Hospital is a cornerstone of healthcare for the region. Spanning five specialized buildings, it serves as a hub of medical expertise and is home to a team of dedicated doctors and nurses delivering top-tier care in fields ranging from ophthalmology and cardiology to plastic surgery and pediatrics. With a capacity of 400 beds - 188 dedicated to internal medicine and 192 to surgical care - Agios Andreas plays a pivotal role in providing comprehensive treatment to the local population. To elevate its diagnostic capabilities, Agios Andreas Hospital invested in cutting-edge PET/CT imaging technology, selecting the uMI 550 by United Imaging. 

The system is designed as a state-of-the-art solution for medical imaging, integrating functional imaging with anatomical precision. The uMI 550 stands out for its efficacy in detecting abnormalities at both the molecular and structural levels, offering diagnostic accuracy in molecular imaging. 

Image source: United Imaging 

The new system leverages several features to improve image quality, speed up acquisition and streamline workflows. These include through-silicon via (TSV) technology to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), an Integrated Light Guide to boost light collection efficiency and spatial resolution, and Point-spread-function (PSF) iterative reconstruction technique. The scanner further supports Time-of-flight (TOF) imaging, which accelerates image convergence with better contrast and considerably reduced image noise. An integrated head motion correction detects and corrects motion artifacts from list-mode data during patient scans to prevent motion blurring. 

United imaging reports that their system is also designed to minimize radiation exposure for operators, since no radioactive source is needed for automatic daily quality control (QC). Additionally, the periodic full QC accommodates both liquid 18F and solid 68Ge sources with reduced storage requirements, ensuring greater flexibility and ease of use. 

The uMI 550 is equipped with a solution package for oncology, designed to enhance tumor diagnosis and post-therapeutic evaluation directly from the operation console. This integration empowers healthcare professionals to elevate the management and care of oncological patients, driving improvements in diagnostic precision and treatment planning, the company says, concluding: ""At United Imaging, we are fully dedicated to revolutionizing imaging solutions and enhancing patient care worldwide. Thanks to the partnership with Papapostolou Healthcare Technologies, we've successfully installed the uMI 550 at Agios Andreas General Hospital, furthering our mission to increase access to advanced diagnostics on a global scale.""

This week, several vendors are partnering up and validating new tools to scale cybersecurity protections for providers, payers and healthcare innovators. 

Google announced on March 18 that it has signed an agreement to acquire Israeli cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion – it's the biggest and most expensive acquisition it's ever made.

The rapidly growing startup's technology will enable Google Cloud to improve cloud security and scale security across multiple clouds, the company says.

The Wiz security platform connects to all major clouds and code environments and can be used by organizations of all sizes to secure platforms they build and run in the cloud. 

""Enabling more companies to prevent cyberattacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents,"" Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, said in a statement.

""Businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions and greater choice in cloud computing providers,"" Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, said in a statement. ""Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.""

The company's products will remain available on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and other platforms.

Nashville-based Clearwater said Tuesday that it is the first CancerX member company to focus on advancing cybersecurity and data privacy in oncology innovation. 

The company said it will contribute its expertise and resources to educate the public-private partnership's community members, including the recently announced 2025 Accelerator cohort. 

Clearwater will work with the cohort on building cybersecurity and privacy programs that align with best practices and healthcare industry standards.

""Clearwater is honored to join such a prestigious group of organizations that are dedicated to addressing critical challenges in oncology,"" Steve Cagle, the company's CEO, said in a statement. ""As a champion, our role is to help ensure that innovation advances unabated by concern over the security and privacy of data and systems.""

CancerX is hosted by the Moffitt Cancer Center, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.

DrFirst, a provider of end-to-end medication management solutions, announced Tuesday that all of its medication management products are now HITRUST-certified and protect against current and emerging threats. 

With validated controls, customers can address cybersecurity challenges and remain cyber-resilient over time, the company said. The controls protect and effectively manage data, mitigate information and cybersecurity risks, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including HIPAA requirements. 

""Strong cybersecurity measures are essential to protecting our organization and the stakeholders who rely on us,"" G. Cameron Deemer, CEO of DrFirst, said in a statement.

Oops, something went wrong

While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC).

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors' money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

 See our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies 

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for GE HealthCare Technologies is:

24% = US$2.1b ÷ US$8.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, GE HealthCare Technologies has a superior ROE than the average (12%) in the Medical Equipment industry.

That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.

It's worth noting the high use of debt by GE HealthCare Technologies, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.03. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.

But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Of course GE HealthCare Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.

The FBI on Wednesday shared a wanted poster for Chinese national Baoxia ""Emily"" Liu, adding that the State Department is offering a reward of up to $15 million for information on her and others accused of smuggling U.S. drone weapons to Iran. 

Liu and three other fellow Chinese nationals were charged by President Joe Biden's Justice Department in January 2024 in an alleged years-long conspiracy in which they unlawfully exported and smuggled U.S. export-controlled items through China and Hong Kong to entities affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), which supervises production of Tehran's missiles, weapons, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).Her co-defendants are Li Yongxin, also known as ""Emma Lee;"" Yung Yiu Wa, also known as ""Stephen Yung;"" and Zhong Yanlai, also known as Sydney Chung.

The Department of State, now under President Donald Trump, said on Wednesday its Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $15 million ""for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms"" of the IRGC and its various branches, including the IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), which are designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). 

""The IRGC has financed numerous terrorist attacks and activities globally, including via its external proxies such as Hamas, Hizballah, and Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq,"" the State Department wrote in its announcement. ""The IRGC funds its terrorist activities — in part — through sales of military equipment, including UAVs, or drones."" 

Beginning as early as 2007, Liu and her associates ""allegedly utilized an array of front companies in the People's Republic of China (PRC) to send dual-use U.S.-origin electronic components to IRGC-linked companies that could be used in the production of UAVs, ballistic missile systems, and other military end uses,"" the State Department said, noting the IRGC and its supporters ""generate and move millions of dollars around the world by establishing and relying on front companies to procure cutting-edge technology to evade sanctions and trade controls.""

The announcement comes after Trump ordered U.S. strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the weekend, and Israel bombarded Gaza, ending its ceasefire with Iran-backed Hamas after the terror group refused multiple hostage release deals. 

Hezbollah, another Iran-backed terror group based in Lebanon, also launched a missile toward Israel, but it was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 

Trump said he sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei two weeks ago offering direct negotiations with Tehran to deter them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 

TRUMP WATCHES STRIKE ON IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS IN YEMEN IN NEW WHITE HOUSE PICS AS LARGE-SCALE OP CONTINUES

The State Department said Liu and her three co-defendants ""allegedly misrepresented the end users of dual-use U.S.-origin electronic components, leading U.S. companies to export goods to PRC-based front companies under the guise that the ultimate destination of these products was China rather than Iran.""

""As a result, a vast amount of dual-use U.S.-origin products with military capabilities have been exported from the United States to IRGC-linked companies Shiraz Electronics Industries (SEI), Rayan Roshd Afzar, and their affiliates, in violation of U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations,"" the department said.

For decades, the CIA has urged the continued secrecy of many details.

The National Archives on Tuesday released thousands of pages of declassified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

The records were posted to the National Archives' website, joining recently released records posted in 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2017-2018.

Most of what the government released tonight is not new -- in fact, much of what has attracted attention on social media and in news reports has long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees, including names and addresses, which have now been disclosed.

But the newly-declassified versions of these documents also shed light on granular details of mid-20th century espionage that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret. President Biden and President Trump had accepted those arguments, until now.

Tuesday's initial release contained 1,123 records comprising 32,000 pages. A subsequent release on Tuesday night contained 1,059 records comprising 31,400 additional pages and key takeaways from the newly released tranche of previously classified records.

Several of the newly-released pages detail how the CIA went about tapping telephones in Mexico City between in December 1962 and January 1963 to monitor the communications of the Soviets and Cubans at their diplomatic facilities, which Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald visited in the months before the assassination.

The previously-redacted pages spell out specific instructions for CIA operatives on how to wiretap, including the use of certain chemicals to create markings on telephone devices that could only be seen by other spies under UV light.

For decades, the CIA has urged the continued secrecy of these details out of fear that they would reveal the methods of the agency's spy craft.

Another newly-disclosed portion details CIA surveillance of Soviet embassies in Mexico City and efforts to recruit double agents from Soviet agency personnel -- and reveal the names and positions of those who were recruited.

The CIA officials writing these memos tout the efficacy of their efforts, with one trumpeting, ""I cannot help but feel that we are buying a great deal for our money in this project.""

The memo also details the CIA's surveillance of an American man described as a Communist living in Mexico. The bulk of the memo is a listing of phone numbers that were tapped by the U.S. government. This file has long been sought by researchers due to Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City, but the document includes no mention of Oswald by name.

The material shed new light on U.S. covert activities in Cuba targeting revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

Unredacted text of a June 1961 memo on the CIA -- sent to Kennedy by aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr. -- contained harsh criticism of the spy agency just months after its backing of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion.

Some of the other documents also detailed operations to potentially overthrow Castro. One 1964 document showed that two intelligence assets discussed potentially assassinating Castro under the administration of President Lyndon Johnson.

The document said the CIA was allegedly ""formerly in favor of such a plan,"" but it was ""shelved"" due to the opposition of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.

Another previously released document detailed RFK being briefed on potential plans to kill Castro. ""RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again,"" a footnote of the document read.

Schlesinger had also argued to Kennedy that the CIA's reliance on ""controlled American sources"" had been encroaching on the traditional functions of the State Department, and that the CIA may have been seeking to infiltrate the politics of America's allies.

At the U.S. embassy in Paris, for example, Schlesinger wrote that the ""CIA has even sought to monopolize contact with certain French political personalities, among them the President of the National Assembly,""

Newly declassified portions of Schlesinger's notes also revealed the number of CIA sources in Austria and Chile.

The release included 77 documents regarding RFK, with most of the documents relating to his activities as attorney general and senator, totaling about 2,500 pages.

Of those, only two directly mentioned his assassination in 1968. An intelligence document from 1968 -- previously released in 2018 -- discusses how RFK's assassination stoked interest in his brother's assassination and New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation into the matter.

""The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion against the United States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister 'political murder conspiracy,'"" the dispatch said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with President Trump on Wednesday, following Trump's call on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump said on social media that he had spoken with Zelenskyy for about an hour.

""Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,"" Trump said.

A statement by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the conversation as ""fantastic"" and said Trump ""fully briefed"" Zelenskyy on Tuesday's conversation with Putin. The statement said Zelenskyy thanked Trump for ongoing meetings of officials and for U.S. military support, ""especially the Javelin missiles that President Trump was first to provide.""

Zelenskyy asked for additional air defense systems, the statement said, particularly Patriot missile systems, and ""President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.""

""The two leaders also agreed on a partial ceasefire against energy,"" the statement said. ""Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the ceasefire to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. They agreed this could be the first step toward the full end of the war and ensuring security.""

Trump suggested that the U.S. ""could be very helpful"" to Ukraine in running its power plants, the statement also said. ""American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" it said.

In a social media post, Zelenskyy called the conversation ""positive, very substantive, and frank"" and said, ""In further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security guarantees."" He said the conversation ""touched on the issue of the release of POWs, and the return of Ukrainian children who were taken by Russian forces."" The statement by Rubio and Waltz noted that ""President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.""

Despite Putin's agreement to halt attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Russian forces launched drone and missile strikes overnight, targeting energy facilities and transport infrastructure. Two hospitals were also hit.

""Even this night after Putin's talk with President Trump, when Putin allegedly said he had given the order to stop strikes on the Ukrainian energy targets, 150 drones hit energy infrastructure, transport, unfortunately two hospitals,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Helsinki, Finland. ""Putin's words are very different from reality.""

Zelenskyy met with Finland's president, who suggested Russia should accept the full land, sea and air ceasefire that American and Ukrainians negotiators had agreed was the way forward.

Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about Russia's commitment to the ceasefire and emphasized the need for continued international support for Ukraine. He stated that pressure on Russia is essential for achieving peace and cautioned against making concessions, particularly regarding Western aid to Ukraine.

""There are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: yes or no ... but no conditions,"" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said at a news conference with Zelenskyy.

The defense minister of Germany, which is the second-biggest aid donor to Ukraine after the U.S., said Putin is ""playing a game.""

""We've seen that attacks on civilian infrastructure have not eased at all in the first night after this supposedly groundbreaking, great phone call"" between Putin and Trump, said Boris Pistorius in an interview with German public television.

The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, stressed that the Kremlin's demand to halt military aid to Kyiv is unacceptable.

""What Russia wants is that Ukraine will let all the guards down,"" Kallas said on Euronews television. ""If they achieve that 'no military aid to Ukraine,' then they are free to continue, because the Ukrainians can't defend themselves. So I mean, clearly this can't work.""

She also said the EU and its member nations must be part of any discussions.

""For an agreement to work, the Europeans must be at the table to approve it. Its implementation must be in Europe's hands.""

Zelenskyy has taken pains to show he wants talks to work, after a heated encounter with Trump and Vice President Vance at the White House last month. The Ukrainian leader says he believes the war can end this year, as Ukraine has security guarantees. ""Otherwise, Putin will come again with war,"" he said in Helsinki.

WASHINGTON, March 18, 2025 – Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins celebrated National Agriculture Day, reinforcing the importance of American farmers, ranchers, and producers as outlined in President Donald J. Trump's official proclamation marking the occasion.

“Today on National Agriculture Day, we recognize the people who make it all possible. The farmers, the ranchers, and the producers who dedicate their lives to feeding, to fueling, and to clothing our nation,” said Secretary Rollins. “Every day, through challenges and triumphs, the men and women in agriculture show up. They adapt, they solve problems, and they push forward ensuring that future generations can continue this proud tradition. To every farmer, to every rancher, and to every producer, we see you, we appreciate you, and we thank you.”

In his proclamation, President Trump underscored the essential role of American agriculture in the nation's economy and way of life: 

 “From the earliest days of our Republic, our farmers and agricultural communities have been the source of American success — enduring the elements and defying hard conditions to cultivate our land and feed the people. Farming is indelibly engrained in our history, customs, and culture, and stands to this day as the bedrock of our economy and way of life."" 

 “For centuries, American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of the American economy.  Today and every day, we extend our unending gratitude to the dedicated men and women in farming communities who embody the timeless virtues of hard work and self-reliance.  As we continue our new chapter of American prosperity, we commit to embolden the heroes of our agricultural community who work tirelessly with their unwavering American pride to nourish our Nation, feed our families, and fuel our way of life.” 

 In honor of National Agriculture Week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is highlighting the voices of farmers, ranchers, and producers from across the country who embody the resilience and commitment that sustain American agriculture.

A view is pictured of the United States Institute of Peace building headquarters on March 18 in Washington, DC.

(CNN) The US Institute of Peace has filed suit against the Trump administration after the Department of Government Efficiency's takeover of the independent organization and gutting of its board.

A lawsuit filed Tuesday in DC district court seeks “the immediate intervention of this Court to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute and irreparably impairing Plaintiffs' ability to perform their vital peace promotion and conflict resolution work as tasked by Congress.”

The suit was filed after DOGE personnel, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week. That dramatic escalation followed the Trump administration's Friday gutting of the organization's board. The Trump administration has faced several losses in the courts.

USIP, which works to resolve conflict, is not a federal agency. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984, and USIP owns and manages its headquarters.

A declaration filed as part of the lawsuit from the institute's chief security officer alleges that the one USIP employee who “possesses the technological capability to access the Infrastructure and to grant others access” was traveling to Washington, DC, “at the behest of DOGE … in order to access the Infrastructure and grant access to DOGE as soon as the evening of March 18, 2025.”

Another memorandum of support states that “USIP also has reason to believe that Defendants or those working in concert with them are currently in the USIP building, causing physical damage to the premises and physically accessing and disposing of USIP financial records.”

It included a photo taken Tuesday of a trash can full of files, some of which appear financial, marked “SHRED.”

The complaint argues the administration's actions, including alleged destruction and modification of files, are causing “irreparable harm” against USIP. It asks the court to block the “trespass by Defendants against real and personal property belonging to the Institute” and prohibit them from “maintaining, retaining, gaining, or exercising any access or control over Plaintiffs' offices, facilities, computer systems, accounts, or any other records, files, or resources, and from acting or purporting to act in the name of Institute, and from using the Institute's name, emblem, badge, seal, and any other mark of recognition of the Institute.”

The complaint specifically calls on the court to declare the Trump administration's efforts to oust the USIP board of directors and its acting president “null and void.” It asks for an injunction saying that those individuals may not be removed unless the court finds that it complies with the law and gives its “express permission.”

Under the USIP Act, most of the bipartisan board of directors is appointed by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Last week, the White House said they were terminating most of those members, who include President Donald Trump's former ambassador to Russia. According to the lawsuit, the termination emails from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel “did not state any justification for the purported terminations.”

The three remaining members of the board – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin – said they were removing the acting president, Amb. George Moose and installing Trump appointee Kenneth Jackson. The suit alleges that appointment is not valid and asks the court to declare that Moose “lawfully remains the president of the Institute.”

The case has been assigned to Judge Beryl Howell.

The records were posted to the National Archives' website, joining recently released records posted in 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2017-2018.

""This release consists of approximately 80,000 pages of previously-classified records that will be published with no redactions,"" said the announcement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""Additional documents withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and records subject to section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, must be unsealed before release.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 23 directing the release of all remaining records related to the assassination, saying it was in the ""public interest"" to do so.

Tuesday's initial release contained 1,123 records comprising 32,000 pages. A subsequent release on Tuesday night contained 1,059 records comprising 31,400 additional pages.

Among the material was the long-awaited, unredacted text of a June 1961 memo on the CIA, sent to President Kennedy by aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr. The memo contained harsh criticism of the spy agency just months after the CIA backed the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion of Fidel Castro's Cuba.

Previously-released versions of the 63-year-old memo had contained more than a full page of redactions -- classification markings that generated a great deal of interest among researchers and conspiracy theorists, particularly those who hold the unsubstantiated view that the CIA may have played a role in Kennedy's killing.

Schlesinger had argued to Kennedy that the CIA's reliance on ""controlled American sources"" had been encroaching on the traditional functions of the State Department, and that the CIA may have been seeking to infiltrate the politics of America's allies.

""CIA today has nearly as many people under official cover overseas as State,"" Schlesinger wrote in 1961, adding that in certain countries, the CIA's presence ""outnumbers regular State Department personnel.""

The previously-classified portion of the memo cites the specific number of CIA personnel that had been stationed at the U.S. embassy in Paris, where ""CIA has even sought to monopolize contact with certain French political personalities, among them the President of the National Assembly,"" the memo said.

Schlesinger also details the number of CIA sources in Austria and Chile, information in the memo that had been classified until now.

Several of the newly-released pages detail how the CIA went about tapping telephones in Mexico City between in December 1962 and January 1963 to monitor the communications of the Soviets and Cubans at their diplomatic facilities, which Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald visited in the months before the assassination.

The previously-redacted pages spell out specific instructions for CIA operatives on how to wiretap, including the use of certain chemicals to create markings on telephone devices that could only be seen by other spies under UV light.

For decades, the CIA has urged the continued secrecy of these details out of fear that they would reveal the methods of the agency's spy craft.

One 79-page record contains 15 newly unredacted pages -- though several of them remain unreadable due to the degraded quality of the typeface after many rounds of photocopy duplication.

The newly-disclosed portions detail CIA surveillance of Soviet embassies in Mexico City and efforts to recruit double agents from Soviet agency personnel -- and reveal the names and positions of those who were recruited. The CIA officials writing these memos tout the efficacy of their efforts, with one trumpeting, ""I cannot help but feel that we are buying a great deal for our money in this project.""

The memo also details the CIA's surveillance of an American man described as a Communist living in Mexico. The bulk of the memo is a listing of phone numbers that were tapped by the U.S. government. This file has long been sought by researchers due to Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City, but the document includes no mention of Oswald by name.

""The first JFK files release of 2025 is an encouraging start,"" Jefferson Morley of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a nonprofit that operates a database of government records on the Kennedy assassination, said on X. ""We now have complete versions of approximately a third of the redacted JFK documents held by the National Archives (1,124 of approximately 3,500 documents ). Rampant overclassification of trivial information has been eliminated and there appear to be no redactions, though we have not viewed every document.""

""Seven of ten JFK files held by the Archives and sought by JFK researchers are now in the public record. These long-secret records shed new light on JFK's mistrust of the CIA, the Castro assassination plots, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and CIA propaganda operations involving Oswald,"" Morley posted. ""The release does not include two thirds of the promised files nor any of 500-plus IRS record, nor any of the 2,400 recently discovered FBI files. Nonetheless, this is most positive news on the declassification of JFK files since the 1990s.""

Many of the documents have long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret.

One such document from August 1966 recommends a ""certificate of distinction"" for a CIA official who led the spy agency's technical division. Previous releases of the same document contained redactions striking sentences that described how this individual led a team that ""conceived and developed"" the use of ""fluoroscopic scanning"" and X-rays, which allowed the CIA to ""detect hidden technical listening devices"" for the first time. The official, James McCord, would go on to become head of security for Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972 -- and gain infamy for his role as one of the Watergate burglars whose break-in precipitated the Watergate scandal of the 1970s.

The release of the JFK materials comes a day after Trump announced to reporters that the administration would begin releasing the records on Tuesday, prompting a scramble inside the Justice Department to free up attorneys to assist with the declassification process.

Congress voted in 1992 to require the government to release and declassify all records related to the assassination and subsequent investigations by 2017, but that deadline was repeatedly pushed back by Trump and President Joe Biden due to national security concerns.

Tuesday's release represents a small, outstanding tranche of the more than six million pages of Kennedy assassination records collected by the National Archives -- the majority of which have already been declassified and are available online or in person for review, according to the agency.

Also released Tuesday were 57 documents referencing Martin Luther King Jr., 35 of which relate to his 1968 assassination, and 77 documents referencing Robert F. Kennedy, two of which relate to his assassination the same year.

An intelligence document from 1968 -- previously released in 2018 -- discusses how RFK's assassination stoked interest in his brother's assassination and New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation into the matter.

""The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion against the United States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister 'political murder conspiracy,'"" the dispatch said.

Some of the other documents detailed operations to potentially overthrow Castro in Cuba. According to a 1964 document, two intelligence assets discussed potentially assassinating Castro under the administration of Lyndon Johnson.

""CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however, inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY Would have no part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been brought up again for consideration,"" the document said.

Another previously released document detailed RFK being briefed on potential plans to kill Castro.

""RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again,"" a footnote of the document read.

Some of the documents appear to have originated from the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission. In a 1964 intelligence document, a station chief noted an interest in developing a source whose daughter is a secretary in RFK's senate office. That document was released in 2018.

	And it uses far less energy than ChatGPT and similar bots

DeepSeek is one example of an AI reasoning agent. This new type of AI can “think” through tasks and plan out actions. When paired with a robot, an agent allows the automaton to anticipate needs and then act on them.

Have you tried out DeepSeek? Released on January 20, this new artificial intelligence tool quickly became the world's most downloaded free app. It held that spot for several days. More than 22 million people were using it to chat, assist with writing or coding and more.

Such bots are tools built on top of a type of AI known as a large language model. New AI bots pop up all the time. Some of the best known — ChatGPT, Grok, Claude and Gemini — can all perform similar tasks.

So what made DeepSeek special? It matches the performance of the best of those. But it needs less energy to do so, explains Vijay Gadepally. A lot less. That makes it “better for the environment per unit of work,” he explains.

Gadepally is a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington. There, he works on boosting the efficiency of AI models and the computers that run them. He did not take part in DeepSeek's development.

AI models have a reputation for being energy hogs. But the team that made the DeepSeek bot found clever innovations to slim down the processes of both developing and running AI models, says Gadepally. This “was very novel,” he says.

That team was part of a company based in Hangzhou, China. It announced the energy-saving approach last December 27 on arXiv. A month later, this company — which is also, confusingly, named DeepSeek — released a new bot. It had been built on top of a slimmer AI model.

People call this new bot DeepSeek. Its technical name, however, is DeepSeek-R1.

It can answer questions like an ordinary chatbot. But it's actually something new. This new type of bot is known as a reasoning agent.

Thank you for signing up!

There was a problem signing you up.

A chatbot answers one question at a time. A reasoning agent doesn't. It can “take a complex task and break it into smaller pieces,” explains Gadepally.

Your initial question or request goes into the underlying AI model, which comes up with an answer.

But the agent doesn't stop there. It uses the first answer to ask itself more questions. This process is somewhat similar to what people do when they think over a task.

Researchers call this a chain-of-thought. Depending on the difficulty of the task, this process can take a few seconds or as much as a half hour. During this time, questions and answers are “bouncing around inside the model,” says Gadepally.

Reasoning agents are most useful when paired with search engines, robots and other technology. When this happens, questions and answers bounce in and out of the model, too. The reasoning agent acts sort of like a brain to direct other tools. This entire system can then “act on your behalf and actually perform some activity,” Gadepally explains.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has also developed AI models that support this sort of system. Its first one was called o1.

This model (or newer versions of it) support several agents. One agent is called Operator. It has access to a web browser, so it can do such things as book appointments for you. Another agent, called Deep Research, uses search engines. It can gather information and create a custom report.

The newsletter Understanding AI had 19 people try out Deep Research. Seven of them said the tool accomplished work similar to what a professional in their field could do. But OpenAI charges $200 per month for a subscription to this agent. And to use o1 directly, you must pay $60 for every million words of output.

When the DeepSeek-R1 agent came out, it could do the same sorts of tasks as agents built on top of o1. But DeepSeek's model is far more efficient. It cost just $2.19 for every million words.

This shocked many experts. “I can get a lot more intelligence [for the same amount of computing power],” Jeremie Harris said on his podcast, Last Week in AI. “That is the DeepSeek story.”

“It's absolutely impressive,” he adds. “This is legit.” (In addition to co-hosting this podcast, Harris runs Gladstone AI, a company based in Washington, D.C.)

Another benefit to DeepSeek: Its maker has shared how it built the reasoning agent and the model that runs it. Techies call this open-source tech. ChatGPT's developer, OpenAI, has taken a different approach. It's kept technical details of its bot and platform secret.

“Open-source tools give you the benefit of peeking under the hood and seeing what's going on,” says Avijit Ghosh. Based in Boston, Mass., he's an expert in AI ethics at the company Hugging Face. This company runs a platform for open-source AI development.

Anyone can now build their own version of DeepSeek. Some have already done so. The AI company Perplexity launched a free Deep Research tool in February. It's built using a modified version of DeepSeek-R1.

AI companies often describe their reasoning agents as “thinking” machines. That can be misleading. These agents do perform impressive feats. But they don't work like our brains do. They are built on the same sorts of AI models as chatbots. That means they can suffer some of the same drawbacks.

They may produce biased content, for instance. Or people can jailbreak them to get around safety guardrails. And these bots may sometimes confidently provide wrong information, a problem called hallucinating.

When an agent uses a model to perform a complex task on its own, a bunch of small problems can also snowball into bigger ones, notes Ghosh. And that worries him.  

He co-authored a paper on arXiv in February that sums it up: “Fully autonomous AI agents should not be developed.” Being “fully autonomous,” explains Ghosh, means being able to act entirely on its own.

Science News Explores reached out to DeepSeek for comment but the company didn't respond.

DeepSeek-R1 and similar bots aren't fully autonomous yet. They can do more complex tasks than chatbots. Yet a real person still guides the process. And Ghosh thinks that's essential. “I don't think [these systems] are nearly as reliable and as accountable as humans,” he says.

But things are moving quickly. In late February, the robot company Figure AI announced a new AI model called Helix. Robots that use this model are better at reasoning.

In early March, a different Chinese company, named Monica, announced a brand new agent named Manus. It's built atop a handful of different AI models. It's also close to fully autonomous. When you give it a task, it decides on its own how it should solve it. Then it starts taking actions, such as searching online, writing code, creating charts and more. This all happens (in the cloud) while you wait. Manus then alerts you when its task is done.

And consider this: Companies like DeepSeek, Monica and OpenAI can now use their agents to come up with ideas on how to build better reasoning models.

Harris, of Last Week in AI, is confident that this is already happening. How well they will work remains to be seen. Clearly, it's an exciting time for AI innovation.

This is one in a series presenting news on technology and innovation, made possible with generous support from the Lemelson Foundation.

agent: A person or thing (it can be a chemical or even a form of energy) that plays some role in getting something done.

artificial intelligence: A type of knowledge-based decision-making exhibited by machines or computers. The term also refers to the field of study in which scientists try to create machines or computer software capable of intelligent behavior.

arXiv: A website that posts research papers — often before they are formally published — in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. Anyone can read a posted paper at no charge.

autonomous: Acting independently. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, pilot themselves based on instructions that have been programmed into their computer guidance system.

bot: (short for web robot) A computer program designed to appear that its actions come from some human. The goal is to have it interact with people or perform automated tasks such as finding and sharing online information through social-media accounts.

browser: (in computing) The software program or application that someone uses to find and retrieve information from Web pages on the internet.

chatbot: A computer program created to seemingly converse with human users. Modern ones (such as Siri, Alexa, Ocelot and Sprinklr) can retrieve information over the internet about news events or classroom topics. Many even work as digital assistants to answer questions about purchases, products or scheduling on behalf of stores, pharmacies or banks.

cloud: (in computing) A network of computers (hardware), known as servers, which are connected to the internet. They can be used to store data and computer programs (software) that can be accessed by one or many people at once, and from anywhere in the world.

coding: (in computing) A term for developing computer programming — or software — that performs a particular, desired computational task.

development: (in engineering) The growth or change of something from an idea to a prototype.

engine: (in computer science) A computer program that performs a particular, narrow range of functions.

environment: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).

ethics: (adj. ethical) A code of conduct for how people interact with others and their environment. To be ethical, people should treat others fairly, avoid cheating or dishonesty in any form and avoid taking or using more than their fair share of resources (which means, to avoid greed). Ethical behavior also would not put others at risk without alerting people to the dangers beforehand and having them choose to accept the potential risks. Experts who work in this field are known as ethicists.

field: An area of study, as in: Her field of research is biology. Also a term to describe a real-world environment in which some research is conducted, such as at sea, in a forest, on a mountaintop or on a city street. It is the opposite of an artificial setting, such as a research laboratory.

innovation: (v. to innovate; adj. innovative) An adaptation or improvement to an existing idea, process or product that is new, clever, more effective or more practical.

large language model: (in computing) Language models are a type of machine learning. They attempt to predict upcoming words (in text or speech) and then present those predictions using words that almost anyone should understand. The models learn to do this by reviewing large quantities of text or speech. As their name would imply, large language models train using enormous troves of data. They organize and make sense of those data using “neural nets” — a scheme patterned a bit off of the pathways of nerves in the human brain (and for whose development the 2024 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded). Large language models don't just learn words, but also phrases made of many words. They can even learn from the context in which a new phrase and idea is worded (meaning the words that accompany those phrases or in which those phrases have been embedded).

model: A simulation of a real-world event (usually using a computer) that has been developed to predict one or more likely outcomes. Or an individual that is meant to display how something would work in or look on others.

podcast: A digital audio or video series that can be downloaded from the Internet to your computer or smartphone. Some podcasts also are shows that are broadcast on radio, television or other media.

robot: A machine that can sense its environment, process information and respond with specific actions. Some robots can act without any human input, while others are guided by a human.

search engine: (in computing) A computer program that allows a computer to search for information on the Internet. Common examples include Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo.

system: A network of parts that together work to achieve some function. For instance, the blood, vessels and heart are primary components of the human body's circulatory system. Similarly, trains, platforms, tracks, roadway signals and overpasses are among the potential components of a nation's railway system. System can even be applied to the processes or ideas that are part of some method or ordered set of procedures for getting a task done.

technology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry — or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts.

unit: (in measurements) A unit of measurement is a standard way of expressing a physical quantity. Units of measure provide context for what numerical values represent and so convey the magnitude of physical properties. Examples include inches, kilograms, ohms, gauss, decibels, kelvins and nanoseconds.

web: (in computing) An abbreviation of World Wide Web, it is a slang term for the internet.

Data centers power the digital world, storing and processing the vast amounts of information that keep businesses and web-based services running. According to Wangda Zuo, Penn State professor of architectural engineering in the College of Engineering and associate director for research at the Global Building Network, the operating costs for data centers are rising. He said for data centers, cooling is often the primary expense after IT. Servers generate significant heat, requiring temperature regulation to prevent overheating and malfunctions. 

NexDCCool Technologies, a Penn State research-based startup launched by Zuo's lab, is developing a platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to optimize the cooling systems in data centers, helping them maximize IT capacity by reducing cooling demand. 

“AI is booming, which means more computing power is needed, but data centers are facing limited power supply,” said Zuo, who is also affiliated with the Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. “Data center owners must allocate the limited power between cooling and IT. Our goal is to reduce cooling demands so more power can be used for IT, ultimately increasing revenue for those data centers.” 

Over the past decade, Zuo's lab has developed various open-source software to improve building energy efficiency, including data center cooling.  

Zuo explained that many data centers are operating for maximum cooling needs with constant IT loads. However, he said the cost of power, the amount of cooling needed and the IT load is always fluctuating. The NexDCCool software aims to automatically manage and adjust the cooling based on the customer's objective, whether it's to minimize total costs, minimize total cooling power or maximize profit. The software would connect to the existing cooling system and IT infrastructure. 

In spring 2024, Zuo and Viswanathan Ganesh, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Architectural Engineering, participated in the Invent Penn State U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps short course. The program is designed to help researchers start on the path toward commercializing their innovations. 

""The short course was eye-opening,” Zuo said. “We had an idea to commercialize, and they taught us entrepreneurial basics from scratch while pushing us to engage with customers. In academic research, our technology was praised, but in I-Corps, industry professionals said it was too complex and slow. That's when I realized research-grade tech doesn't easily transfer to industry — businesses lack the time and expertise to adapt it. That insight was invaluable.” 

The NexDCCool team then moved on to the NSF I-Corps National Teams program in fall 2024. 

“During the regional program, we had a general idea that data centers were our market, but we didn't know who our end users were or what features they needed,” Ganesh said. “The national program helped us identify our key initial users. We also learned the importance of sales language — saying ‘you can save $150,000' is one thing, but saying ‘you can add two extra IT servers that could generate over $2 million' was a game-changer.” 

In addition to the I-Corps program, the NexDCCool team utilized resources from the Penn State Small Business Development Center (SBDC), the Penn State Dickinson Law Entrepreneur Assistance Clinic and Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Central & Northern PA. 

""From a faculty perspective, the I-Corps program and Invent Penn State's entrepreneurial network as a whole have been invaluable,” Zuo said. “It reinforces that our research should work towards solving real-world problems, highlights industry needs and helps us focus on what's truly useful. This program provided a bridge for me to align academic research with industry demands.” 

Ganesh echoed that sentiment from a student perspective. 

“I wasn't someone who liked talking to people, but I-Corps pushed me to engage, understand potential customer needs and communicate my ideas effectively,” Ganesh said. “It also changed my perspective — researchers typically work bottom-up, focusing on details first, but I-Corps taught me to start with the big picture. The program has also given me incredible industry exposure, connections with major players, and opportunities to travel and attend major conferences.”

On Human Rights weekend, the South African People's Tribunal on AgroToxins will put the government on trial in the court of public opinion for gross dereliction of its constitutional duties to protect the right to life. Farm workers and community members will share truly harrowing testimonies.

They will attest to how the government has persistently, decade after decade, failed to protect farm workers and their families, especially children living in low-resource communities in both urban and rural areas, from the catastrophic consequence of exposure to highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs). These HHPs include the notorious pesticide, Terbufos, implicated in the deaths of primary school children at the end of 2024.

The Tribunal will be adjudicated by a panel of three influential South African women who have remarkable track records in ensuring justice for the voiceless – Judge Navi Pillay, Dr Sophia Kisting-Cairncross, and Human Rights Commissioner Philile Ntuli.

It takes place this week in the heartland of white hegemony in the Western Cape and the export agriculture sector –  Stellenbosch – from the 21st to 23rd of March 2025, to break the isolation and invisibility of farm workers and expose the inhumane and slave-like working and living conditions they endure.

South Africa is the largest consumer of agrotoxins in Africa, with over 9,000 toxic chemical compounds registered for use in our chemically based industrial farming, including approximately 192 HHPs  – many of which are banned in the European Union.

According to People's Tribunal coordinator Haidee Swanby, “We see a complete regulatory breakdown and a ‘free-for-all' for the agrochemical industrial complex that is symptomatic of a dismantled and dysfunctional state. It also links back to a long history of extraction and colonisation in South Africa, resulting in gross human rights violations and environmental calamity.”

Farm workers will give testimony at the Tribunal of their lived experience of working in the sacrifice zone of South Africa's deeply inequitable and toxic wine and fruit farming systems. The General Secretary of the Commercial, Stevedoring, Agriculture and Allied Workers Union (CSAAWU) explains that “many farm workers are forced to work with poisons that have been banned in Europe and many countries in the SADC [Southern African Development Community] region. It is difficult to live on our wages or access good health care. If we get ill then we must hear its because of alcohol and drugs. When we become too ill to work, we can just be evicted from farms where we have been working and living all our lives”.

The judges will also hear testimonies from community members who bore the brunt of the devastation that was unleashed when a chemical warehouse was torched in Cornubia City in KwaZulu-Natal in 2021. This has led to the loss of life, chronic illness, loss of livelihoods, and widespread environmental degradation and pollution. Abject regulatory failure was at the heart of this disaster. Similarly, regulatory failure routinely results in toxins that are restricted for agricultural use in South Africa finding their way into domestic urban settings when people buy ‘street pesticides' to deal with pest infestations resulting from chronic lack of service delivery and food systems collapse. Children are most at risk of death, and acute and chronic poisoning from these street pesticides. The Tribunal will hear both community and expert testimonies on these issues.

Expert testimonies will be given by Mr Wisdom Basera, Prof Leslie London, Prof Rajen Naidoo, Prof Saloshni Naidoo, Prof Andrea Rother, Dr Cindy Stephen, Ms Paola Vigletti, and Rico Euripidou.

According to the South African People's Tribunal on AgroToxins,

“As our turbulent world is plunged into greater chaos, there is also great momentum and impetus amongst us in our collective struggles to reclaim our sovereignty and dignity. For many years, farm worker organisations, unions, civil society, and academics have been calling on the government to phase out HHPs and update our antiquated regulatory framework. This has been done through sharing current science and research, commenting on policy, letters of demand, objections, petitions, protests, and campaigns. Having reached exhaustion of remedies, we decided to host the Tribunal as part of our ongoing and collective solidarity struggles.”

The Power of Independent Thinking

 Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a physician, epidemiologist, and economist, faces a “glide path” to confirmation as director of the National Institutes of Health. On the other hand, former NIH Director Francis Collins has been contending that the Bhattacharya nomination represents an attack on science itself.

On March 7, Collins appeared at a “Stand up for Science” rally, where he sang “For All the Good People,” accompanying himself on guitar. The former NIH boss contended that an “appropriate mantra” for the federal agency would be “First, do no harm.” That citation of the Hippocratic Oath recalls Collins's alliance with Dr. Anthony Fauci who headed the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for nearly 40 years.

Dr. Bhattacharya contended that Dr. Fauci's lockdowns did indeed do harm, especially to schoolchildren. The Stanford professor was aware of studies contending that masks, quarantines, and lockdowns are of limited effectiveness; that the fatality risk for older people was much higher than for young children; and that the COVID virus was less menacing than portrayed by the media.

Dr. Bhattacharya made that case in the Great Barrington Declaration, co-authored by Martin Kulldorff and Sunetra Gupta, and joined by hundreds of medical scientists, most if not all as qualified as Fauci and Collins. Instead of debating these medical scientists, Collins tasked Fauci with a “quick and devastating published take down” of the “fringe epidemiologists.” Suppression of debate is not part of the scientific method, and Dr. Fauci took it to another level.

“Attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science,” the NIAID boss claimed in 2021. “All of the things I have spoken about, consistently, from the very beginning, have been fundamentally based on science. Sometimes those things were inconvenient truths for people.” This is from a non-practicing physician whose bio showed no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry.

Dr. Fauci told people not to bother wearing a mask, later changed to one mask and then two masks. Last year, Dr. Fauci conceded that the six-foot distancing rule he promoted was “arbitrary,” and “sort of just appeared.” Francis Collins has yet to explain how Dr. Fauci's statements and actions square with science. As Collins should know, bureaucracy runs on the Peter Principle, promoting people to their highest level of incompetence. Here Dr. Fauci has a problem.

Nobel laureate Kary Mullis, inventor of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, contended that Dr. Fauci didn't understand electronic microscopy, didn't understand medicine, and “should not be in a position like he's in.” That makes a case that Dr. Fauci, who never invented anything, should not have had the NIAID job in the first place.

Defending bureaucracy is not the same as defending science. Dr. Bhattacharya should ignore Francis Collins and get busy with reforms. Never again must the same people control public health policy and funding for medical research. The NIAID director should be a fully qualified medical scientist and limited to a single four-year term. All NIH grants should be posted online in real-time and downloadable form. That leaves a more pressing matter for Dr. Bhattacharya, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and possibly Pam Bondi at the Department of Justice.

On Jan. 20, Joe Biden pardoned Dr. Fauci but didn't explain what crime he had committed. More than 50 years in government, with no accountability to the people, offers many possibilities. Consider also the NIH officials Biden failed to pardon.

Acting NIH director Lawrence Tabak suddenly resigned two days before RFK Jr. was confirmed. Tabak admitted that the NIH funded dangerous gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Communist China, which Fauci had previously denied. In 2022, Tabak told Congress that, at the request of Chinese scientists, the NIH “eliminated from public view” data on the early genomic sequences of COVID-19.

Consider also James LeDuc, former director of the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), who maintained that the COVID virus arose naturally in the wild and “the Chinese just happened to be in the place where this was discovered.” LeDuc signed agreements with three Chinese labs, including the WIV, giving China the power to destroy “secret files, materials, and equipment, without any backups.”

Those agreements could explain why LeDuc suddenly retired in 2021. So did the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the government's first spokesperson on the pandemic and a veteran of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS).

Dr. Messonnier's press briefings in early 2020 echoed China's talking point that the “novel virus” emerged in the “Wuhan market,” not the WIV or any laboratory. Dr. Messonnier told reporters she was not at liberty to discuss some matters about Wuhan but failed to reveal which government official was laying down the rules.

As he strives to reform the NIH, Dr. Bhattacharya should find out who that was. Given all they suffered during the pandemic, the people have a right to know.

 A man in tears struggled Wednesday to retrieve the body of a small boy from under the rubble of a building in Gaza City hit by a recent wave of Israeli air strikes. 

 One by one, relatives and neighbours used a sledgehammer to try to break apart the large chunks of concrete trapping the young boy. 

 His eyes closed and wearing a Spiderman sweater, the boy was visible but unreachable. 

 ""The civil defence tried to retrieve people but couldn't get anyone out so they left,"" said Muhammad al-Deiri, a neighbour who had come to help. 

 Each strike of the sledgehammer echoed from the building's collapsed second floor through the eerily quiet surrounding streets of what was once a bustling city. 

 In the early hours of Tuesday, Israel launched its most intense air strikes since a ceasefire took hold in Gaza in January, killing more than 400 people according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. 

 Israel vowed to keep up the pressure until the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas releases the hostages still held in Gaza. 

 Of the 251 captives seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. 

 Hamas says it is willing to negotiate and has called on the international community to act to bring the war to an end.

 In Gaza City's al-Sabra neighbourhood where the boy was trapped under rubble, surrounding buildings had also been damaged in the strikes. 

 Flattened floors lay atop one another. 

 ""Random bombings started everywhere,"" said 21-year-old Sundus al-Imam. 

 ""The Al-Hattab family's house our neighbours was hit, leaving some with minor injuries among us girls."" 

 ""Since Trump's time, the United States has been sending massive military aid to Israel, making it more powerful than before,"" she added. 

 Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have promised ""hell"" for Hamas if the remaining hostages held in Gaza are not immediately released. 

 As part of its escalating pressure, Israel first blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in early March, then cut the limited electricity supply to the territory's main water desalination plant. 

 Since then, humanitarian organisations operating on the ground have been reporting on the dire situation for the population. 

 Rafat Ramadan, another resident of al-Sabra, painfully remembered seeing ""bodies hanging from the rubble, needing cranes to remove them"". 

 Ramadan's own house was struck, trapping his daughters under concrete until he managed to free them with the help of his nephews. 

 They took the girls to Gaza City's Baptist Hospital, he said, only to find the facility overwhelmed. 

 ""What we lived through was hell,"" said Ramadan, who says he lost his son in the war.

 After almost two months under the truce, Gazans are once again experiencing the panic of more than 15 months of war between Hamas and Israel. 

 In the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah, dozens of men gathered in mourning next to white plastic body bags. 

 They said that four members of the same family were caught by overnight bombing while reciting a traditional Ramadan prayer. 

 ""Remember Allah, pray for your loved ones, your heart will be in peace,"" read a poster near the bodies. 

 A young man cried in silence while the body bags were loaded into a truck for burial. 

 The Israeli military urged residents of several areas in Gaza's border areas to evacuate ""combat zones"", in particular Beit Hanun, in the territory's far north. 

 Residents took to the road, mainly by foot and for most of them, not for the first time in order to seek shelter in Gaza City. 

 Children pulled water jerrycans next to donkey carts loaded with cheap foam mattresses, plastic bowls and tents. 

 Residents carried only the most basic necessities for daily life, nearly a year and a half after the war started. 

 Around them stood bombed-out buildings, piles of rubble and mountains of waste, while Israeli planes roared and drones buzzed above their heads.

Don't judge a blob by its cover.

Once dubbed the world's ugliest animal for its soft, lumpy appearance, the blobfish has made a stunning comeback: it was crowned this week as Fish of the Year by a New Zealand environmental group.

The annual competition, held by the Mountain to Sea Conservation Trust, aims to raise awareness for New Zealand's freshwater and marine life.

This year, the blobfish took home the coveted accolade with nearly 1,300 out of more than 5,500 votes cast.

It's an underdog victory for the blobfish, which burst into mainstream notoriety as the mascot for the Ugly Animal Preservation Society in 2013.

The gelatinous fish lives on the sea bed and grows to about 12in (30cm) in length. They're mainly found off the coast of Australia, where they live at depths of 2,000-4,000 ft (600-1,200m).





While the blobfish is known for its misshapen silhouette, in its natural deep-sea habitat it actually resembles a regular fish, with its shape kept together by the high water pressure.

However, when caught and rapidly brought to the water surface its body deforms into its hallmark mushy shape - the same one that has earned it the reputation of being among the ugliest creatures the world has seen.

Coming in second place was the orange roughy, a deep-sea fish in the slimehead family - known for the mucous canals on their heads.

It was ""a battle of the deep sea forget-me-nots,"" said Kim Jones, co-director of the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust. ""A battle of two quirky deep sea critters, with the blobfish's unconventional beauty helping get voters over the line.""

The orange roughy had appeared on track for the win, until a couple of local radio station hosts started a passionate campaign for the blobfish.

""There is an up and coming fish, it needs your vote,"" Sarah Gandy and Paul Flynn, hosts of local radio network More FM, urged listeners on their show last week. ""We need the blobfish to win.""

News of the blobfish's victory has been celebrated by the radio hosts. 

""The blobfish had been sitting patiently on the ocean floor, mouth open waiting for the next mollusc to come through to eat,"" the pair said. ""He has been bullied his whole life and we thought, 'Stuff this, it's time for the blobfish to have his moment in the sun', and what a glorious moment it is!""

Besides molluscs, the blobfish also eats custaceans like crabs and lobsters, as well as sea urchins.

Instead of a skeleton and scales, the blobfish has a soft body and flabby skin.

Nine of the ten nominees for fish of the year are considered by conservation groups to be vulnerable, according to the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust. This includes the blobfish, which are vulnerable to deep-sea trawling.

New Zealand also has a Bird of the Year contest, organised by conservation organisation Forest & Bird. The latest winner, crowned last September, was the hoiho, a rare penguin species.

New Zealand take a 2-0 lead in their T20 series in Pakistan with a five-wicket win in Dunedin.

Trade talks had previously stalled due to differences over issues such as market access.

Pakistan are bowled out for 91 - their lowest T20 total in New Zealand - in the series opener in Christchurch.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the first batch of survey data from its €1.4bn Euclid mission. The release includes a preview of its ‘deep field' where in just one week of observations, Euclid already spotted 26 million galaxies as well as many transient phenomena such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The dataset is published along with 27 scientific papers that will be submitted to the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The dataset also features a catalogue of 380 000 galaxies that have been detected by artificial intelligence or citizen-science efforts. They include those with spiral arms, central bars and “tidal tails”, inferring merging galaxies.

There has also been the discovery of 500 gravitational-lens candidates thanks to AI and citizen science. Gravitational lensing in when light from more distant galaxies is bent around closer galaxies due to gravity and it can help identify where dark matter is located and its properties.

“For the past decade, my research has been defined by painstakingly analyzing the same 50 strong gravitational lenses, but with the data release, I was handed 500 new strong lenses in under a week” says astronomer James Nightingale from Newcastle University. “It's a seismic shift — transforming how I do science practically overnight.”

The data released today still represents only 0.4% of the total number of galaxies that Euclid is expected to image over its lifetime. Euclid will capture images of more than 1.5 billion galaxies over six years, sending back around 100 GB of data every day.

“Euclid shows itself once again to be the ultimate discovery machine. It is surveying galaxies on the grandest scale, enabling us to explore our cosmic history and the invisible forces shaping our universe,” says ESA's science director, Carole Mundell. “With the release of the first data from Euclid's survey, we are unlocking a treasure trove of information for scientists to dive into and tackle some of the most intriguing questions in modern science”.

Euclid was launched in July 2023 and is currently located in a spot in space called Lagrange Point 2 – a gravitational balance point some 1.5 million kilometres beyond the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The Euclid Consortium comprises some 2600 members from more than 15 countries.

Euclid has a 1.2 m-diameter telescope, a camera and a spectrometer that it uses to plot a 3D map of the distribution of galaxies. The images it takes are about four times as sharp as current ground-based telescopes.

Euclid released its first images in November 2023 and began routine observations in February 2024, releasing a first data batch in May 2024.

The mission's first “cosmology data” will be released in October 2026.

Power, Politics, and the Olympic Prize: IOC Race Heats up on Greece's Sunlit Shores

Olympics - 144th IOC Session - Costa Navarino, Pylos, Greece - March 19, 2025 General view as International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach speaks during the session REUTERS/Louisa Gouliamaki

By Ossian Shine

PYLOS, Greece - The slow-burn race for the most powerful job in world sport roared into life on Wednesday, set against the dazzling backdrop of the Ionian Sea, where the seven contenders for the International Olympic Committee presidency made their final moves ahead of a vote that will shape the sporting landscape for the next decade.

Behind the gilded facades and five-star hospitality of the Costa Navarino resort in Greece's southwestern Peloponnese, whispers of alliances and voting tactics swirled as IOC members met for the 144th Session – the last with Thomas Bach at the wheel.

The winner of the presidential election will lead the world's wealthiest multi-sports organisation with revenues of about $7 billion per four-year cycle.

With the Mediterranean breeze carrying hints of salt and ambition, the seven seeking to replace Bach had to navigate a gauntlet of flashing cameras and microphones as they were ushered to lunch on a terrace overlooking the sea.

""I'm still here,"" quipped Britain's Sebastian Coe, considered one of the frontrunners, as he walked briskly past the bank of reporters, flashing a smile but making no further comment.

Kirsty Coventry, considered another frontrunner and believed to be Bach's preferred candidate, was similarly circumspect, stopping only to make one brief comment to German media before the Zimbabwean headed to the terrace.

MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF VOTING

MORE:  

Last to leave the Session Hall was Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, son of the IOC's seventh president who led the body from 1980 to 2001.

""It's very easy in this (Olympic) world, so close, to confuse a smile for a vote, a friendship for a vote, a nice word for a vote,"" smiled the Spaniard when asked how he felt the race was going. ""We all have to be very careful in making that translation.

""It's a very good system. All the IOC members have one thing which is extraordinarily precious, which is a vote and its confidentiality.

""That gives each one of us the full independence to decide whatever we think is better. And that we will only know, it's only possible to know when the real votes are cast. So we will see.""

Samaranch Jr rounds out the trio widely thought to be the favourites, but is taking nothing for granted. ""I don't know if we will win or lose votes (in the remaining hours before the vote), but I can promise you that I will be working until the very last second, until 3:59:59 tomorrow afternoon.""

French candidate David Lappartient, head of the world cycling federation, insisted the race was wide open, and that he expects multiple rounds of voting before a decisive winner emerges.

""GLOBAL COMMUNITY""

With just over 100 ballots set to be cast at the Greek seaside resort the winner will need an outright majority. If nobody secures a majority, the lowest scorer is axed, triggering another round of voting until one candidate emerges victorious.

""In the race, still in the race,"" Lappartient smiled, before leaning on a cycling analogy. ""I think that it's riding fast, but I'm still in the first part of the bunch. I've not been dropped from the bunch, so I still believe it's possible.

""I respect my fellow colleagues, also candidates, but I think I'm one of the potential options to be the winner tomorrow.""

Other candidates Johan Eliasch and Morinari Watanabe would not speculate. Japanese Watanabe, head of the world gymnastics federation, smiled and simply said: ""I am waiting,"" while president of the world ski and snowboard federation Eliasch said: ""We shall see tomorrow.""

""Tomorrow is the big day,"" Swedish-born Eliasch added. ""I am sure the outcome will be a good one – we have seven good candidates.""

The final candidate, Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan, said: ""I have spoken to more members in the last 3-4 months than in the last 4 years, and that for me has been the great takeaway of this – engagement.

""This is a global community and we should use that for our advantage.""

A new report from the World Meteorological Organization delivers a stark warning: climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The State of the Global Climate report confirms global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.

The report, compiled with data from 101 countries and various scientific organizations, provides a comprehensive look at the state of the planet. Here are five key takeaways from the WMO's findings.

2024 set a new global temperature record, averaging over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. For years, climate scientists have warned that exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming would lead to increasingly disastrous impacts around the globe, and it is a key goal of the Paris Climate Agreement to try to keep warming below that threshold.

""While a single year above 1.5 °C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies and to the planet,"" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.

Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.

According to John Kennedy, scientific coordinator and lead author of the report, the primary driver of this heat was the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions, with El Niño playing a smaller role in the spike. ""Maybe a tenth of a degree or two-tenths of a degree from El Niño and other factors,"" Kennedy said.

Greenhouse gas emissions continued their upward trend, the report says.

Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide all reached record levels in 2023 — the latest year global data was available — surpassing pre-industrial concentrations by significant margins. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, fueling global warming and its cascading effects.

Over 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean, and in 2024, ocean heat content reached a new high in 65 years of observational records. The report notes that 2024 was the eighth consecutive year of record-breaking ocean warming.

This warming is contributing to widespread coral bleaching, disrupting marine ecosystems and accelerating sea level rise.

The WMO report states, ""The ocean will continue to warm for the foreseeable future — a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales.""

The long-term rate of increase has more than doubled — from 2.1 mm per year between 1993 and 2002 to 4.7 mm per year between 2015 and 2024. For coastal communities, even minor increases can lead to more frequent and severe flooding.

Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking at alarming rates. Between 2021 and 2024, glaciers experienced the most severe three-year mass loss on record, the report says.

Arctic sea ice reached a minimum daily extent of 4.28 million square kilometers on Sept. 11, 2024, marking the seventh-lowest in the 46-year satellite record. That was 1.17 million km² below the 1991-2020 average — meaning an area of ice nearly equivalent to the size of South Africa had been lost.

Antarctic sea ice has remained at historically low levels, with its extent falling below 2 million km² for the third consecutive year. These losses contribute to rising sea levels, disrupt water supplies for millions of people, and threaten ecosystems that depend on stable ice conditions.

From deadly hurricanes and historic floods to devastating wildfires and droughts, 2024 was marked by extreme weather events. In the U.S., hurricanes Helene and Milton caused more than 250 deaths and tens of billions of dollars in damage.

Extreme weather events linked to climate change are also displacing millions of people worldwide. In 2024, climate-driven disasters triggered the highest number of new displacements in 16 years, exacerbating food shortages and economic instability worldwide.

In Brazil, devastating floods overwhelmed parts of Porto Alegre, displacing approximately 420,000 people and causing extensive economic losses. In West and Central Africa, widespread flooding affected multiple countries, with Chad and Nigeria among the hardest hit. More than 1 million people were displaced, and over 639,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

""We are working together with all the scientists around the world and the countries to ease the problem of people around the world, in developing countries, in small island developing states, so we hope that this will continue, despite the differences in politics and internal changes,"" said Dr Omar Baddour, chief of climate monitoring at WMO.

He suggested the report should prompt greater action to help protect our planet.

""The report highlights that, despite the rapid pace of change, there are still viable pathways of mitigation and adaptation. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains essential, with rapid expansion of renewable energy playing a crucial role.""

The US says ""peace has never been closer"" after a Donald Trump-Volodymyr Zelenskyy phone call. Zelenskyy called the conversation ""frank"" and ""positive"" as he asked for air defence help. There was also an update on intelligence sharing. Listen to The World as you scroll.

Wednesday 19 March 2025 20:05, UK

Live reporting by Ollie Cooper

Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke returns tomorrow for his weekly Q&A on the Ukraine war - covering anything from the battlefield to the negotiating table.

He'll tackle as many of your questions as he can at 1pm - submit yours in the box above.

In these talks for a ceasefire, the Russians first want all of their issues addressed, our military analyst Michael Clarke said today.

That's a stark contrast to the Ukrainians, who haven't set conditions for a pause - and this puts strain on the Americans, who want a ""quick-ish"" deal.

Clarke added: ""The question is how much patience have the Americans got to play this game?

""The Russians are very good at this, and I keep saying Putin is an old KGB man, he's been doing this his whole career, he knows how to do all this.

""I'm not so sure the Americans with their business background are really so accomplished at this sort of thing.

""The business community want to move in, make a quick-ish deal and move on, but in political terms, these things can go on for a very long time.""

Will Trump turn on Putin?

Trump is capable of ""turning on a dime"" against Putin, Clarke added, but so far there is nothing to indicate that's likely to happen.

""Putin's calculating how long he can needle Trump into more concessions - what will he get? Or will Trump turn on him and say 'enough',"" Clarke said.

""The longer this goes on, the bigger the turnaround would be.""

The relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been complex over the years.

Relations between the two presidents extend as far back as 2019, the year the Ukrainian leader took office.

It has since weathered the start of the war in Ukraine, Trump's re-election and last month's heated exchange in the Oval Office, in which Zelenskyy was accused of being ""disrespectful"" to his country's most powerful ally.

Here, news reporter Lauren Russell looks back at the key moments that have helped shape the pair's relationship and how it has changed over the years.

In this post, we'll examine the differences and similarities we've noticed in the readouts and information surrounding Donald Trump's calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy respectively. 

Length

Trump said his call with Zelenskyy lasted around an hour, while his chat with Putin went on for around an hour and a half. 

That could be because they had more to discuss - or because the US leader's call with his Russian counterpart may have required translation at both ends - whereas Zelenskyy speaks strong English. 

Tone

Our correspondent David Blevins noted that Trump's message after the chat with Zelenskyy was markedly calm in tone - without the capitals letters usually sprayed across his social media posts. 

It's similar to his post yesterday on his call with Putin, where there was only one word in capital letters - the word 'end', as in to end the conflict.

The readouts

The readout of the Putin call was 226 words and released by the White House, whereas the Zelenskyy one was issued by Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz on behalf of the president and was a whopping 480 words. 

Read into all of that what you will...

By Sophia Massam, junior digital investigations journalist and Freya Gibson, junior OSINT Producer 

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that Russian drone strikes on Ukraine last night targeted energy facilities, despite Vladimir Putin agreeing with Donald Trump on Tuesday to stop attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure. 

Sky News has pinpointed the locations of several Russian strikes which happened overnight in the Donetsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Sumy oblasts. Downed Russian drones were also found on the outskirts of Kyiv. 

The map below shows where strikes verified by Sky News occurred, and where major energy facilities are in those areas. The blue pins show Russian strikes from last night, and the yellow pins show major Ukrainian energy facilities. 

In a post on X last night, Zelenskyy said attack drones had been spotted over the Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.  

Energy ceasefire 'shaky from beginning'

As negotiations continue, Ukraine's energy infrastructure could still be a target, despite the Trump-Putin call this week - according to security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke.  

""There are so many different infrastructure targets in a big country like Ukraine that it will always be a point of contention as to which of them might be classed as clearly, and only, 'energy infrastructure' targets. 

""So, the very limited ceasefire agreed by phone between presidents Trump and Putin is looking shaky from the beginning.""

What does Ukraine say Russia targeted after Putin-Trump call?

Speaking in Helsinki with the Finnish president this morning, Zelenskyy said 150 drones struck energy infrastructure and transport in Ukraine overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday.  

Zelenskyy added Ukraine was willing to provide a list of its energy infrastructure facilities to implement a halt on strikes.  

Ukrzaliznytsia, the state administration of railway transport in Ukraine, said in a post on X that Russian strikes had hit their energy facilities in the Dnipro region overnight.  

Large energy facilities have been targeted in Ukraine before, but smaller-scale infrastructure is also a target.  

The Donetsk prosecutor's office reported shelling in Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region. Local reporting said that part of the city is now without electricity. 

Civilian infrastructure was also hit overnight. 

In Sumy oblast, two hospitals were hit by Russian strikes, Sumy Regional Hospital and Krasnopil Hospital. 

The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in statements made on Telegram that all patients from both hospitals had been successfully evacuated. 

By David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington DC

The readout of the call from President Zelenskyy was conciliatory, repeatedly thanking Donald Trump for military support and for his peace efforts.

In agreeing to a partial ceasefire, he held out the prospect of US investment in Ukrainian power - perhaps deeming that more of a security guarantee than the minerals deal (see previous post for more on Trump's team apparently moving on from this).

""American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.""

Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz readout of Trump-Zelenskyy call

Trump agreed to continue sharing intelligence but when Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence, he said he'd see what was available in Europe.

That's a vague response from the US president as he seeks to keep both Ukraine and Putin on board.

Those ambiguous words and the change in tone are both indicative of the sensitive point they've reached days before fresh negotiations in Saudi Arabia.

The US has moved ""beyond"" a previously agreed minerals deal with Ukraine, Karoline Leavitt said during her news conference a short time ago. 

""Now, we have moved beyond the economic minerals deal, we are at a place of peace, we're at a partial ceasefire,"" she said.

She offered no further details. 

The deal was put on hold following the disastrous Volodymyr Zelenskyy visit to the White House last month, but it was understood it would be picked up again once relations recovered. 

This statement comes to us from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and Mike Waltz, Donald Trump's national security adviser after the president's call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

""Today, President Donald J. Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a fantastic phone conversation. President Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for a productive start for the work of the Ukrainian and American teams in Jeddah on 11th March. The meeting of the senior officials from both nations significantly helped in moving towards ending the war.

""President Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for the support of the United States, especially the Javelin missiles that President Trump was first to provide, and his efforts towards peace. The leaders agreed Ukraine and America will continue working together to bring about a real end to the war, and that lasting peace under President Trump's leadership can be achieved.

""President Trump fully briefed President Zelenskyy on his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the key issues discussed. They reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defence staffs as the battlefield situation evolved. 

""President Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence systems to protect his civilians, particularly Patriot missile systems, President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.

""The two leaders also agreed on a partial ceasefire against energy. Technical teams will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the ceasefire to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. They agreed this could be the first step towards the full end of the war and ensuring security. 

""President Zelenskyy was grateful for the President's leadership in this effort and reiterated his willingness to adopt a full ceasefire.

""President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

""President Zelenskyy also thanked President Trump for continuing to push humanitarian concerns, including the exchange of POWs. He noted they had just had a successful exchange and thanked the President for his leadership. 

""President Trump also asked President Zelenskyy about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted. President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.

""They agreed all parties must continue the effort to make a ceasefire work. The presidents noted the positive work of their advisers and representatives, especially Secretary Rubio, National Security Adviser Waltz, Special Envoy Kellogg, and others. 

""The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the technical issues related to implementing and broadening the partial ceasefire. The presidents instructed their advisers and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible. 

""The presidents emphasised that in further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing towards lasting peace and security.""

Following on from our last post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also confirmed that US intelligence sharing with Ukraine would continue. 

Vladimir Putin said yesterday he wanted all intelligence sharing and arms supplies for Kyiv halted by the US and other Ukrainian allies. 

""It was emphasised that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.""

Kremlin readout of the Putin-Trump call yesterday

It appears this demand is not being met by the Trump administration at present, as Leavitt says: ""Intelligence sharing in terms of Ukraine defence will continue."" 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has just read out a US statement on today's call between presidents Trump and Zelenskyy - which described the call as ""fantastic"" and ""productive"".

It ""significantly helped"" in efforts to end the war, it said.

Zelenskyy thanked the US for Javelin missiles in particular - which were first provided to Ukraine by Trump.

The leaders also reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely, the statement continued.

Trump also suggested that the US take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.

Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence missiles to protect Ukraine's civilians - interestingly, Trump replied by saying he'd work with him on this, but that they'd look particularly at what was available in Europe.

Further talks will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the coming days, the statement added.

Zelenskyy also thanked Trump for pushing for prisoner exchanges - like the successful one today.

Zelenskyy also asked about Ukraine's missing children. Both parties agreed to work to ensure those children are returned home.

The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the details of implementing a partial ceasefire.

Discussions would also include expanding any ceasefire to the Black Sea.

""We have never been closer to peace,"" Leavitt added.

Watch a clip from her news conference here...

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had a ""positive, very substantive and frank"" conversation with Donald Trump. 

He said he began by thanking the president for his efforts to bring about a ceasefire. 

""One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it,"" he said. 

""The American side also proposed an unconditional ceasefire on the frontline, and Ukraine accepted this proposal as well,"" he added, saying work continues to reach this step. 

""I also provided an update on the battlefield situation and the consequences of Russian strikes. 

""We spoke about the situation in the Kursk region, touched on the issue of the release of PoWs, and the return of Ukrainian children who were taken by Russian forces.""

Zelenskyy also said he asked around strengthening the Ukrainian air defence. 

""Ukrainian and American teams are ready to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to continue coordinating steps toward peace.""

Ending his statement, the Ukrainian leader said he ""highlighted the importance of President Trump's concept of peace through strength"".

""We agreed to maintain constant contact, including at the highest level and through our teams.""

WHEELING — Alliances of teams from Ohio and Marshall counties made the finals at the West Virginia State Middle School Robotics Tournament Tuesday, and earned themselves a trip to the world championships in Dallas.

In total, five local teams earned their spots at the world championships during the state tournament at Fairmont State University on Tuesday.

The “Return of Self Destruct” from Moundsville Middle School, aligned with the “Robo-Raiders” from Triadelphia Middle; and “Lil' George” from Sherrard School, partnering with  “Steel Vikings” from Warwood School, all made the finals at the state championships.

The teams all won spots in the VEX Robotics World Championships, which is scheduled for May 6-14 in Dallas.

“Lil' George” then won the “Excellence Award,” which double-qualified them for the world competition. This freed up a spot and permitted another Sherrard Middle School team, “Killer Frequency,” to go to the world championships.

When the local teams competed against each other for the state championship on Tuesday, the “Self Destruct/Robo-Raiders” alliance came out on top, defeating “Lil' George/Steel Vikings” 40 to 9.

The “Self Destruct/Robo-Raiders” alliance dominated throughout the competition, finishing first and second among the 32 teams competing in the qualifying rounds. They agreed to a partnership in the final rounds.

Members of “The Return of Self Destruct” are Juda Jones, Leo Nguyen, Isaiah Toothman and Kingsley Zheng. Those on the “Robo-Raiders” team are Katelyn Maloney, Sebastian Molina, Evan Clatterbuck, Chris Zelek, Amos Racer and Temperance Emmons. The “Robo-Raiders” team also won the state championship in 2023.

The “Lil' George Team” won the “Skills Award” during the event, in addition to the “Excellence Award.” Members are Zane Gast, Evan Cunningham, Gavin Pickett, Kabe Blake and Joziah Baker. The “Steel Vikings” members are Max O'Connell, Oliver Kovach, and Miles Wharton.

Those on “Killer Frequency” are Kolson Shepard, Blake Oliver, Nathan Spangler, Chase Nolan and Josh Naome.

Teams from Ohio and Marshall counties accounted for 16 teams, or half of the entries in the 32-team tournament.

Six teams at the state competition won seats at the world competition. The sixth team, winning the “Design Award” and qualifying, was “Sci-Botics” from Westwood School in Morgantown.

In addition to being finalists, the Robo-Raiders won the “Build Award,” and the “Steel Vikings” took home the “Amaze Award.”

“From the large group of sixth graders who joined us this year, to the incredible group of eighth graders who have grown so much over the last three years — and to everyone in between —  they are dedicated and diligent workers who persevere every day to hone their skills, skills that will serve them not only in robotics but in their lives,” said JoJo Shay, director of innovation for Ohio County Schools. “They are the future of OCS Robotics, and the future is shining bright!  We could not be more proud of these students and of our program.”

The middle school teams will join four local high school teams in Dallas that also won their way to the Vex Robotics Championship this week. These teams are the  “Iron Patriots:X-Ray,” “Iron Patriots:Yikes” and “Iron Patriots: Platypus” from Wheeling Park High School, and “George Drinks Water” from John Marshall High School. 

In total, nine local teams will be representing West Virginia's Northern Panhandle at the world championships this spring.

Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Donald Trump for over two hours today

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he discussed Russian and Ukrainian requests and needs for a peace deal in an hour-long call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. ""We are very much on track,"" Trump added.

The Kremlin also said Wednesday that Putin and Trump ""trust each other"" and want to normalise US-Russia ties after more than three years of Moscow's Ukraine offensive.

""Presidents Putin and Trump understand each other well, trust each other and are intent to gradually move towards the normalisation of ties,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that the pair's phone call Tuesday lasted around two hours.

Zelensky earlier today warned against heeding the Kremlin's calls to halt military aid for his country, announcing that he would speak with Trump about it later.

Putin issued the demand after the call with Trump on Tuesday.

""I do not believe that we should make any concessions in terms of assistance for Ukraine, but rather there should be an increase in assistance for Ukraine,"" Zelensky said at a press conference with his Finnish counterpart Alexander Stubb.

The call between Trump and Putin failed to secure the breakthrough ceasefire that Ukraine has been pushing for after it endorsed the US-led proposal last week.

But the Kremlin said it agreed to halt Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, and Zelensky said he hoped to learn details during the call with Trump.

""Today I will have contacts with President Trump and we will discuss the next steps,"" Zelensky said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

 A prosecutor on Wednesday demanded that an 81-year-old French hunter be handed a four-month suspended jail sentence for killing an endangered female bear that had attacked him in the Pyrenees in 2021. 

 The brown bear is a protected species in the mountain range, which separates France and Spain. 

 Andre Rives was boar-hunting when a female bear nicknamed Caramelles attacked him. 

 He has said he had no choice but to open fire. 

 But the prosecution argued at the trial in Foix in southern France that he and 15 other hunters should not have been in the nature reserve in the first place. 

 As well as the four-month suspended term for Rives, prosecutor Olivier Mouysset also called for the suspension of hunting licenses and fines against all sixteen hunters who participated in the ""unauthorised"" hunt in the Mont Valier reserve, in the Ariege region, in November 2021. 

 Rives ""knowingly took the risk of a confrontation with the bear in the reserve, which is an area of calm"" for the bear, said the prosecutor, also requesting he be given a two-year ban on carrying a weapon.

 On November 20, 2021, two bear cubs emerged from the woods in front of Rives. Then their mother appeared, charging at the man and dragging him for several metres. He shot and killed the animal. 

 Rives sustained leg injuries and was in a state of shock. A fellow hunter managed to stem the bleeding before he was evacuated by helicopter. 

 According to the investigation, the bear was killed 400 metres outside an authorised hunting area. 

 When the cubs emerged, ""I looked at them with admiration,"" Rives said in court on Tuesday. ""I made myself very small. Then the mother saw me. Our eyes met, she charged."" 

 He said he had no choice but to shoot. 

 ""She grabbed my left thigh, I panicked and fired a shot. She backed away growling, she went around me and bit my right calf, I fell, she was eating my leg,"" he added. ""I reloaded my rifle and fired."" 

 Defence lawyer Charles Lagier said all the defendants should be acquitted. Rives ""killed a bear because he had no other option; it was necessity. This does not call for criminal charges."" 

 But Alice Terrasse, the lawyer representing several environmental associations at the trial, called for all 16 hunters to be convicted. 

 ""We want the fault to be acknowledged and compensation for the environmental damage. At the very least, a bear must be reintroduced to compensate for Caramelles's death,"" she said, saying such an operation would cost 100,000 euros . 

 Animal rights activists view bears as integral to maintaining a fragile mountain ecosystem under threat from human activity and climate change. 

 According to estimates from 2023, there are more than 80 bears currently in the Pyrenees. 

 Bears had nearly disappeared from the mountain range before France began a reintroduction programme in the 1990s, importing them from Slovenia. 

 But the presence of bears has led to increasing tensions with farmers because of the threat they pose to their livestock. 

 The trial adjourned until a verdict on May 6.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said a recent spate of attacks on Tesla property, owned by key President Donald Trump's ally Elon Musk, was akin to terrorism and vowed to impose severe punishments on perpetrators.

""The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism,"" Bondi said in a statement Tuesday. 

She said the Department of Justice has already charged ""several perpetrators with that in mind,"" including some cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences.

""We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,"" she said.

Billionaire Musk is one of Trump's closest advisers, as well as top financial donor, and is spearheading highly controversial attempts to slash entire US government departments as part of what he says is a cost-and-fraud-cutting drive.

Tesla share prices have plunged as the brand's image suffers from the fallout.

Bondi's statement came after the latest incident in which a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas, damaging five vehicles, according to city police. 



""As officers arrived, they located several vehicles fully engulfed in flames and the word 'Resist' spray painted on the building,"" the police said in a statement Monday.

Musk also shared a video of the Las Vegas torching on his social media platform X, calling it ""domestic terrorism."" 

""Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks,"" he said.

Compounding the company's public relations woes, the Vancouver International Auto Show announced it was removing Tesla from the event on the eve of its Wednesday kickoff, citing security concerns.

Politics ""has absolutely no bearing on the decision,"" the show's executive director Eric Nicholl said late Tuesday. ""This is purely from a safety point for our guests and our attendees.""

In an interview at the White House late Tuesday, Musk told Fox News he was ""shocked"" at the attacks on Tesla vehicles and the ""hatred and violence from the left.""

""Tesla is a peaceful company, we've never done anything harmful,"" he said.

Several Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations across the United States and Europe have been vandalized in recent weeks. 

A Tesla charging station in the US state of Massachusetts was ""intentionally set"" on fire in early March, authorities said, while in Colorado police said last month they arrested a woman for vandalizing a dealership ""with incendiary devices.""

Trump expressed support for Musk last week, saying the perpetrators would be caught and will ""go through hell."" 

Analysts also say Musk's political endeavors -- including backing far-right parties in Europe and sharing conspiracy theories online -- could badly damage Tesla's traditionally liberal market base.

The Kremlin accused Kyiv Wednesday of countering US-Russia efforts to end the conflict in Ukraine, saying it had tried to strike Russian energy infrastructure despite Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump agreeing a halt on such attacks.

Putin announced a 30-day pause on striking Ukrainian energy facilities following a call with Trump on Tuesday, after turning down the US president's previous demand to pause all hostilities.

""Unfortunately, so far see there has been no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime. There were attempts to strike our energy infrastructure,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 

""These attacks are countering our common (Russian-American) efforts.""

Peskov said Putin had ""immediately"" given the command to stop energy attacks on Ukraine, claiming that seven Russian drones were ""in the air"" to be used on Ukrainian energy infrastructure but were instead shot down by air defences.

Both countries attacked each other with drones after the Putin-Trump call.

The Kremlin said Putin had only committed to a ceasefire in strikes on energy infrastructure, clarifying a discrepancy between Russian and US reports after US envoy Steve Witkoff said Moscow had agreed to halt strikes on all infrastructure.

Kyiv had last week committed to an unconditional ceasefire with Russia.

The Kremlin said that Putin and Trump ""trust each other and are intent to gradually move towards the normalisation of ties"" more than three years into Moscow's offensive.

Peskov said the phone call between Trump and Putin lasted around two hours and that the pair had also discussed military aid to Ukraine, without giving details as ""it is quite a sensitive topic and probably should not be discussed in public"".

Moscow and Kyiv accused each other on Wednesday of launching air attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would speak to President Donald Trump later on Wednesday and that the United States should monitor any potential ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia focusing on energy facilities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday to stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities temporarily but declined to endorse a full 30-day ceasefire that President Donald Trump hoped would be the first step toward a permanent peace deal.

Moscow and Kyiv accused each other on Wednesday of launching air attacks that damaged infrastructure just hours after their leaders agreed to a limited ceasefire to halt attacks on energy infrastructure.

Zelensky, in a joint briefing in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, said Putin's words were not enough and that Ukraine would provide a list of energy facilities it hopes the US and allies would help monitor.

""I really want there to be control. But I believe that the main agent of this control should be the United States of America,"" he said, adding that Kyiv would be ready to commit to a ceasefire.

""If the Russians will not strike our facilities, then we will definitely not strike theirs.""

Earlier on Wednesday, Kyiv's air force said it destroyed 72 of 145 drones launched by Russia overnight, while Russia's defence ministry said its units downed 57 Ukrainian drones.

Russia and Ukraine accused each other on Wednesday of launching air attacks that sparked fires and damaged infrastructure just hours after their leaders agreed to a limited ceasefire to halt attacks on energy infrastructure.

Putin agreed to temporarily stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities but declined to endorse a full 30-day ceasefire sought by US President Donald Trump in a telephone call with the Russian leader on Tuesday.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky had agreed to the US proposed 30-day ceasefire before the Putin-Trump call and later supported the more limited ceasefire on energy targets.

But after Russia launched its air attacks early on Wednesday, Zelensky urged the world to block any attempts by Moscow to drag out the war.

""Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure and people - right now,"" Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff, said overnight on Telegram.

Regional authorities in Sumy in northeast Ukraine said that Russia's drone attacks damaged two hospitals there, causing no injuries but forcing the evacuation of patients and hospital staff.

A 60-year-old man was injured and several houses damaged in Russian drone attack on the Kyiv region that surrounds the Ukrainian capital, Mykola Kalashnyk, governor of the region, said early on Wednesday.

Zelensky said that Russia launched more than 40 drones against Ukraine in the hours following the call between Trump and Putin.

Russia's defence ministry said that its units destroyed 57 Ukrainian drones overnight, 35 of them over the border Kursk region. The ministry reports only how many drones were destroyed not how many were launched by Ukraine.

Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said early on Wednesday that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot located near the village of Kavkazskaya.

No one was injured in the fire, which spread across 20 square metres (215 square feet), but 30 employees were evacuated, the administration of the southern Russian region said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

""The work at the facility has been suspended,"" the administration said.

The Russian SHOT news Telegram posted a video of blazes at night at what seemed like an industrial area.

SHOT said the Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point is an important facility designed to transport Russian oil for exports railway and into the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline system.

Reuters could not independently verify the SHOT report.

Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said that for a couple of hours overnight flights were suspended from airports in Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Nizhnekamsk, Russia, all hundreds kilometres east of Moscow, to ""ensure air safety"".

The agency did not say what was the reason for the suspension, but it usually suspends flights when there are reports of drone attacks.

Former NASA scientist and American YouTuber Mark Rober put Tesla's autopilot to a ""crash test"", and the results weren't impressive, to say the least.

In the video, Mr Rober said he would check if the car collides with the Wile E Coyote-style wall painting. The YouTuber was referring to the unfortunate enemy of the Looney Tunes series known for his futile plans to catch the Road Runner.



Before the test, Mr Rober explained that other cars used LiDAR for object detection, but Tesla relied on optical cameras. He claimed he set the Tesla on Autopilot at 40 miles per hour ""to see if Tesla's Autopilot can be tricked because it famously only relies on simple cameras to navigate the world as opposed to much more expensive tech.""

He is then seen driving in the direction of the fake wall and smashing through it.



The vehicle also crushed a child-like mannequin on the other side. While the Tesla Model Y failed to identify a wall painted as the road, another car with LiDAR in the same video appeared to pass the “crash” test.Mr Rober constantly lauded LiDAR technology company Luminar during the episode, leading viewers to wonder if the video was edited as part of a complex commercial.

He further commended ""fancy cars that use more advanced technology"" during the test, including Luminar's vision-based LiDAR technology-equipped cars.

People were equally shocked and amazed when the video initially went viral. Soon after, Tesla fans alleged the video was made to defame Mr Musk's car brand.

One user wrote in part on X, ""Tesla needs to pull the data from the car itself and show us exactly what happened... I know what the data will show, that this was a huge case of fraud. But I doubt Mark wants us to see all that.""

A second user said, “Mark Rober's Tesla Scam EXPOSED – The Experiment Was FAKE!”

“Mark Rober built a reputation as one of YouTube's most trusted creators. But one video may have destroyed his credibility forever,” a third user remarked.

Mr Rober dismissed fake crash test claims and posted “raw footage” of the incident on X, saying that he wasn't sure “why it disengages 17 frames before hitting the wall but my feet weren't touching the brake or gas.”

Earlier in 2022, Mr Rober posted a video explaining how he used a bunch of cockroaches to shut down fake call centres. In the video, he said he was pursuing the scam industry for over a year and exposed at least four of them.He claimed the scam centres were in Kolkata, West Bengal.

Tesla on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a transportation charter-party carrier permit (TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.

With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the Cybercab, a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.

Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.

Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.

Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.

A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes on Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said.

Wednesday 19 March 2025 19:16, UK

Israel says it has launched a ""limited ground operation"" to retake part of a key corridor in Gaza.

The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive that shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January.

As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which bisected northern Gaza from the south and had been used by Israeli forces as a military zone.

It came as an international United Nations worker from Bulgaria was killed and five others seriously wounded in a strike on a UN guesthouse in the Gaza Strip.

Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the UN Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike that killed the worker in the central city of Deir al Balah but said the explosive ordnance was ""dropped or fired"" and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.

The UN body, known as UNOPS, carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world.

Oren Marmorstein, spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Sky News that the country carried out an initial investigation which found there was ""no connection"" between the strike and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Speaking to Mark Austin on the News Hour, he said: ""Of course, we express our sorrow when it comes to the death of a Bulgarian citizen, a UN worker.

""But no connection has been found. And even more so, we are now working in order to evacuate the body and the wounded will be treated in hospitals in Israel.""

Mr Marmorstein did not say who Israel believes is responsible for the strike but said it may be connected to a ""terrorist organisation"".

The IDF, which has carried out a massive series of airstrikes throughout Gaza since early on Tuesday, had earlier denied reports that it had targeted the UN compound.

But Mr Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the worker was killed.

He said the agency had contacted the IDF after the first strike and confirmed that it was aware of the facility's location.

The UN's secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the staff member's death and condemned attacks on UN personnel.

The war in Gaza has been among the deadliest conflicts ever for humanitarian workers, according to the UN.

At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes, the Gaza health ministry said.

Mr Marmorstein insisted on Sky News that the figures are ""anything but accurate"".

The IDF claims it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Gaza's health ministry records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it had overnight attacked a Hamas military site from which the militant group planned to launch strikes into Israel.

The IDF targeted the site in northern Gaza as it was where ""preparations were being made to fire projectiles at Israeli territory"", the military said in a statement.

The Israeli navy also struck several vessels in the coastal area of Gaza as they were intended to be used for ""terrorist activities"", the IDF claimed.

Israel issued fresh evacuation orders on Wednesday for different areas across the Gaza Strip and told people to move to known shelters in Khan Younis and western Gaza City.

Middle East correspondent

Israel is facing increasing international opposition to its new assault on Gaza, and from some of its close allies including Britain and France whose leaders have both voiced concerns today.

But in actions, and words, the Israeli government is defying those calling for it to stop the attacks.


The Israel Defense Forces has announced what it describes as “limited” ground operations in central and southern Gaza, but limited for how long?


Israel's defence minister has warned of ""total devastation"" if Hamas doesn't surrender.

Beyond the threats, it's not clear what Israel's strategy is. 

The government failed to achieve its two war aims - to eliminate Hamas and return the hostages - during fifteen and a half months of brutal fighting, so how will it have more success now?


One answer might be Netanyahu's belief that President Trump won't try to rein him in as Joe Biden did. 

But for how long will the White House support a new phase of the war in Gaza?

Trump is an impatient man, and he wants a Gaza peace deal as part of his wider ambitions to resolve the world's conflicts. 


If Netanyahu's new offensive doesn't deliver quick results, the White House might not remain so supportive. 

The latest strikes come weeks after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages for prisoners and were set to negotiate an extension to the truce that was meant to bring about an eventual end to the war. But those negotiations never got off the ground.

Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war.

Follow our channel and never miss an update

Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war.

During the ceasefire period, 33 hostages were released, along with nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners.

There are 59 hostages still in captivity, of whom Israel believes 35 are dead.

More than one million people risked being left without food parcels in March if aid was not allowed into Gaza, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the Food Security Sector as saying.

The war, sparked by Hamas' 7 October 2023 killing of 1,200 people and capture of 250 more in southern Israel, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in the Strip, Gazan health officials say.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

UK-based Cornish Bakery has appointed advisors to oversee a sale of the business. 
 

The premium bakery-café chain said consumer-focused M&A advisory firm Tamweel Capital will facilitate a deal, which is expected to generate interest from private equity firms and strategic trade suitors. It has not been disclosed whether Cornish Bakery is pursuing a full or partial stake sale. 


World Coffee Portal has approached Cornish Bakery and Tamweel for comment. 
 

Founded in 1994 by Steve Grocutt, Cornish Bakery currently operates 66 UK stores, serving a premium food menu of pasties, pastries and brunch dishes alongside specialty coffee supplied by London-based Union Hand Roasted Coffee. 


The chain, which has previously received funding from Virgin Money to open new outlets, appointed Matt Finch as its first Managing Director in May 2024 to lead its bid to ‘double or triple in size' over the next few years. 


“From our first bakery in Cornwall to our nationwide presence today, we've stayed true to our vision of bringing high-quality, handcrafted products to every corner of the UK. The brand is in a fantastic position for its next chapter, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've built. With the right partner, Cornish Bakery has the potential to go much further, and I'm excited for what's next,” Grocutt said. 


Cornish Bakery posted 9.7% like-for-like sales growth for the last six months of 2024, with total year-on-year total sales increasing 26%. The premium bakery-café chain forecasts full-year revenue for the 12 months ending 31 May 2025 will reach £37m ($48.1m) – representing 26% year-on-year growth if achieved. 


Coffee shop M&A activity in the UK ramped up in the second half of 2024, with hospitality operators and investors seeking a greater slice of the booming £6.1bn UK branded coffee shop market. 


Premium doughnut and coffee chain Crosstown, specialty coffee roaster and café group The Gentlemen Baristas and hospital coffee chain Peabody Coffee all obtained new owners last year, while US coffee giant Starbucks acquired its largest UK franchisee, 23.5 Degrees, in October 2024. 


Gerry Ford-run The Nero Group also bolstered its UK coffee shop portfolio by acquiring Nottingham-based coffee roaster and café chain 200 Degrees Coffee and travel hub coffee chain FCB Coffee, while Bread Holdings reportedly appointed New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs to auction a sale of Gail's in November 2024. 


London-based Tamweel advised on a £5.5m ($7.1m) private equity raise for sustainability-focused restaurant chain Farmer J in January 2025 and has also facilitated fundraises for hospitality group White Rabbit Projects, experiential leisure brand Swingers and fitness group Gymbox.

Give us back the Statue of Liberty, Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party  | Photo: Pexels


	Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France.


	So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the US is no longer worthy of the monument, which was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.


	Raphael Glucksmann, as a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, can't claim to speak for all of his compatriots.


	But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants reflects the broad shockwaves that US President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe.


	Give us back the Statue of Liberty, Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled, on Sunday.


	It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us, Glucksmann said.


	The White House brushed back on the comments Monday, saying France instead should still be grateful for U.S. support during World War I and World War II. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is eternal, but added: If the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe."" 
	No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty, he wrote in X posts. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone.


	Can France claim it back? 
	Dream on.


	Unesco, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is US government property.


	It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.


	But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Frdric-Auguste Bartholdi.


	The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision made that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.


	Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled on Oct. 28, 1886.


	Is France's government offering asylum to Lady Liberty? 
	No French-US relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.


	For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand, but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.


	Macron has let his prime minister, Franois Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the brutality that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine.


	Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an authoritarian manner and is preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter to Russia.


	In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the mighty woman with a torch who promised a home for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.


	Today, this land is ceasing to be what it was, Glucksmann said.


	What is the White House saying? 
	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about Glucksmann's comments, responded that the US would absolutely not be parting with the landmark in New York Harbour.


	Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in a lawsuit by The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.


	My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,"" Leavitt said Monday, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I. They should be very grateful.


	But the debt of gratitude runs both ways. Leavitt skipped past France's key role in supporting the future United States during its war for independence from the United Kingdom.


	In his subsequent follow-up, Glucksmann said that his call for Lady Liberty to travel back across the Atlantic to France had been intended as a wake-up call.


	We all in Europe love this nation to which we know we owe so much,"" he posted. It will rise again. You will rise again. We are counting on you.

Antigua Foreign Minister Says ""Not On Island""","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-news-antigua-barbuda-where-is-mehul-choksi-antigua-foreign-minister-says-not-on-the-island-7961187","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:42:42 GMT","

Mehul Choksi - wanted by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate in the alleged defrauding of the Punjab National Bank of Rs 13,850 crore - is not currently on the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene told news agency ANI Wednesday evening.

Mr Greene - invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, India's annual conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics - said the fugitive businessman had left for medical treatment.

He did not reveal where Mr Choksi had gone, only that he remains an Antiguan citizen.

""Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda. The governments, yours and mine, are working together on this matter,"" he said when asked about Mr Choksi's extradition to India.

""We both respect the rule of law (and) the matter of Mehul Choksi has been subject to legal review. Until it is reviewed... there is nothing I, or anyone else, can say or do,"" he said.

He also told a TV channel, ""I want to assure the Indian people there will be no subterfuge.""

Mehul Choksi, 65, fled India in January 2018 after being named in the PNB case.

His nephew, 54-year-old Nirav Modi was also named and is awaiting extradition from London.

In May last year Mr Choksi told a special court in Mumbai that he has not been able to return to India ""due to reasons beyond (my) control"", and therefore could not be called a 'fugitive economic offender'.

This was after the ED moved the special court - to declare him a 'fugitive economic offender' for evading its summons, and for his properties to be confiscated under the relevant laws.

In May 2021 he went 'missing' from Antigua, sparking speculation he had been 'kidnapped' by the Indian government - an absurd claim proven false after he was found on another Caribbean island nation - Dominica. There were also suggestions he attempted to flee expecting extradition.

He was arrested by Dominican authorities for entering their country illegally, but returned to Antigua on interim bail for medical treatment. In May 2022 proceedings against him were ""discontinued"".

Mr Choksi had contested the illegal entry charge, claiming he had been from a restaurant in Antigua - called Jolly Roger, which he reportedly owned - by 'cops' and taken to Dominica on a boat

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wouldn't mind if the Liberal Party won the upcoming Canadian election, saying: ""I'd rather deal with a liberal than a conservative.""

Trump has taken a tough stance toward Canada, imposing tariffs on Canadian imports and repeatedly threatening to make it the 51st US state.

During an interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle,"" host Laura Ingraham pointed out that Trump's treatment of Canada could propel the ruling Liberals to win the next election and lead a government that's hostile to the U.S.

""I don't care,"" Trump responded. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all.""

Trump then took aim at the Liberals' main opponent, Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre.

""The conservative that's running is, stupidly, no friend of mine. I don't know him, but he said negative things,"" he said. ""When he says negative things, I couldn't care less.""

The Liberals, who have been in power since Justin Trudeau was elected prime minister in 2015, just weeks ago looked headed toward certain defeat to the Conservatives in an election that must be held by October 20 and may happen earlier.

But the party is mounting a major comeback after replacing Trudeau with former central banker Mark Carney. Several recent opinion polls have shown the Liberals closing the gap or even ahead of the Conservatives.

The Liberals have portrayed Poilievre as a right-wing populist in the same vein as Trump. A Liberal advertisement accuses Poilievre - a career politician who supported an anti-government movement during the COVID-19 pandemic - of resembling Trump.

Poilievre has adopted the slogan ""Canada First"" in the face of US threats, and sought to tie Carney to the former Trudeau government, which lost popularity in recent years as a result of the cost of living and a deepening housing crisis.

The Conservative Party of Canada and the Liberal Party of Canada didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Young, urban women in Afghanistan are increasingly ditching the all-enveloping blue burqa with a face mesh that has become a symbol of the Taliban's oppression of women.

Since their return to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed an ultra-strict vision of Islamic law, modelled on their previous rule from 1996 to 2001.

But while women must still have their bodies and faces covered, restrictions from the feared religious police do not specifically mention the burqa.

So young women are instead following fashions seen in many Gulf nations.

Many prefer a flowing abaya robe, worn with a hijab headscarf and often a face covering as well -- sometimes a medical mask, or a Saudi-style cloth niqab veil that exposes only the eyes.

""The new generation would never accept wearing a burqa, because of the design and colour,"" said 23-year-old Tahmina Adel in the capital Kabul.

With social media, ""everybody follows the trends"", Adel added, who was forced to quit her economics degree because of the Taliban government's ban on women's education.

""I prefer wearing an abaya because I am comfortable in that,"" she said.

Young women in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif said that abayas and headscarves offer more freedom of expression than burqas, with a variation in colour, material and pattern.

""Only elders wear a burqa,"" said Razia Khaliq, as she embroidered one at a workshop in Mazar-i-Sharif.

Khaliq began wearing the billowing head-to-toe burqa aged 13, like her mother and grandmother before her.

But her daughter, in her 20s, prefers the abaya.

""Young people wear the abaya because it is more comfortable,"" Khaliq said.

The burqa has long roots in Afghanistan.

It was strictly enforced during the first Taliban government rule of Afghanistan, when women were lashed for failing to wear one in public.

But the abaya and hijab headscarf combination grew in popularity during the time of the foreign-backed government.

When the Taliban recaptured Kabul in 2021, they had promised to be more flexible than during their first rule, when women were deprived of almost all their rights.

They have gradually erased Afghan women from public space, imposing what the United Nations has called a ""gender apartheid"".

They outlawed the loose headscarves commonly worn by urban women.

Billboards were erected ordering women to once again wear the burqa -- or an abaya, headscarf and a face covering.

A law in August confirmed restrictions imposed on men and women by the religious police.

It stipulates that, while women can go out ""in case of necessity"", they must cover up.

""Whether a burqa or hijab, there is no difference,"" said Saif ul Islam Khyber, spokesman for the morality police, known officially as the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

Nasima, in her 40s, insisted that ""showing your face is a sin"".

But she admitted to sometimes wearing an abaya and headscarf to free her nose and mouth from the ""stifling"" burqa.

Niha, 22, said she was reprimanded for not wearing a burqa in public buildings, which are guarded by the Taliban authority's security forces.

It is common to be asked to readjust the headscarf, or ordered to add a medical mask.

""As soon as we enter offices, we are mistreated,"" said Niha, who did not give her surname.

Hayatullah Rafiqi, a specialist in Pashtun culture, said the burqa was ""strictly imposed"" under the first Taliban government -- when some women were ""whipped if they did not wear it"" -- but that ""today it is worn less.""

Burqas vary only in colour according to province, from blue to light brown, and green to pink.

Gul Mohammad has been selling burqas in Kabul for 40 years, and said many now come from China -- made of nylon rather than cotton, making them cheaper and stronger but less breathable.

""The Chinese burqa is very cold in winter, and it is like fire in summer,"" said Gul. ""This makes the women sweat.""

For Sabrina, 23, from the Taliban's spiritual cradle of Kandahar, life under a burqa is fraught with pitfalls.

She is regularly lectured if she does not wear it.

The first time she wore it was after the Taliban government seized back control in 2021, and it was not her choice.

""I couldn't see my way, I didn't know if I was going right or left,"" she said. ""It was very strange.""

A top US general warned on Tuesday about China developing ‘dogfighting' skills in space, with the country's satellites having conducted coordinated manoeuvres with ‘synchrony' and ‘control'.

Speaking at the annual McAleese defence programmes conference, vice chief of space operations, General Michael Guetlein, said the US Space Force has observed five different objects' in doing manoeuvres that he described as ‘dogfighting', a term generally used for air-to-air combat between fighter jets.

“The service is starting to see our near-peers focusing on practicing dogfighting in space with satellite-on-satellite operations. With our commercial assets, we have observed five different objects in space manoeuvring in and out and around each other in synchrony and in control. That's what we call dogfighting in space. They are practicing tactics, techniques, and procedures to do on-orbit space operations from one satellite to another,” Guetlein was quoted as saying by Defense One.

The US Space Force also confirmed the same following Guetlein's comments, saying that the official was referring to a series of Chinese satellite maneuvers in 2024 in low Earth orbit. These manoeuvres involved three Shiyan-24C experimental satellites and two Chinese experimental space objects, the Shijian-6 05A/B.

Dogfight in space is a term that is still gaining a definition as there is no friction or atmosphere in space. So to do what the jets achieve by using atmospheric friction, objects in space have to rely on thrusters.

Apart from China developing dogfight skills, general Michael Guetlein outlined other threats in space that the US (and other countries) face. According to him, these include ‘nesting dolls' that could launch anti-satellite weapons, satellites that ‘shadow' other satellites, and satellites equipped with grappling arms that can tow another satellite or hold it hostage. He warned that Russia has developed a nuclear weapon designed for space.

“Unfortunately, our current adversaries are willing to go against international norms of behavior, go against that gentleman's agreement, and they're willing to do it in very unsafe and unprofessional manners,” Guetlein said.

According to him, the competitors of the United States have narrowed the capability gap that existed before and called for the country to shift in approach.

US President Donald Trump announced the creation of the Space Force in 2019 during his first term in office. It became an independent military service in 2020. According to its website, the service focuses on establishing superiority in the space domain. General Guetlein's comments are a call in that same regard.

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has once again defended his stance against remote work and expressed frustration with the virtual environment.

At Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, Mr Dimon said he has had enough of the common work-from-anywhere practice, which doesn't work in his business.

The comment came after a student questioned him about his remarks from a company town hall where he strongly criticised hybrid work policies.

The 68-year-old said he respected employees' rights to choose remote work and favoured it when it proved effective. He explained that 10 per cent of his employees worked from home and the company set up virtual call centres in Baltimore and Detroit.

""They're highly effective. They work from home. They're mostly minorities. That's why we did it. So I'm not against it where it works,"" he said.

The CEO added that employees had the right to choose whether or not they wanted to work remotely, but stated that he would not allow personal preferences to control corporate strategy.

He said the only group of people that were unhappy with the return to the office were ""the people of the middle,"" such as corporate workers. He explained, ""If you work in a restaurant, you've got to be in. You all may not know this, but 60 per cent of Americans worked the whole time.""

Referring to people who have never had the option to work remotely, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, ""Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?""

Mr Dimon said, ""You got UPS and FedEx and manufacturers and agriculture and hospitals and cities and schools and nurses and sanitation and firemen and military. They all worked.""

Mr Dimon said he wanted employees back in the office because he believed younger people were being left behind. He clarified that although it might not initially appear like a major problem, over time, remote workers eventually lose out on important opportunities. They have fewer connections with colleagues and receive fewer assignments, he added.

""As a management tool, when we meet in the morning, we talk, we have these debates, all day long we're talking. Hey, no, I checked on that, you're right about that, here's what I think we should do,"" he said.

""All day long, constant update, constant share of information. So I tell you, it doesn't work in our business. And for culture, you talk about culture, it's impossible to do culture.""

He also highlighted that phone usage often distracted people during Zoom meetings.

In February 2025, Mr Dimon dismissed suggestions from employees to reconsider the company's five-day return-to-office (RTO) policy.

""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that f***ing petition,"" he said, according to a Reuters-reviewed recording.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Mekhri feels ""a sense of freedom and self-confidence"" when she's behind the wheel of a car -- despite being forced to drive illegally because of an unwritten rule in Turkmenistan preventing women getting a licence.

In the reclusive Central Asian state where she lives, young women are effectively banned from driving.

""I know the rules of the road. I drive calmly, don't overtake anyone and know how to park,"" the 19-year-old said.

Like other women interviewed by AFP in Turkmenistan -- ranked by rights groups as one of the most closed and repressive countries in the world -- she withheld her surname.

There is no legislation specifically outlawing women under 30 from obtaining a driving licence. But it is one of many informal prohibitions that is universally followed, so women that do drive must do so without a permit, which is illegal.

""When my daughter wanted to enrol at the driving school, we were told that she could take lessons but that she would probably not pass the test,"" said Guzel, Mekhri's 57-year-old mother.

So instead of paying for lessons, Guzel assumed the role of instructor and now takes Mekhri outside the capital Ashgabat to practice.

""Where there are few cars, police officers and cameras, I let my daughter take the wheel and I teach her,"" Guzel, who started driving when she was 40, told AFP.

Among the other transport-related diktats imposed by father-and-son heads of state Gurbanguly and Serdar Berdymukhamedov -- who have ruled the country one after the other since 2006 -- are a ban on black cars.

Owners have been forced to paint the vehicles white, the favourite colour of Gurbanguly, whose official titles are ""Hero-Protector"" and ""leader of the Turkmen nation"".

Many young women share Mekhri's frustration.

""I wanted to take my test at 18. At the driving school, the instructor immediately warned the many girls there: 'You've come for nothing. You won't be able to take it,"" said Maisa, a 26-year-old saleswoman.

""But up to the exam, driving schools take both boys and girls, because they pay,"" she told AFP.

Goulia, 19, said her parents had wanted to buy her a car when she went to university so she could be more independent, do the family shopping and take her grandmother to hospital and the chemist's.

""But because of the difficulties that girls like me face getting a driver's licence, my mother said she would have to postpone the decision,"" she said.

""I've just turned 19 and I can't get a licence but the boys can and I don't understand why,"" she added.

Turkmenistan's motor transport agency did not respond to an AFP request to comment.

Contacted via phone by AFP, one driving school said ""women have the right to enrol in the course and take the exam"" before abruptly hanging up.

But another instructor from Ashgabat acknowledged the informal ban.

""It is due to a sharp increase in accidents involving female drivers,"" the instructor said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""After an investigation by the authorities, it turned out they were simply buying driving licences,"" the instructor said -- a claim AFP could not verify.

Rules have also been tightened for women over 30 who are not covered by the informal ban.

To register a car in their own name, they have to show a marriage certificate, family record book and a report from their employer.

Authorities routinely reject accusations that they are restricting women's rights.

Responding to a recent United Nations report criticising the country, the government said: ""The motherland treats mothers and women with great respect.""

Ahead of International Women's Day on March 8, President Serdar Berdymukhamedov gifted every woman the equivalent of $3 -- enough to buy a cake or six kilos (13 pounds) of potatoes.

 Turkish assets drop after arrest of Erdogan rival 

 By Harry Robertson 

 LONDON, - 

 European shares slipped on Wednesday after a selloff on Wall Street overnight, while the dollar ticked up from a five-month low ahead of the Federal Reserve rates decision later in the day. 

 Turkish stocks, bonds and the lira all slid, meanwhile, after 

 Turkish authorities detained 

 President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival on Wednesday. 

 The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.1% after rising for the three previous sessions, boosted by 

 Germany's overhaul 

 of its debt rules to spend far more on defence and infrastructure. Germany's DAX index was down 0.3% after hitting a record high on Tuesday. 

 European stocks took their cue from Wall Street, where equity indices fell on Tuesday as investors continued to worry about a slowdown in growth stemming from tariffs. 

 The S&P 500 fell 1.1% and tech stocks were particularly hard hit with the Nasdaq index falling 1.7% on Tuesday. Futures pointed to a muted open on Wall Street on Wednesday with S&P contracts ticking up 0.1%. 

 U.S. stocks have tumbled this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's stop-start tariffs have 

 sown uncertainty 

 among companies, households and investors. 

 European shares have fared much better, thanks to plans to ramp up defence spending in response to Trump's more isolationist policies, the major fiscal changes in Germany, and hopes of an end to the war in Ukraine. 

 Asian stocks struggled for direction overnight, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 0.25% but China's CSI 300 inching slightly higher. 

 ""There's still a continuation of the notion of a U.S. growth slowdown relative to expectations,"" said Tim Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street. ""There's a realisation that growth will probably get worse before it gets better."" 

 Graf said the slight fall in European stocks on Wednesday was likely due to disappointment with the peace process in Ukraine after Russian President 

 Vladimir Putin 

 refrained from endorsing a full 30-day ceasefire. 

 In currencies, the dollar index ticked up 0.25% to 103.57 after dropping to a five-month low of 103.19 on Tuesday as the euro rallied on the approval of the German spending bill by parliament's lower house. 

 The dollar rose slightly against the yen after the 

 Bank of Japan 

 held rates as expected and was last up 0.2% at 149.60. 

 Attention now turns to 

 the Fed 

 , which traders expect to keep rates in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Investors will focus on new economic projections amid tumbling stock markets and signs of tightening credit. 

 Markets are pricing in around 60 basis points of easing this year from the Fed, with the first cut fully priced in for July, LSEG data showed. 

 TURKISH SELL-OFF 

 The Turkish lira slid in its biggest daily fall since the peak of the country's most recent 

 currency crisis 

 in June 2023 and last traded at around 39 per dollar, down around 5%. 

 Investors ditched Turkish assets after authorities detained Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, on Wednesday on charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group. The main opposition party called the arrest ""a coup against our next president"". 

 Turkey's main stock index was last around 6% lower and government bond prices dropped as analysts said the arrest raises concerns about economic reforms in Turkey. 

 ""Traders had become increasingly complacent, and that spell has now been broken, with dramatic results as traders reprice Turkey's political risk premia, triggering this morning's sharp lira selloff,"" said Nick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe. 

 Analysts said the move out of the lira was likely boosting the U.S. dollar.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","Vikings haven't completely closed the door on Aaron Rodgers","https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/vikings-havent-completely-closed-the-door-on-aaron-rodgers","Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:17:33 GMT","

The clue was hiding in plain sight, at the tail end of the report the Vikings leaked on Wednesday morning to NFL Network.

The Vikings are not pursuing veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers “at this time.”

Given that many reacted to the news as a closing of the door on Rodgers, the Vikings have leaked clarification. They could revisit Rodgers later in the offseason.

This means that second-year first-rounder J.J. McCarthy will lead the offense in the offseason program. If he checks the boxes and looks to be the best option, he'll continue to be the QB1. If things go sideways, Rodgers could become the emergency option.

If, of course, he hasn't signed with another team.

In the interim, the Vikings will need at least one more quarterback, if not two. Two arms (McCarthy and Brett Rypien) aren't enough to distribute the reps in OTAs.

Would it be better for Rodgers if he has a chance to fully prepare to play quarterback for the Vikings? Sure. But remember this — in 2009, Brett Favre didn't sign with the Vikings until August 18. This gives the Vikings a chance to be sure that McCarthy is good to go. It also gives Rodgers an incentive to bide his time.

Will it be clunky if the Vikings suddenly pivot to Rodgers in August? Sure. But the Vikings were able to overcome the “schism” that had the team supposedly split between Tarvaris Jackson and Favre. Once Favre showed up and started flinging the pig, any and all doubts about the upgrade to the aging veteran were instantly squelched.

Auburn, the top college basketball team in the country, was called first on Selection Sunday. A few moments later it was Texas A&M's turn. Then Ole Miss. Then Mississippi State. By the full reveal of the 2025 NCAA Tournament's bracket, 10 more SEC schools would be named. 

The conference has 16 programs — and an unprecedented 14 made into the NCAA Tournament, including four of the top eight teams in the bracket. The aforementioned Tigers, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama were all seeded No. 1 or No. 2.

“It's a dominating performance,” ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla told NBC News. “I'm not sure there's ever been a conference that is this clearly far ahead of everyone else in a given year.”

Not bad for a league most people associate with football. The SEC has 13 national championships since 2006, routinely brings in the best high school recruits, produces the most NFL talent and boasts fan bases that treat the sport like a religion.  

But in 2025, the roundball — not the pigskin — reigns supreme. 

“Statistically it's the best season for any conference in modern college basketball history,” said Garth Glissman, the SEC's associate commissioner of men's basketball.

The secret to the league's success? Get older, not younger. 

A decade ago, in the “one and done” era of college basketball, top-tier programs were built on their ability to recruit elite high school players. Former Kentucky coach John Calipari, now with Arkansas, was a prime example. He built the Wildcats into a consistent power with 14 freshman classes ranked either No. 1 or No. 2 in the nation, according to On3. 

But times have changed since the establishment of “Name, Image and Likeness” (NIL) deals and new transfer rules. Since 2021, the NCAA has allowed players to change programs and not sit out a season. And NIL collectives — groups that raise money with both large and small donors at individual schools — are able to offer athletes deals to join their programs. Some are reportedly in the millions of dollars. 

This is all to say that transfers — not incoming freshmen — are the shiny new toys. 

“There was a significant period of time in college basketball where high school recruiting rankings dictated a program's success,” Glissman said. “Now players are able to transfer more freely, and so after each season, they're effectively free agents. They're able to assess the landscape and go often to the highest level of basketball available to them and to the best fit. Certainly that has worked to the SEC's benefit this year.”

No more so than for Auburn, the best team in the country. 

The Tigers (28-5) won the SEC regular season largely thanks to experienced talent. The roster includes six fifth-year or older players, and the starting lineup's average age is 23.2.

Johni Broome, a first-team All-American who averages 18.9 points and 10.6 rebounds a game, is a Morehead State transfer. Auburn's second-leading scorer, Chad Baker-Mazara, is at his fourth school. The backcourt of Denver Jones and Miles Kelly transferred in from Florida International and Georgia Tech, respectively.

Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said the program has nine seniors, seven of whom have already graduated. 

“There's very little difference between a 48-year-old man and a 52-year-old man. But there's a huge difference between an 18-year-old man and a 22-year-old,” he told NBC News. “It's huge — physically, experience, maturity, you name it.”

Pearl, who has taken 22 teams to the NCAA Tournament, added his current squad could be his most promising yet. 

“This is a team that is capable of winning a national championship,” he said. “It could be the best team I've ever had, but that's to be determined.” 

Another program that exemplifies this way of thinking is top-seeded Florida. The Gators, with a starting lineup average age of 21.6, just won the SEC Tournament behind senior transfers Walter Clayton Jr. (Iona) and Alijah Martin (Florida Atlantic). 

“We're still getting some of the best high school players to come to the SEC,” Glissman said, “but this year in particular, the winning formula in our conference has been older, veteran players.”

In contrast, the ACC, long considered one of the premier basketball conferences, has had a down year, partly based on a hesitancy to embrace NIL. According to ESPN, “the ACC's top 10 men's basketball players in NIL earnings in January 2024 made less than their peers in the Big East, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC.”

Only four teams from the conference — No. 1 seed Duke, No. 5 Clemson, No. 8 Louisville and No. 11 North Carolina — got into the Big Dance. 

“They haven't given their coaches the resources that you need to compete for really good players,” ESPN's Seth Greenberg told NBC News. “We live in a world where it's ‘pay for play.' That's the world we live in. One school [Duke] has done a really good job. Your investment equals your expectation. If you want that expectation of being really good, then you've got to match that expectation with your investment.”

Greenberg cites Auburn, Alabama, Florida and Tennessee as SEC teams that could make deep postseason runs but isn't counting out anyone in the conference. 

“They're the deepest, most athletic, most mature and [are] as well-coached as any conference in America,” he said. “What they did well ahead of everyone else is they invested in coaches, facilities, infrastructure and now obviously NIL. So they've hired world class coaches, given them the resources, and in the climate of college athletics today, that's a perfect storm.”

SPORTS ALERT: Navy men's basketball coach Ed DeChellis is retiring after 29 years as a collegiate head coach



Nick Iannelli  | niannelli@wtop.com


March 18, 2025, 8:26 PM

Thousands of young students across D.C. will soon have a new way to stay active as Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the company that owns the Washington Capitals and Wizards, begins handing out 29,000 NBA regulation-size basketballs to elementary school students.

The effort is part of the company's commitment to expanding access to youth sports, according to Monumental CEO Ted Leonsis.

“Going to the schools and giving out these balls is going to be a lot of fun,” Leonsis said. “The parents, the kids, the students — this will be something tangible to have an official NBA ball.”

The plan is to give every student, from kindergarten through fifth grade, a basketball at 80 public schools in the city.

“This is a big donation,” said Lewis Ferebee, chancellor of D.C. Public Schools. “(It's) an opportunity to get students moving around, improving physical health, but also gaining some athletic skills.”

The first 300 basketballs will be delivered on Thursday at Browne Education Campus in Northeast D.C.

Deliveries will continue at a rate of about five schools per day, with the goal of having every student receive a ball before spring break. Each basketball features the official Washington Wizards logo and team colors.

“Sports can positively impact students, whether it's physical health, mental health, emotional health or social skills,” Ferebee said. “This is another great way to show the connection between sports and organized activities, and how they help build well-rounded students.”

The whole process is expected to take about a month to complete.

“We've got to blow up the basketballs, if you can believe it,” Leonsis said with a laugh, adding that employees have volunteered to help. “We're working really, really hard on that.”

Leonsis said he hopes it creates lasting memories for students.

“When you say we're giving every kid a basketball, everyone closes their eyes and just remembers when you got for Christmas, a new baseball glove or a football or a basketball,” he said.

Campbell

Bellwood-Antis graduate Alli Campbell confirmed via text message to the Altoona Mirror Tuesday evening that she has entered the NCAA transfer portal ahead of her final year of college basketball eligibility.

Campbell has spent the last four years with the Penn State women's basketball program but did not play and used a redshirt due to injury during the 2021-2022 season.

This past season, Campbell played in a career-high 26 games and started 23 of them. She also had career high averages in minutes per game (30.5) points per game (8.1), rebounds per game (4.1), assists per game (4.4) and steals per game (1.4).

“I definitely haven't ruled out staying at PSU, but sometimes a change of scenery isn't a bad thing,” Campbell texted. “For my last year, I'm trying to find a great fit for how I play basketball and hopefully help a team win games. Penn State will always be home, though, no matter what.”

Campbell's time at Penn State was unfortunately marred by injuries, including one that hampered her this past season.

She played in 25 games and averaged 15.2 minutes per game during the 2023-2024 season and averaged 3.2 points per game. Campbell played in just 10 games during the 2022-2023 season, starting one, and finished averaging 3.9 points per game.

She began her college career in the 2020-2021 season at Notre Dame and played in six games, averaging 2.2 points in limited action, before entering the transfer portal and coming to Penn State.

Campbell is Blair County's all-time leading scorer in high school basketball, finishing with 3,019 points during her stellar career at Bellwood-Antis. 

She led the Lady Blue Devils to back-to-back PIAA Class 2A championships in 2018 and 2019 before her senior season was cut short in the PIAA quarterfinals when the rest of the tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wind Advisory for nearly the entire Lake Shore, Newaygo, Mecosta counties for 50 mph gusts, isolated outages, limbs may come down.

by Abigail Taylor | News Channel 3

TOPICS:

KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Kalamazoo County could soon be home to a state-of-the-art youth sports complex, designed to bring basketball and volleyball tournaments to the region, promising to transform the region's sports tourism industry while providing new opportunities for local youth. 

Brian Persky, Director of Business Development at Discover Kalamazoo told News Channel 3 that he has been spearheading the effort for nearly three years, aiming to provide a major boost to the local economy by tapping into a booming market of youth sports tourism.

“About 80% of our sports tourism groups [are] in five sports—wrestling, ice hockey, ice skating, soccer, and tennis,” said Persky. “But when we studied the sports with the highest participation levels, we found that basketball and volleyball were being overlooked. We weren't capturing any of that. In a lot of cases, these kids were leaving our community to play in tournaments.”

The plan calls for at least eight basketball courts and 16 volleyball courts, providing what Persky said is much-needed space for local teams and tournaments.

“In our eyes, it's a win-win for local programs and for sports tourism. We can keep those people and those dollars in our community,” Persky added.

This new center would fill a gap in youth sports infrastructure in the region, as there are no comparable facilities within an hour and a half of Kalamazoo. The closest facilities are in Brighton and Mishawaka, Indiana, according to Persky.

“We're really trying to be the first ones to do this and get something going sooner rather than later,” said Persky.

The facility would primarily serve as a tournament venue on weekends, with additional space during the week for local programs to expand.

Persky stated that the new center is not intended to compete with other regional facilities, such as the Courthouse Athletic Center in Portage, but rather offer something entirely new to West Michigan.

“We think it can complement what they're doing out there. We've had conversations with the Courthouse, and they've told us themselves that there are limits to what they can do,” said Persky, noting that ceiling height restrictions and a focus on local programs limit the Courthouse's ability to host large tournaments.

While the exact location of the new facility is yet to be determined, a thorough site selection process has already been completed. 

“We started with over 30 potential locations and narrowed it down to a top three,” Persky said. However, no decision can be made until an authority is created at the county level, a process expected to take place in April and be completed by May.

Persky said the goal is to have the facility up and rolling by the end of 2025 or early 2026.","{'href': 'https://wwmt.com', 'title': 'WWMT-TV'}"

When a triumphant Medfield girls hockey team skated off TD Garden ice on Sunday after 10:30 p.m., the winter sports season ended. 

But before we look ahead to improved weather, baseball/softball diamonds and lacrosse balls rippling into nets, let's spring backward. 

The final weekend of the season included Franklin's boys hoop team winning the winter's final game on the hardwood, which also served as the last game on the sidelines for Newton North's Paul Connolly after 24 seasons. 

This winter included eight 1,000-point scorers – likely a record for these parts – five individual All-States wrestling champions, three indoor team track and field titles and a Wayland boys swimming team champ. 

For peak performances, we compiled 14 of them – and not all of them involved champions. Buzzer beaters (two by L-S!), overtime goals and wrestling duals are here for your viewing. 

When we did this in the fall, more than 91,000 votes were cast. It was so popular, let's do it again. Help us select the Highlight of the Winter. Vote below. 

A quick refresher, in no particular order, in case you're having trouble going back to a cold and snowy past few months: 

We couldn't have these two competing against each other for votes, so we packaged them together. Paul Conway, on Jan. 10, swished a foul-line jumper just before time expired in a home win over Concord-Carlisle. 

Five weeks later, Nolan Martindale knocked down a shot in traffic to beat the buzzer in a victory to close the regular season at the Spartan Classic in Lynn. 

Logan Keaney took an inbounds pass and nonchalantly flipped a shot over his shoulder that went off the glass and in to give Medway a 43-41 win over Norton on Valentine's Day. 

In their fourth visit to the finals, the Franklin boys basketball team finally broke through and won the title behind 31 points from Caden Sullivan. The 55-52 win over Newton North capped a 26-1 season. 

Junior Phoebe Carroll drove the lane, hit a short runner and celebrated with her Hopedale teammates on Jan. 31. The basket gave helped her surpass 1,000 career points, a feat her mother, Cheryl, achieved in 1989.  

In a first, the Framingham wrestling team took its act downtown on Jan. 29 to help the city celebrate its 325th birthday. The City Hall Showdown drew a packed house as the Flyers defeated Braintree 40-30. 

After Medway tied the score late in the third period, Hudson didn't blink. Jordan Sousa scored in the second overtime to give the Hawks a 3-2 playoff victory in Franklin, setting off a wild celebration with the Red Sea, aka, the Hudson student section. 

During 3-on-3 play in double overtime against Pembroke in the Division 3 playoffs, Jack Gavron lifted Watertown/Wayland to a 4-3 victory over Pembroke. Gavron skated over the blue line, used a toe drag and a spin move to nutmeg a defenseman before faking out the goalie to flip in a backhander. He then dropped to his knees to celebrate with his teammates. 

The same day Hudson survived on the ice, Milford senior Aidan Baum became one of two Scarlet Hawks to win All-States wrestling titles, along with Mikey Boulanger. Baum punctuated his win over St. John's Prep's James Lally at 144 pounds with a back flip. 

With the season on the line, Patrick Madden led Hopedale to the state finals when he scored with 3.6 seconds left in a 57-56 win over Westport in the Division 5 Final Four in Taunton. 

It wouldn't be winter without another indoor track and field championship for the girls from Wellesley. In winning a pair of relays, the Raiders won their eighth in a row, out-pacing the field at Reggie Lewis Center by 15 points. 

It came down to a dropped baton, but the Algonquin boys indoor team won its first state title. Miles Lipka scored 25 of the Titans' 43 points, winning the 55 dash and the high jump while also placing fourth in the long jump. 

Natick junior Emmanuella Edozien set the state record in the 55-meter hurdles during the Division 1 meet at Reggie Lewis Center. Her time of 7.96 seconds bested the old mark by 1/100th of a second. 

Another buzzer beater. Framingham senior Allie Regan, another one of our 1,000-point scorers, sank a shot from half court just before the third quarter came to a close at Lincoln-Sudbury. 

Forty seconds after Weymouth tied the score, Natick's Alex Peck scored the game-winner with 1:25 left in a 5-4 playoff win at Chase Arena. ","{'href': 'https://www.metrowestdailynews.com', 'title': 'MetroWest Daily News'}"

Sports sections from six college newspapers across the greater Pittsburgh area are competing to see which school's writers can put together the best bracket. 

On Monday night, The Pitt News Sports Desk convened in their office to consider each of the 63 contests in March Madness. After thoughtful — and at times intense and spirited — deliberation, the staff came to a consensus. Here's a look at the notable selections and the picks that generated the most controversy. Our full bracket is on our Instagram and X. 

South 

The desk settled on three upsets in the first round of the South region. No. 13 seed Yale over No. 4 seed Texas A&M, No. 11 seed North Carolina/San Diego State in the First Four over No. 6 seed Mississippi and No. 10 seed New Mexico over No. 7 seed Marquette. 

Despite a 30-4 record and a popular upset pick, the staff was not convinced that UC San Diego could overcome Big Ten champion Michigan. 

The impetus for the upset over Mississippi is the belief that UNC is a strong squad with the potential to win multiple games. This decision came despite doubts that the Tar Heels belonged in the field over other teams in consideration such as Indiana and West Virginia.

Yale and New Mexico's Cinderella bids came to an end in the second round, losing to Michigan and MSU, respectively. The desk, high on North Carolina's potential, sees the Tar Heels' postseason run continuing into the Sweet 16. 

The South's third round features wins by both higher seeds, with Auburn beating Michigan and MSU taking down UNC for trips to the Elite Eight. This matchup provided the first controversy of the caucus. Eventually, MSU garnered a majority vote with the desk predicting the Spartans' return to the Final Four.

West 

The West region follows the South with multiple double-digit seeds winning their first-round matchup. Colorado State won a closely contested vote over Memphis to decide the game between the No. 5 seed and No. 12 seed. The meeting between Drake and Missouri provided less controversy, with Drake earning a wide majority. 

After beating a Southeast Conference foe in the first round, the Bulldogs advanced as the desk's second and final double-digit seed to reach the Sweet 16 over No. 3 Texas Tech. In the second weekend, the staff chose to advance the top two seeds in the region, Florida and St. John's (NY), defeating Maryland and Cinderella Drake respectively.

A fierce dispute over the West's Final Four representative transpired. One faction praised the biting, quick-striking offensive ability of the Gators while highlighting the shooting inefficiencies of St. John's and voted in favor of Florida. Others emphasized the Johnnies' ability to play stout, suffocating defense and their solid guard play as an advantage. In the end, the Final Four nod went to St. John's with Rick Pitino, one of college basketball's elder statesmen, commanding its sideline. 

East 

In the East, the Power Four conferences reigned supreme. In the one agreed-upon upset, No. 10 seed Vanderbilt of the SEC took down West Coast Conference runner-up and No. 7 seed Saint Mary's (CA). The second round only featured one upset, with No. 5 seed Oregon defeating No. 4 seed Arizona. Duke, Wisconsin and Alabama all join Oregon in the Sweet 16. 

In the third round, Duke takes down Oregon, and Wisconsin pulls off a minor upset, taking down Alabama. Higher seeds continued to dominate in the East as the No. 1 seed Duke punched their ticket to San Antonio with a victory over No. 3 seed Wisconsin.

Midwest 

The first round in the Midwest is defined by two victories by double-digit seeds. The first is No. 13 seed High Point taking down No. 4 seed Purdue. The second surprise is Utah State's victory over UCLA in the matchup of No. 7 and No. 10 seeds. 

Top-seeded Houston takes down No. 5 seed Clemson in one of the most hotly debated matchups of the entire meeting. Clemson initially seemed to have the votes, but after a moving oration by a member of the staff, the desk agreed on a revote, and the speech proved effective. Houston moved on. In the bottom half of the Midwest bracket, No. 2 seed Tennessee defeats No. 3 seed Kentucky in the Sweet 16. 

Tennessee secures the victory against Kelvin Sampson's Cougars in the Elite Eight to advance to the Final Four from the Midwest. The final matchup in the Midwest was yet another point of contention with a thin margin in the vote. Houston was backed desperately by its ardent supporters on the staff, but the majority vote went the Volunteers' way.

Final Four

The two votes to decide the two teams in the National Championship were quite disparate. The desk's support for Tennessee evaporated as Duke won the poll with flying colors. On the other side of the bracket, Michigan State and St. John's faced off after both schools won close votes in the Elite Eight. The staff decided it was time for the Spartans to return to the Final Four — their first in 16 years.

Now, the stage is set for San Antonio. Duke, cruising through the East, will face off against Michigan State after several close calls against Auburn and St. John's. John Scheyer, in his first National Championship as a coach, will face off against Tom Izzo, coaching in his third. 

After 40 minutes of intense, breathless basketball on the elevated court of the Alamodome, Michigan State comes out on top 69-67. The Spartans cut down the nets for the third time in their school's history, and Tom Izzo lifts the trophy for the first time in 25 years.

NORTH CAROLINA — Sports betting has been underway in North Carolina for over a year, but where does the gross wagering revenue go? 

With March madness holding rounds in North Carolina, sports are top of mind for the state. Home fans and those from out of state will place bets on their favorite team this weekend, just over a year from when it became legal in the state.  

In a one-year anniversary report, the N.C. State Lottery Commission said North Carolinians have bet more than $6.6 billion in bets both paid and promotional. From those wagers, players have won more than $5.85 billion in the state's first year of legal betting. 

Besides licensing fees, the state is gaining proceeds on an 18% tax on the gross wagering revenue from sports wagering. 

According to the N.C. State Lottery Commission's report, the state's gross wagering revenue totals more than $713 million. With the 18% tax, the state is projected to receive more than $128 million in proceeds. 

Sports wagering tax proceeds are collected by the North Carolina Department of Revenue by state law, to support programs across the state, from N.C. Problem Gambling Program to youth and collegiate sports. 

UNC Pembroke is one of the 13 state universities receiving up to $300,000 annually as well as a remaining 20% of revenue divided amongst the schools. 

“It's been tremendous. You know, we were really at a precipice, a major crossroads with small college athletics and the UNC system,” said Dick Christy, UNC Pembroke's athletic director. “The long-time standing funding model just wasn't fitting the new the new student makeup of our universities.”  

Christy said with the additional benefits from the state, the school has developed a five-year plan. They're starting by getting out of deficit spending, which plagued the campus from lost revenue during COVID, and will then target adding on services which the school may have lacked. 

“We've got a number of things that our strategic plan over the next four and five years that if sports betting is where it needs to be, and if we're able to get out of deficit spending, we can incrementally be able to take advantage of those funds,” Christy said. 

Christy said the school is expecting to get close to $2 million from the state from sports betting gross wagering tax revenue, and hopes to update resources such as added scholarships, nutrition services, team training, tutoring and more. 

It will allow the school to be more competitive when it comes to athletic recruitment. 

“We're going to, we're going to provide an average experience for everybody. Is selling them on the moon. We want to be able to consistently provide that and back up what we're what we're telling parents and students, whether that be a transfer or high school student,” Christy said. 

UNCP has advanced to the Division II Sweet Sixteen for the first time in the university's basketball history.

Youth sports are also getting in on the funding, with $1 million going toward Youth Amateur Sports.

Raleigh Parks and Recreation and Cultural Resources Department Assistant Director Ken Hisler applied for a grant from the Youth Amateur Sports funding, receiving around $6,000 for Youth Sports Program Equipment.

“One of the great benefits of receiving the grant is that we can really accommodate that growth without having to go back and ask for additional funding through our annual budget or reallocation of resources,” Hisler said. 

Hisler said the interest in Raleigh's park and rec youth athletics has grown roughly 15% from last year. 

“It's really meeting a diversity of needs to be able to buy equipment. And one of the other things we often like to do when we get these opportunities is how can we support our coaches as well,” Hisler said. “Can we get them pinnies? Can we get them cones? Can we get different things to help with training practice that they don't have.”

Hisler said he will continue to apply for grants in the future and hopes to be awarded more funding through sports betting tax revenue in the future. 

“Youth Athletics, it really is just a great skill building. A ton of teamwork of how you're going to be successful in life, comes a lot through sport,” Hisler said.

 

Department of Health and Human Services for gambling addiction education and treatment programs will receive $2 million in funding annually. 

A representative from the NCDHHS department of communications said the rules of the lottery may have safeguards in place for those who are at risk of problem gambling. 

An email from NCDHHS reads in part, “The law allocated an additional $2 million in the state budget to help prevent, treat, and provide services related to problem gambling. The rules which the lottery has prescribed provide many safeguards for residents, especially those at risk of problem gambling.”

They say signs of problem gambling include: 

The state also has partnerships with EPIC risk management, an NCAA funded organization, to further provide education and prevention resources on college campuses to athletes and students about the risks of sports betting. 

“Our messaging hasn't changed to our student athletes. If you work in collegiate athletic space or if you're a student athlete, this is off limits for you. Continuing our messaging about ‘don't bet on it' and ensuring that our athletes are insulated from this but still being transparent that this is a tax resource that has been earmarked for us for a reason,” Christy said. 

April 2024 had the highest gross wagering revenue at over $105 million. 

Here is the complete breakdown of where the tax proceeds from gross sports wagering is, according to the North Carolina State Lottery Commission: 

Remaining proceeds will be divided as follows:

LA JOLLA, Calif. (KGTV) — La Jolla Country Day Girl's Basketball has built a reputation as a national powerhouse. The program has produced talent in the likes of WNBA Superstars Candice Wiggins and Kelsey Plum. 

During their college careers, Wiggins won the prestigious Wade Trophy, awarded annually to the best player in women's college basketball. Plum held the NCAA all-time leading scoring record for several seasons before moving into second once Iowa standout Caitlin Clark broke her record in 2024. 

The list goes on for the top-tier talent produced by head coach Terri Bamford and the Torreys' program. Like Wiggins and Plum, three more alumni from La Jolla Country Day Girl's Basketball are playing pivotal roles for teams in the Women's NCAA Tournament. 

At UC San Diego, sophomore guard Sumayah Sugapong was instrumental in securing the Tritons' historic tournament bid. It's the first time ever a program secured a spot in the tournament in their first year of eligibility. 

Sugapong's standout performances earned her the title of Big West Championship Most Outstanding Player. 

Meanwhile, at San Diego State, freshman guard Naomi Panganiban made the Mountain West All-Tournament Team while helping lead the Aztecs to a conference title.

Sugapong ('23) and Panganiban ('24) played together at La Jolla Country Day for three seasons, where they led the Torreys to two Open Division section championships — the highest division in California high school basketball. 

WATCH: Coach Bamford reflects on the characteristics that made Sugapong and Panganiban great players

During those seasons, the team was ranked among the top 12 in the nation.

Now seeing their game translate to one of the highest levels of college basketball, Bamford is excited to see her alumnae take the stage in the tournament.

“For me as a coach, I'm just excited to be part of their journey,” Bamford said. “Credit to them — their hard work, consistency, and relentlessness. I'm really proud of where they've gone.”

As two former Torreys represent the hometown universities in the tournament, another alum is representing San Diego across the country with a college powerhouse, No. 1 seed South Carolina. 

After transferring from Oregon, Te-Hina PaoPao helped lead the Gamecocks to the program's third national championship during her junior season. She earned All-American Honors that year as well. 

WATCH: See the segment focusing on PaoPao below

PaoPao ('20) left behind a legacy during her time at La Jolla Country Day.

She helped lead the team to one of its best seasons in program history, posting a 32-1 record and ranking as the #1 team in the nation in 2019-2020. The team did not compete for a state championship that year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Her outstanding play in high school earned her a spot as a McDonald's All-American, one of the most prestigious recognitions an individual high school basketball player can receive. 

Bamford remembers when PaoPao first arrived to Country Day, she already had her eyes set on becoming a household name in the program. 

""Kelsey came in and said to me, 'How do I get my banner on the wall?' She says, 'Okay, I'm going to do it,' and she did it,"" Bamford said. ""Tahina was following like, 'You know, I'm the next one coming through here.' [PaoPao] grinds really hard, so just excited for her and her journey.""

Now PaoPao is looking to lead the Gamecocks to back-to-back national titles. If successful, South Carolina would be the first team since the 2016 UConn Huskies to repeat as champions. They'll start their quest to repeat on Friday against No. 16 seed Tennessee Tech. 

Sugapong and UCSD enter the tournament as a 16-seed. They'll take on Southern University on Wednesday night in one of the First Four matchups. 

Panganiban and SDSU earned a 14 seed and will play against No. 3 seed Louisiana State on Saturday. 

""I just want to wish them good luck. Super proud of where you've come and what you're doing for just not yourself but our program, carrying on the legacy. Good luck. We're rooting for you,"" Bamford said.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

If you look at the betting markets, the race for the 2024-25 NBA MVP isn't particularly close. Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is listed as a -850 favorite at a handful of books. Nuggets big man and three-time MVP winner Nikola Jokić is seen as a 4-to-1 or 5-to-1 underdog.

It feels a lot closer than that. Painfully close, as this story from CBS Sports' Bill Reiter details. Two weeks ago, I finally came down off the Jokić hill and put Gilgeous-Alexander at the top of my MVP rankings. But then when my editor came calling for an internal CBS Sports MVP straw poll over the weekend, I changed my mind right back to Jokić. 

I looked at it, and thought about it, some more over the last few days, and I'll be damned if I haven't switched back to SGA. Maybe the odds are right and SGA will win comfortably, but this feels like it's headed for a photo finish. It feels right to vote for each guy, and perhaps more tellingly, it feels criminally wrong to not vote for each guy. 

But I'm an SGA guy at this point. For now, that's where I'm staying. To be clear, this ranking isn't a reflection of who I think will win the MVP, but rather who I think should win it, and that goes for the 2-5 finishers, too. 

For nearly all of the season, those two ideas haven't lined up in my rankings. I stuck with Jokić as the deserving winner for as long as I could despite always believing SGA would actually win. Now I'm aligned on both fronts. I believe SGA should win, and I believe he will win. 

With that, let's get to the MVP rankings entering play on Wednesday, March 19. 

Over eight games in March, Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 37.6 points and seven assists on blistering 54/40/95 shooting splits. Even by SGA's standards, those are preposterous numbers. He's scored at least 40 points in four of those games and 51 in one. He went into Boston and beat the Celtics without Jalen Williams. The guy just won't stop dominating. 

SGA leads the league in 50-point games, 40-point games, 30-point games and 20-point games, of which he's piled up an astounding 63 straight, and overall scoring at 33.0 PPG. He also ranks second in total steals, which highlights the two-way impact probably best reflected in his plus-719 individual point differential that's by far the best mark in the league and almost 350 points better than the next-highest Thunder player. 

Yes, SGA has more help that Jokić, but this isn't a sum-of-the-parts situation like Cleveland where every night there's a different best player. This is SGA's show, and that plus-minus number drives that point home. 

Oh by the way, the Thunder are going to sail past 60 wins as the runaway No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. At a certain point, you just have to concede that as great as Jokić has been, Gilgeous-Alexander is the deserving MVP and I believe the final vote tally will validate that. 

Looking for more discussion on the NBA's MVP race? Bill Reiter and John Gonzalez discussed SGA vs. Jokić in depth on Wednesday's Beyond the Arc podcast. 

Fifty years from now some kid is going to be scrolling through whatever version of Basketball-Reference they're using on Mars and see that a guy who finished third in scoring, second in assists, third in rebounding and fourth in steals per game DIDN'T win MVP and think we were out of our minds. 

Maybe we are. 

It actually does feel clinically insane that Jokić might not win MVP despite having the best season of a career that has already seen him win three MVPs. To be top four in all four of those categories is ridiculous. By season's end, Jokic will be the second player in history, joining Oscar Robertson, to average at least 29 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Robinson shot 48% that year. Jokić is shooting 57%, including 41% on more than four 3s per game. 

Perhaps the best MVP argument for Jokić is what happens to the Nuggets, who crater by almost 21 points per 100 possessions when Jokic sits, per Cleaning the Glass, when you take him away. While the Thunder would at least be a play-in team without SGA, the Nuggets would certainly be in the lottery and maybe one of the six or seven worst teams in the league without Jokić. Yet here they are tied for the West's No. 2 seed. 

Still, SGA, and by extension OKC, has just been too great and it just feels like his time. Voter fatigue is real; if it wasn't, Michael Jordan would've won MVP every season. Jokić is the best player in the world by a comfortable margin, but he's going to take second in this MVP race the same way he did a few years when it was just Joel Embiid's time, and this time around I'm more OK with that. 

Giannis isn't a lock to make it to the 65-game threshold for MVP consideration, but he should get there barring some sort of 10-day injury over the next three weeks (he needs to play in nine of Milwaukee's final 14 games). 

Giannis has no chance to actually win the MVP, as is the case for every non-SGA/Jokić player on this list, so it's simply a matter of finishing order, and for that his lead on Jayson Tatum, for my money, is very slim and open to interpretation. 

But assuming he does get to the 65 games, I'll slot Giannis as the forgotten bronze medalist as the only player in NBA history -- not this year, but in history -- to average at least 30 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and one block for a team that, much like Jokić and Denver, would be residing at the bottom of the standings without him. 

Boston being so collectively loaded combined with his pedestrian shooting efficiency makes Tatum an easy MVP candidate to skip over. But he's clearly Boston's best player and has developed as a true star in every area of the game. 

Tatum is the league's sixth-leading scorer at over 27 PPG. He's one of just three players, joining Jokic and Luka Doncic, averaging at least 25 points, eight rebounds, five assists and one steal this season. The 5.9 assists are by far a career high, and the rebounds are right there. 

Since the All-Star break, Tatum is grabbing nine boards and dishing out seven assists per game. He's just so well rounded, and even on such a talented Celtics team, Tatum is the guy who draws the disproportionate defensive attention. 

Before LeBron went down, the Lakers had won eight of nine games. As soon as he went out, they lost three straight. Yes, the addition of Luka Dončić has made the Lakers a contender in some people's mind, but the simple truth is LeBron has had this team playing way above expectations all season. 

To think that the Lakers, who many people, including myself, picked to finished with a win total in the 30s, are tied in the loss column for the No. 2 seed with less than a month to play is a testament to the power than the King still wields. 

Forget the age qualifier: LeBron is the only non-Jokić player in the league averaging at least 25 points, eight assists and eight rebounds on better than 50% shooting. He's been defending like crazy, too. He could be 100 years old and it wouldn't change the fact that he's still one of the best players in the league. 

This No. 5 MVP slot is the dealer's choice. Two weeks ago, I had Cade Cunningham in this slot and you won't get an argument from me if you still think Cunningham deserve higher recognition than LeBron; what he's doing with the Pistons this season is a minor miracle. There's Donovan Mitchell and Anthony Edwards; Stephen Curry could even factor in on the fringes given the tear he's gone on since Jimmy Butler refilled his tank. 

But for me, it's LeBron (who needs to return from injury and play seven more games to hit the 65-game threshold). Again, the Lakers were supposed to be a play-in team and they're fighting for a top-two seed. Even with Dončić, they immediately lost three straight games when LeBron went out. He deserves top-five billing this season.

A ton of news is flooding in this week so Rivals national recruiting director Adam Gorney needed a second Recruiting Rumor Mill.

The four-star running back from Delaware (Ohio) Rutherford B. Hayes visited Ohio State on Monday and was offered by the Buckeyes. It's definitely a huge one and “every Ohio kid's dream” to land an offer from Ohio State.

This will end up being a battle between the Buckeyes and Miami for Akih and it's always tough to bet against the Buckeyes.

LSU is making a massive move for the four-star quarterback from Celina, Texas, especially after he met the entire coaching staff during his weekend visit and feels like a clear priority. Bentley talks with offensive coordinator Joe Sloan every night and the success LSU has had at quarterback is a major bonus.

Visits to Georgia, Ohio State and Florida State are coming up and Oklahoma is still very much in the picture, but LSU looks great in his recruitment now.

Tennessee remains a favorite for the former South Carolina commit but a weekend visit to Missouri made a major impact as the Tigers remain a serious contender for the four-star linebacker from Newnan, Ga.

“Everything” stood out to Colton during his visit, from how the linebackers play, to the defensive play style to the scheme to how he bonds with position coach Derek Nicholson.

Missouri is right there at the top along with Tennessee as Florida State, Florida, Georgia and others are involved.

An in-state battle with Alabama leading Auburn might be taking place with the top-rated running back but Texas is making a run at him again and now Florida “made a push up” after his recent visit to Gainesville.

The four-star running back from Jackson, Ala., loved how UF coach Billy Napier and position coach Jabbar Juluke related to and coached the players. The Gators have some work to do but if they can keep up their momentum then it could be interesting.

Georgia is the front-runner for the 2027 four-star linebacker from Raleigh (N.C.) Millbrook and the Bulldogs will be tough to beat. But Ohio State, North Carolina and now Notre Dame will get a look after its offer on Monday.

It was a “huge honor” to get the Irish offer but he needs to visit South Bend to see if ND becomes a serious contender or not.

LSU is the new front-runner “as of now” for the five-star receiver after a great visit to Baton Rouge in recent days. But this one isn't so clear-cut yet.

Feaster also loved his recent visit to Alabama and then Texas A&M is pushing very hard along with USC, Oregon, Miami and others. But the Tigers have the edge right now for Feaster, who recently reclassified from 2027 to 2026.

North Carolina, Florida, Ole Miss and Florida State are the four top contenders for Gordon, who had been committed to Alabama and UCF earlier in his recruitment.

Watch for the Gators to make a serious move here since the four-star defensive back from Jackson, Ala., stays in touch with coach Billy Napier “all day, every day.”

The 2027 high four-star quarterback from Shreveport (La.) Evangel Christian loved his recent visit to LSU, talked with Zorin Istvan from Tiger Life and really got a great feel for how things will be if he ends up in Baton Rouge. But this is also a tricky situation. LSU wants to keep Houston in its pocket but the top target is five-star Elijah Haven from Baton Rouge (La.) Dunham.

Oklahoma could still be the team to beat for Houston with Texas and Texas A&M right there. If Haven goes elsewhere then LSU could move up very quickly for Houston but not yet.

The 2028 athlete from St. Louis (Mo.) De Smet took game-day visits to Nebraska, Illinois and Missouri this past season and Janes was back in Columbia in recent days.

What Janes loves early on with the Tigers is that they're telling him they still have a chip on their shoulder and want to make a national championship run. Missouri definitely has his attention but Janes is visiting Ole Miss this weekend and possibly Alabama as well.

A battle between Penn State and Pitt is shaping up for the 2027 four-star cornerback from Pittsburgh (Pa.) Imani Christian Academy and Jenkins was recently at the Panthers' first spring practice.

The local standout loved how competitive everyone was at the workout and how the coaching staff there makes it clear he's a major priority.

Oregon has been considered the clear front-runner in Fa'alave-Johnson's recruitment and the Ducks could still be tough to beat with USC and many others involved but a new offer from Notre Dame “will definitely shake things up.”

The San Diego (Calif.) Cathedral Catholic standout is now very interested in the Irish and will talk a lot more with the coaching staff as Notre Dame will be one of the few programs he focuses on moving forward.

The message from coach Kirby Smart is that Jones is a top priority and that meant a lot to the four-star safety from Marietta (Ga.) Sprayberry as he loved watching practice and seeing the energy from the players and the coaches.

The Bulldogs are right up near the top with Florida, Georgia Tech and Duke also battling it out for him.

A connection to Will Campbell could lead Krempin to LSU. The two talked during a recent visit to Baton Rouge, they have FaceTimed, Campbell has given the four-star offensive tackle from Prosper, Texas, advice about his recruitment and how to move forward with everything and their fathers played together at Kilgore JC.

Plus, Krempin just had an awesome visit to LSU where Campbell told him he'd be a great fit in the Tigers' system.

SMU, Clemson, Texas, Texas A&M, Ohio State, Michigan and a host of others are involved but LSU is really interesting here.

Oklahoma is definitely high on the list and Florida has made some serious in-roads with the Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy edge rusher but Ohio State gave him something to seriously consider after visiting in recent days.

Kreul loves the new additions on staff as he spent time with Matt Patricia and Tony Washington Jr. and then position coach Larry Johnson told Kreul he's an elite talent “that you don't see very often.”

If the Buckeyes can keep up the momentum, they might have something here.

LSU has been the front-runner in McCoy's recruitment but after he visited Florida and had an “amazing” time and was “lost for words” the Gators are now considered a very serious contender in his recruitment.

The Tupelo, Miss., four-star defensive end was blown away by Florida and how the staff treated him. By the end, McCoy felt like he belonged there which is only good news for the Gators.

The four-star defensive end from Denton (Texas) Guyer had been committed to Oklahoma but backed off that pledge and was recently at Georgia for a spring practice. It was made clear to Rowe that he's “their guy” for 2027 and he loves the development in Athens along with the urgency in practice.

Georgia is right there at the top for Rowe with Texas, Oklahoma, SMU, Texas A&M and Nebraska.

The four-star tight end from Nashville (Tenn.) Donelson Christian Academy remains committed to Tennessee but there is going to be a lot of competition to keep him as Sneed loved a recent visit to Colorado and was at North Carolina this week as well.

Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur's NFL experience and work with tight ends in his career is a big deal to Sneed, who thought everyone was really authentic in Boulder.

Ole Miss, Miami, Tennessee and UCLA are the others to watch.

Georgia is going to make a serious push for the 2027 four-star defensive end from Atlanta (Ga.) Pace Academy and seeing the intensity at a recent spring practice definitely helped the Bulldogs move even higher.

But South Carolina should definitely be watched closely and then Tennessee and Auburn round out his early top four.

USC is going to be tough to beat for the five-star cornerback from Gardena (Calif.) Serra as there's been a lot of talk about staying closer to home but LSU definitely intrigued him over the weekend. Williams was in town for the Battle tournament and went to Baton Rouge where he loves the DB tradition there. Even though he didn't get a chance to talk with position coach Corey Raymond (who was attending a funeral) the coaching staff made it clear that he's a top priority if he wants to come play in the SEC.

During talks with coach Ryan Day and new defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, Webb was told because of his tackling and ball skills he could be used in the same way as Caleb Downs and that was a big selling point during his visit.

The four-star from Frisco (Texas) Panther Creek got to spend a lot of time with position coach Matt Guerrieri, too, and loved how he was working with his players.

Ohio State, LSU and Michigan are the three front-runners in his recruitment.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

          / CBS Colorado
        

A community in Colorado is planning a new project to build a mega sports complex while preserving more than 400 acres of open space.

The Board of Douglas County Commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to enter a partnership for the development of the Zebulon Regional Sports Complex. The first phase of development will include three ice rinks and basketball courts, a soccer complex and a baseball complex. Officials said the project will also preserve over 400 acres of open space in the area, including a 104-acre wildlife corridor adjacent to Sterling Ranch and Louviers.  

""This is such an exciting time. We are in the golden era of Douglas County where we can start moving on what our citizens want – a best-in-class regional sports facility paired with ongoing efforts to preserve open space,"" said Commissioner Abe Laydon.

Officials said the proposed site for the new sports complex is four miles south of C-470. The Sterling Ranch Development Company, which is partnering with the board of commissioners, said, ""This project will attract new shopping, dining, recreation, and community gathering spaces that Sterling Ranch would not be able to support on its own at this time.""

Funding for the sports complex comes from a .17% sales tax approved by voters in Nov. 1994 to cover the acquisition, administration, planning, development, construction, operations and maintenance of parks, trails, historic resources and open space. That tax was recently extended by voters in Nov. 2022.

Officials said the design process is underway for the first phase of the project. They said the estimated cost is between $60 million and $70 million.

A live town hall in April will allow residents to learn about the Zebulon project as well as other parks and open space projects in the county.

Two new parks, High Note Regional Park and Wildcat Regional Park, are also planned for Lone Tree and Highlands Ranch.

Gustavus women's basketball head coach Laurie Kelly hugs Sydney Hauger following a Sweet 16 win over McMurry on March 12 at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Hauger scored her 1,000th career point in the win.

ST. PETER — Springfield grad Sydney Hauger's final game with the Gustavus Gusties women's basketball team Saturday saw her career end selflessly as she fouled out in the final minute of a DIII Elite Eight game against Smith College.

And despite the Gusties falling 61-50 to end their historic season, Hauger was one of several senior leaders that got to say their collegiate careers had an elite ending.

With the loss to Massachusetts' Smith College (30-2), the Gusties ended their season with a 29-2 mark, a program record for wins and the first time the women's program made it to the Elite Eight.

The Gusties, who were ranked fifth nationally, trailed just 30-29 at halftime. Smith, ranked eighth, made a late push and controlled the fourth quarter by outscoring the Gusties 14-6 for a 61-50 win. 

This moved Smith on to the Final Four for the third consecutive season.

Gustavus' Sydney Hauger dribbles the ball whiled guarded by McMurry's Kylie Flippin during a Sweet 16 National Tournament game on March 12 at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.


“I think what took us out of the game, this is super not like us, in the first half we had 11 turnovers and we have like 13 usually in a game,” Hauger said. “At the end of the first half, they had a couple step and steals, but I think that was what kind of broke the game in the end. For matchups, I feel like we matched up pretty well against them and I thought that we had a pretty good advantage inside because we have post play and they are kind of more guard-based play to rely on scoring. Most of their guards score, their leading scorer was their shortest 5-3 guard [Ally Landau].”

Landau finished the game with a game-high 22 points.

The Gusties hung around in the game until a cold fourth quarter forced them to foul in the final minute, giving Landau four more free throws to add to Smith's lead late. Hauger picked up back-to-back fouls in the final minute to help stop the clock and give her team a chance, giving her her fourth and fifth fouls of the game and forcing her to take a seat.

“I don't think I was emotional until I had to go to the bench,” Hauger said. “There was another senior sitting at the end of the bench waiting for me once I high-five everyone and I don't think it hit me until I gave her a hug and I had to sit through the last minute of play, which was really hard. I think that's when all the emotions hit me.”

Gustavus' big playoff run started after winning the MIAC tournament championship on March 1 on their home court with a 66-53 win over Bethel. 

The Gusties then hosted Wisconsin Lutheran in their first game of the NCAA Tournament on March 7, a 61-49 overtime win that gave Gustavus another home tourney game March 8 against Wartburg. The Gusties won that game also 56-50 to advance to the Sweet 16 for the second time in program history, the first time coming during the 2017-18 season.

The win over Wartburg set Gustavus up for a long trip to Brunswick, Maine, to begin the next round of the tournament. The Gusties left St. Peter around 4 a.m. last Wednesday to catch their flight to Maine, which saw the team split up on two different flight connections. One group had a stop in Chicago, while the other stopped in Dulles, Virginia. 

After getting to Maine, Hauger said the team had several team meals and get-togethers at places like Buck's Naked BBQ & Studio Bar, Antonia's Pizzeria, Big Top Deli and Bay Bowls.

Despite being split up on their flights until meeting back up in Portland, Maine, the Gusties were fully in sync during their Sweet 16 game against McMurry on March 19 as they won 71-58 at Bowdoin College.

During that win, Hauger finished the game with 12 points and passed 1,000 points for her career at Gustavus with a third-quarter 3. 

“I didn't know how many I needed and they didn't stop the game, but all the fan section held up these papers with 1,000 on them,” Hauger said.

That 3 saw her join the 1,000-point club for the second time in her basketball career as she did so with the Springfield Tigers in 2018. Hauger went on to score another 1,000-plus points with the Tigers, ending her career in 2020 with a Tigers girls record of 2,219 points.

Hauger said while scoring 1,000 points in college was still a nice accomplishment, she was more worried about getting the win.

“It's pretty cool, but it's not something I think about a lot,” she said. “I think more about my team and what we do together and having fun, but it's just like a little extra added bonus that goes with it.”

While Hauger and the Gusties would like to be in Smith's place playing a Final Four game Thursday in Salem, Virginia, there is still a lot the team can be proud of. Hauger said getting to the Elite Eight was proof of how good the Gustavus women's basketball team was.

“When I first started at Gustavus, it was like, ‘OK, our goal is to make it to the National Tournament,'” Hauger said. “And now I feel like we've grown so much and our goal this year was to make it to the Sweet 16. I'm super proud of the team and I'm super grateful we got to the Elite Eight. And at that point, in the Elite Eight, all the teams are good, it's a coin flip for who's winning these.

“I think a lot of the NCAA and other teams have counted us out because the MIAC hasn't typically gone far in the National Tournament. I feel like also one of our goals this year was to prove to them that we're actually a really high quality basketball team. I think it just feels really good to put Gustavus on the map that we are that and we deserve to be here.”

Hauger finished her college career with two MIAC All-Conference selections and 1,013 points, 15th overall in Gustavus women's basketball history.

MARK NANCE/Sun-Gazette Correspondent
Loyalsock's Julie Ellis (2) celebrates after Loyalsock won the District 4 Class AAA championship against Hughesville this season.

Only one freshmen who entered the Loyalsock girls' basketball program four years ago remains there today.

What a player and leader Julie Ellis has become, too.

Ellis is the lone Lancer remaining from that group and is leaving a mark which goes beyond points or rebounds. It has never been about individual numbers for Ellis, only winning. And she sure has helped Loyalsock do that the past four years, 92 times as a matter of fact.

Now, Ellis has helped Loyalsock reach a second straight Class AAA state Final Four. There, the Lancers play Imhotep Friday at Parkland High School.

“It feels good because I feel like I can look back on all of my seasons and know it's been a good experience,” Ellis said. “The people I've played with for four years have been great. The coaching staff is great here, too. I wouldn't want to play for any other coaches.”

Those coaches would not want any different version of Ellis than the one they see every day.

“Julie has been an instrumental member of the team the past four years and has won 92 games in her career. She deserves a ton of credit in sticking it out as the only four-year member of her class,” Loyalsock coach Curtis Jacobson said. “I am so proud of the growth and maturity she has made as a person, way more than a basketball player.”

Ellis excelling on and off the court has helped bring out Loyalsock's best during her four years. During that time, the team has won two district championships, six state tournament games, two HAC-III titles, and a Heartland Conference championship. Loyalsock has never won fewer than 18 games in a season in those years and has broken the single-season record for wins the last two years, producing 27 and 28, while going 55-6. Loyalsock has won an average of 23 games per season during Ellis's four years, a remarkable achievement, considering the regular season lasts just 22 games.

Every player has a role in creating that success, but Ellis emerging as a strong leader has provided a strong foundation to build upon. That has gone double this year with she and Lacey Kriebel being the team's lone seniors and helping guide a team which graduated several key players from a year ago.

“Julie is the X factor for our team. Since Julie and I are the only seniors, she provides that extra leadership that the team needs,” Kriebel said. “She also does a lot of dirty work and extra little things that don't necessarily show up in the box score, but they have a big impact on our performance.”

That has evident the last four years. Ellis is a Swiss Army Knife player, capable of hurting opponents in many ways. She can be a scorer, facilitator, rebounder and defender. She can take her game inside or outside and defend guards or post players.

Equally important, Ellis is a calming influence on the court. She is a stabilizing force; a glue-like player who helps keep the team together whether things are going well or not. Every successful team needs a player like that and Loyalsock having Ellis has again helped it become one of the state's top four 3A teams.

That goes beyond the games as well. Ellis exhibits those same qualities at practice. She is a tone-setter who makes sure the team is focused on the next game and/or play. The cliché is practice makes perfect but in reality it is perfect practice makes perfect.

While no player or game is perfect, the way Ellis attacks each day is.

“There isn't a day that Julie is not giving the team everything she has. She has never had a bad practice,” Jacobson said. “While she hasn't been perfect, her attitude and effort daily in practice has been. She is vocal when needed, and leads by example always.”

That has helped Loyalsock weather storms in games or after tough losses. The Lancers have not cracked when behind this year or when struggling. They rallied from 11 down in the fourth quarter to edge Hughesville in the district final, overcame struggles for three quarters in the second round against West Catholic to maintain a lead and then put together a dominant fourth quarter finish and turned a one-point second quarter deficit into a 27-point third quarter lead last Friday against Dunmore.

It has been the next step in the evolution of a player who excelled as a reserve her freshman year, helping Loyalsock repeat as district champions a season after graduating two-time all-state selection Summer McNulty. Ellis moved into the starting lineup a year later and was a key factor in a young team returning to the district final.

Ellis continued surging as a junior as Loyalsock made history and reached its first Final 4. Becoming a senior captain, Ellis has made sure the Lancers keep grinding through all the ups and downs a season can bring.

That included suffering a badly sprained ankle late in the regular season. Ellis wanted to return for the HAC Tournament, but kept things in perspective, understanding her team needed her most for the state tournament push. She then returned in the district semifinals and has continued making a steady impact ever since, setting the tone against Dunmore when she scored the game's first two points, then found Alaina Dadzie for the next two.

“I'm super proud of her because she's been fighting through injuries this entire postseason,” Kriebel said. “And every game she has went out there and played her heart out.”

Four thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four days.

For 4,754 days, BYU has gone winless under the brightest lights of college basketball.

In the past 4,754 days, BYU's Marches have been filled with much more sadness than madness.

You get the picture. But after 13 long years, the Cougars have a chance to end their current stretch of NCAA Tournament futility Thursday against the 11-seeded VCU Rams in Denver.

On March 13, 2012, BYU took the court in Dayton, Ohio, as a 14 seed to face Iona in the First Four play-in round.

After falling into a 25-point deficit, Dave Rose's Cougars rallied back to stun the Gaels in a 78-72 classic, marking the largest comeback win in NCAA Tournament history — a record that's still standing today.

Noah Hartsock led the charge with 23 points against Iona, Brandon Davies added another 18 points and 15 rebounds, Damarcus Harrison came off the bench to score 12 and Craig Cusick dished out eight assists.

None of those players could have imagined how notable their performances that night would still be in 2025. They didn't expect to be the last group of Cougars to claim a March Madness win before a 13-year drought.

Program greats Eric Mika and Alex Barcello each went one-and-done in the tournament, while Elijah Bryant, TJ Haws and Yoeli Childs never even had a chance in the dance.

I was 11 years old and in the sixth grade the night of BYU's victory over Iona. Today, I'm 24. This current March drought for the Cougars has spanned more than half of my lifetime.

What else was happening the last time the Cougars won a tournament game? Here's what life looked like back then.","{'href': 'https://www.deseret.com', 'title': 'Deseret News'}"
