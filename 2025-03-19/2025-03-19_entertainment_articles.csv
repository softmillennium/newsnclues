Taylor Swift might have sung, “I swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me,” on her 2017 album Reputation, but the fanfare leading up to its loooong-awaited rerelease seems to indicate otherwise. Ever since Swift’s sixth studio record became eligible for rerecording way back in November 2022 — the same long-ago month that saw Ron DeSantis topping polls and the end of The Walking Dead — fans have eagerly lapped up any clue that Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is ready for release. Yet 16 months later, all we have are a few brief clips and a new understanding of trademark law.

If you’re still down to clown, the latest rumors are that the album will arrive on July 16, which just so happens to be World Snake Day (during the Year of the Snake, no less). But if the date comes and passes without so much as a hiss? Well, take comfort in knowing it would be far from the first time we were all fooled by Swift’s Rep teases. And while some of the examples on the list below may seem like unintentional red herrings, remember Swift’s own warning to listeners on “Mastermind” off 2022’s Midnights: “What if I told you none of this was accidental?”

May 2023: The “Karma” Music Video Starts It All

Swift’s video for the Midnights single “Karma” contained references to all of her albums, but the Reputation nods got fans talking the most. From a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it snake cameo to the coffee-cup clock with a black nail by the No. 2 (a.k.a. a potential February release, duh), there were a good amount of clues that indicated Rep (TV) would soon be on its way.

August 2023: Two TV Teasers and … Ed Sheeran?

Toward the end of summer 2023, Swifties were surprised with not one but two clips of songs from Rep (TV) featured on TV shows: “Delicate” on The Summer I Turned Pretty and “Look What You Made Me Do” on Wilderness. What felt like celebratory gifts were probably more like consolation prizes as we still haven’t heard full versions of either track.

Also in August, Swift’s close pal and frequent collaborator Ed Sheeran revealed he had not yet recorded the new version of “End Game,” which was disappointing only if you miss the sound of Sheeran rapping.

October 2023: Shout-outs in Swift’s Eras Tour Movie Post

In her Instagram post celebrating the premiere of the movie The Eras Tour, Swift made several notable references to Reputation, including “getting in the car now” (a.k.a. “Getaway Car”) and “look what you genuinely made me do” (which, like her reputation, needs no further explanation). Perhaps the film would contain an announcement about Rep (TV)’s release date, we thought! Nope, just a better view of the Lover house and some amusing bloopers in the credits.

December 2023: Time’s “Person of the Year” Has “tRuSt iSSues”

Finally, some legit teases! In her Time Person of the Year cover story, Swift explicitly talked about Rep (TV) for the first time by calling the vault tracks “fire.” Let your very patient fans be the judge of that, Ms. Swift! The star fueled the flames in her Instagram caption about the article, writing that she had “tRuSt iSSueS” regarding interviews. An R for Rep and an S for snakes? Hmm …

January 2024: Green Dresses and Black-and-White Photos

By the start of 2024, hype was building that Swift would release Rep (TV) in February (remember that “Karma” clock?), supported by a few seeming teases in the year’s first month. In addition to Swift sporting some very Rep-like looks at the Golden Globes and on the street, she and some of her A-list friends changed their social-media profile pictures to black-and-white, which fans took to be a hint that the album was forthcoming. Well, an album was forthcoming, but it turned out to be The Tortured Poets Department, which also features a black-and-white photo of Swift on the cover. Half-credit?

With the two on the coffee clock having arrived, Swifties were convinced the star would drop Rep (TV) sometime in the month. The Grammys, during which Midnights scooped up Album of the Year, seemed like a perfect time. Yet Swift used her acceptance speech not to announce the release of the record everyone expected but a brand-new one (the aforementioned TTPD). Which we might have been way happier about if we already had Rep (TV) in our hands!

March 2024: Taylor Swift and … Tom Brady?

While Swift is a hardcore Chiefs fan these days, it was just a year ago that she allowed another NFL team to use a clip from a Rep (TV) song in its docuseries. Viewers of The Dynasty: The New England Patriots on Apple TV+ got to hear “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor’s Version)” during one episode. Perhaps Swift was lured in by the “TV” similarities?

June 2024: “This Is What You Came For” Hits Eras

On June 14, the lucky attendees of Swift’s second Liverpool stop on the Eras Tour got to hear her perform “This Is What You Came For,” the 2016 Calvin Harris–Rihanna hit later revealed to be written by Harris’s own ex. Many theorized the rarely heard track was bound to be a Rep (TV) vault track, especially since Swift’s breakup with Harris occurred while the original album was being recorded. Hey, it still could be!

August 2024: Swift Does “Something Bad” With Her Hand

All summer, it seemed as if the album might finally be released on August 17 since the date marked seven years since Swift’s social media went dark in advance of the original Rep’s announcement. During a London tour stop, Swift played Rep’s “I Did Something Bad” (one of her self-proclaimed favorite songs) for the first time, giving fans hope, but ultimately nothing came of it. A few days later, on August 20, Swift got fans hyped up again when she made a snakelike hand signal during her final London show, but it ended up signaling only a possible cramp.

October 2024: A New Bodysuit and Boy-Pop Delays

Oh boy, October was a ride when it came to Rep (TV) teases. Not only did Swift debut a very snaky new bodysuit on tour in Miami — about which she left a rare and suspicious comment on Instagram — but she wore Rep-tinged outfits on multiple nights out. Also, both Joe Jonas and Shawn Mendes delayed their planned October 18 album releases, moves many fans took to be made out of caution over Swift’s incoming album. It’s possible that was the case and Swift moved the release date, but alas, we’ll never know.

November 2024: The End of an Era But Still No Rep (TV)

Her last three posts also go in order 3..2…1… (people in the cover). A countdown to an announcement? pic.twitter.com/eB9pZ0XRR9 — GAV #1 FOTS STAN (@gavbreakfavtoys) November 5, 2024

Surely, Swift would announce Rep (TV) at the end of the Eras Tour, right? It was a solid theory strengthened by the singer’s continued love of green outfits and an astute fan noticing Swift’s recent Instagram posts seemed to indicate a countdown. Sadly, the only things the Vancouver final show delivered (besides great music) were tears and confetti.

January 2025: Spotify Glitch or Reason to Clown?

After so many false hopes, most Swifties had stopped looking so closely for Rep (TV) clues by the beginning of this year. Yet when some Spotify listeners discovered the original album wasn’t showing up on the streaming service, the clowning began that an announcement was imminent. In all likelihood, it was probably just a glitch — and not the cool Midnights version.

February 2025: Travis Kelce and Trademarks

From Swift presenting at the Grammys, to boyfriend Travis Kelce saying he “can neither confirm nor deny” the Rep (TV) release date, to news that the album’s trademarks would be valid only until August, February brought some solid teases but no actual news.

March 2025: An (Imaginary) Lady Gaga Collab and That Necklace

The release of Lady Gaga’s Mayhem wasn’t just exciting for Little Monsters, but for Swifties, since it was rumored that the two pop idols had collaborated for a Rep-coded song. Alas, the rumors proved false, and fans were left with their hopes once again dashed. But the month also saw one undeniable Rep tease in the form of Swift sporting a snake necklace in a video acceptance speech at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. Even more? Per Swifties, the snake was actually an ouroboros, a.k.a. an ancient image symbolizing rebirth. SSSuspicious!",vulture
https://vulture.com,"I Don’t Know Why, But Snow White Is Totally About Lefty Infighting",https://www.vulture.com/article/review-snow-white-is-about-leftist-infighting-inexplicably.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Photo: Walt Disney Studios

I don’t actually know how to judge these live-action Disney remakes on any relative scale of quality. The bar is so low, and what people seem to want from them — a tickle of nostalgia, the familiar rendered new on a technicality, 109 minutes of child-friendly distraction — feels so different from the usual standards. So: Snow White is not as bad as it could be, while not being anywhere near good? It’s better than, say, 2019’s Aladdin, which was awful but nevertheless made a literal billion dollars. It’s garishly ugly and padded out with new tunes from Pasek and Paul that are as smooth and unremarkable as river rocks, all of which may or may not matter to its target audience, who could just be basing their decision about whether to see the movie on how unacceptably woke social media has informed them it is. But while the movie itself is devoid of delight, there is something delightful about getting to actually see the thing after the years of culture-war skirmishes that have preceded its release like a wrathful red carpet and discovering it’s about lefty infighting.

The shortcomings of Snow White — which was directed by The Amazing Spider-Man’s Marc Webb and written by The Girl on the Train’s Erin Cressida Wilson — aren’t on star Rachel Zegler, who, despite being set up as a fall gal by the studio, gives excellent princess face while communing with CGI animals and belting out the chorus of the remake’s newly added “I Wish” song, whose role in the film you will not miss, given that it’s called “Waiting on a Wish.” But the funny thing about her take on the storybook standard is that, in the context of the movie, the character is effectively a normie lib dithering about how to fight back against the fascist takeover of her kingdom by her stepmother, the Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot in a glittery wimple and a performance so incredibly stilted it almost swings around to being good-bad. Snow White’s father is gone, his fate uncertain, and she dithers about the castle in a demoted role, fretting about how her people are suffering outside. Snow White is an institutionalist, which I suppose is a given for a princess, pining for the idealized era of Obama’s/her father’s leadership, when her family would make apple pies so the working folks could have a small taste of luxury, and unable to conceive of a way to fight the Queen, who may be pretty flashy but who also came into power via the standard methods (marriage and magic).

Snow White eschews violence and gets awfully sniffy about property for someone who’ll later let herself into the Seven Dwarfs’ home, scolding her future love interest, Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), when she discovers him stealing food from the royal kitchen. In this revamped take, Jonathan is not a prince but a rebel leading a group of bandits who hide out, Merry Men style, in the forest. Thanks to these plot changes, Snow White doesn’t include one of the animated original’s most famous songs, “Someday My Prince Will Come,” instead opting for a new number where Jonathan taunts Snow White about her “princess problems.” It’s a tale as old as time — a sheltered Ivy League girl meets a rakish dirtbag leftist who lives with a bunch of roommates and who radicalizes her by negging her about her privilege. What’s left for a girl to do but attempt some coalition building among a ragtag crew that includes her septuple hosts, who I will not try to fit into this larger political allegory on account of their being abominations who can only be described as garden gnomes who’ve come to life while retaining their shellacked sheen. As Snow White pleads to her bickering would-be allies, all the Evil Queen wants is for them to fight among themselves while she sits on her throne room, eating caviar and, no doubt, getting fillers and Botox from her in-castle aesthetician off-screen.

When Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, it was history-making — the first U.S. feature animation and a hit that proved that audiences wouldn’t just turn up for full-length animated films but embrace them. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would cement fairy tales as an inextricable part of the Disney brand, in rides and merchandise and Broadway musicals, to the point where 88 years later, Disney is still in this game, albeit in an eating-its-own-tail fashion where the media giant is no longer just iterating on a well-known story but on its own previous take. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was born out of the landscape of early animation, owing as much to the era’s high jinks–centric shorts as to the Brothers Grimm. Snow White is, for better and (mostly) worse, a product of a corporation that has for years been lumbering after its idea of the Zeitgeist with all the agility of an aging colossus. (The recent deletion of a trans story line from a Pixar series is a reminder that the company is just as willing to make a clumsy heel turn out of the same impulse.) That, in chasing something vaguely progressive and YA-inspired with Snow White, Disney has turned out a film with some hilariously timely choices is a great joke, though I wouldn’t call it an intentional one. The most pragmatic aspect of Snow White is that with its plasticky set design and gift-shop-tacky costuming, it already looks like it takes place in a theme park — no adaptations necessary.",vulture
https://vulture.com,John Mulaney’s Playhouse,https://www.vulture.com/article/john-mulaney-everybodys-live-writers-room.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:00:46 GMT","“Whether something’s good or people like it is so ephemeral. If they could possibly predict it with data, they’d have more hits,” Mulaney says. “I don’t mean Netflix. I mean everybody.” Photo: Jamie Lee Taete

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.

Nine days before the premiere of Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney, Mulaney and the writing staff are gathered around a table in the show’s Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood. It’s mid-afternoon, and the writers are kicking around ideas they imagine might come up during the show’s first episode, which Mulaney has decided will be on the topic of lending people money. Within minutes, they start throwing out hypotheticals and personal experiences. “If you lend a relative money to build a greenhouse, and they end up building an addition to their home with it, is that okay?” Mulaney asks the group. Quickly it’s clear that this happened recently with Mulaney’s mother-in-law, who he calls Miss Kim. “I don’t mean to sow division, but she fucked you,” writer Langston Kerman says. “Because?” Mulaney asks. “Because she knew it wasn’t a greenhouse from the beginning,” Kerman says.

Everybody’s Live is Mulaney’s new hourlong weekly show streaming live on Netflix, a reinvention of a late-night talk show format. “It’s my live, jazzlike, unpredictable talk show,” he says in the March 12 premiere’s opening monologue. “Netflix has given me an hour to introduce my fans to the baby-boomer culture that has made me the unsettled weirdo that I am today.” The show, an extension of a six-episode experiment in May 2024, is heavily filtered through Mulaney’s own experiences and preferences, from the topics to the panelists to the musical guests to the references. It provides endless space for Mulaney’s sharp comedic instincts, and it gives him a platform to work out the contours of his shifting onstage persona after marrying actor Olivia Munn and becoming a father. It also leaves plenty of room to slip into his blindspots, to expose all the pitfalls of a show that’s determined to stay deliberately, stubbornly loose.

All of it is visible in the show’s premiere episode. Everybody’s Live features live calls from viewers, and more than once, the calls — some about drug addiction or housing instability — get quite sad, trapping Mulaney in an uncomfortable spot between empathy and playful detachment. There are other hiccups: A surprise Tracy Morgan appearance drags the pacing down, and between that and the phone calls, Mulaney has to rush through the ending to avoid going over the show’s hour limit. (The production incurs fees for running long.) But the show’s potential for improbable magic is all there, too. It’s delightful to watch Michael Keaton listening to tracks from Fred Armisen’s upcoming album of sound effects. There’s a perfectly stupid Body Double telescope parody, where Mulaney witnesses several murders from afar and decides to shrug them off so he doesn’t have to deal with any hassle. Best of all, the episode’s unexpected combination of guest panelists and musical performers produces a transcendent moment where Joan Baez and Richard Kind start dancing ecstatically to Cypress Hill’s “Hits From the Bong.”

“I can protect myself by acting like we just think it’s weird, and that way you can’t criticize it in the same way,” Mulaney says of his show’s purposeful unevenness. He will happily crack jokes about it being slapdash and unproduced: “We’ve been working on this episode all day,” he says in the premiere. “Some crew got here as early as 9:00 a.m.” But in truth, he believes this show, with its awkward phone calls and guests who have no reason at all to be there, is better entertainment. “Whether something’s good or people like it is so ephemeral. If they could possibly predict it with data, they’d have more hits,” he says. “I don’t mean Netflix. I mean everybody.”

Mulaney’s office in the Everybody’s Live studio has a turntable, a large collection of vinyl, a stack of notes on yellow legal pads, and a small toddler-size table piled with juice boxes. There’s also a large bulletin board filled with planning cards, a double of the board in the main writers’ room. The planning boards are distracting, and it’s hard not to keep looking at them and trying to guess what all the cards might mean, although a few (“Richard Hair Transplant”) seem mostly self-explanatory. Some are Mulaney’s ideas; many are from the show’s writing staff, whom Mulaney hired with the intent that the show could work a little like Saturday Night Live, where writers often produce their own work.

“Every writer here has basically run their own show,” Mulaney says. Fran Gillespie and Anna Drezen are longtime SNL alumni. Vanessa Ramos created the show Blockbuster for Netflix; Alex Scordelis comes from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and has a journalism background that Mulaney appreciated; stand-up Langston Kerman co-created the Peacock series Bust Down; Rajat Suresh and Jeremy Levick made names for themselves as writers and producers of off-kilter digital videos. When I ask Mulaney about hiring Dave Ferguson as head writer, he notes that he and Ferguson worked together when Mulaney cohosted the Spirit Awards and that Ferguson is especially good with “the administrative aspects of running a writers’ room.” “Making Google Docs seems to fuel him,” Mulaney says. He, like all the show’s writers, has the primary quality Mulaney was looking for: “They write thinking about producing it.”

Some ideas on the Everybody’s Live board. Photo: Jamie Lee Taete

Some of the planning-board cards are bits Mulaney or other staffers have developed for the writers to appear in themselves, like Levick and Suresh, who have established onscreen personas. Some are cards Mulaney knows only a little about; at least one of them is a sketch Kerman is developing for late in the season that they’ve both decided Mulaney will not see a script for until the day it’s performed. Kerman is also responsible for the live-written lower-third gags that play during each episode, which Mulaney never sees until after the show’s finished. Did he know that in the Everybody’s Live premiere, Kerman would identify him as “John Mulaney, Host (White),” I wonder. “Was that in the top of the show?” he asks and laughs and shakes his head.

Although Mulaney is now able to rattle off a list of Everybody’s Live’s influences and models (The Dick Cavett Show, Larry King Live, a late-’70s public-access series called TV Party), none of it was obvious at the start. Netflix originally hired Mulaney to do a streaming tie-in for its Netflix Is a Joke Festival in 2024 with little requirement for it beyond Something-Something Live Mulaney. That six-episode nightly show became Everybody’s in L.A., and all but one of the writers on Everybody’s Live were hired from that earlier trial version. Mulaney decided to develop something more like a late-night talk show with pre-produced comedy sketches, musical performances, and an organizing topic of the day related to the show’s Los Angeles focus like palm trees, coyotes, and earthquakes. Mulaney wanted the show to have its own rhythm rather than be dictated by an ironclad rundown or media-promotional cycle: “It’s fun to have a topic, and not to interview people about their career or life.” He wanted Richard Kind to be involved, he says, because Kind seems to belong to 1940 and 2025 at the same time. “There’s no greater insight into Richard as a performer that I have, versus anyone else who watches him. It’s just so funny, and I’m never unhappy to see him.” And his impulse was to build a show that felt purposely aimless. “I don’t see dead air enough. Everything’s so tight. I just wanted Richard and I to have an exchange that is neither electric nor has a conclusion and sit in it.”

Everybody’s in L.A. was a success — as much as any show that sometimes ran over its allotted time, hung up on callers, featured a buggy delivery robot, and insisted that “Helicopter Night” also be “Sunglasses Night” could possibly succeed. Netflix agreed to let Mulaney do more of it, ordering two 12-episode seasons. They’d still be live, but they’d now be made on a weekly instead of nightly schedule; Netflix requested the word Live in the title, and it would shift away from its heavy Los Angeles focus so it could tackle a broader range of subjects. Good topics for an Everybody’s Live episode, Mulaney says, are “something that would lead to a lot of questions, stories, and conversations on Facebook groups or Quora.” When the writers first arrived at the Sunset Gower offices in January, Mulaney already had a theme in mind. “He walked straight in and said, “‘Okay! The first episode will be lending people money,’ in a way where I thought he needed to settle a score,” Gillespie says. “He didn’t even say ‘hi,’” adds Kerman.

Although some themes are still in flux for the rest of the season (Mulaney is dubious about a planned episode on “Sleep”), the writers felt good about several of the topics they’d landed on, which include “Cruises,” “End-of-Life Planning,” and “Real ID.” Some of them, Mulaney acknowledges, are his own grievances. And it is a grievance. “I think it’s weird,” he says of the Real ID. “Why are we all going in and getting a new photo taken by the federal government? I’m not even a conspiracy person. We just don’t do this. You don’t tell me my license isn’t good on a plane any more. How dare you?” This is as much of a take on the topic as he likes to have, he says: “What the hell’s going on? What’s this about?”

While some elements of the show come straight out of Mulaney’s particular obsessions and hang-ups, the writing staff is happy to make their feelings clear when he pitches an idea they don’t think will work. Early on, Mulaney pitched a series of pre-taped sketches meant to mimic only the boring scenes of a Korean historical drama, like two people having a conversation next to a well. “The reaction was so immediate,” Levick says. “He had come in so hot with this idea, and I think he was looking around the room, but no one was doing that thing where they’re nodding.” “It was a full, ‘I don’t know what that looks like, but follow your heart, I guess?’” says Ramos. As of the week before the premiere, no Korean historical drama bits had made it on to the planning board, but there is a card reading “Bring Out a Crow” and a different idea Ferguson had pitched based on NBA tunnel walks.

Mulaney has no plans to stop doing everything else in order to become a full-time weekly late-night host. He’s shooting a movie this summer and developing a TV project with his friend, the lawyer and legal scholar Neal Katyal. He’s mulling a stage version of his 2019 Documentary Now! episode “Original Cast Album: Co-Op.” He’s touring again in August. He has never had so many projects planned in advance, and while he loves doing Everybody’s Live, he says, “we’re not looking to stay on for 30 years.” He has a family now; Mulaney and Munn have a 3 year-old and a new baby. It’s helpful to have a project that keeps him in Los Angeles and to have more work scheduled ahead of time. His life has shifted its center of gravity over the past several years. When I reach him by Zoom after the premiere, his video pops up on screen with the identification “Olivia Munn.” There’s a running gag on Everybody’s Live where Mulaney asks callers what kind of car they drive. When I ask Mulaney about his own car, he says he sometimes drives a Mini Cooper because Munn has been teaching him to drive a stick. “I’m getting sort of better, but I have a lot of trouble with speed bumps.”

Everybody’s Live reflects Mulaney as he is today: his musical tastes, the writers he loves, the references that tickle him. Consciously or not, it’s also a reflection of a Mulaney who’s still attached to an earlier iteration of his comedic persona, even as he’s actively building another one more suited to who he is now. Without the L.A. focus, Everybody’s Live has more emphasis on Mulaney himself. It’s most obvious in the premiere’s monologue, after he gets through the necessary introductory jokes about what the show should be. “Netflix picked up this show by accident. They thought it was a true-crime documentary because I look like a disappeared boy,” he says. A minute later, he transitions into material about his family, including Munn’s cancer diagnosis, their IVF experience, and a joke that culminates in Mulaney, as Munn, miming cunnilingus. They are jokes about two different Mulaneys — one of them with a more mature look and a more complicated relationship with his audience — and they chime against one another like discordant notes. Neither version is fully integrated with who he plays as a host, either: the Mulaney with the trick of being charmingly annoyed that he has to keep checking off the chores of performing this show, even as he wanders around a world built to his specifications in the manner of Pee-wee Herman in his playhouse.

But he is also the Mulaney who made Richard Kind his sidekick and booked Joan Baez to be on the first episode. He knew that even though the premiere was running long, he had to make sure there was time for the episode’s highlight, a pre-taped sketch of a panel of 11 actors who have played Death of a Salesman’s Willy Loman, written and produced by Scordelis. The sketch is an expression of all the things Everybody’s Live does best: sincere love and admiration for cultural iconography, forced through a sieve of surreal frivolity. “I was just determined to make sure that aired,” Mulaney says.

The previous week, in a lull during the conversation about episode one’s theme, Mulaney abruptly changes subjects. “We just had the funniest call with Netflix,” he says to the writers. Netflix had learned that the premiere’s guests would include Armisen and Baez, and it was worried that the show hadn’t booked talent that would make the premiere buzzy and exciting. “‘This is not the show we sold,’” Mulaney describes an unnamed executive saying. “It was great to see someone kind of apoplectic — like, Oh honey, do you know what you bought? And then they go, ‘We don’t even understand what this rundown means!’ I’m like, Yeah, you think you’ll feel better when I explain ‘telescope murder’? If I walk you through that it’s a Body Double parody, you’ll feel better about the spend?”

As Mulaney describes the call, the writers laugh, but they also consider the note about booking buzzier talent. Kerman asks what name would actually be “big” enough. “No one knows,” Mulaney says. He has a hard time imagining a potential viewer who has no interest in a new Mulaney show then changes their mind after they hear someone like Tom Hardy is going to be a guest. The room starts to move on with a short check-in about how much of a script to send Morgan’s team for his King Latifah appearance, but in the first pause, Mulaney returns to the Netflix call. “They said, ‘And Jo Ann Baez?’ And I said, ‘It’s Joan.’” The writers chuckle, thrilled and a little alarmed. “The show’s not good, guys,” Mulaney says. “That’s the thing about the show, is it’s not like, Oh, this is awesome! It’s great, but it’s not good.”

Kanye West continues to get his family involved in his latest antics. The rapper has released a short film, Bully, featuring his son Saint, days after putting his daughter North on a song with Sean “Diddy” Combs. West posted three versions of Bully to X on March 18 because “the first link started acting up,” he wrote. The black-and-white films all feature 9-year-old Saint hitting wrestlers with a mallet, set to a new Ye album. The rapper shared that he shot and directed the project, while longtime collaborator Hype Williams edited it; the three versions include “post-Hype” and “post-post-Hype” editions. In a deleted post, per Variety, West said the album was “not finished and half the vocals AI.” The album includes a sample of the Supremes’ “You Can’t Hurry Love” and vocals from Peso Pluma.

This comes after West posted and deleted a song with Diddy, who is currently in jail on sex-trafficking charges, that featured his daughter North West, on March 15. At the time, Kanye also posted screenshots of texts from his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, claiming he put the song out against her wishes. Kardashian has yet to respond to Kanye using their children in his recent work. However, after she shouted out Playboi Carti on Instagram for referencing her brand Skims on his new album, Music, Carti commented, “TELL MY NIECE NORTH SEND ME A SONG.”

This seemed to trigger Kanye, who dropped Bully in the middle of an X rant about Carti, with Kanye also claiming Carti snubbed him on Music. Kanye also attacked Jay-Z and his wife, Beyoncé, along with their children, over feeling abandoned by his once collaborator. Kanye has made antisemitic comments and used anti-gay and anti-disability slurs on X in the past 24 hours, on top of threatening Carti.

Kanye previously teased Bully on Justin Laboy’s podcast, The Download, in February, saying it was inspired by Saint kicking a kid he was playing with. “I asked my son, I said, ‘Why did you do that?’” Kanye explained. “And Saint responded with a simple, ‘’Cause he weak.’ And I was like, This man is really a bully right here.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,Hollywood’s Latest Conservatorship Battle,https://www.vulture.com/article/wendy-williams-guardianship-fight.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 20:12:32 GMT","Wendy Williams. Photo: Aeon/GC Images

Wendy Williams has amped up her demands to be free of a restrictive guardianship that she alleges controls every aspect of her life. She was placed in a guardianship three years ago but took her protests to the literal streets last week, pressing a handwritten note to the window of her Hudson Yards luxury high-rise assisted-living facility that read “Help! Wendy!,” resulting in police and medical personnel intervening and sending her in an ambulance for evaluation.

Mathew Rosengart, the attorney and former federal prosecutor who obtained the court-ordered suspension of Britney Spears’s father, leading to her freedom, said conservatorship and guardianships were “designed by state legislatures as last resorts, generally for people who are incapacitated.”

“They should, in fact, be a last resort because, in essence, they strip individuals of fundamental rights and civil liberties, as appears to be the case with Ms. Williams,” Rosengart said.

After a brief hospitalization, Williams was back at her unit at the Coterie Hudson Yards, a luxury assisted-living and memory-care facility, where rooms can cost anywhere from $10,800 to $34,900 a month, wearing a pink fuzzy Versace robe and waving to onlookers. But she has in no way given up her fight for more freedom. Last Friday she called in to The View, saying she wanted her current guardian to “get off my neck.”

“I am not permitted to do anything but stay on this floor, the memory-unit floor, where the people are 90 and 80 and 70,” Williams said to View co-host Sunny Hostin. “Look, I’m 60, and I don’t even know what a memory unit …Why am I here? You know what I’m saying, where people don’t remember anything? So I stay in the bedroom the majority of the time.”

Willams told Hostin she appreciated her giving light to her situation, adding if “I was allowed to come out and put on nice clothes and see you in person, but I cannot.” Below, a breakdown of Wendy Williams’s guardianship and how she’s fighting against it.

Why is Wendy Williams in a guardianship?

The popular talk-show host started to act erratically in 2021. Guest hosts filled in for her 2021–22 season, and her Fox Television show was cancelled in 2022. Her bank, Wells Fargo, initiated a guardianship proceeding February 14, 2022, after it reported having several interactions with Williams concerning her financial accounts.

“Wells Fargo became concerned that W.W.H. was being exploited, subject to undue influence, or experiencing dementia,” according to court papers filed in NY Supreme Court by Wendy’s court-appointed guardian, Sabina Morrissey.

Williams was 59 at the time.

Who is Wendy Williams’s guardian?

Sabrina Morrissey, a New York estate and guardianship attorney, was appointed by the court as Williams’s guardian. Her attorney profile states that she is “passionate about representing elderly clients and protecting them from fraud and abuse” and helps individuals in need obtain the appropriate support and “safeguard their assets.” On February 22, 2024, two days before Lifetime’s Where Is Wendy Williams? aired, Williams’s “care team” sent out a press release announcing that Williams had been “officially diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Aphasia, a condition affecting language and communication abilities, and frontotemporal dementia, a progressive disorder impacting behavior and cognitive functions, have already presented significant hurdles in Wendy’s life.” In addition, the release said Williams suffered from Graves’ disease and lymphedema.

What was shown in the documentary?

Producers had been filming with her for three years, documenting her time leaving the show, her struggles with alcohol, and her erratic behavior. At one point in the documentary, Wendy proclaims, “I love vodka!” and says she was glad she was done with her talk show so she could “show my boobs,” pulling down her top and grabbing her nipples. She’s also seen with her eyes severely bulging, sometimes wearing only a gray bathrobe and without her trademark wig.

Attorneys for A&E said in court papers that it showed a “raw, honest, unfiltered reality” of Williams’s life after she had been placed under guardianship.

After seeing a trailer for the show, Morrissey filed unsuccessfully to prevent the show from airing. She also filed a lawsuit against A&E, alleging Williams did not have the capacity to consent to being part of the documentary and that they knowingly exploited Williams under false pretenses, filming her and profiting from an “unauthorized and repugnant program.”

What has Williams said?

Williams said she feels like a prisoner. She said she isn’t allowed to go outside and that the two times she had been out in 30 days were only to go to her dentist.

“No, no, I’m not allowed to go out,” Williams said when she called in to TMZ on February 12. “I can call you, but you can’t call me.”

She also said in that interview that she doesn’t have her phone or an iPad to contact her family and friends and that her friends are not allowed to visit. “Where I am is this place where the people are older, you know what I’m saying,” she described the facility. “They are in their 90s and their 80s. I eat lunch and dinner in my bedroom. I don’t eat out there with the people that live here just cause it’s so goddam depressing. There’s a bathroom, there’s a closet, and the TV, which is purchased by me through the guardian person.”

What has Williams’s family said?

Williams’s niece Alex Finnie, who took her to dinner after her medical evaluation on March 12, told TMZ outside the Coterie that she was told the assisted-living facility called the police on her for talking her aunt out.

“Unbelievable,” Williams added.

“Wondering how that coordinates with the statements that the guardian has made that Wendy is able to come and go as she pleases and that there are no family visits that are blocked,” Finnie said.

What is next for her guardianship fight?

Williams was released from the hospital on March 12, and two days later she called in to The View and told Hostin that she passed a mental evaluation “with flying colors” during her hospital stay. Hostin said it was just “a rudimentary type of evaluation.”

“But I think the important takeaway from it is that she did pass that one with flying colors as she described,” Hostin said. “Now where we are at is the guardian agrees that she should have a more robust evaluation done by experts, a psychological evaluation, and the judge has agreed.”

“She doesn’t sound like someone that needs that type of restrictive environment,” Hostin said. “She doesn’t mind having a guardian, but she just doesn’t want this guardian. “

After Williams said in multiple press statements that she was capable of managing her own affairs, Morrissey in court papers requested the court appoint a qualified expert to conduct a supplemental medical evaluation of Williams to determine her capacity. Federal judge Ronnie Abrams agreed and gave the parties until June to get the medical evaluation done.

“These matters can be extremely nuanced and complex, but generally speaking, there are several tacks a lawyer can assess and potentially take in this type of situation, ranging from filing an application with the court to remove a guardian, to seeking a less restrictive guardianship or seeking to terminate it,” Rosengart said.

Hostin said Williams was alcohol free and suggested she could have a sober coach and live in her own apartment. She said Williams seemed “so present” and remarked on “the way she sounded so hopeful.”",vulture

Leaving Neverland, the 2019 documentary about Michael Jackson’s alleged child abuse, is returning with a sequel, but not to HBO. Dan Reed’s movie was a hit on the platform and won the Primetime Emmy for Best Documentary or Nonfiction Special. However, Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is out on YouTube in the United States. Below, everything we know about the follow-up and the lawsuits involved.

What is Leaving Neverland 2 about?

The original Leaving Neverland chronicled the allegations of childhood sexual abuse against Michael Jackson by Wade Robson and James Safechuck. Its sequel follows Robson and Safechuck as they attempt to get a trial after suing Jackson’s companies, which are controlled by his estates. Currently, the case is set to go to trial in California in 2026.

Where and when is it available?

The full 53-minute-long documentary is currently available on YouTube. In the U.K., the documentary premiered on March 18 on Channel 4.

Why isn’t it on HBO or Max?

Following the release of Leaving Neverland in 2020, the Michael Jackson estate sued HBO for $100 million, claiming the company violated a 1992 non-disparagement agreement. The suit was settled by both sides in 2024, but, according to Puck’s Matt Belloni, HBO took down the original Leaving Neverland from Max as part of the settlement.

What has the creator said?

Dan Reed, the British director who made both films, says releasing the documentary on YouTube was not necessarily his choice. “I would have loved to release this with HBO,” Reed told Variety on March 13. “That wasn’t possible. Clearly, it’s related to the lawsuit or the arbitration dispute. But HBO don’t call me up and say, ‘Hey, this is what’s happening with that case.’ It all happens under wraps, so I don’t know.” However, he does seem excited about the prospect of a YouTube release in comparison to a streaming project. “It feels as though maybe the world of streaming is more cautious [about] tricky subjects, political subjects, subjects that put people’s teeth on edge and make them upset,” he said to Deadline in a March 13 story. “In order not to strike the wrong note with such a vast subscribership, you can’t really afford to do anything that isn’t absolutely safe.”

Will there be another installment?

This is intended to be a three-part series with the third installment covering the trial. Reed told Variety that he considers this film, the second installment, to be “a bridge film in between what was a pretty high-profile start and what I hope will be a very dramatic ending.”",vulture

Don’t know if you’ve heard, but Saturday Night Live season 50 is kind of a big deal. Like: It’s the cover of New York Magazine and a Reason to Love New York kinda big deal. Also a big deal? The first time we’re going to get to see Mikey Madison act post-Anora and post-Oscar win will be as SNL host on March 29. The actress still doesn’t have any projects lined up (although there Gerwig-ian rumors), so we await a chance to see her speak in character on bated breath. She’ll be joined by Morgan Wallen, whose first performance was canceled after he violated COVID protocols in 2020. He made his return a few months later, apologizing via sketch.

Madison and Wallen will be followed by Jack Black — he’ll be hosting for the first time since 2005. Notably, he cannot be musical guest as Tenacious D, which the duo did in 2006, since that relationship has blown up and the band is currently “on a break”. Instead, his musical guest(s) will be Elton John and Brandi Carlile. Finally, SNL’s favorite hottie Jon Hamm will host alongside musical guest Lizzo, who is somehow currently the most controversial musical guest on a lineup that includes Morgan Wallen. Below, all the dates, hosts, and musical guests for SNL 50.

https://vulture.com,The 15 Best Couch Co-op Video Games,https://www.vulture.com/article/best-couch-co-op-local-multiplayer-video-games.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:40:49 GMT","Photo: Hazelight Studios

Before the onset of high-speed internet connections, couch co-op, in which multiple players share a screen, was one of the only ways to game together. Classics of the 1980s and ’90s, arguably the mode’s heyday, range from the powder-pink platforming masterpiece Kirby Super Star to the inimitable beat-em-up Streets of Rage. But in recent years, this style of collaborative local play has taken the backseat to collaborative online experiences like MMO shooter Destiny and beast-slaying extravaganza Monster Hunter Wilds. Thankfully, studios like Hazelight, the makers of 2025’s highest-rated title on Metacritic, Split Fiction, are keeping the couch co-op experience from becoming a lost art. Here, we’ve rounded up 15 inventive titles worthy of your consideration. After all, why bicker with internet strangers about a botched boss fight when there could be a close friend or partner sitting next to you?

Split Fiction

(PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X)

No other studios are making couch co-op experiences of such popcorn panache. We can confirm Hazelight’s Split Fiction is pure co-op bliss, a summer blockbuster that delivers a deluge of delight at a frankly outrageous clip. (Hazelight founder Josef Fares was formerly an award-winning film director.) Playing as Zoe and Mio, you’re thrust into the whimsical fantasy and brooding sci-fi worlds that each of them dream up as fiction writers (hence the title). So begins a self-aware celebration and deconstruction of genre tropes that always has fun with its source material. You’ll ram razor-sharp blades into the mouth of a terrifying robot dentist and swing from the fishing rod of a steppe-scraping giant. It’s the most accomplished Hazelight effort yet: video game imagined as frenetic roller coaster for two.

Vampire Survivors

(Android, iPhone, PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

With screen-erupting euphoria, Vampire Survivors offers an unapologetically pure take on the video-game power fantasy. Start out with a solitary automated attack (a flailing whip or single projectile spell); upgrade your arsenal to become a whirling maelstrom of cosmic violence, wiping out hundreds of enemies every second. Teaming up with a pal, you may find the early portion of the game can be trickier because only one of you gets to enjoy the upgrade that comes with hitting a new level. But the payoffs are arguably all the sweeter. Marvel at the firework display of disintegrating foes; revel in your might as a pair of badass demon slayers.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder

(Nintendo Switch)

Fittingly, the world’s favorite proletariat gaming star, mustachioed plumber Mario, has long made the case for cooperative play. Early entries, like the 1983 original, were simple by today’s standards: You merely swapped the controller with a partner. In 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a return to the franchise’s side-scrolling roots, up to four players can hop into a level, sharing lives and power-ups in one of the series’ most fiercely imaginative entries. Whether bounding through the Pipe Rock Plateau or soaking up the tropical holiday vibes of the Petal Isles, bouncy secrets burst forth from every corner of this undeniably kaleidoscopic world. We’ve run the math: With more players, the delight is simply multiplied.

Baldur’s Gate 3

(PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X)

Whether playing together or alone, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a daunting experience. Every action in this isometric role-playing game is decided by the rolling of a 20-sided dice, and there is a frankly dizzying array of menus and submenus to parse. Yet no other RPG gets this close to summoning the pure freeform magic of a pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons session. If you and a friend can pierce the game’s somewhat obtuse exterior, you’ll be rewarded with a jaw-droppingly flexible experience, from story and combat to romantic canoodling, all seamlessly narrated by a chatty dungeon master. Alas, you’re not able to seduce one another, but that’s really the only black mark against this absurdly fun all-timer adventure.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Beat ’em ups of the 1980s and ’90s, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, helped shape an idea of couch co-op that is still with us today: bruising arcade action, furious electronic soundtracks, sick-as-hell pixel art. In short, these are perfect games for kicking back with friends. 2022’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, starring our favorite sewer-dwelling amphibian heroes, is the modern-day inheritor to such titles. The co-op mode, which can accommodate six players, is brilliantly chaotic because, with each additional character, Shredder’s Revenge throws more enemies at you. It’s a game fundamentally about buddies kicking butt best enjoyed by buddies with a pile of New York pizza at arm’s length.

The Quarry

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Summer camp; a handful of 20-something counselors; monsters intent on ripping this do-gooding bunch to shreds. Is there a movie genre more perfectly suited to the couch co-op treatment than the teen slasher? The answer is no, and U.K. studio Supermassive duly delivered on the idea’s rich potential. Where most couch co-op titles typically involve a little light competition if not outright working together, The Quarry sees you and up to eight friends role-playing in a narrative drama. You only need one controller, passing it around as you take turns playing your assigned character or characters, such as sensitive bro Chris (voiced by David Arquette) and sarcastic slacker Max (Skyler Gisondo). Will you collaborate or double-cross one another? Will your character make it out alive, or will they perhaps meet a bloody end and lose a limb or two?

It Takes Two

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Divorces are hard, especially if the two parents have been magically shrunk. This fantasy set-up is the catalyst for a journey of reconnection for mother and father, May and Cody, across a variety of brilliantly distinct levels. One is a DIY-themed romp through a tool-inspired land: cue swinging from nails. Another takes place in a garden of gigantic, deadly flora. Really, this isn’t so much a game about divorce as it is one about finding new ways to keep you and your playmate riotously entertained. On this level, as a teeming toybox, It Takes Two, also developed by Hazelight, is an unqualified success.

Heavenly Bodies

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Amid the twinkling grandeur of the cosmos, two hapless astronauts are fumbling crucial tasks: docking into a space station; adjusting the angle of satellite dishes; keeping their plants alive. That’s because you, the players, are independently controlling each of their arms and hands, a brain-scrambling challenge in its own right. As such, physics puzzler Heavenly Bodies is often a game of flailing noodle limbs and intrepid spacemen drifting out into the inky abyss. But that’s fine: In this beautifully presented starlit comedy, failure is part of the fun.

Untitled Goose Game

(PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One)

Life is more amusing when you’re causing mischief with a partner, and the same is true in the Untitled Goose Game. In this co-op, you team up as a pair of anarchic geese; steal the bespectacled child’s toy airplane; turn the sprinkler on while the gardener is tending to their vegetable patch; yank a stool away from an elderly man. After each moment of perfectly engineered insolence, pulled off with the slapstick verve of Laurel and Hardy, you’ll likely want to honk together in the faces of your victims. This quintessential English village has never known such fowl behavior.

Wilmot’s Warehouse

(PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One)

In this moment of political and economic chaos, does your brain long for a semblance of order? Then try Wilmot’s Warehouse, a strangely cheerful take on working in a gigantic storage warehouse. At regular intervals, a new van-load of crates bearing cryptic icons arrives, and it’s your job to pack them away. In single-player, this is a deeply personal process: Will you attempt to categorize these goods, or are you content with a little mess? Regardless, you’ll likely slip into a pleasingly Zen state shuffling them about. Playing with a partner, Wilmot’s Warehouse becomes a negotiation: Should what looks like a pen knife go over here with the tools or over there with the camping materials? Where the hell shall we put the rainbow? Through such decisions, this charming little game has the power to make — and indeed break — relationships.

Overcooked 2

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Have you and a friend or partner ever harbored aspirations of opening a café or restaurant? Then perhaps try Overcooked 2 first to see how you might handle such famously intense working environments. The task is ostensibly simple: A team of chefs cut food, cook food, and serve up finished dishes to a zombie army known as the, ahem, Unbread. Actually doing so is more complicated as you and your gastronomic buddies run around flinging ingredients onto chopping boards and, should things get a little out of control, applying a fire extinguisher to ablaze pots and pans. Overcooked 2 is what you get if you cross Nintendo twee with The Bear’s kitchen nightmare: unbridled culinary chaos.

A Way Out

(PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One)

What if The Shawshank Redemption was directed by Guy Ritchie, and it’s also a video game? That’s A Way Out in a nutshell, another Fares joint that sees two convicts, Vincent Moretti and Leo Caruso, plan and execute their escape from a high-security prison somewhere in 1970s America. This is a macho affair: You and a friend will do press-ups, chin-ups, and bench presses by day and crack skulls by night. Yet it’s markedly elegant, the camera swooshing back and forth between each character to frame the action more dramatically. For every on-the-nose jailbreak cliche, there is a moment of disarming emotional connection between Leo and Vincent.

Don’t Starve Together

(PC, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)

Looking like a popup book from the mind of Tim Burton, Don’t Starve Together is easily the most challenging game on this list. The clue is in its title: This is a survival game that centers on getting enough grub inside your 2-D-cutout character’s bellies. If you’ve played Minecraft, or any other survival game from the past 15 years, the loop should be familiar: scavenge for materials, slowly construct tools, forage berries, hunt the odd rabbit. But beware of permadeath, which means, should you succumb to hunger or any other perilous fate, that’s it — your game is truly over. There’s something about playing with a pal that softens this finality.

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake

(PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X)

For Josef Fares, director of Split Fiction, It Takes Two, and A Way Out, this is where it all began. This a significantly less zany, more melancholic affair than any of those games, a chilly fairytale of light puzzle-solving and poignant, worldless adventuring. The 2013 original saw you control two young boys named Naiee and Naia with each analogue stick. The 2024 remake delivers fully-fledged local multiplayer. As you push, pull, heave, and ho your way through stunning Nordic landscapes, the game builds to a show-stopping climax that delivers mightily on its coming-of-age premise. It’s a rare example of mechanics and meaning being completely intertwined. Just be sure to have a box of tissues at hand.

L.A. Noire

(PC, PlayStation 3/4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, Xbox One)

An uncanny all-star cast (including Ken Cosgrove actor Aaron Staton); a resplendent recreation of postwar Los Angeles; a spate of unsolved crimes. L.A. Noire is a rare single-player game that works even better as a couch co-op experience. That’s because this open-world crime thriller is less about driving and shooting than interrogating suspects. The co-op joy comes in collaborating on these interviews, choosing when to push a subject or pull back; when to buy their story or accuse them of cooking it up. There’s endless fun to be had in reading each virtual eyebrow raise and curled lip, arguing with your co-op buddy about what it could possibly mean — motive, alibis, smoking gun! — before the two of you invariably get it wrong anyway.",vulture

What if we didn’t talk about anyone’s genitals? Jason Isaacs is walking back some comments made about onscreen nudity during press for The White Lotus. “I said the wrong words in the wrong way,” he clarified to Variety on March 19. “I used the phrase ‘double standard,’ which I didn’t mean at all. There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven’t.” During an interview with CBS Mornings on March 14, Gayle King asked Isaacs about a scene with his White Lotus character’s exposed penis in episode four. “A lot of people are debating it. It’s all over the internet,” Isaacs said, regarding whether or not he wore a prosthetic. “And it’s interesting because the best actress this year is Mikey Madison at the Oscars. And I don’t see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on [the screen] all the time.” He added, “It’s interesting that there’s a double standard for men.”

“When women are naked, Margaret Qualley as well, in The Substance, nobody would dream of talking to her about her genitalia or her nipples or any of those things,” he continued. “So, its odd that there’s a double standard.”

Isaacs says he was attempting to deflect from the personal question. “I had been asked so many times in the same day by journalists, ‘Are you wearing a prosthetic?’ Which means, ‘Have I seen your actual penis? It’s very important for me to know if I’ve seen your penis,’” Isaacs told Variety. “It just strikes me as a bit weird and slightly obsessive. I thought I could have fun batting it off, but I batted it off very poorly.”

In Season 3 of #TheWhiteLotus, Jason Isaacs portrays the patriarch of a wealthy Southern family on vacation with his wife and children — as his business life back home seems to be falling apart.

Ellen Pompeo is narrating another TV show. But this time, the narrator is … unreliable? Good American Family is Pompeo’s first big proj away from Grey’s Anatomy and even necessitated her scaling back involvement in the titular role of the medical drama. Another limited series based on a true-crime story? Yes, another one. Like Monsters before it, the show intends on dramatizing multiple sides of the narrative. The trailer claims it’s “inspired by multiple stories, perspectives, threats, interpretations,” and “accusations.” But what are those stories, and what is the truth?

What is Good American Family about?

Good American Family stars Pompeo as Kristine Barnett. She and her husband, Michael (Mark Duplass), adopt Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism. But Kristine starts to suspect something is off with Natalia, even suspecting she may be older than her adoption papers claim.

“I want people just to think about how they look at things and what kind of judgments they make based on the way people look,” Pompeo told Variety. “I think we just need to check our own biases and question why we believe what we believe.”

Oh, this is that real-life-Orphan case, right?

That’s certainly how the media portrayed it. Here’s what happened IRL: The Barnetts adopted Ukrainian Natalia Grace in 2010. In 2012, the family successfully petitioned to have Natalia’s date of birth changed from 2003 to 1989, changing her legal age from 8 to 22. They then put Natalia in an apartment by herself and moved from Indiana to Canada.

Natalia Grace was taken in by Cynthia Mans (played by Christina Hendricks) after she noticed Natalia had trouble caring for herself. No duh — she was 8! Mans believes the Barnetts used the plot of Orphan as inspiration for how to abandon their adoptee. The Barnetts maintained that Natalia was simply of Orphan age and exhibiting Orphan-style sociopathy.

However, as part of Investigation Discovery’s The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, Natalia took a DNA methylation test, which determines age by how much one’s DNA has changed over time.

So we finally know the truth about Natalia Grace’s age?

According to the test results, Natalia Grace was 22 at the time of filming the ID docuseries, which made her 8 at the time the Barnetts left her in a Lafayette, Indiana, apartment. “This one little piece of paper throws every single lie that the Barnetts said right into the trash with a match,” Natalia said in 2023. “This is so big because, literally, this has been 13 years of just two people lying their butts off. They ruined a kid’s life. They painted [me] as some big monster when, in reality, they were the ones.”

What else does the doc say?

Docs, plural. The first season focused on the Barnetts’ side of the story, while The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks was dedicated to her version of events. Alongside the evidence of Natalia’s real age, the second season shares her allegations of abuse by Kristine Barnett, including getting pepper-sprayed twice. There is also evidence that Natalia had been a victim of human trafficking in Ukraine.

Where is Natalia Grace now?

She is living in a community of little people in New York State. The final season of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace alleges that the Mans family abused Natalia as well. With the help of the first family that tried to adopt her, Natalia escaped and was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, according to People.

When does Good American Family come out?

The first two episodes drop on Hulu on March 19 with six more episodes following on a weekly release schedule. All seasons of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace are streaming on Max.",vulture

This article was originally published in March 2019. Since then, new spy movies have emerged from the shadows and joined the ranks, including Steven Soderbergh’s latest espionage thriller Black Bag.

As with most genres, any attempt to define the spy movie falls apart pretty quickly. Maybe more quickly than most, given that the term can encompass films featuring everything from evil supervillains plotting to take over the world with futuristic weapons to grounded-in-fact stories of those who trade secrets behind enemy lines. (At least Westerns take place in the Old West. Except those that don’t. See, genre definitions are hard!) For this list of the best spy movies ever made, Vulture opted for a big-tent approach in an attempt to create a selection that captured the full breadth of the spy film. If it features espionage of some form as a key element, in other words, it’s a spy movie for our purposes.

A few dominant types of spy movies do help provide a little definition, however. It’s useful to remember the terms “Martini” and “stale beer,” two categories often used to define spy stories, in movies and elsewhere. Martini stories operate in a glamorous world where bad guys live in lairs, femmes fatales wait at every backgammon table, and our hero drives fast cars and seldom takes off a tuxedo. If that puts you in mind of James Bond, there’s a reason. Stale-beer stories take place in the shadows, where dull-looking operatives plot and probe, it’s never clear who’s a friend and who’s an enemy, and moral compasses tend to get warped. Stale-beer stories often tend to be informed by the actual practices of spying, and sometimes written by those with some experience in the world of espionage, e.g. the quintessential stale-beer writer John le Carré.

Even these groupings are less firm categories than the two poles between which most spy movies fall. The Bond series, for instance, has a habit of inching toward the stale-beer end every time it gets too fixated on gadgets and world-destroying plots. Then there are categories within categories, like spy-fi, stories set at the intersection of espionage and cutting-edge technology.

We tried to include a little from every corner of the spy-film world in this list without favoring one sort of spy movie over another. And while it would be easy enough to fill out a whole list with nothing but le Carré adaptations, Bourne movies, Bond movies, and Hitchcock films, we tried to look more broadly. Which isn’t to say there isn’t a lot of le Carré, Hitchcock, Bourne, and Bond on this list. And, as for the latter, we tried to include some representative samples from each Bond era. So, if your favorite Roger Moore movie didn’t make the cut, just assume that the one we chose is representing it as well. (Unless your favorite Moore movie is Moonraker, because that one is terrible.)

With that said, let’s begin with a pair of spies at the beginning of their careers then work our way toward more shadowy terrain.

50. Spy Kids (2001)

Photo: Miramax/Everett Collection

The perfect My First Spy Movie, Robert Rodriguez’s charmingly handcrafted kids’ film follows a couple of second-generation spies (Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara) compelled to follow in their parents’ footsteps thanks to the scheme of a dastardly supervillain/children’s show host played by Alan Cumming (one of many stars clearly having a blast in supporting roles). The wild designs and not-exactly-state-of-the-art special effects are all part of the charm. Three sequels and an animated series followed, but the original remains the most memorable. (Available to stream on Max.)

49. Hopscotch (1980)

If James Bond resides at one end of the spectrum when it comes to glamour, you can find Miles Kendig at the other. Played by Walter Matthau in this fun send-up of Cold War intrigue, he looks disheveled, acts impatient, and appears always on the verge of packing it all in and going home. And, in fact, that’s what he’s trying to do for much of Hopscotch by way of publishing a scorching memoir and calling it a day. Only the powers that be within the CIA, including a boss played by Ned Beatty, don’t want him to leave or, more importantly, his secrets to get out. But, unglamorous as he is, Kendig’s also an extremely good spy, and much of the fun of this Ronald Neame–directed comedy comes from watching such an unlikely secret agent outwit every trap American intelligence can throw his way. (Available to stream on Tubi and The Roku Channel.)

Bookended by a pair of intense dinner scenes, this David Koepp–scripted, Steven Soderbergh–directed thriller occasionally plays like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as reimagined by John le Carré. Michael Fassbender stars as George, a chilly veteran British operative who’s given a list of five possible agents who might be betraying the organization. The twist: The list includes his wife, Kathryn (Cate Blanchett). Actually, that’s not the only twist in this taut, sexy thriller, which reveals a new secret with almost every scene as everyone on George’s list (played by Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, and Regé-Jean Page) starts to wonder who they can trust as personal and professional betrayals come to light. The stakes are global, but the conflicts disarmingly intimate. (Now in theaters.)

47. Spy Game (2001)

Robert Redford’s history with the spy movie has made casting him a kind of shortcut for anyone wishing to channel a particular vein of paranoid, post-Watergate thrillers (more on this below). That’s why he was so effective in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and why he works so well as Nathan Muir, the mentor to Brad Pitt’s Tom Bishop in this Tony Scott–directed thriller, which opens during Muir’s last day on the job then flashes back to various points in the Cold War. Scott’s slick direction is sometimes at odds with a story that tries to capture the uglier aspects of spycraft, but Redford and Pitt’s raw, nervy performances anchor it. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

46. True Lies (1994)

If you can ignore the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably the last person who should be cast as a guy so ordinary-seeming that even his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) doesn’t know he’s actually a secret agent, there’s a lot of fun to be had in James Cameron’s lighthearted and explosion-heavy thriller. Sandwiched between Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Titanic, it can’t help but feel a bit minor by Cameron’s standards, bringing little new to the genre beyond a sense of excessiveness. But Cameron has as few equals as an action director as Schwarzenegger has as an action star, so the pairing works, even if their ambitions don’t stretch much further than blowing up whole chunks of the Florida Keys. (Available to stream on The Roku Channel.)

45. The Bourne Identity (2002)

When Paul Greengrass assumed control of the Bourne franchise with 2007’s The Bourne Supremacy, he helped redefine what 21st-century action scenes looked like. But that’s no reason to underrate the Doug Liman–directed The Bourne Identity, which introduced Matt Damon as Robert Ludlum’s amnesia-suffering CIA agent Jason Bourne. Damon brings a haunted intensity to the role, and Liman, who struggled with the studio throughout production, directs with style and grit. (Available to rent on Prime Video.)

44. M. Butterfly (1993)

David Cronenberg found a different angle on his career-long exploration of how bodies shape identity (and vice versa) by adapting David Henry Hwang’s fact-based play about a French diplomat (Jeremy Irons) who conducts a years-long affair with Peking opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) without seeming to recognize that Song was spying on him — or that Song was a man. One of Cronenberg’s most intimate films, M. Butterfly uses espionage as means to explore what we keep to ourselves, what we give away, and what we refuse to see when we fall in love. (Available to rent on Prime Video.)

43. The Fourth Protocol (1987)

Few Cold War betrayals stung as sharply as that of Kim Philby, a British intelligence officer who worked as a double agent for the Soviets for decades, then defected after being found out. Philby died in 1988, by all reports a disillusioned man, but he’d already been killed off onscreen the year before in the opening moments of this Frederick Forsyth adaptation, in which a rogue branch of the KGB plots to build and detonate a bomb on British soil. Future James Bond Pierce Brosnan plays the steely eyed agent sent to do the deed, and Michael Caine (whom we’ll meet again elsewhere on this list) stars as the wild card MI5 agent who stands in his way. It’s a fantastic plot, but Caine’s tough, smart performance and the no-nonsense direction from John MacKenzie (The Long Good Friday) keep the film tense and believable.

42. Sneakers (1992)

Photo: Universal/Everett Collection

Robert Redford (yes, him again) heads an all-star cast in a fun, fleet thriller in which he plays a former radical whose activities in the 1960s — as a Stone Age computer hacker — have forced him to reinvent himself under another name as an independent security expert. Redford heads a team of eccentric misfits that includes a former CIA Agent (Sidney Poitier), a conspiracy theorist (Dan Aykroyd), an awkward geek (River Phoenix), and a blind man (David Strathairn) who get in over their heads when tasked with finding a device capable of breaking any code. Both very much a product of the early ʼ90s and years ahead of its time, the Phil Alden Robinson–directed film is set at a moment when the former Soviet Union no longer seemed like much of a threat, but predicts a future in which information would be a kind of currency and a single keystroke could bring down a government. (Available to rent on Prime Video.)

Ang Lee’s follow-up to Brokeback Mountain garnered mixed reviews and vanished quickly from American theaters, mostly attracting attention for the explicit sex scenes that earned it an NC-17 rating. That’s too bad for several reasons, including Lee’s meticulous reconstruction of Hong Kong and Shanghai under Japanese occupation, paranoid, perilous places in which anyone could be working with the occupying forces or conspiring against them. Even more memorable, however, is the film’s intense focus on the toll taken on Wong (Tang Wei), a student who joins an acting troupe that decides to assassinate Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), a cruel higher-up in the Japanese-run puppet government. The sex scenes are just part of the film’s depiction of how much of herself Wong gives away in the course of an undercover operation instigated by passionate amateurs who have no idea what they’re doing — up to and including the person she once thought she was. (Available to rent on Apple TV.)

40. Our Man Flint (1966)

As with film noir, it sometimes seem like parodies of spy movies outnumber proper spy movies. And sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference. In Our Man Flint, James Coburn plays a former agent of Z.O.W.I.E. whose carefree lifestyle — he happily lives with four women — gets interrupted when he has to take out some mad scientists. Coburn’s a lot of fun in a film that never for a moment takes itself seriously yet doesn’t feel that far removed from the ’60s James Bond films it’s sending up. Coburn returned for the sequel In Like Flint the following year, and anyone who enjoys this nonsense would also do well to check out the Dean Martin–starring Matt Helm series, which kicked off with The Silencers the same year. (But go deeper into the subgenre at your own peril. There’s a reason many low-budget, tongue-in-cheek Bond knockoffs like The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World have been forgotten.) (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

39. Undercover Brother (2002)

Photo: Everett Collection

An even richer and more rewarding parody, Undercover Brother folds some sharp commentary into a story of the eponymous Undercover Brother (Eddie Griffin), a hero straight out of a blaxploitation movie who hooks up with the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a mostly black underground spy organization — Neil Patrick Harris plays a diversity hire — who does battle with the Man and his attempts to drain the world of soulfulness. Dave Chappelle and Chi McBride are among the other B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. operatives and the film, directed by Malcolm Lee and based on characters created by co-writer John Ridley, mixes easy jokes with smart, barbed gags about the insidious persistence of racism. (Available to stream on Prime Video.)

The influence of the James Bond films wasn’t limited to movies, inspiring several attempts to bring the world of globe-trotting spies to television via shows like The Avengers and Mission: Impossible. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. ran for four seasons in the mid-’60s, but wasn’t widely remembered by the time the 21st-century rolled around. That might be why Guy Ritchie’s 2015 adaptation struggled at the box office, which is a shame. Set in the 1960s, it’s a terrifically entertaining spy movie that teams the American agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill, who’s more fun here than he’s ever been anywhere else) with the Russian Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) to stop a former Nazi from executing a deadly scheme. (Alicia Vikander holds her own nicely in the middle of their over-the-top machismo.) The film stays light, but Ritchie brings excitement and flair to the action scenes. The only disappointment: We’ll likely never see the potentially charming sequel set up in the film’s final moments. (Available to stream on Netflix.)

37. Duplicity (2009)

Not all spies work for governments. Some decide to make real money in the private sector like the ex-spies played by Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in this clever thriller written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Gilroy brings in some of the skills he picked up writing the Bourne series, but it’s the film’s contentiously romantic spirit, to say nothing of the chemistry generated by Roberts and Owen, that makes it stand out. Why so few showed up to see it at the time remains a mystery, but it deserves to find a second life. (Available to stream on Max.)

36. Saboteur (1942)

Shot at the height of World War II, this Alfred Hitchcock thriller sends one of the director’s trademark falsely accused men on a cross-country journey after he’s wrongly believed to be a spy, a journey that climaxes atop a national landmark. If that sounds a lot like another, even more famous Hitchcock film (and there will be more about that one, and Hitchcock, below) just chalk it up to further support for the auteur theory. Yet Saboteur never plays like a dry run for North by Northwest. Its wartime atmosphere gives it a sense of dread all its own and its set pieces are all doozies, especially the Statue of Liberty climax. Hitchcock’s fixation on the falsely accused found a natural home in the spy genre, as did his technical gifts as a crafter of suspense sequences, which explains why his name turns up on this list more than any other director’s. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

35. The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)

Speaking to Francois Truffaut in the series of conversations that would become the indispensable book Hitchcock/Truffaut, Alfred Hitchcock referred to his 1934 film as the work of a “talented amateur” when compared to his 1956 remake. Maybe … but where the ’56 version has some great set pieces, it also features Doris Day singing “Que Sera Sera” approximately 500 times and much looser narrative than the lean original, which forces a married couple (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) to pretend nothing is wrong after a nefarious organization (that includes Peter Lorre) kidnaps their daughter. It also features a memorable trip into the London underworld and the best imaginable payoff of an early scene that sets up Best’s character as an expert skeet shooter. In this case, it’s talented amateurism for the win. (Available to stream on Pluto TV.)

34. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)

Photo: New Line Cinema/Everett Collection

The sequels and endlessly repeated catchphrases eventually threatened to make the unfrozen, Über-English superspy Austin Powers unbearable, but this first outing in Mike Myers’s affectionate send-up of ’60s spy movies (and ’60s culture in general) remains terrific fun. Myers’s script draws on a deep knowledge of a bygone era and builds to a heartfelt consideration of what’s been lost as we moved away from the ideas that fueled that decade — if not the outmoded, deeply sexist realities of the actual ’60s. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

33. The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)

After taking over for Sean Connery with the 1973 film Live and Let Die, Roger Moore became the longest-serving but least-respected James Bond. Moore gets a bit of a bad rap. He’s cheekily charming even when dropped in the most ridiculous situations — he even mostly keeps his dignity while wearing clown makeup in Octopussy — and though the Moore years’ lows are very low, their highs are considerable. By 1977, Moore had made the part his own. Gone were the early attempts to set himself apart by smoking cigars and drinking bourbon. Here, Moore skillfully employs an arched eyebrow in the midst of some of the series’s best action scenes. Ups (For Your Eyes Only) and downs (Moonraker) would follow, but with this film Moore established his Bond legitimacy once and for all. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

32. The Hunt for Red October (1990)

Photo: Paramount/Everett Collection

Though later entries starring a series of other actors (Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine) would turn Tom Clancy’s long-serving CIA analyst Jack Ryan into a more traditional action hero, none would make him as appealing as in this first outing. Alec Baldwin plays Ryan as a man who’s more brain than brawn, and who’s frequently terrified and faking it as he attempts to avert catastrophe by convincing others that a rogue Soviet general (Sean Connery) in command of a state-of-the-art submarine is attempting to defect to America, not start a nuclear war by blowing up the East Coast. On a hot streak, Predator and Die Hard director John McTiernan keeps ratcheting up the tension as his two leads get closer to each other, building to a climax that, at the time at least, played like a farewell to American and Russian enmity. (Available to stream on Paramount+.)

Daniel Craig’s third entry as Bond, after helping to bring the character back to his two-fisted roots in Casino Royale, is one of the series’s best thanks to a combination of elements: sharp direction by Sam Mendes, a script that doesn’t feel like a bunch of action scenes strung together by the thinnest of narratives, jaw-dropping photography by Roger Deakins, a top-tier theme by Adele, Craig’s ownership of the role, Javier Bardem as a truly menacing villain with a personal connection to Bond, and an all-star supporting cast that by this point had expanded to include Judi Dench, Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes, and Naomie Harris as a tough Moneypenny. Like Casino Royale, it confirmed that, with the right tools, Craig could fully reinvent the venerable spy for contemporary times. (Mendes’s 2015 follow-up, Spectre, on the other hand, proved that a similar combination of elements could fall apart.) (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

30. The Tailor of Panama (2001)

Pierce Brosnan didn’t always get the best material as Bond, but the shadow of Bond helped make him a more compelling presence. In this John le Carré adaptation, Brosnan plays Andy Osnard, a disgraced, unscrupulous, but unfailingly charming MI6 agent who sees a new assignment in an ultracorrupt Panama as a chance to accumulate money and power. To that end, he attempts to manipulate Geoffrey Rush’s Harry Pendel, a con man turned tailor who’s not as helpless Osnard might hope. It’s a battle of wits that John Boorman directs with a palpable sense of danger, building tension by letting his characters sweat in the tropical heat. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

29. Top Secret! (1984)

Between 1980’s Airplane! And 1988’s The Naked Gun, the team of Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker made this similarly molded spy spoof starring Val Kilmer as a rock star, famous for songs about skeet shooting, who’s enlisted to go behind the Iron Curtain. The film’s jokes range from the broad (a ballet sequence in which the male dancers have bulging genitalia) to the subtle (at some point its Cold War plot segues into a struggle against World War II–era Nazis) to the borderline avant-garde (an underwater saloon fight), and they arrive so quickly that if one doesn’t work the next three will be strong enough to make you forget the misfires. (Available to stream on Pluto TV.)

28. Eye of the Needle (1981)

Photo: United Artists/Everett Collection

Donald Sutherland has a gift for dropping flashes of malevolence into his performances even when he’s playing nice guys, so he’s particularly well-suited to play a character whose genial surface masks a vicious heart. In this 1981 thriller directed by Richard Marquand (whose fine work here would him secure a job directing Return of the Jedi a few years later), Sutherland plays “the Needle,” a deep-cover Nazi spy working in World War II England. His methods: charm everyone he meets and stab everyone who figures him out. An adaptation of a Ken Follett novel, the film follows the Needle on a bloody cross-country journey to escape back to Germany with some vital secrets in hand, then slows down the action when he washes up on a sparsely populated island and seduces the unsuspecting (at first) Lucy (Kate Nelligan), a neglected wife. Sutherland’s equally convincing as a seducer and a brutal operative in a performance that emphasizes that both sides of her personality are tools of the same trade. (Available to stream on MGM+.)

The sixth entry in the Mission: Impossible series (and the second in a row to be directed by Christopher McQuarrie), Fallout attempts to up the stakes in every way. It both takes baby steps into exploring the emotional life of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt (which doesn’t really go anywhere) and ups the stakes of previous films’ action set pieces (including thrillingly extended chase scenes in London and Paris and a how-did-they-do-that helicopter chase) while introducing varieties of action scenes untouched by previous entries, like a brutal fight in a nightclub bathroom. McQuarrie did excellent work with the previous entry, Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, but this tops it, in part because it’s designed to top it. (Available to stream on Paramount+.)

26. Munich (2005)

Steven Spielberg explores the psychic toll of living in the moral murk of espionage via the story of a group of Mossad agents charged with finding and killing the Palestinian terrorists behind the massacre of members of the Israeli team at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Their cause may be righteous, but the group, headed by Eric Bana, quickly discovers it’s sometimes impossible to tell the good guys from the bad guys in the midst of crossed wires, twisted loyalties, and mission drift. Spielberg has trouble landing the film in its closing scenes, but the director’s technical skills and empathetic command of characters combine to make it an extraordinary feel-bad spy thriller. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

25. Spy (2015)

Photo: 20th Century Fox/Everett Collection

Melissa McCarthy plays a desk-bound, overlooked CIA agent who unexpectedly gets the call-up after the apparent death of her flashy partner (Jude Law). McCarthy’s terrific fun as a shy woman who stands up to the bad guys and institutional sexism in a film written and directed by her frequent collaborator Paul Feig. (Possible alternate title: The Spy Who Came Out of Her Shell.) She also has help from a gifted supporting cast whose standouts include Rose Byrne and Jason Statham, in a pitiless spoof of the sort of macho tough-guy roles he normally takes. (Available to stream on Peacock.)

24. Foreign Correspondent (1940)

Though it eventually went all-in in supporting the war effort, Hollywood was shy about calling out Nazi Germany until the U.S. entered the war. Germans, after all, went to the movies, too. Isolationist senators even held a Senate subcommittee to investigate the presence of pro-war sentiment in Hollywood movies as late as September of 1941. Hitchcock’s Foreign Correspondent is one of the exceptions, casting Joel McCrea as an American reporter drawn into foreign intrigue on the eve of World War II. This was Hitchcock’s second Hollywood movie, and he earned some criticism in Britain for remaining abroad rather than returning to support the war effort. That stung, but there’s no shortage of concern for his native land to be found in a film that essentially ends with a call for America to join the war. Whatever its effectiveness as propaganda, it’s as fine a thriller as Hitchcock ever crafted, one highlighted by a stunning plane-crash sequence. (Available to stream on Max and Tubi.)

23. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969)

If the stars had aligned just a little differently, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service might have been the greatest James Bond film ever made. Consider this: It features one of the film’s most memorable locales (a lair high atop the Swiss Alps), Telly Savalas as Bond’s archnemesis Blofeld, an uncharacteristically moody tone, and Diana Rigg as a love interest who effortlessly holds her own opposite Bond — a woman he seems capable of truly loving, for once. The only problem: Connery left the series after the previous film, leading the merely adequate George Lazenby to take over. He might have grown into the part — and the film doesn’t help by saddling him with some winking nods to the camera about being the new guy — but Lazenby comes off as a bit of a lightweight in the midst of an otherwise superior entry. When Connery came back a few years later after Lazenby walked away, he was stuck with the so-so Diamonds Are Forever, making it that much harder not to ponder what might have been. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

22. Ronin (1998)

In a late triumph for John Frankenheimer, Robert De Niro stars as a mysterious operative working for initially unclear purposes in Paris, Nice, and Cannes. The film whisks through various plot convolutions, but the real attraction is the sharp dialogue (David Mamet co-writes the script), the tense scenes of spycraft in practice, and action sequences that Frankenheimer must have been waiting his whole career to shoot. (Available to stream on Pluto TV and Tubi.)

21. Goldfinger (1964)

Photo: Everett Collection

With its third entry, the James Bond series found the formula it would repeat without really topping for years to come. Trading in the relative realism of From Russia With Love, Goldfinger brings in gadgets and flashy cars galore as Bond matches wits with a gold-obsessed supervillain with a colorful henchman and plans for Fort Knox. Everything about Goldfinger is bigger and flashier than in previous entries. Down the road, that would be for worse, as the franchise’s obsession with topping itself pushed it in some silly directions. But it all works here, and the scene pitting Bond against a laser almost single-handedly launched the spy-fi subgenre. It’s a Martini in which every ingredient is perfectly balanced (even if Bond’s anti-Beatles joke makes him sound more out of touch now than ever). (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

20. The Spook Who Sat by the Door (1973)

Part spy movie, part blaxploitation film, part call to arms, this adaptation of a 1969 novel by Chicago writer Sam Greenlee follows Dan Freeman (Lawrence Cook) as he’s selected to be the first black CIA officer, trained in a variety of espionage techniques, then given little to do. Without warning, he quits the agency and returns to Chicago, where he starts converting gang members into freedom fighters to foment an uprising. Directed by Ivan Dixon (best known as Sergeant Kinchloe on Hogan’s Heroes), the film casts no judgment on Freeman’s militancy, and its depiction of entrenched racism provides many suggestions that Freeman might have the right idea, leading to a suggestively open-ended finale.

19. Mission: Impossible (1996)

Brian De Palma kicked off this long-running, Tom Cruise–starring big-screen adaptation of the ’60s spy show with a Hitchcockian adventure that finds Cruise’s Ethan Hunt wrongly accused of treason and forced to take extreme measure to prove his innocence. Set in a post–Cold War climate in which the dissolution of old allegiances has led to corruption and confusion, it’s justly famous for a long, mostly silent mid-film heist sequence. But, apart from some janky-looking special effects in the climactic sequence, the whole movie hangs together brilliantly, setting a high standard for the sequels. (Available to stream on Paramount+.)

18. Ministry of Fear (1944)

Graham Greene spent a carer alternating between what he considered serious novels and lighter work he regarded as “entertainments,” some of which involve spies (which makes sense, since Greene himself dabbled in espionage). But time has had a way of blurring such distinctions, revealing depths in his thrillers that Greene himself may not have seen at the time.

He didn’t think much of Fritz Lang’s adaptation of his novel Ministry of Fear, either, and he was wrong about that as well. Released in the midst of World War II, the film stars Ray Milland as a man who leaves an asylum only to find himself roped into a Nazi plot to steal English secrets — simply by guessing the correct weight of a cake at a charity fair. Lang uses the film to explore how paranoia can distort reality, and how living in a state in which no one can be trusted can feel a lot like insanity.

17. Three Days of the Condor (1973)

Photo: Everett Collection

Decades later, Sydney Pollack’s quintessential post-Watergate spy movie would explore a similar mood, casting Robert Redford as a low-level analyst who returns from a lunch run to find that everyone else in his office has been murdered. He calls headquarters only to realize he’s not sure whom, if anyone, he can still trust. Redford delivers a tough, rattled performance as a man who’s learning new skills on the job because his life depends on it. Pollack delivers some standout suspense scenes, but the best moments feature Redford wandering the New York streets and realizing anyone could be a threat. Sometimes paranoia is just another form of self defense. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

Paul Greengrass pioneered a handheld, close-to-the-action shooting style with the 2002 film Bloody Sunday, a re-creation of the 1972 Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland. He took that approach mainstream via this first sequel to The Bourne Identity, proving it could give action movies a different sort of energy. It’s been imitated to death by lesser films in the years that followed, but this first appearance still has a disarming spark. (Greengrass would return to the series twice more, first with The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, then with Jason Bourne in 2016.) (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

15. The IPCRESS File (1965)

A kind of mirror-image Bond, author Len Deighton’s Harry Palmer is the working-class embodiment of everything grubby and unglamorous in the espionage world. In the first of his several outings as Palmer, Michael Caine is put-upon and bogged down with paperwork. When he wants to seduce a woman, he doesn’t take her out to dinner but goes shopping for canned food. London might have been swinging for other residents, but Palmer still lived in a neighborhood filled with post-War deprivation. He wears thick spectacles, has dubious-looking teeth, and has presumably consumed many a stale beer. The down-market thrills are as effective in their own way as Bond’s globe-trotting adventures, and it’s easy to see why it was part of a mid-’60s run of movies that made Caine a star. (He’d return to the part of Palmer in four sequels.)

14. Burn After Reading (2008)

Photo: Focus Features/Everett Collection

A Coen brothers riff on the spy genre, Burn After Reading is filled with self-mythologizing drunks, unskilled opportunists, and borderline morons. Each of them loses track of a CD filled with secrets, and some end up dying in the stupidest possible ways because of their incompetence. The film’s underlying suggestion that spies are just as susceptible to selfishness, prone to mistakes, and likely to lie as anyone lines up nicely with some of the revelations brought to light during the George W. Bush years, and little that’s happened since has made the movie seem less insightful. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

13. Army of Shadows (1969)

There are films that get overlooked, and there are masterpieces that go unrecognized in their own time. Jean-Pierre Melville’s Army of the Shadows belongs to the latter camp. Released in France in September of 1969, a few months after Charles de Gaulle stepped down as the country’s president, it was viewed as too sympathetic to de Gaulle by the country’s left, mostly because it dealt with the French Resistance during World War II, commanded by de Gaulle as the country’s leader in exile during the war. What they missed, and what an appreciative audience didn’t miss when a restored print made the art-house rounds in 2006, is a moody, gutting film about wartime sacrifice and the ugly realities of what it takes to practice espionage for even the most noble cause. Drawing from a novel by Joseph Kessel (Belle de Jour) and his own Resistance work, Melville depicts the life of those who worked against the Nazi occupation as one of constant peril and strict rules, an existence in which the fight for French ideals essentially requires those on the right side of history to sever all ties with humanity — and in which every moment of triumph can feel like it’s just forestalling an inevitable defeat down the line. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

12. The 39 Steps (1935) and 11. The Lady Vanishes (1938)

Between making The Man Who Knew Too Much and leaving for Hollywood at the end of the ’30s, Hitchcock returned repeatedly to the spy thriller. All are worth watching, but The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes deserve special considerations. The former finds Hitchcock coming into his own as the creator of tense, fast-paced, cleverly plotted thrillers, following Richard Hannay (Robert Donat), a wrongly accused man (yep, another one of those), as he traipses from London to Scotland and back again while trying to unmask a mysterious organization trying to steal British military secrets. The Lady Vanishes proved Hitchcock could be just as effective in tighter quarters. Set largely aboard a train, it finds Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) facing a sanity-challenging scenario when she discovers that an elderly recent acquaintance has seemingly disappeared as they traveled together on a transcontinental train journey, a disappearance others seem not to have noticed. Both films are breathlessly entertaining, revealing a director seemingly capable of drawing thrills out of any setting (and the years to come would find Hitchcock challenging himself on this front again and again). (Both are available to stream on Tubi and Pluto TV.)

10. Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (2011)

Until Christopher McQuarrie followed Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation with Mission: Impossible — Fallout, the series had worked through a rotating series of high-profile directors, some of whom fared better than others. John Woo struggled to sustain the excitement found in his Hong Kong and early Hollywood work with Mission: Impossible 2, while J.J. Abrams confirmed he could make the leap from television to film with the very good Mission: Impossible III. Brad Bird, too, had something to prove when he signed on to Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol. He’d had tremendous success working in animation, but a live-action film, to say nothing of a live-action film on the scale of a globe-trotting Mission: Impossible entry, remained new territory. If anything, Bird over-delivered, transporting a gift for dynamic action scenes from his animated films to create the best action movie of this century, from a film-opening prison break through a nausea-inducing trip to the top of the Burj Khalifa and beyond.

9. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965)

“Staring at the Wall was like staring at frustration itself, and it touched an anger in me,” John le Carré wrote in 1989, reflecting on his 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. The author born David Cornwell wasn’t writing as a distant observer. He spent the first decades of the Cold War working in British intelligence, growing increasingly frustrated as the years piled up and channeling that frustration into a novel that depicts espionage as a dehumanizing occupation unfit for anyone with a conscience. Directed by Martin Ritt and starring Richard Burton, the film adaptation opens and closes on opposite sides of the Berlin Wall, and its grimmest suggestion is that both are controlled by amoral forces willing to sell out any principle and sacrifice as many pawns as necessary to secure power. Burton plays Alec Leamas, the spy chief of Britain’s Berlin station who, after losing a defector, is taken off the case. But his demotion is a ruse designed to make him attractive to enemy agents, who see a target vulnerable for recruitment thanks to the drunken, disillusioned pose he’s adopted. But, after a while, even Alec isn’t quite sure where the act ends and his true identity begins. The novel’s success allowed le Carré to embark on a long career depicting his former profession as the domain of gray, defeated men, most of whom have abandoned their consciences out of a sense of professional obligation. His work would be adapted many times over the years, and both Ritt’s chilly direction and Burton’s hollowed-out performance set examples others would strive to match. (Available to stream on MGM+.)

8. The Lives of Others (2006)

Set in the final years of the Cold War, The Lives of Others has all the political rot of a le Carré thriller without the thrills. That’s not a knock on Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s film, however, which finds a different kind of charge from the moral dilemmas of Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), who’s told to surveil a playwright only to discover that the motivations behind the assignment might be more personal than political, and that the time spent watching the playwright has begun to change his own point of view. The film attracted some criticism for its portrayal of a sympathetic Stasi agent, but Mühe’s performance so beautifully captures an awakening conscience that it’s hard to complain too much. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

7. Notorious (1946)

As entertaining as Hitchcock’s ’30s spy movies are, this Hollywood effort plumbs emotional depths that Hitchcock wasn’t even attempting to explore in the previous decade. Ingrid Bergman stars as Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a Nazi spy coaxed by T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) to join a group of former Nazis living in South America, a group whose leaders include Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), with whom Alicia has a history. Hitchcock keeps the sense of dread high as Alicia embarks on a mission that takes her deeper into Alexander’s world than she imagined she’d have to go, but the film’s drama comes just as much from the tension between her and Devlin, whose love for her is complicated by his professional obligation to put her in danger and push her into the arms of another man. (Available to stream on Tubi.)

6. The Manchurian Candidate (1962)

Based on a novel by Richard Condon, The Manchurian Candidate takes accounts of American soldiers being brainwashed during the Korean War to a nightmarish extreme via the story of a politically connected war hero (Laurence Harvey) who’s been programmed as an assassin by communist forces. John Frankenheimer fills the film with a Cold War–era sense that anyone could be the enemy — even, thanks to a chilling turn by Angela Lansbury, one’s own mother. But it’s Frank Sinatra, in one of his best performances, who embodies the exhaustion of the times, playing a weary, traumatized soldier who discovers he still has a role to play in a war that never really ended. Also worth seeing: Jonathan Demme’s 2004 remake, which revisits the story through a post-9/11 prism. (Available to stream on Prime Video and Pluto TV.)

5. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)

John le Carré’s densely plotted novels can be tricky to condense into feature-length films, which may explain why they’ve sometimes had better luck on TV than on the big screen (see: The Night Manager, The Little Drummer Girl, and this 1974 novel’s previous adaptation as a 1979 mini-series starring Alec Guinness). This Tomas Alfredson adaptation demands close attention. The film that brilliantly captures the crisscrossed loyalties and hidden agendas of le Carré’s fiction — and the ways they are more likely to play out in the dull, institutional buildings of postwar Britain than in glamorous locales. Also brilliant: Gary Oldman’s performance as George Smiley, le Carré’s signature hero, an unglamorous man in an unhappy marriage who’s become alienated from the job his extraordinary mind allows him to perform better than anyone else. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

4. The Conversation (1974)

If either could let their guards down, le Carré’s Smiley could doubtlessly have long, meaningful conversations about the personal costs of spying with Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), the protagonist of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation. A surveillance expert with a particular gift for audio work, Caul takes on the challenging job of recording a couple in an open space. But he soon finds success comes with consequences when the implications of what he’s recorded start haunting him, stirring his own fear of being watched, underscoring his profound alienation, and reminding him that the soul refuses to stay silent. Coppola shot The Conversation in the break between The Godfather and its sequel, a period in which he could seemingly do no wrong. Yet one of The Conversation’s most striking qualities is how little it resembles Coppola’s gangster masterpieces, trading epic sweep and classic grandeur for a tight focus and experimental flourishes — all while exploring the damage done to a man who, in the process of probing others’ lives, has come to realize the profundity of his own loneliness. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

3. From Russia With Love (1963)

The best James Bond film is also something of a dead end. Connery’s second outing as the superspy is more grounded than both its predecessor and the sequels to come, teaming Bond up with a female Russian agent (Italian actress Daniela Bianchi, overdubbed by Barbara Jefford) to outwit the evil SPECTRE in Turkey. It’s similar in tone to Fleming’s early novels, a spy story whose more outrageous elements — dig those switchblade shoes with poison blades! — are kept in check by a tough, bare-knuckled approach and a committed, unwinking performance from Connery. Goldfinger would take the series on a different, and highly entertaining, path just one film later, but From Russia With Love suggests it might have found just as much success staying a little closer to the world we know. (Available to rent on Prime Video and Apple TV.)

2. Black Book (2006)

Dutch director Paul Verhoeven’s earliest memories involve falling bombs. Born in Amsterdam and raised in the Hague when it served as German headquarters during World War II, Verhoeven grew up in a country torn apart by war. “Because I was so young when war broke out,” he told HuffPost in 2015, “seeing fighting and bombing and ruins and grenades and dead bodies and planes going down in flames seemed like the norm.” It’s not hard to make a connection between that upbringing and a career filled with images of casual brutality, but it’s unfair to suggest that Verhoeven ever depicted violence as normal. The shock of Verhoeven’s films comes less from the graphic violence — though, sure, that can be plenty shocking — than the ways in which violence can be made casual, even acceptable, be it by greed, war, or institutional approval. It’s as if he’d spent a lifetime wondering how the world he grew up in could have been allowed to happen in the first place.

Black Book was Verhoeven’s first Dutch film after a couple of decades in Hollywood, and it’s a less-than-sentimental journey back to the times and place that made him. Carice van Houten stars as Rachel, a Jewish woman who survives a massacre at the hands of the SS that kills the rest of her family. Falling in with the Dutch Resistance, she agrees to go undercover in an attempt to undermine the Nazis. In the confusion of violence and betrayal that follows, Rachel finds some of her assumptions challenged and her life imperiled. As in Notorious, much of the tension comes from Rachel’s fears that she’ll become lost in the cover story, and the acceptance that immoral acts can find their way into even the most righteous cause. It’s a tale of gray shades spattered in red, alternately depicting espionage as thrilling and sexy, and as a harrowing pursuit that puts spies in constant danger of losing their lives and souls. It eschews formula, but it’s the quintessence of a fluid genre that can play host to an astounding variety of stories. (Available to stream on Tubi.)

1. North by Northwest (1959)

Photo: Everett Collection

The platonic ideal that all light-footed spy movies aspire to emulate, Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest gave him his biggest canvas yet to explore the theme of an innocent man attempting to outrun wrongful accusations and sinister forces. Here a case of mistaken identity sends an unsuspecting advertising agent, played by Cary Grant, on a journey across the United States (and, eventually, into the arms of Eva Marie Saint). The plot revolves around a classic Hitchcock MacGuffin: a roll of microfilm, a perfunctory narrative device that perfectly illustrates how spy stories are often really about everything but what everyone’s chasing after. The film offers some never-topped set pieces, but Hitchcock makes them serve his interest in what happens when characters find themselves stripped of everything that makes them feel safe and comfortable. More than the terrifying plane, it’s the image of Grant looking dapper and terrified in a sharp gray suit that makes the film’s famous crop-duster scene work so well. This is a master working in top form from start to finish to create a film that’s been much-imitated but never topped. (Available to stream on Tubi.)",vulture
https://vulture.com,Deal or No Deal Island Recap: You Get What You Give,https://www.vulture.com/article/deal-or-no-deal-island-recap-season-2-episode-11.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 02:00:10 GMT","Once again, the Black Widow has been squashed. Fresh off a deliciously diabolical run on last year’s The Traitors, Parvati Shallow came to Deal or No Deal Island to eat up the competition “like little gummy bears” — and for a while, it worked. Week after week, Parv managed to secure her immunity from elimination while building the game’s strongest alliance, The Family. But in the game’s penultimate episode, backed into a corner and forced to face the banker, she cut a bad deal and sent herself home. That’s the problem with becoming one of the biggest stars in reality TV: The more powerful you get, the less inclined people feel to help you out.

Part of the appeal of DONDI is its willingness to pit normies against reality royalty like Parvati and Australian Survivor “Golden God” David Genat. Now, with only the finale remaining, the show seems to have proven the thesis that seasoned champs really do have one over on the little guy. Big Brother’s infamous Dr. Will Kirby might’ve gone home relatively early, but our other two familiar faces, Parv and David, made it to the final four. Ordinary people do have one advantage, though, and that’s their sense of camaraderie. At the end of the day, it’s far easier to convince ourselves to work with fellow struggling students and stupid-email-job doers in the trenches than it is to hand another win to someone who’s already taken home a massive cash prize.

How fitting, then, that DONDI’s only remaining reality winner is David, who’s spent the game cosplaying as a buff, unassuming bloke from Australia. Alongside him in the Final Three were C.K. and Lete, and in the end, the game might’ve come down to how forgiving our most recently jilted normie, Phillip, was feeling.

David was in a privileged but tough spot this week — forced to decide whether to let his work wife, Parv, play Deal or No Deal like she wanted or to make someone else roll the dice with their fate instead. The last time he had to make this choice, he overruled his “son” Dickson, who wanted to play, and watched him get sent home. This time, David made the opposite choice but got the same outcome. Parvati made a bad deal, thus ending another run as the “Black Widow.” Where do we think we’ll see her next? Personally, I’m hoping for Dancing With the Stars. With her intensity, I’m convinced she’d crush a tango.

For now, though, this means that “The Family” is in shambles, and only the patriarch remains. (Typical!) But with more than $10 million on the line, this week’s excursion still came down to relationships — which did not bode well for C.K., who’s managed to alienate pretty much everyone at one point or another.

Each season, Survivor assembles a jury of recently eliminated contestants. On DONDI, the fresh departures showed up to either help or sabotage their former competitors as they attempted to cross a bridge full of obstacles, collecting unmarked cases along the way. Two alumni stood on each platform, where they could either provide helpful intel, laugh as the finalists struggled, or actively work against them. Whoever took the longest to cross the bridge would automatically go home, and the person with the highest case values would win the chance to play for the final case — worth more than $10 million. (Sorry, just one second — I’m wiping the drool and tears off my keyboard.)

Obviously, alliances are crucial to this challenge, but so is trust. With unmarked cases on the line, the people in charge of communicating their values had the opportunity to be very sneaky. This would not be a problem for someone like Lete, who never let anyone forget what an honest player she was, but needless to say, C.K. had a rougher time.

Lete went first, and for the most part, everyone wanted to help. Phil obviously pointed her right to his highest-value case, and after demanding that Lete convince her to help, Parv guided her as she built a bridge out of planks of wood. La Shell was not quite as helpful as Phil and told Lete which case not to pick, while Dr. Will helped her toss ropes with monkey’s fists at the end across the platform to create a pulley system to yank herself across. On the final platform, Seychelle jumped to help Lete cross, and although Dickson tried to play coy, you just knew he’d guide his former “island girlfriend” to his highest-value case. After all, once you’ve exchanged friendship bracelets, it’s forever.

The funniest round of this challenge was always going to be C.K., and she did not disappoint. People do NOT like her, and it’s not bullying because she deserves it. She’s spent weeks screwing people over, double dealing, and even got caught cheating in a challenge. As tired as this saying might be in our current era, this week was clearly the “Find Out” stage in C.K.’s “Fuck Around and Find Out” cycle. She was toast and she knew it, but that didn’t mean we couldn’t savor every smirk from a former competitor along the way.

On the first platform, Seychelle sets the tone beautifully by forcing C.K. to grovel, agreeing to help her, then doing nothing anyway. Honestly, that’s what C.K. gets for thinking Seychelle, who just recently called her “nothing but a cheat with a flat ass, baby,” would actually lift a finger to help her. If there’s a God on this earth, we’ll see Seychelle on another show before the year is over.

On the second platform, Phil got similarly petty, asking C.K., “Are you going to trust that I treated you better than you treated me?” He deliberately pointed her to the high-value case, knowing she’d never trust him. Indeed, she chose another, once again sealing her own fate. Even La Shell decided to be less than helpful on the third platform, forcing C.K. to pick her own case and ask her if she thought it was a good or bad idea. The only person who really helped C.K. was Dr. Will, who declined at first but then seemingly took pity on her. Who knew that such a softie lurked beneath that L.A. vampire exterior?

David mostly did okay in this game, but Dr. Will forced him to reveal which show he’d competed on before, which briefly threatened David’s relationship with Dickson, who overheard and wondered why David would keep such a secret. Luckily for David, the answer is both obvious and understandable, and Dickson will clearly be his biggest fan for life, so it didn’t matter — he still gave him his highest-value case. Dr. Will, meanwhile, helped David build his bridge until the final plank, which he threw into the water for a laugh. I hate to say it, but I think after all the complaining about him, I’m Dr. Will–pilled now.

Really, the only threat to David’s game came from Phil, who hit him with the same question as he had C.K.: “Do you trust that I have been better for you than you have for me?” I’ll be honest: As funny and appropriate as this question might have been the first time, it felt a little obnoxious and self-righteous the second time. Then again, Phil’s downfall in this game was taking things too personally at the expense of being strategic, so this does track.

In the end, C.K. obviously got the slowest time by several minutes — ending her DONDI run with the automatic and unceremonious exit she deserves. (That said, I do wish that we could have seen her case values, because I bet they were even more abysmal.) David and Lete were neck and neck, and ultimately, this game will all come down to which case Phil gave the guy who sent him home. Despite their beef, David trusted the case that Phil picked — which, based on what Phil did with C.K., might have been the right move. But if Phil had a different trick up his sleeve, Lete might’ve just won this thing. Curse the DONDI gods for making us wait a week to find out!

Island Power Rankings

Lete spent weeks at the top of my leaderboard, and in this final power ranking, I’ve decided to follow my heart and manifest the win I wish to see in the world. Team Lete, all the way! David has played a great game, and while part of me suspects Phil stuck to his honorable strategy, there’s always the chance he just screwed him over. For the sake of my girl Lete, I’m hoping he did. David already won once. In the Age of the Female Banker, we deserve another female DONDI champion.

See you all next week!",vulture
https://vulture.com,Adolescence Doesn’t Have the Answer,https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-ending-explained-finale-mystery-analysis.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:25:52 GMT","Photo: Netflix

Spoilers follow for all four episodes of Adolescence, now streaming on Netflix.

Adolescence isn’t exactly a mystery, since the identity of the killer is never in question. The Netflix limited series, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, opens on a raid of a North England home where the police arrest a 13-year-old boy for the murder of a classmate. Each of Adolescence’s four episodes, all directed by Phillip Barantini, are structured as one-shot takes, and so the first chapter unfolds as a meticulous accounting of what happens as the boy, Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), is processed at the police station: fingerprinted, medically evaluated, and assigned a lawyer. As the camera coolly observes the system at work, it lingers on Jamie’s vulnerability and terror; we’re reminded that this is still a boy who wet himself when the police broke down his door, who’s still young enough to be instructed by his father, Eddie (Graham), to eat his police-supplied cornflakes. Genre expectations are such that you might expect the series to linger within the question of whether Jamie did it, but by the end of the first episode, Adolescence removes any ambiguity. His interrogation by officers Luke Bascombe (Ashley Walters) and Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) culminates in the revelation of security footage that captures him stabbing his classmate, a girl named Katie Leonard, multiple times with a kitchen knife. So, Jamie is undoubtedly the killer, and to the extent there’s a mystery, it’s the slippery question of why.

With this early reveal, Adolescence makes its intent clear. The series is less a procedural crime drama than a social portrait diving headfirst into the simmering cultural anxiety around boys and young men in the age of incels, male dislocation, and toxic podcasts. Thorne and Graham’s script unfolds as a progression of set pieces that dip into specific windows in the long aftermath of Jamie’s arrest: The second episode follows Bascombe and Frank as they interview his classmates a few days after the police raid; the third drops in on an incarcerated Jamie a few months later; and the final episode takes place about a year after the arrest, focusing on the Miller family as they struggle to move on with their lives. But within that chronological structure, Adolescence abstains from any strict sociological linearity: Though we’re given some broader context for Jamie’s actions — a mixture of cyberbullying, hormonal distress, and online influence — Thorne and Graham avoid sketching out too specific of a model for why something like this happens and what, if anything, we can do about it. This is reasonable, given the sheer amorphousness of the problem. To what extent can we attribute this to the so-called “manosphere”? To social media and the internet more generally? To a broader misogynistic culture? To the natural cruelty of people, young and old, which exists with and without digital acceleration? The possible explanatory layers overwhelm, and so there’s an honesty to how the series opts to focus on the devastation instead, fading out on the image of the Miller family torn apart and Eddie breaking down on Jamie’s bed.

Adolescence’s explicit interest in incel culture gives it a timely distinction. Fear and anxiety around the subject isn’t particularly new onscreen, but works that seriously grapple with the subject are relatively uncommon. Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling builds up to laughably wacky reveal that Harry Styles was an incel all along, and Todd Phillips’s Joker is often derided as a shallow incel-flavored Taxi Driver knockoff that transposes its anti-hero onto the superhero industrial complex. Adolescence, which voyages well beyond the superficiality of those two films, marks an interesting moment when pop culture appears more willing to directly grapple with the violent specter of red-pilled young men. Last year saw the release of Rejection, Tony Tulathimutte’s short-story collection that builds and expands upon his viral 2019 short story, “The Feminist,” which plays out as a (Vantablack funny) psychological depiction of a try-hard male feminist who drifts deep into incel radicalization. At this very moment, The Pitt is in the middle of paying off its own Chekhov’s Young Adult Male, as emergency-room doctors grapple with the choice of preemptively reporting a young man who made disturbing social-media posts and a list of women he wants to hurt, which runs the risk of ruining his life, or finding some other way to help — an ethical dilemma that comes to a head when a mass shooting is called in.

But Adolescence isn’t really an exploration of incel culture in and of itself, in large part because it never properly plumbs the perspective of Jamie or anybody his age. Rather, the series mirrors the position of its adults, universally stuck on the outside looking in as they try to wrap their heads around Jamie’s interiority. We viewers are primarily situated within the point of view of the officers, the schoolteachers, the therapist, the father. You can sense this roughly in the first episode, where the roving camera trades off between focusing on Eddie and different facets of the police station, and detect it concretely in the second, which follows Bascombe and Frank as they search Jamie’s school for clues that may lead to the murder weapon and a motive. The officers bumble around for answers, clueless and repeatedly dunked on by students until Bascombe’s son, Adam (Amari Bacchus), finally pulls him aside. “You’re not reading what they’re doing,” he says, before explaining his cohorts’ social-media symbology to his impatient father.

The distance between generations is emphasized in this episode, with the school depicted as an unruly wilderness that Bascombe and Frank move through as if it’s a war zone. (This is where Adolescence’s use of the oner briefly evokes Children of Men.) “These kids are impossible,” says one teacher. “What am I supposed to do?” Between the haplessness of the adults and the chaos barely contained by the institution, Thorne and Graham seem to lay down another thread of possible explanation: School conditions are so crowded and chaotic, to a point where Bascombe compares it to a “holding pen,” that you can’t help but see why a boy on the edge of actual violence might be overlooked. Again, Adolescence makes this observation and lets it hang there, much as it does with every other explanatory thread. Bascombe’s arc ends with him making an effort to reconnect with his son, a suggestion that more engaged parenting may well be the solution we need. But in keeping with Adolescence’s intent to distantly observe, it’s barely ever more than a suggestion.

While Adolescence doesn’t break much ground with incel interiority, it does feel genuinely novel in its commitment to steering into adolescent male sexuality. One of the more striking beats in the first episode is a moment where Bascombe and Frank show Jamie printouts of his own Instagram posts featuring female models with innuendo-laced comments. “How do you feel about women, Jamie?” Bascombe asks. “Do you have a girlfriend? If you did, would you want her to look like these women?” The line of questioning is uneasy, not just because we’re watching a 13-year-old boy being confronted with expressions of his own underdeveloped and unfocused sexuality, but because those expressions are contextualized as evidence pointing toward his potential for violence against women. The framing is literally correct but nevertheless tenuous: For better or worse, you can imagine countless other boys his age doing similar things, and it’s hard not to wonder whether 13 is old enough to begin attributing misogyny as a trait.

This thrum of uneasiness further escalates in the third episode, where Jamie is visited by Briony (Erin Doherty), a therapist assigned to evaluate his mental health prior to trial. This is Adolescence’s most interesting set piece, as it labors to show a Jamie deepened in his anger by his time in the detention system. The young Owen Cooper oscillates between projecting emotions we fear from men (rage, entitlement, aggression) and reminders that Jamie is still a 13-year-old who’s now stuck ever deeper in developmental confusion, all bundled up in an interaction where he displays some adolescent sexual desire for his adult interlocutor. It’s an utterly fascinating episode that’s make-or-break for the series as a whole, and though it doesn’t entirely stick the landing, it is gutsy enough to underscore Adolescence’s ambitions to gaze into dicey, sensitive territory.

The true mystery of Adolescence is a genuinely difficult one: What do we do about boys and young men? That a productive answer continues to be elusive underscores the series’ defining feeling, which is a mixture of the eternal parental fear over whether you’ll ever be able to do enough, and the generational fear over how modernity has unknowably but fundamentally altered the natural dangers of boyhood. Adolescence is a work of social realism, but it also captures the cosmic horror lingering in the background within the experience of raising a boy. The series’ final episode, its most overtly emotional, sticks with the Miller parents as they’re tortured with questions of what went wrong — and how they failed as parents. “He never left his room,” says his mother, Manda (Christine Tremarco). “He’d come home, slam the door, straight up the stairs on the computer.” Eddie replies, by saying that you can’t keep an eye on your kids all the time, but he, too, is ravaged by doubt. He wonders if he could have done better setting Jamie up with sports. Did his abuse by his own father pass down some anger to Jamie? The fear you’re left with is the gnawing sense that there are, ultimately, no answers, and that the fate of the children you love is never fully in your hands.",vulture
https://vulture.com,‘Severance’: Merritt Wever Explains Gretchen,https://www.vulture.com/article/severance-merritt-wever-gretchen-dylan-g-breakup-s2e9.html,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 08:00:05 GMT","Photo: Apple TV+

Spoilers ahead for Severance season two, episode nine, “The After Hours.”

Severance season two has been chock-full of loopy surprises, from Helena Eagan’s deception and Irving’s sacrifice to departure episodes centered on Mark’s missing wife, Gemma, and his Innie’s old boss, Harmony Cobel. But through it all, possibly the most affecting and human story line is the blossoming yet doomed relationship between Innie Dylan G. and his Outie’s wife, Gretchen George (Merritt Wever). In this season’s penultimate episode, Gretchen breaks the news to her husband that she kissed his Innie, leaving him hurt and betrayed. Soon after, she breaks his Innie’s heart by rejecting his paper-ring marriage proposal.

Despite how sweet and strange it can be to watch Gretchen connect with a different version of the husband she knows and loves, Wever has no illusions about the nature of this complicated love triangle, calling the scenario “emotionally grotesque.” “It’s a horrific bind, because if her husband quits, this man ceases to be,” Wever says. “If he doesn’t quit, this man stays down here in this underworld in pain, and she can’t see him.”

How did the role of Gretchen come to you, and had you seen Severance before?

I was on a job in L.A., and I got one of those “You should expect a text from Ben Stiller” messages, as one does. He reached out before I had seen the show. I had dinner plans that night, and resented them because it meant I couldn’t watch the whole series in one go. When they sent me the first two scenes of Gretchen and Dylan in episode three, I liked that there was a lot of room to play things instead of just say things. I’d been working on dialogue lately on projects where you were saying the thing that was happening, and there wasn’t a ton of room to breathe or sit in the material. In this instance, I liked the water I was being asked to swim in.

I remember saying, “Can you give me an idea of where this will go?” I know what it’s like to be invited onto a project and really love it, but then get to work and find that the thing you’re being asked to do isn’t really the thing you want to be doing. They sent me a two-page document that was “This is what you can expect.” In retrospect, it was very generous of them, given that the show is so discreet about what’s coming.

How did you develop your chemistry with Zach Cherry in two different forms?

We didn’t do a lot of talking about it. We both just showed up and did it. There was one little rehearsal when I was coming in for a camera test. But I think we just read it twice, and it felt like we were there with each other. I like working with him so much. You never know what it’s going to be like to work with someone, and why sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.

When you first meet Dylan’s Innie, you have to balance this sense of familiarity with the politeness of meeting a new person. How did you handle that?

That’s what I responded to when they sent me the scenes. There was so much going on. When I watched those scenes over, though, I was also like, Oh yeah, it’s a lot of two people sitting and talking to each other, which can be challenging. At one point, the scene in episode three started to lag, and Ben had to tell us to go faster and louder. It reminded me of what happens sometimes when you’re rehearsing a play. The thing that’s happening is such a big deal that you feel, as an actor, How could I ever go faster? I have to experience every second. That’s what it feels like when you’re acting the scene, but when you’re the castmate sitting in the audience during tech, watching, you’re like, Yeah, it’s true. Faster and louder. It’s simple as that.

Unpack Gretchen’s costuming for me. I noticed that you had your hair down in her second meeting with Dylan G., which feels looser.

She wants to make herself pretty. I remember, when I spoke to one of your colleagues, bringing up Sarah Edwards, the costume designer, because I’d worked with her on Michael Clayton. She’s one of the best I’ve ever worked with. On Severance, she did a lot of the work for me. It was wonderful to be shepherded into that world, aesthetically, and the outside-versus-inside world. I wasn’t saying a lot during our fittings, and I looked up at her face once, and I realized she was worried that I wasn’t talking because I was unhappy. I said, “No, no, no, Sarah, no notes.”

I’m not sure how much you even get to see them, but there’s this amazing pair of boots she wears in episode nine. There was even a line in the very early iteration of the episode-three scene that referenced Dylan and Gretchen’s favorite movie, and it got cut, but she was able to bring that feel and aesthetic of that film into what she was wearing. For episode nine, we were choosing what dress she would wear to go see him at Lumon, and we were choosing between one that was a solid color and one with little flowers. I think in episode four, Dylan’s first line is talking about the sky. So we went with the one with little flowers, because we felt like we should give him more to lose. He’s losing the outside world, the world at large, so let’s give him some flowers. He got a taste of the outside, in a way, so let’s give him more to lose, even subliminally. She was on the same page when it came to thoughtful details like that.

What is Gretchen drawn to when she keeps returning to visit Dylan’s Innie?

She’s meeting the man she first fell in love with, the man who first fell in love with her. I can’t imagine how enticing that must be. When she tells Outie Dylan that something happened with his Innie, I don’t think it’s because she’s trying to blow something up. I think she’s weirdly trying to save her marriage. In the two previous episodes, we’d shot the Innie scenes first and the Outie scenes second. For episode nine, we shot the Outie scene first and then the Innie scene. The Outie scene ends with her begging her husband to stay, and he walks out the door, and the Innie scene ends with him on one knee, begging her to stay, and she walks out the door. I remember standing there, with Zach on one knee, and thinking it was horrific what had happened. She’s getting the thing she wants from the man she wants it from, but he’s down here. She finally has it, and she can’t keep it. She covers her face because she doesn’t want to see what she’s done to him, and she doesn’t want him to see her. She doesn’t want to look or be looked at.

I’m struck by the fact that Innie Dylan and Gretchen can only have so much of a happy ending. She can never really choose the Innie, because he can’t ever overtake the Outie Dylan.

It’s a horrific bind, because if her husband quits, this man ceases to be. If he doesn’t quit, this man stays down here in this underworld in pain, and she can’t see him.

I remember in episode six, she’s very much the one who instigates the kiss. I remember Zach trying to explain why he was letting it happen, instead of being the person who makes it happen. He said, “I don’t think he’s ever kissed anyone before.” I remember thinking, She’s harming this person. Whether she knows it or wants to be, there’s such a power discrepancy. There’s something, not in their nature but in their circumstance, childlike about their position. I was glad that there was a mutual understanding of that. It means that what happens in episode nine matters. The way they edited that sequence, too, gave it a kind of gravity that maybe the original scene didn’t end with — the way they cut it together with Mark and Helly. It foreshadows that this is going to have emotional consequences.

It does often feel like Gretchen speaks to Dylan like he’s a child. And he says things like “I kind of like the hugging,” which is a very childlike formulation.

When she first shows up in episode three, it’s because she has to talk to her husband about, “Can you please keep your job?” It’s a very weird line to toe. It’s almost parental. I don’t think I did that on purpose, but I think it’s born of the strange conditions of his life and employment. It mirrors this paternalistic orientation of the company.

I knew what was coming and was very aware she was going to suffer the consequences of harming this person. She has put him down on one knee and is going to break his heart and leave. The show is part Star Trek, part Greek myth, with a dash of the importance of labor solidarity and late-stage capitalism. There’s a lot of things in the water. One of the things I appreciated about the first season was that they did a good job at balancing the concept with the heart. If you don’t have the humanity to balance the ideas, it doesn’t mean anything.",vulture
https://indiewire.com,'Snow White' 2025 Review: Live-Action Remake Is Sweet and Song-Filled,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/snow-white-2025-review-live-action-remake-1235104411/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","If you’re looking for a laundry list of the controversies that have beset Disney’s latest live-action remake, the Marc Webb-directed “Snow White,” we’ll direct you to that subsection on the film’s Wikipedia page and then move swiftly onward because none of that really applies to the task at hand. Put more bluntly: as a remarkably sensible audience member said to me at the conclusion of our screening, “After all that?”

Yes, after all that, Webb’s Rachel Zegler-starring film is good. Not great, but certainly good, spirited and sweet and filled with wonderful songs and some canny updates to extremely dated material. And while that might not be good enough for some potential audience members, let’s be honest: There are just some people who were never going to loosen up to a “colorblind” fairy tale or one that dared ask, “Hey, what if a woman could like, do stuff, too?” If it hurts you to see an updated version of a story you loved — if your childhood is ruined because of the existence of this film or the new “Little Mermaid” or the new “Aladdin” or whichever new spin on literal fairy tales has so wounded you — that’s fine. You don’t have to watch. That’s not mean; that’s the honest truth.

But for those film fans willing to embrace the most obvious updates and upgrades to a story over 200 years old, “Snow White” will likely please. That’s not to say every choice made here (even some of the “controversial” ones!) sticks the landing. Wherever you fall on the debate surrounding the cast of the title character’s seven best friends, those magical pals sure look awkward in their final form (heigh hoooooo, Uncanny Valley animation!) plunked into a world that’s otherwise photorealistic and lit to high heaven. Loosey-goosey backstory doesn’t help (they’re magical? kind of?), and I’d love for anyone to explain to me where the hell the tons of gems they mine every single day go, but fairy tales do require a suspension of disbelief, so we’re willing to back off on the demand for P&L statements.

Mostly, all those classic elements are still in place: the lovely princess, the dead parents, the evil stepmother, the magic mirror, and the poison apple. This is still “Snow White,” and it’s still Disney, so you better believe they’re going to play the hits. In this version, written by “Secretary” and “The Girl on the Train” screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, Snow White (Zegler) is the sole heir of the kind of kingdom that could really only exist in make-believe (they rely on their agricultural bounty to flourish, but they also all live on a rocky outcropping without a field in sight? No, no, we’ll stop with the practical concerns). Her parents are so awesome their character names are literally “Good King” (Hadley Fraser) and “Good Queen” (Lorena Andrea), and the ruling life, well, rules.

‘Snow White’ Disney

We know this because the trio loves to sing together, and everyone’s clothes (even the “farmers”!) are colorful and bright. Sometimes, they all eat giant pies together that Snow White bakes! There are woodland creatures, well, around, and they seem happy too! But when Good Queen dies (the victim of the terrible scourge of voiceover exposition), darkness creeps into everyone’s lives. And when Evil Queen (no, she never has another name) arrives, portrayed by Gal Gadot having an absolute whale of a time chewing the scenery, we all know where this is going. Unaware, however? Good King, who falls for the temptress, promptly follows her tip to fight a far-off battle, and never returns.

Evil Queen and her best pal Magic Mirror (voiced by Patrick Page) are pleased as punch with the whole thing, and when Gadot is not imploring the reflective surface to tell her how hot she is, she’s making young Snow White’s life miserable. Eventually, it becomes fairly (hehe) clear (tehehehe) that Evil Queen’s read on what being “the fairest of all” is woefully skewed. While her take on “fair” has to do with beauty, young Snow White is blossoming into someone both beautiful and just. Ah, felled by homographs!

Just as Snow White is starting to think she needs to do something to save her now-extremely sad kingdom (Evil Queen turned all the farmers into soldiers, no one wears color anymore, also everyone sort of thinks Snow White is dead?) and beat back the real baddie (self-doubt), a dashing stranger (Andrew Burnap) arrives on the scene. He’s stealing potatoes from the queen, but this Robin Hood-esque bandit isn’t all terrible. He and his merry band of forest scamps still believe in the king and serve him. Perhaps Snow White is into that?

‘Snow White’ Giles Keyte

This all sparks something important in Snow White and thus something the Evil Queen loathes. Enter still more classic Snow White lore: The queen instructs her loyal Huntsman (Ansu Kabia) to take Snow White to the forest (to pick apples, naturally) and kill her. But Huntsman, like many other citizens we meet along the way, can’t quite bring himself to commit such an evil act. After all, he remembers what life was like before, and wasn’t that better? After he frees a terrified Snow White, she runs deeper into the forest, where she encounters still more peppy woodland creatures (as ever, her natural animal husbandry is used as a quick way to sell her pure-hearted spirit) and eventually a quite charming cottage that houses seven very strange small men.

This all sounds familiar, does it not? In between some classic songs (“Heigh-Ho” and “Whistle While You Work” remain charming), new jams from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul offer a little punch-up, from Snow White’s “I want” song “Waiting on a Wish” (fine, does its job) to Evil Queen’s hilariously evil anthem (“All Is Fair”), all the way up to the standout “Princess Problems,” which is clever and self-effacing in ways that these live-action remakes can tend to miss.

‘Snow White’ DISNEY

If there’s a quibble to be had with the film — and a real quibble, not one about the film’s casting or some production photos taken entirely out of context or some bird-brained defense of the original story in which the prince carried Snow White’s dead body around with him wherever he went until the poisoned apple was dislodged from her throat and she suddenly woke up — it’s that it can often feel as if all its various parts and players exist in a slightly different film. Zegler’s Snow White is in the more straightforward and good-natured fairy tale, the Dwarfs in a literally (and figuratively) more cartoonish version of that, Gadot in a wildly hammy villain story, and Jonathan in some sort of “Into the Woods” take on the material.

It doesn’t always fit seamlessly together, but it’s far more entertaining than that might lead on. This is a spirited and sweet spin on classic material that deserves kudos for its balance of necessary updates and affection for the old ways. Mostly, it’s a reminder of what’s actually worth considering and critiquing: the final product. This one is good.

Grade: B-

Walt Disney Pictures will release “Snow White” in theaters on Friday, March 21.

https://indiewire.com,Trump’s DEI Attacks Are Creating Real-Time Destruction for Filmmakers of Color,https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/trump-dei-attacks-destruction-filmmakers-of-color-1235104122/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT","As the Trump Administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs continue to be litigated in the courts, the damage is already being done for independent creators.

“We are most certainly feeling it, and it’s been quite disheartening,” said filmmaker Tommy Oliver, CEO of Confluential Films and founder and chairman of Black Love, Inc.. He’s backed projects such as “Fancy Dance,” “Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project,” and “The First Purge” director Gerard McMurray’s upcoming horror film “Goons.”

“A lot of the investors are spooked,” said Oliver. “During this time of political agita, coupled with the fact our industry is already in a place of disruption, it’s gotten more difficult.”

“There is a lot of uncertainty,” said independent producer Avril Speaks (“Jinn,” “Dotty & Soul”). “I have been having conversations with other producers who are trying to get their projects out, and everybody has that question: Who is going to be bold enough to help us tell our stories? When I read in the trades that companies are looking for projects that are ‘more commercial,’ ‘Middle America,’ or ‘non-coastal,’ or something along those lines, we can see the writing on the walls.

“As a producer, I don’t know how we’re going to move our projects forward,” added Speaks. “I’m not feeling the reassurance and confidence from this industry right now that these stories will be OK in their hands.”

Speaks compares her experience to pitching projects in 2020-2021 after the murder of George Floyd —when everyone was “rolling out the black squares” on social media — to the current moment.

“There were lots of companies reaching out and one-on-one conversations, but now, I have meetings on the unscripted side, and their eyes dart around,” she said. “It’s not even feigned interest; you can almost see the fears in their eyes.”

On the fiction side, she said, “All they want is commercial, commercial, commercial. If I start to pitch about a queer drama with a Black lead, they’ll be like, ‘Wait a second now.’”

Many producers speak to conditions that were shifting even before Trump took office, such as the moving or exiting of “people of color who had decent positions of power,” said Oliver. “But those senior executives of color are no longer there. And when you don’t have those people in the rooms, it’s harder to convince people that these stories are important to the culture.”

In Hollywood, 2023 saw the departure of Karen Horne, senior VP of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Warner Bros. Discovery. She oversaw and implemented several pipeline programs that aimed to uplift underrepresented creators, including WB’s Reframed: Next Gen Narratives shorts series.

Disney senior VP and Chief Diversity Officer Latondra Newton left the studio in June 2023, after 6 years in the role. (In October 2023, Tinisha Agramonte was hired for the same role.) Last fall, Marva Smalls, executive VP and Global Head of Inclusion at Paramount, moved to a new role in the office of the CEO. These entertainment companies are among the many — including Amazon Studios — that have shuttered, tweaked, or renamed their diversity divisions and let go of staff.

“I’ve seen this pendulum switch back and forth several times over the years,” said Horne. “And I’m hopeful that it centers itself, because the bottom line is that this work is good for the business and bottom line.”

Others are worried about the future of these programs as their colleagues struggle to remain committed to the work.

“They are totally dismantling divisions within our business that people spent entire careers building,” said producer Deniese Davis, CEO of Reform Media and co-founder of Issa Rae’s production company, ColorCreative. “Now, who are our champions on the inside; who is left at the table supporting underrepresented storytelling?”

Davis sees the entertainment business losing gains made over the last 20 years “when people were just starting to expand opportunities for underrepresented creators,” she said. “Coming off the back of the writers’ strike, there was already less work to be had, and then with DEI rolling back, there’s even less opportunities for them.

“It’s a trickle-down effect,” she said. “What I see DEI stand for is opportunities and allowing non-privileged people a way to get their foot into the door and to get your first staffing job. When you roll that back, how do you break in? These programs were one way you could gain access.”

“It’s very frustrating,” said filmmaker Razi Jafri, who participated in Disney and the Sundance Institute’s first Muslim Artist Fellowship. That program has since been renamed the Artist Fellowship and expanded to be “inclusive” to all entrants.

“I see other donors and grantees extremely worried about what they can do in terms of identifying what these programs and grants are for,” he said. “It’s taken a lot of work to get to this point, and it has had such a profound benefit, because you get films like ‘Moonlight’ and ‘The 40-Year-Old Version,’ and because of these diversity programs, you have this plethora of amazing talent and stories.”

Davis points to an ongoing program that ColorCreative has been able to maintain called Find Your People, which helps creatives of color build sustainable careers through networking. “We’re very proud that we’re still here, because we see these other labs diminishing everywhere else,” she said.

IndieWire spoke to several executives who suggested the industry has always been fundamentally racist and wary of stories by and for historically marginalized communities. The Trump Administration’s actions, along with financial contractions in the media space, provide gatekeepers a justification for pulling back on BIPOC storytelling.

Oliver said the current decisions don’t make any sense “unless their decision to [support DEI] in the first place wasn’t connected to why they were doing it in the first place,” he said. “If you stand for nothing, you fall for anything.”

Speaks also saw many DEI initiatives as merely “performative.” “The problems remain the problems,” she said. “As many companies that had DEI offices, there still weren’t enough people of color who could greenlight projects.” But now, “It’s infuriating because everyone is cowering and giving in because of the financial moment and they’re afraid they’re going to lose everything.”

Adrienne Becker, co-founder of Level Forward, which focuses on diverse projects like Monica Sorelle’s “Mountains” and Alex Heller’s “The Year Between,” also points to the overall stresses on independent films and media compounded by the Trump agenda.

“This weighs on all parts of the industry, from artists to craftspeople, to producers, financiers, and donors,” she said. “That hesitancy reinforces a dangerous scarcity mindset, setting off a chain reaction that suppresses every aspect of our business. But this applies to films dealing with themes of equity, identity, or climate, as well as romance or action films. Everything in this environment is now being evaluated through a politicized lens.”

Some still see opportunity for change. Carlos Gutierrez, founder and exec director of nonprofit Cinema Tropical, which presents Latin American cinema in the United States, said these problems are much the same “for Latinx filmmakers for a long time, because we have a whole system that is not welcoming to Latinx filmmakers in terms of validation and commercialization.”

For Gutierrez, “Now is a good opportunity to bring back the audience and the filmmakers back to the center and create ecosystems around that.” Inspired by the radical Third Cinema of the ’60s and ‘70s, Gutierrez said, “We need to democratize film exhibition, and I think the context is really ripe for doing something drastic.”

Gutierrez is a member of Distribution Advocates, a collective advocating for equity and transparency in film distribution. The collective’s co-founder, Karin Chien, sees “independent film shrinking into a space that works for people only with access and celebrity and privilege and that’s not the field that I chose to work in.”

She points to Distribution Advocates’ new $200,000 Marketing Innovations Film-ADE Fund as a new opportunity for filmmakers looking to work around the traditional gatekeepers. Applications for the program began last year, and the first round of grantee strategies was announced last November.

“The audience is still there,” said Oliver. “And if the demand is there, and the supply has decreased, that’s an opportunity, so we need to figure out how to bridge that gap.”

Level Forward’s Becker said filmmakers can’t be distracted by Trump’s bully pulpit. “We know half the country believes in stories that open people’s hearts and minds to one another and create a capacity to care and connect. I believe investors and funders are there, and they remain committed to these films,” she said. “We just have to work harder to connect with them. And if this environment is too fraught for one company or financier to come onto a project, that creates an opportunity for someone else to come in and make a profound difference for many.”

“Fear is not going to help us,” added Gutierrez. “When people start complying in advance, that’s one of the biggest problems right now, because it helps the other side. I do think we need to be optimistic,” he continues, “because optimism is a political tool.”

https://indiewire.com,Carey Mulligan Reflects on Her Very First Film Role in ‘Pride & Prejudice’: ‘It Was the Dream Job’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/carey-mulligan-first-film-role-pride-and-prejudice-1235110023/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:30:00 GMT","Twenty years after its theatrical release, Joe Wright’s luminous Jane Austen adaptation “Pride & Prejudice” continues to delight fans — we’re talking hand flex freaks, “a million times yes” devotees, and anyone who loves a romantic reunion in a dawn-lit field — and is preparing for a very well-received theatrical re-release next month.

That’s good news for fans, but perhaps even better news for some of its many wonderful cast members, including three-time Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan, who made her film debut in the feature as the delightfully ditzy fourth Bennet daughter Catherine (better known as Kitty).

During a recent interview with Mulligan in support of her latest role in the charming “The Ballad of Wallis Island” (out next week from Focus Features, and with much more to come from Mulligan on IndieWire in the coming days), I mentioned that a recent article sharing the news of the upcoming re-release of the film for its 20th anniversary was met with huge interest from our readers.

“What?,” a delighted Mulligan responded. “That’s so crazy. That’s crazy!”

Asked her memories of the gig, Mulligan (who was just 18 when she shot the film in 2004) was effusive. “I mean, it was the dream job,” she said. “I felt lucky at the time, obviously, but I look back now and think, ‘You lucky fucker, that you managed to land that as your first gig.’ It’s extraordinary. And then what a cast to have gotten to learn from. I was literally a student watching these unbelievable actors around me with zero responsibility, except I had to occasionally giggle. And even that, I just copied Jena Malone. Whatever Jena did, I would just do it.”

Malone, of course, played youngest Bennet sister Lydia (a character somehow even more ditzy than Kitty, and one whose romantic hijinks almost pull the entire clan into ruin). Mulligan and Malone appear in most scenes together, and have a fizzy chemistry that really worked for their parts.

Mulligan was also happy to recount her affection for some of her other co-stars, ticking through them with glee. “It was the first time I worked with [Rosamund] Pike, who became such a good friend and we’ve done three things together now, and I just think she’s the most extraordinary actress,” Mulligan said. “All these incredible people! Keira [Knightley] and Jena and Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench. I mean, to be in a film with Judi Dench for my first ever job out of the gate is nuts.”

And even Mulligan can’t deny the impact of the film’s iconic reunion scene, in which Knightley’s Lizzy Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen’s Mr. Darcy finally profess their love to each other in a miraculously lit British field.

“I think it’s the most beautiful film,” the actress said. “Matthew Macfadyen and Keira in that scene, are just, ugh, the most beautiful, beautiful, beautiful dynamic. I’m so proud that I got to be a tiny part of it. It’s amazing.”

Focus Features will re-release “Pride & Prejudice” starting Sunday, April 20, with special theatrical events taking place both on Sunday, April 20 and Wednesday, April 23 nationwide.

Focus Features will also release “The Ballad of Wallis Island” in limited theaters on Friday, March 28.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘The Electric State’ Is Most Expressive in How It Created Its Kitschy Robots,https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/the-electric-state-vfx-interview-robots-cosmo-netflix-1235104366/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:00:00 GMT","In Netflix’s “The Electric State,” the sci-fi adventure from Anthony and Joe Russo, Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt help renew a robot rebellion in an alternate version of the ’90s. The robots themselves are not exactly new, at least not in terms of looks. They share the kitschy design of the robots in the graphic novel by Simon Stålenhag on which the film is based. But there are 175 of them — which meant the film needed a prodigious ensemble of motion capture performers.

Led by motion choreographer/actor Terry Notary, the mo-cap team actually outnumbered the principal actors. “It was like a great casting call, trying to find the right characters for the mood of the film,” production designer Dennis Gassner (“Blade Runner 2049”) told IndieWire. “ And it took a lot of trial and error with the visual effects team to make it work.”

Mo-cap performance became critical to conveying the emotions of the sentient robots. Principally, there is Brown’s companion, Cosmo (voiced by Alan Tudyk), based on a cartoon character with a painted face; Pratt’s motormouth utility bot, Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie), who is able to change size; and Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson), the animatronic-looking leader of the rebellion.

However, the biggest challenge for production VFX supervisor Matthew Butler (“Ready Player One”) of Digital Domain was selecting the most appropriate capture technique. “ Because of the speed and adaptability that the brothers wanted to have, it made more sense to go with accelerometer-based sensor motion capture [from Xsens] instead of the more traditional optical motion capture,” Butler told IndieWire.

The performers wore suits with inertial sensors that provided acceleration to compute velocity and position. This allowed the filmmakers the freedom to capture the actors’ movements in real-world environments. “ That frees you up so that now they can be on the set without any complicated photogrammetry systems in place,” added Butler.

‘The Electric State‘ Netflix

Digital Domain (supervised by Joel Behrens) was the primary VFX studio, with ILM (supervised by Russell Earl) handling much of the epic battle at the end between the robots and industrialist Stanley Tucci’s army of drones. The most complex robot, though, was Cosmo, with his oversized head and unrealistic form. He needed to be solved before anything else, so Butler arranged an early traditional mo-cap test at Digital Domain for the Russo brothers with the help of animation director Piotr Karwas.

Fortunately, Karwas had a young daughter who was willing to act as Cosmo on the mo-cap stage. “ We wanted to have this innocent performance conveyed [by] Cosmo,” Butler said. “So we basically had her do some childlike performances, and we got that motion captured and applied it to a fairly crude proxy of Cosmo rendered through Unreal Engine. You had this crazy-looking object that now has all this beautiful performance and everybody was happy.”

But when they finally got the green light, panic started to set in about Cosmo. “There was still somewhat concern about his lack of dexterity,” continued Butler. “Not only has Cosmo got a big ball for the head but he can’t talk [though he conveys a projected consciousness] and he can’t gesticulate with his face because of a permanently painted grin. Everyone goes, ‘Maybe he should have eyebrows.’ We decided to honor the painted face, knowing a lot can be done with pantomime to express emotion, and the animators took that limitation as a challenge.”

Attention turned to the robot design, which was cartoony right down to the clunky boots. Butler told the directors that they needed to find a way of making him mechanically feasible. They consulted with UCLA and Boston Dynamics and learned how to keep Cosmo’s giant head from toppling over by sizing it down and adding pushrods, pistons, and stepper motors to his neck and elbows.

In one of the opening shots in Brown’s room, there’s a closeup of Cosmo’s feet, where you see counter-rotating ankle motors. “And we did this sort of gratuitous use of little LEDs everywhere and electrical cables,” Butler said. “You start with that and the sounds and the blinking light, and you go, ‘Now I buy that you’re doing the most ridiculous things.”

Then they found a way of adding emotion to the painted face when Butler pitched designing the pupils of his eyes as dark smoked glass with a camera behind them. The green light ring in the camera allowed them to then animate a twinkle. “Like a Tesla, if you look at the side cameras, they’re hidden behind a smoked glass,” added Butler.

As for Herman and Mr. Peanut, they had their own limitations to overcome. Herman boasts a unique design in the movie: His face looks like a Cathode-Ray Tube display. “The fun part was doing the screen and figuring out how that sort of decay of the pixels and the look of that classic television screen could be in the form of pseudo futuristic,” Digital Domain’s Behrens told IndieWire.

“And we took Dennis’ designs and made them feel like they could actually exist in the world of robotics,” Behrens continued. “They had proper joint structure and mechanics that would allow him to do what he does [sizing up]. So he had a lot of pistons around his waist to give a pretty impressive range of motion for a little guy.”

‘The Electric State’ Netflix

Meanwhile, Mr. Peanut was a challenge because they tried to figure out what level of complexity his facial expressions and animation could have. Digital Domain ran a series of tests from being puppet-like to completely elastic like a human.

“We found that it started feeling a little cartoonish and a little creepy,” added Behrens. “So we took inspiration from those old animatronics from Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz Pizza. We assumed that there was an understructure that allowed Peanut to have certain expressions and movements like his mouth.

“But we also wanted that to feel limited like he’s a mechanical base with a sort of elastic, latex shell wrapped around it with some sort of capacitors and pistons that would allow him to do a slight pucker or a slight smile. For the most part, we tried to make him feel as robotic as possible with the exception of his eyes, which we wanted to keep as human as possible. You’ll notice he can do eye darts and looks around at people. That was actually a pitch from Jeff Ford, the editor, and everybody agreed that it was a smart move.”

The State of the Race

FX has the option to do the funniest thing.

The reigning network in the Outstanding Drama Series race does not boast a major contender this time around, as it has already canceled “The Old Man” (which did earn star Jeff Bridges an Emmy nomination for Season 1), and has not received the greatest ratings and reviews for new Ryan Murphy show “Grotesquerie.” Maybe it is time for FX to call the naysayers’ bluff and submit “The Bear” as a drama.

Looking at the more realistic possibilities, HBO is having a big comeback year. Two Emmys ago, it tied the record for most nominees in one series category with “House of the Dragon,” “The Last of Us,” “The White Lotus,” and “Succession” filling up four out of the eight nomination slots. Though the latter series, which won, is over, HBO is still in strong standing now that “The Pitt,” from its sister network Max, has become one of the breakthrough shows of this current TV season. One could argue “House of the Dragon” is most vulnerable, but it had one of the first FYC events of the season at Television Academy headquarters, and the theater was fully packed with eager attendees.

That HBO/Max dominance is all great for Warner Bros. Discovery, which could use a win, but makes the Drama awards landscape not super-ideal for other companies. Going back under the Disney umbrella, which includes FX, ABC, Hulu, etc., the latter streaming service is the only one boasting a previous Outstanding Drama Series winner. In fact, “The Handmaid’s Tale” is the first streaming series ever to win the category, and did so for its premiere season. The question becomes, would Television Academy members want to bookend their love for the show by nominating its final season? Or are they already more partial toward “Paradise,” the latest Hulu hit that already had its FYC event where its Emmy-winning stars Sterling K. Brown and Julianne Nicholson really charmed attendees in the massive room?

Next, looking at the usual suspects, Netflix has “Squid Game” and “Bridgerton,” which have both been nominated in the category before, but is still figuring out which drama to put its full weight behind. For example, “The Diplomat” Season 2 went over even better with the crowd that votes on Emmys (the addition of seven-time winner Allison Janney certainly helps), but is still getting ready to premiere “Forever” and “Department Q,” from veteran showrunners Mara Brock Akil and Scott Frank, respectively, so it will be interesting to see how Netflix’s awards strategy evolves. If it got “3 Body Problem” nominated, which did not have as passionate a reaction as some of the other shows listed above, it is safe to count on Netflix to secure at least one nomination slot.

Finally, the drama most permeating the culture right now is “Severance” on Apple TV+, which was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series its first season, and has only become exponentially more popular. It is the strongest of the remaining previous nominees back in the race that have not been mentioned so far, like “Andor” (Disney+), “Slow Horses” (Apple TV+), and “Yellowjackets” (Showtime), and could even win this time.

As for more buzzy new shows, Peacock’s “The Day of the Jackal” popped up in quite a few winter awards races, but it is two shows under the Paramount umbrella, “Matlock” (CBS) and “Landman” (Paramount+), that seem to have a little more momentum going into Emmys season.

Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):

“Andor” (Disney+)

“The Day of the Jackal” (Peacock)

“The Diplomat” (Netflix)

“The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)

Last Year’s Winner: “Shōgun”

Still Eligible: No.

Hot Streak: With “Shōgun” off the table, and FX not having any big dramas in the race yet, the 2025 Emmys will more likely start a new hot streak for a show and/or network rather than build off any previous successes.

Notable Ineligible Series: “The Crown” (ended); “The Morning Show” (Season 4 is not eligible); “The Gilded Age” (Season 3 is not eligible); “Shōgun” (Season 2 is not eligible); “3 Body Problem” (Season 2 is not eligible); “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” (Season 2 is not eligible); “Fallout” (Season 2 is not eligible).",indiewire

Series director/executive producer Ben Stiller said during Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast in the below video that the inevitable “Severance” Season 3 will not take three years to make. While Season 3 has not yet been announced by Apple TV+, the hit series is expected to return…and Stiller assured that the next installment will not be plagued by the same delays (namely, the SAG and WGA strikes) as Season 2.

“No, the plan is not to [wait three years],” Stiller said ahead of the Season 2 finale. “Hopefully we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.”

Stiller continued of the three years between Seasons 1 and 2, “It took us a little bit to regroup, and the show, we shot for 186 days on Season 2. Editing takes a while, but thank goodness the audience was there when we came back. The challenge was to get people who hadn’t seen the show to watch the first season, so Apple did a really good job of getting the word out and we did as much press as we could. Also, three years later, Apple TV+ is actually a different…it’s a different situation there now because they have more viewers. When we started out, we were one of the first shows.”

Stiller also shared how making “Severance” has impacted his view on acting as a whole. Stiller directed 11 out of the 19 completed episodes of the show; he also directs the upcoming Season 2 finale, out March 21.

“It’s made me admire actors so much more as a director,” Stiller said. “When you’re really just directing, you can just focus on what you’re doing and be there for the other actors and be connected to the crew.”

Stiller recently teased the Season 2 finale during a SXSW panel with Apple EVP of Services Eddy Cue, saying, “Things are going to happen. I mean, what can I tell you? The season is going to end soon and hopefully people will be along for the ride.”

He further confirmed during “Jimmy Kimmel Live” that the “Severance” team already knows how the series will end. “We know what the ending is but how we’re getting there is the creative process,” he said.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘Coyote vs. Acme’ Lives: Ketchup in Talks to Release Axed Warner Bros. Movie,https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/coyote-vs-acme-ketchup-entertainment-1235110079/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:13:58 GMT","It turns out that’s not all, folks. The “Looney Tunes” live-action hybrid film “Coyote vs. Acme” has finally found a new home — and with a theatrical release. Ketchup Entertainment is set to acquire the Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)-axed film, according to reports. IndieWire has reached out to reps at WBD and Ketchup for confirmation. WBD had no comment. A source close to the film said the Ketchup deal is indeed in the works.

As Deadline reported on Wednesday, Ketchup Entertainment is negotiating an all-rights acquisition in the $50 million range for “Coyote vs. Acme,” with respect to the film’s reported $70-million budget.

If the deal closes, “Coyote vs. Acme” will also receive a theatrical release, much like the critically acclaimed “The Day the Earth Blew Up.” Originally commissioned for Max, “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie” also landed at Ketchup Entertainment. The film has grossed a total of $4.8 million worldwide since opening March 14.

WBD infamously scrapped the completed “Coyote vs. Acme” in 2023 before it was set to stream on Max. The conglomerate opted to take a $30 million tax write-off instead. WBD later announced that it had no plans to ever release the movie, putting the film up for sale to other interested studios. The film was not picked up elsewhere, despite reported screenings at Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. WBD’s decision followed the similarly shelved films “Batgirl” and animated feature “Scoob! Holiday Haunt.”

“Coyote vs. Acme” is directed by David Green and written by Oscar-nominated “May December” scribe Samy Burch; James Gunn produced the film and also received a story credit. John Cena and Lana Condor co-star with Will Forte, who has pushed for years for “Coyote vs. Acme” to still be distributed.

Forte said it was “fucking bullshit” that “Coyote vs. Acme” might not be viewed by audiences, telling MovieWeb earlier this year, “It deserves so much better than it got. I can’t tell you possibly why the decision was made to not release it. But it makes my blood boil. […] I don’t want people to forget what [Warner Bros.] did to this.”

The original “Looney Tunes” cartoon series was removed from Max this month due to low viewership on Max. Other iterations of the franchise are still streaming, though.

Other releases from Ketchup include “Goodrich,” “Hellboy: The Crooked Man,” “Hypnotic,” and the Jessica Chastain-starring drama “Memory.” “Coyote vs. Acme” would be the company’s highest-profile release so far.",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,‘Daredevil’ Episode 4 Brings in an Old Friend — and New Enemies,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/daredevil-born-again-104-review-1235110016/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","[Editor’s note: The following review contains spoilers for “Daredevil: Born Again” through Season 1, Episode 4.]

Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) have always had a lot in common, including a shared belief their beloved city needs to be cleaned up. In “Daredevil: Born Again” Episode 4, written by David Feige & Jesse Wigutow and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff, Matt faces the limits of his above board legal work when he infers that he’s up against police officers — some of the most dangerous individuals he’ll ever encounter, all protected and propped up by the system he has no choice but to trust.

Matt doesn’t believe for a second that Hector (Kamar de los Reyes) was executed by Punisher AKA Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal), and moves right to the obvious answer: it was the cops, because Hector got in their way, and his freedom was both an inconvenience and an insult.

As much as Fisk was and is the de facto antagonist of our lawyerly superhero, “Born Again” has also built a thrilling dynamic between Matt and Officer Powell (Hamish Allan-Headley), a man whose presence now sends Matt into high alert. Everything about the relationship is just plain good TV: Matt’s confidence, Powell’s hubris, the dislike on the surface, and the burning, violent hatred below it.

Beneath their shiny official personas, these men could — and might — kill each other.

Speaking of which, the episode also gives an antihero’s welcome to Bernthal in an outstanding scene between Matt and Frank. It starts with Frank accosting him with an axe, because what’s an old friendship without traditions?

It’s been so satisfying watching all these actors reprise their roles in this reboot, but Bernthal’s Punisher is and always has been a knockout. He growls out the character’s resentment, disillusion, and hard-won wisdom like no time has passed, with Frank instantly seeing through Matt’s nonviolent bravado. Cox and Bernthal work brilliantly together on screen, in a scene buoyed by lighting, set design, and (of course) great writing (I haven’t fact-checked this, but it’s gotta be the first use of “pussy-ass” on Disney+).

Frank confirms that “fucking fanboys” have appropriated his Punisher logo, and Matt surmises that a lot of them are cops doling out their own vigilante justice so someone else takes the blame. But is it a cop in the creepy white mask that appears to be operating on somebody in the final scene? And what about Fisk’s version of justice, which involves keeping Vanessa’s (Ayelet Zurer) ex-lover Adam (Lou Taylor Pucci) in a cage in his basement? What about Matt still keeping his precious masks and weapons safe and secret, and sneaking out at night to practice for the fights he has supposedly left behind?

Everyone on this show is taking things into their own hands, and it’s only a matter of time before they clash disastrously.

IW on the Street

Excellent guest performances by Charlie Hudson III as Matt’s client Leroy and Camila Rodriguez as Hector’s niece Angela.

Not BB (Gennaya Walton) telling Daniel (Michael Gandolfini) they should hit up another spot, sleep on the train, then shower, and go to work like it’s fine on a school night?? Chilling!

Talking about your lover’s hands while at couples therapy with your husband is wild, Vanessa plz.

Between this episode and “Paradise,” what kind of license deal did Disney do for “We Built This City”?

Is there an Emmy specifically for Outstanding Guest Performance By Jon Bernthal in a Series? Because we’ve needed one for a while…

https://indiewire.com,‘Ash’ Review: Flying Lotus’ Pummeling Sci-Fi Freak Out Stars Eiza González and Aaron Paul as Astronauts in Hell,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/ash-movie-review-flying-lotus-eiza-gonzalez-aaron-paul-1235103042/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:52:00 GMT","Editor’s Note: This review was originally published during the 2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival. “Ash” opens in theaters Friday, March 21.

Usually, when someone says a movie is “all vibes,” they mean it as an insult. But vibes can accomplish some wonderful things: Just ask Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Amy Seimetz, Panos Cosmatos, and now Flying Lotus. Born Steven D. Bingley-Ellison, the musician and record producer claims his place in the pantheon of vibes-based filmmakers with “Ash,” a pummeling psychedelic sci-fi freakout that one doesn’t watch so much as experience.

Don’t let the green mist tinged with white lightning and rotating cosmic orifices fool you, however: Ingesting psychedelic drugs is not recommended before watching this film. Like Brandon Cronenberg’s “Possessor,” “Ash” makes extensive use of cut-ins that violently tear through the frame, jarring the audience with nightmarish imagery that’s disarming under normal circumstances and probably soul-searingly terrifying if one’s third eye happens to be open at the time. Think rage monsters — coated in blood that’s as thick as crude oil — who scream under red lights as the score spikes in the background. It’s very much a horror movie, and a freaky one at times.

I saw this film stone-cold sober and sufficiently caffeinated at its world premiere at SXSW, and still had trouble figuring out what was going on throughout a lot of it. This was true even when one of the characters explicitly explained what was going on, which happens quite a bit — this is writer Jonni Remmler’s first produced screenplay, and it shows. But there aren’t too many dialogue scenes, thankfully, as heroine Riya (Eiza González) spends a good deal of the movie alone, walking through the husk of a wrecked spaceship after waking up bruised and bloody, trying to figure out who she is and who all these dead bodies around her used to be.

Then Aaron Paul shows up as a previously unseen member of the ship’s crew, and if you’ve ever seen an “Alien” movie you’ll know immediately that this guy should not be trusted. The “Alien” series is a prominent influence on “Ash,” showing up everywhere from a scene of working-class astronauts cracking jokes over dinner to the tank tops and tight white T-shirts that make up González’s wardrobe. Riya is a Ripley type, and although her head injury and subsequent amnesia keep her from being as clever as Sigourney Weaver’s iconic sci-fi heroine, she shows an equal amount of grit in a climactic sequence involving a flamethrower and the cosmic anemone Riya just excised from her brain.

That creature combines invertebrate goo with magnetic liquid metal, an example of the many visual textures Flying Lotus plays with in “Ash.” The attention to detail is impressive: An insectoid mobile surgery unit projects vaporwave grids onto its patients, and although the display screen is in English — flashing text that says “Sorry for Your Loss” when the device scans a dead body provides one of the film’s few laughs — the audio prompts are in Japanese, presumably because it sounds cool. Attention is paid to sound as well as to visuals, and Flying Lotus’ score is excellent, a head-nodding blend of pulsating rhythms, abrasive noise, and atmospheric synths.

The last twenty minutes or so of “Ash” are violent and intense, with little time to stop and appreciate the retro-futuristic set design, gel lighting, and bloody gore effects. This is where the montage sequences get really aggressive, assaulting the viewer with imagery of barren alien landscapes and skulls with the flesh melting off of their faces. (Again, psychonauts should proceed with caution.) Combined with first-person action sequences that play like they were filmed through a VR headset, it’s all quite dizzying — one audience member at my screening spent much of the film with his head between his knees.

No worries, though, because the circular flashback structure ensures that we get to see most of the coolest images twice, first out of context and again in slightly more coherent fashion later on. The emphasis there is on “slightly.” Core themes of space colonization and human survival instincts translate clearly. But keeping track of the characters can be difficult, given that we spend barely any time with them pre-alien attack and that many of them are wearing matching space suits in pivotal scenes.

The type of moviegoer who leans over to ask their seat mate what’s happening will be lost almost immediately. And trying to fight this film’s sensations, as unpleasant as they may be at times, will bring nothing but misery. So just give in, vibe out, and take solace in the fact that “Ash” is way more accessible than Flying Lotus’ first film.

Grade: B-

“Ash” premiered at SXSW 2025. RLJE Films will release it in theaters on Friday, March 21.

https://indiewire.com,‘The Last of Us’ Gets ASL Edition on Max from ‘CODA’ Star Daniel Durant Ahead of Season 2,https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/the-last-of-us-asl-edition-max-daniel-durant-interview-1235101572/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","The “clickers” in the “The Last of Us” are zombies whose fungus has grown so infected, it has both blinded them and made their hearing hyper-sensitive. In the video game on which the hit HBO television series is based, players use stealth to evade them and respond to the sound of the monsters’ clicks in order to survive.

For Deaf players, developer Naughty Dog’s game is top of the line in terms of accessibility, implementing subtle visual cues to make players aware of looming danger, putting those players on equal footing with hearing players. It’s only fitting then that the series adaptation of “The Last of Us” be as inclusive for Deaf viewers as the game is.

HBO is set to launch an ASL version of both the first season of its hit series “The Last of Us” and the upcoming second season, IndieWire can reveal exclusively. Daniel Durant, one of the stars of the Oscar-winning “CODA,” is the ASL performer for the first season of the show, acting through the entire season in American Sign Language to open up a new level of appreciation and comprehension of the series for the Deaf audience.

The series will be available as a standalone title on Max, and it drops on March 31 ahead of the premiere of Season 2 on April 13. The ASL version of Season 2 will air day-and-date when it becomes available for everyone else, and Durant and director Leila Hanaumi will be the performers for Season 2.

Daniel Durant on set filming for ‘The Last of Us’ ASL HBO

“We always rely on captions, but they’re always in English grammar structure, and having the concept of adding a Deaf interpreter there just makes it a clearer message,” Durant told IndieWire via an interpreter. “It gives us expanded ideas and meanings, and then we as Deaf people get to understand the meanings behind it, using our own language and seeing it on the screen. It makes it even more accessible to us and so much more special.”

When viewers see Durant on screen, he will be superimposed in the corner of the frame itself, not isolated in a picture-in-picture box, and wearing a neutral black t-shirt throughout as to minimize any distraction from the show itself. His performance has also been edited in such a way that his appearance on camera is seamless and doesn’t see his torso jumping around in the frame. Durant crosses his hands into a resting position when he’s not signing in order to maintain continuity between takes, and the crew even had multiple identical black shirts on hand to keep everything consistent.

These presentation techniques have been refined over the last year, thanks to Max recently offering an ASL version of “Barbie,” in which Deaf actress Leila Hanaumi performed the entirety of Greta Gerwig’s film. Max has also created ASL versions of “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” and “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.” “The Last of Us” is the first time Max is doing it for HBO’s original content.

This time, Hanaumi is behind the camera, directing Durant’s performance and determining the best signs to communicate the intricacies and nuances of the post-apocalyptic story. She helped define what an ASL version of a show would look like on Max, but she’s impressed at how Durant took things to the next level.

“The translation from one line to another is already a huge hurdle on your brain, but [he’s] also copying their body language and catching the mirroring of each character,” Hanaumi said. “Sometimes the character will switch angles, and he has to portray all of those angles while translating the line and foreshadowing what the next line could be. Gosh, it is a lot of mental work.”

IndieWire got an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at their process. In Season 1, Episode 7, “Left Behind,” in which Ellie (Bella Ramsey) ventures to an abandoned mall with her friend Riley (Storm Reid), Durant interprets a poignant scene in which Ellie, for the first time, sees the lights of the mall completely illuminated before her eyes. You hear the sound of the power generators rumbling to life, followed by Ellie running up and down the “electric stairs” she’s never seen before.

Durant is able to communicate it all, from making bursting gestures to capture the sounds of the generators around her, swaying his hand to the tempo of the music, finding different signs for “electric stairs” versus the appropriate “escalator,” and even angling his body from side to side in order to “role shift” his performance and convey both characters’ dialogue at once. In action scenes, he expands his arms and broadens his gestures to help convey, in his own language, the added suspense of the moment, and going smaller as the danger subsides.

It’s a more meticulous shooting process than you might imagine. Durant is positioned in front of a green screen and has to stay on his mark, all while a team in a separate room gets a real-time feed ensuring he remains visible where he’s supposed to. Durant watches a mirrored view of the show to be able to match his role shifting to the direction characters are speaking on screen. Hanaumi, with the help of hearing interpreter Ashley Change, works through each minor detail, whether it’s background noise pertinent to the plot, inflections in a character’s voice, or simply the best sign to convey a particular word.

At one point, Hanaumi coaches Durant to make the sign for “escalator” be his hand moving downwards in one direction rather than going up and down in a way that would’ve been too similar for the sign for “stairs.” In another, she encourages him to mimic the gesture Riley makes on screen when she tells Ellie “chop chop.” And after a take, Hanaumi gives Durant a note that he “didn’t look as confident as he could’ve been” with his role shifting. Durant can, at times, string together 8-10 minute long takes, acting out everything in a particular scene, so precision is key.

They’ve even had to create signs, though they do so sparingly; anything more than that would defeat the purpose of making it easier for a Deaf audience to understand. One exception is the word “Infected.” There’s a real ASL sign for it, or they could’ve gone with the one for “zombie,” but in the context of “The Last of Us,” Hanaumi and Durant opted for a “claw-3” symbol placed just above Durant’s eye. The claw shape with three fingers is the sign for “fungus,” and “claw-2” above your eye is the sign for “blind,” so Durant’s performance specifically emulates the clicking nature of these blind, fungus monsters with one gesture.

All this helps even Durant better understand the show. In the early sequences that are rife with technical scientific jargon, Hanaumi researched how the Deaf scientific community has conveyed such concepts in a way that is easier to understand, and in the process, these signs are becoming better known in the culture.

“It’s just amazing this kind of access is capable now, because it aligns with deaf people in different work environments and fields. We have more Deaf scientists now, and they are coming up with new ASL signs for scientific terms,” Hanaumi said. “We were able to use those signs that they as Deaf people, scientific Deaf people, have developed, so it was very cool to have this process and the progress of more ASL accessibility. It’s not just about the enjoyment, it’s very motivated by the fields as well.”

Fans will also know that the first season of “The Last of Us” features a Deaf child star, Keivonn Woodard, and his character’s interactions with Ellie. Woodard’s performance will remain intact, and Durant only interprets Ellie’s lines as spoken in English. But that too is a moment that is enhanced because of the ASL interpretation.

“The moment was profound, because the moment before Sam becomes infected, he asks Ellie, ‘Is it still you if you become a monster? Are you still inside of yourself?’ We do get the answer to that question, and Ellie wakes up and says hey, and Sam does not respond to that. He’s still Deaf. So technically, it was still him inside of him,” Hanaumi explained.

While it’s great that Max sees the value in making its older content accessible, Hanaumi applauded the streamer for doing the same with a new series and making it available timely, saying that “the Deaf community always seems to get delayed information,” and the importance of being on the same page as everyone else can’t be overstated.

But Durant feels that other studios should adopt this same level of accessibility, and he argues that the progress for Deaf representation on screen he saw since he appeared in “CODA” has stalled.

“For the longest time, Deaf characters have just kind of showed up in TV shows, maybe once or twice, maybe a few episodes, and then that’s it, they’re done. But we want to see a Deaf lead, we want to see more Deaf leads, for an entire seasons and more,” Durant said. “The movie ‘CODA,’ that came out, and for a few years we did see more opportunities for Deaf people, but then we had the SAG strike, and it became really quiet. I hope there are more Deaf characters that will be written in the future in shows or TV. That is our hope.”

In the meantime, Durant said this type of work is a big departure from what he’s done in film and TV and on stage with Deaf West Theater, and he’s proud knowing he’s capable of doing something like this as a performer. It’s a sentiment that’s rubbed off on Hanaumi too.

“I love doing this kind of work. It’s a gift to my own community,” she said. “The language deprivation is absolutely ample to my community. It affects almost all of us, doing the work of translating the English into ASL, that is my bilingual identity. I was very fortunate to be born to Deaf parents who gave me sign language since birth, and I have made a foundation with that sign language. That sign language foundation has been able to help me become fluent in my second language of English. Most Deaf people do not have that kind of access, so being able to do this work feels very healing for me and my community.”

https://indiewire.com,Celine Song Explains Why Her ‘Past Lives’ Is ‘Not at All About a Love Triangle’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/celine-song-past-lives-not-love-triangle-book-excerpt-1235104292/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","The latest entry into A24’s screenplay books collection examines the creation and impact of Celine Song‘s feature directorial debut “Past Lives.” The beloved feature was IndieWire’s favorite film of 2023 and earned Song a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the 2024 Oscars.

“Past Lives” is a record of the film’s creation, split into five chapters. The 86-page book opens with an introduction by playwright Lynn Nottage. The first section features Celine Song’s original screenplay, presented in both English and Korean. Section Two presents film stills shot by cinematographer Shabier Kirchner. “Someone Who Knew Me When,” an essay by New York Times bestselling author Sloane Crosley, looks at that deceptively simple question: What might have been? while “Marriage Plot, Interrupted” by New Yorker staff writer Doreen St. Félix considers how the film escapes the strictures of the domestic drama.

The final chapter — available exclusively on IndieWire — features a wide-ranging conversation between Song and author Andrew H. Miller. You can read it in full below. The book is out today.

SECTION V

“True Love Leaves No Traces”

A Conversation Between Celine Song and Andrew H. Miller

“Past Lives” asks a deceptively simple question: What might have been? Of course, there’s no such thing as a simple interrogation into the other lives we might have led—which is what prompted Andrew H. Miller to write an entire book on the topic. “On Not Being Someone Else” (Harvard University Press, 2022) explores the way we view the roads not taken, whether it’s the person we didn’t marry, the job we didn’t take, or simply the grocery store line we skipped (that’s suddenly moving much faster). Miller sat down with Celine Song to talk about all that might have been, and what could still be.

Andrew H. Miller: “Past Lives” is a movie that’s full of regret and full of relief, some jealousy, some envy. But the dominant feeling for me is this heartbreaking beauty. How does beauty matter? What role does it play for you?

Celine Song: Well, there’s nothing more heartbreaking in life than beauty. And so much of that beauty stems from the longing we feel by living the life we live. We’re always in pursuit of it on some level, even just those small, really beautiful moments. It doesn’t always have to be an aesthetic achievement or something tangible, it can just be a beautiful feeling. You can have a beautiful feeling in a very unattractive mall, for example. Or maybe you’re in a really dark and awful place, or a horrible room, or in a space where there’s a lot of violence and something terrifying is happening, but maybe the words you say to another person there can contain so much beauty. I really believe that beauty makes life worth living.

The clichés and the sayings about beauty are usually true, like how people say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For Hae Sung and Nora, they’re both still children in each other’s eyes. There’s beauty in being able to see someone that way. In the final scene in the film, for example, the street that I was looking for was meant to be the most beautiful street in all of New York in the eyes of the beholders, the eyes of Nora and Hae Sung.

AM: Right, so much of the movie is both terrifically ordinary and terrifically beautiful. You get this very ordinary street in New York, but it’s also exquisitely beautiful at the same time.

CS: And it is only beautiful because something very beautiful has happened there.

AM: It’s beautiful for us. Is it beautiful for Nora and for Hae Sung?

CS: It is very beautiful for Nora and Hae Sung, and it’s even beautiful for Arthur. To me, the corners of the city that we live in or the places we walk by, the more ordinary they are, the more completely beautiful they can be. Somebody else is walking along the same street, and it’s not going to mean anything to them, but the same corner is going to hold so much meaning and so much beauty for Nora and Hae Sung. That spot, in front of a garage, where they’re waiting for an Uber, is a spot that they’re going to think of and feel something about for the rest of their lives. There’s a total beauty there.

‘Past Lives’ screenplay book A24 Books

AM: It will be beautiful for them. At that very moment, even, they’re holding back tears. They’re feeling so much—

CS: Yes, I think they experience all those feelings as something beautiful. But different people talk about regret very differently. I usually find when sharing “Past Lives” with an audience member—and I mean an individual audience member—that the film very much works as a mirror to where that person is in their life and what they have gone through because, depending on where they are in their life, they can think of that one moment as one that’s filled with regret, or they can think of that moment as one that’s filled with a lot of peace. It really does depend on who is watching it. Again, it’s about the eye of the beholder. I’ve heard every reaction: I’ve heard everything from “I would’ve gotten in that Uber” to “Thank God she stayed.” Both of those reactions are true—you can feel different things depending on where you are. So, when you said to me earlier in this conversation that this film is filled with regret, I thought, “Well, what does this say about Andrew and where he is in his life?”

AM: It is revealing.

CS: Right. We’re all living a life. We all have so much in common, but we’re each going through our time and space in a way that’s unique in the world.

AM: We’re all living one life.

CS: Yes. Yes. Exactly.

AM: Each of us dreams in our own language. One of the things that a film can do is say: There’s a body here, and there’s a body here, and they’re separate.

CS: Completely. Even at the deepest level of intimacy you’re still going to know a language that’s unique to you—the language of your life. You have a very specific language because you’re living the one life. In fact, no other human being can know what that is, and therefore there’s no other human being who can actually judge it for what it is either.

AM: One of the wonderful things about cinema is that it needn’t make heavy weather of that. It’s a deep existential truth we’re talking about here, and you could describe it in language that is very heavy, but your film is saying: No, no. Here’s a person. Here’s a person. They’re together.

CS: Completely.

AM: They’re in the same city at the same time, but they’re separate. They’re together, and they’re separate.

CS: I feel like there’s that little gap between Nora and Hae Sung that speaks to the way we connect to everyone. Yes, friends. Yes, lovers. Yes, every other human being, too. There is something that is in the distance between those two characters that, throughout the film, we all understand. It’s a completely unknown space because we actually don’t know what it’s going to be like to cross it. That is the possibility—the alternate universe or living the life that these two people are living, because Nora and Hae Sung are not going to cross that space to go toward each other. In this life, they’re going to remain at arm’s length.

AM: Yes.

CS: Only broken at times by a hug.

AM: Yes. Right. By one hug that she initiates and then one hug that he initiates.

CS: Exactly.

AM: “Past Lives” has been put in a lineage with the films of Yasujirō Ozu and with Wong Kar-wai’s “In the Mood for Love” (2000). You’ve said that it’s been an honor to be put in that lineage, but that each of those movies defies comparison, as “Past Lives” defies comparison. I found myself thinking of Mike Leigh’s “Another Year” (2010), and the way that he elicits the kind of acting where you really feel the presence of the actor. You think: This actor is right here, right now. There’s an absolute specificity to his characters. I was wondering if Mike Leigh matters to you—

CS: Oh, so much. He matters so much to me.

AM: How so?

CS: He means so much to me because I feel like the heart of his work is so connected to what I believe fundamentally, which is that there is nothing bigger in scale than the human life that everybody in the audience can connect to, captured on screen as it is. We can talk about the scale of a film and how cinema is about living in different worlds than the ones we live in currently, and I get very excited about those things, too. I’m a huge fan of sci-fi and a huge fan of fantasy. But Mike Leigh is so interested in capturing the totally extraordinary feelings that can happen in an entirely mundane experience. After watching a Mike Leigh film, I feel like my life is so much more significant and filled with more beauty, complexity, darkness, and perfection than I thought. It’s always life-affirming.

AM: It’s such a gift. Such a gift to the audience.

CS: It’s a gift. I feel very loved and very seen by his films, if that makes sense. In the way that it’s in the eye of the beholder, I feel very beautiful because of the way that his films see my very ordinary life. So much of what I find purposeful about cinema or making art is going to always come down to love. It’s a cliché, but they say love is the greatest thing in life. Well, a part of that is being able to talk about love, and I don’t just mean romantic love, I mean love that we just experience in life. Even if it’s from a friend, from a parent, from someone you work with, whatever it may be, whatever the feeling of being seen and understood, I think that alone is worth depicting because in life it is unfortunately more rare than it should be.

AM: The psychologist Adam Phillips once said, “The death of God is the death of someone who knows who you are.”

CS: That’s wonderful.

AM: There’s such a powerful, powerful desire to be known. So if a film can convey that or suggest that—

CS: There’s nothing holier… There’s a holiness to Leigh’s films because of that. I always feel so seen by his films even though of course I don’t maybe share the same background or… It’s not about representation.

AM: I’m not Korean…

CS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not about being seen in a literal way. It’s about being seen in your soul.

AM: There is that extraordinary moment at the beginning of “Past Lives” where we have our proxy voices as viewers there—the couple who’s watching this film that’s starting, and they’re saying, “Who are these people? Who are they to each other?” Then Greta [Lee] looks right at us, and we think: Oh my God, I’m being seen.

CS: Totally. Well, you’re being asked to see her, because that’s what the truth is. It starts with the mystery of who she is and what her life is, and what she’s asking in that moment is to be seen. This is one of the scenes that I talked to Greta about the most. When she has to break the fourth wall and look at the camera, she has to be both totally open and totally mysterious. It’s supposed to be a Mona Lisa thing of: I defy your attempt to know me, and I’m also going to welcome you into actually getting to know me. That’s very different from: Yeah, here is a list of the things that I am. What she’s telling us is: I’m going to let you—and I mean the audience whose proxy is these voices—I’m going to let you actually live through my life, through this movie… and then at the end of it, you’re going to see me. That’s a very different thing than if she were to just describe herself more literally as, say, Korean American. She can say a lot of words to describe who she is, but, in fact, what she’s saying is, “No, actually, I’m going to let you into a part of my life, not all of it, but part of my life, and at the end of it you’re going to see me. And the next time you are back in this scene, the next time you’re back in this moment, in this film, you’re not just going to look at me, you’re going to see me, and you’re going to love me, and you’re going to love these two people you don’t know.” What I mean by love… it’s not about likeability, it’s about understanding—

AM: Recognizing somebody’s particular humanity?

CS: Yes.

AM: That’s remarkable that you say that because she is so… authoritative isn’t the right word, but she controls so much in the movie from the beginning. For instance, the moment where she says to Arthur, “We say In-Yun to seduce you.”

CS: Yeah. Well, it’s a story about her life—insofar as she can control her own life, the way that we are authors of our own life. I certainly don’t think that’s possible for everyone all the time, which is where all kinds of dehumanization is happening in the world. But in Nora’s situation, she’s living a very happy life, and therefore she has a great deal of authority in her life. But there is a funny wrinkle in her otherwise relentless control and power over her own life, which is Hae Sung coming to visit. It’s so innocuous. It feels like it should not disrupt a single thing.

AM: She says, “Why did you do that?”

CS: Yeah. “Why’d you come?”

AM: Movies and novels and poems that are about lives we could have lived but didn’t tend to fall in patterns. Marriage. “Oh, if I had married this person instead of that person.” Career. Children. I could have had children—I didn’t have children. Emigrating. “If only we stayed in Seoul…” In “Past Lives,” the marriage is under question in a way, or she’s thinking about alternative possibilities, or the movie’s thinking about presenting alternative possibilities, or at least Hae Sung is presenting alternative possibilities. She even says, “You think I’m going to throw away my life? You think I’m going to give up my rehearsals for you?”

CS: I’m not sure how disparate these things are. What I mean is that they’re so connected. Why does Nora live in New York? She lives in New York because of her career and her career is so connected to who she is. She’s married to this person she is in love with because her life in New York makes it possible to marry him. I don’t know if you can separate one thing from the other. And then, of course, she is not somebody who is in any way compatible with who Hae Sung is. Someone would have to give up their life for the two of them to be together. He has a particular job, a particular life, language, country… I would not recommend that these two people get together. To me, that’s the crux of it.

AM: You did what you could to prevent it, as a matter of fact, very successfully.

CS: Yeah, of course. But that’s not really the point of their connection, because love does not necessarily need to have a practical end or a happy ending that is legible or tangible. There is a song that I was thinking about so much, the Leonard Cohen song he made with Phil Spector called “True Love Leaves No Traces.” I think about that song as the heart of this particular film because it’s about the way that Hae Sung and Nora’s connection has nothing tangible in it. There’s nothing practical in it—there’s not even a very proper path through it. When they split at the fork in the road, their love story stopped. In fact, that’s why, when their flashback happens, they’re right back in that spot, as though they’ve been waiting at that corner for 24 years.

‘Past Lives’ Courtesy Everett Collection

AM: Right, at the very end?

CS: Yes, and because they have been waiting in that corner for 24 years, all they need is to get this proper goodbye—and once that happens the film can end. I think there’s a danger in what we do as modern people, which is to evaluate different connections and then assign importance: “They’re just a friend,” or, “They’re just a childhood friend, and you’re my boyfriend,” or, “You were just a boyfriend—now you’re my husband.” We tend to assign different meanings and values to certain relationships, which then flattens the connections we might have. But the truth is that the heart of every connection is its very own thing. You can’t ask Arthur, for example, to have the connection that Nora has with Hae Sung, and you can’t ask Hae Sung to have the kind of connection that Nora and Arthur have. Every single one of their conversations is going to be different, and it’s heartbreaking that Nora won’t get to have the millions and millions of conversations that she could have with Hae Sung in this particular life. But in their place, she’s able to have those kinds of conversations with Arthur, which would be different than with Hae Sung–not better or worse, but different because he is a different person and their love is unique to the two of them.

AM: And her mom says, “When you leave something behind, you get something,” or something like that.

CS: Exactly. To me, it’s like he’s offering an option here. I’m like, “What option? Her life is what it is.” And by the way, the movie could have posed a different question: “Is there something missing in her life that she’s trying to solve by running away with somebody else?” But that’s not the point of the film.

AM: It’s simpler than that. This is just the way life works.

CS: This is the way life is, and this is the life that Nora is living. It doesn’t mean that the feeling she gets when she sees somebody who reminds her of herself as a little girl, who she probably didn’t really think was important, who she never got to say a proper goodbye to, and somebody who is still in love with that little girl… that’s such a powerful feeling. You can always say to her, “How could you do this? You’re married.” You can say a million different things to turn that relationship or turn that connection into something that everybody can understand. But the truth is it’s as simple as the feeling she gets when the two of them are looking at each other, which is: Oh, I remember you when you were a kid, and we were so in love as children. It can be as simple as that. There’s nothing else that you can ask of that, and you can’t expect that connection to become something more than what it was.

AM: That’s such a powerful insight about love.

CS: That’s the thing about love in the movie—it’s not about “romance” in the way that we think about it. It’s about something else entirely. It’s about the universality of love, how it’s about recognizing someone’s humanity and understanding their particularity.

AM: To think about other possibilities is human.

CS: It’s completely human. Even in the grocery line, you think, “I’d have been out of here five minutes ago if I had gotten in the other line.” It’s part of the human imagination. There’s nothing you can do about it, but it’s a very powerful thing, too, because it allows us to empathize with the person who got in the right grocery line. If you take that further, maybe somebody has gone through a certain experience that I don’t know anything about but that I can connect to through cinema. The ability to have empathy is so connected to our ability to think about the lives that we do not live. Part of why “Past Lives” has resonated with people from so many different countries is the universality of its core concept. As I was sharing the movie with the global audience, I got to hear people in all different countries pronounce the word In-Yun in their own accent. An Italian interviewer or fan of the film will want to talk to me about In-Yun, but will say the word with an Italian accent. Or a Japanese accent. There are so many different ways that you can say that word in the world, but we all know what that word is universally. This film connected with people who have not exactly lived the way that Nora has or even made choices that she has, and that is a very special thing I feel so lucky to have experienced on my first film.

AM: I’ve been wondering about the ideals you have about your work and what you think about when it’s finished. Susan Sontag has this line—

CS: Oh, geez. I know it.

On the set of ‘Past Lives’ Courtesy Everett Collection

AM: Critics, when they’re talking about works of art, seem to say that a perfect work of art is a work of art in which nothing can be changed. Any change would make it worse. However, the artist knows that it’s dependent on contingency, on chance, on whether or not there’s a fire truck across the street when you’re filming, on whether it’s raining. On the one hand, life is just full of chaos and chance, and who knows what’s going on. But at the aesthetic level, the ideal of a work of art is one in which nothing could be changed, or it would not be as good. Is that a way to think about your artwork, that you want it to be exactly right, that every piece has to be there, that no other piece would do?

CS: I think that is how I feel. But I also know that, again, it’s in the eye of the beholder. I know that it’s going to be completely changeable and mean completely different things to the people who see it.

AM: You can’t control that.

CS: No, I can’t control it because a part of it is like, well, when I lock everything, when I lock the film, and the film is considered finished, it has effectively become an object. It has effectively become a thing that you could watch on your phone. So it has fully become something that is, in a way, a dead thing because I am no longer able to touch it, because it’s now become a film that exists in the world. Hopefully, you’ve encountered it in a beautiful movie theater, but it’s also possible for you to have seen it on an airplane. Whatever this object is, it’s going to remain the object a hundred years from now, and I hope that a hundred years from now people are able to watch the movie and still feel something for it. Who knows, though? In that way, it is to me no longer a living, breathing thing. But I also know that in the audience, it comes back to life. In front of the audience, it does become a living, breathing thing again, and it becomes a part of their life in this way I, as the filmmaker, can only dream of. Again, we’re talking about contradictions. So to me, it is a changeable and contradictory thing. It is always in flux, but it’s also something that I no longer touch.

AM: It’s like what we were saying about characters who, on the one hand, are just one thing. Nora is this person and no one else, but, on the other hand, she could have been all these other people. She could have stayed in Seoul or could have gone to New York in her different lives. She could have been the bird on the branch.

CS: Yes. Exactly.

AM: A lovely line.

CS: Because it’s a depiction of life, every other life that you can imagine for her. “What if she stayed in Seoul?” Which, of course, Hae Sung talks about. Every choice within this movie is one of an infinite number of choices that could have been made as well. But I believe that’s the part of artmaking where you’re trying to capture the thing that is completely alive and turn it into an object that can be approached by everyone. And, as a result, it has to be something that is open to change and to alternate universes and all the things that Nora could have done instead. All of those things have to be in the film, but, again, it’s a contradiction because it has to also be the only thing that Nora could do in the film. Unpredictable yet inevitable. That’s all you’re trying to achieve. For example, you can always make Arthur a horrible person, and then the audience will have to contend with the fact that her life in New York or her marriage doesn’t seem very good. But, in fact, the thing that I’m trying to do is to make sure that Nora does not get in the Uber. You want it to feel completely inevitable because that’s what life feels like. Life is completely inevitable and totally spontaneous.

AM: I want to ask you about Virginia Woolf. Have you read “Mrs. Dalloway”?

CS: I’ve read all the classics. I’m not scared of your English department.

AM: In “Mrs. Dalloway,” a lover comes back and, in a way, makes her think about everything. About her marriage, about her deeply and powerfully unspoken relationship to her husband, who can’t say that he loves her but does. You were a playwright before you were a filmmaker. One of the things I loved about your movie, as I’ve been saying, is its formal refinement, the extraordinary care with which you manage space and time and intensify the viewers’ experiences of space and time through all sorts of formal, technical choices. But then there is the harmony, a series of chord progressions on top of which your language then plays this melody. I don’t want to end without acknowledging the language. How did you think about language in relation to thinking about unled lives? The more particular question is to ask about the translation of the very last line in the movie, when Hae Sung says, in translation, “See you then.” I take it to mean, or possibly mean, “I’ll see you in that future life.” Is that there in the original Korean, too?

CS: Yes. I would say it’s more specific than even, “See you then.” The more direct translation is, “Geuttae boja / 그때 보자.” It means, “See you at that time.” In that way, it is completely and unambiguously about that.

AM: That’s lovely. I love that.

CS: Yes, and what an amazing promise. And at the end of the film, after the beautiful credit song by Sharon Van Etten ends, there’s a little piece of music that comes back from the film, which is the piece of music from the first moment that Nora and Hae Sung reconnect over Skype. We wanted to play that song there as a way of—

Inside ‘Past Lives’ screenplay book A24 Books

AM: Anticipating.

CS: Revealing what is happening in the next life. Even though you’re just watching the black screen and the credits, you’re hearing Nora and Hae Sung meeting in the next life. They probably don’t know that they’re meeting each other again in this life after they promised to see each other then in that New York City corner in their last life.

AM: Maybe for the 8,000th time. Who knows?

CS: Yes, maybe the 8,000th time. The movie is about this sense we get when we meet certain people. “I’ve known you forever. I don’t know how to describe it, but you and I, we are connected for some reason.” That’s why we chose that piece of music for a post-credit song.

AM: That’s lovely. When her parents decide to move, one of the first things she does is choose her new name. She names herself, and she practices this new language with her sister on the plane, learns this language and enters fully into it. Was having these two languages a resource for you? If you’re thinking, “I want to write a movie about two lovers, about a past lover coming back and a present lover,” that could be done without the bilingual element. You didn’t need to, but you did. So that is to say, how did you think about using the language difference or the two languages to intensify the experience of unled lives or past lives?

CS: I think it suggests, again, that this movie is some kind of a love triangle, but the truth is this movie is not at all about a love triangle. If it is a love triangle, it’s between Nora and one of her lives and another one. To me, it’s really less about language as an element. It’s so fundamental because it’s about a part of her that is very much a literal place, a culture, a language, and a time in her life, and it’s a very vivid space. It’s so much more about somebody from that space coming to remind her of its existence, and the way that space still longs for her. It’s actually not a love triangle with the language barrier, it is fully about language itself…

AM: I understand that it’s not a love triangle, but I don’t understand—

CS: That’s what I’m trying to talk about, which is that this space within her that Hae Sung occupies is the thing that’s coming to visit. I don’t even think of it as a language barrier as opposed to this language that’s coming to visit, and that’s what really poses this existential question of who Nora is, what kind of a life she lives, and what the choices are that led to her life. Hae Sung coming to visit Nora in New York is a challenge to her entire existence. It’s about how this language that she forgot, this language that she doesn’t use, this language that only really exists in a certain part of her life, in her memory of the past, has come to invade her present and ask questions about her future. To me, it’s so much more about the love triangle of the past, the present, and the future sitting in that bar—

AM: Of this one person.

CS: Of this one person. And these two men who each hold a key to parts of her life, and they do not have each other’s keys—they only have one key that unlocks one part of her. The truth is that she gets to be completely unlocked because Hae Sung came to visit with his language and his inability to speak another one. He’s showing up to say, “There is this little basement in your soul I don’t think you’ve thought about or accessed, but I’m still in that basement, I’m still in love with that little girl, I still miss you.” In their encounter, he’s unlocking a part of her that I don’t think she fully recognized as an important part of her until he came along. So at the end of it, she has become a fuller woman and a fuller person as a result of Hae Sung’s visit. It is about her, and it is about these two men who love her differently, different parts of her, but are trying to reconcile how the woman and the girl that these two men know are somehow the same person. To love one is to love the other, and in that way, the men are then being asked to care for each other as well because the men are a part of this one woman who they both love very differently.

AM: We have In-Yun.

CS: Exactly.

AM: At the end, she recognizes her love for Arthur and having this part of her unlocked. At that moment, there’s nothing to do but to cry. To cry—to cry and to hug him.

CS: To grieve. To grieve something.

AM: To grieve while being hugged.

CS: A wonderful thing.

Per reporting in the Miami Herald, a majority of council members opposed the plan.

Meiner had publicly discouraged O Cinema from screening the Oscar-winning documentary about the Israel-Palestine Crisis, which he referred to in a March newsletter as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.” (Though many have noted that the film was made by a collective of filmmakers of both Israeli and Palestinian descent.) When the theater did not comply, legislation was introduced last week to remove the independent theater from its longtime home and withdraw roughly $40,000 in grant funding from the institution.

The move was swiftly criticized by activists from both the political realm and the world of independent film, all concerned about the First Amendment implications of a government telling an independent exhibitor what kinds of films it is allowed to program. In a statement provided to IndieWire following the withdrawal of the proposal, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations celebrated the success of the pressure campaign.

“Public pressure works. CAIR, CAIR-Florida, and the ACLU — among others — applied public pressure on Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner to drop his failed proposal to censor our cherished First Amendment right to freedom of speech, which protects artistic expression. He first attempted to censor the screening of ‘No Other Land‘ and later tried to terminate the lease and evict O Cinema. We welcome Mayor Meiner’s failure on both attempts,“ the chapter’s executive director, Imam Jaber, said. “Our organization remains steadfast in its commitment to safeguarding our community’s rights and will remain vigilant against the aggression and apparent pattern of discrimination that Mayor Meiner repeatedly exhibits in targeting Arab and Palestinian residents, business owners, and visitors.”

Despite winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, “No Other Land” still does not have a formal distribution deal in North America. The film continues to book theatrical engagements on an individual basis and became the highest-grossing Oscar-nominated documentary of the year.",indiewire

Written and directed by Michael Shanks, “Together” stars Franco and Brie as Tim and Millie, a couple who relocate across the country and find themselves more reliant on each other than ever. The twist? Tim physically cannot be away from Millie, and the confounding sickness seems to be rotting him inside out.

The official synopsis reads: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other. With tensions already flaring, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love, and their flesh.” Damon Herriman co-stars.

“Together” debuted at Sundance, where the indie was acquired by NEON. The IndieWire review deemed the feature to be a “crowd-pleasing (and -screaming) little ditty of a midnight treat.”

IndieWire’s Kate Erbland wrote, “Shanks’ often transparent scene-setting mostly serves as an additive to the fun of the film, from the first appearance to a tiny electric saw (might as well call it Chekhov’s Tiny Electric Saw) to those bold opening scenes that don’t hide what’s to come, but that tends to add to the joy of watching the film, those edgy expectations, that desire to guess what’s coming next (and the delight when you’re right).”

Franco, who previously directed wife Brie in the horror movie “The Rental” and the 2023 romance “Somebody I Used to Know,” told IndieWire that “Together” was a first for them. (The duo also produce the film.)

“This was like the most full-on thing we’ve ever done together,” Franco said. “We’re very picky about what we choose to do, especially when we’re onscreen together, just because we don’t want to burn people out on us.”

“Together” is produced by Mike Cowap, Andrew Mittman, Erik Feig, Julia Hammer, Tim Headington, and Max Silva, with both Brie and Franco also producing.

“Together” premieres in theaters August 1 from NEON. Check out the teaser below.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘The Alto Knights’ Review: Robert De Niro Plays Two Rival Crime Lords in Barry Levinson’s Utterly Lifeless Mafia Drama,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-alto-knights-review-robert-de-niro-1235104577/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","It’s rare to see a film in which not a single interesting thing happens over the course of its entire running time. Not only is that true of Barry Levinson’s “The Alto Knights,” but this tired-as-hell mafia story — which wouldn’t merit so much as a footnote in the history of mob cinema if not for the gimmick of casting Robert De Niro as real-life crime boss Vito Genovese and his best frenemy Frank Costello — seems totally at peace with it.

From the moment it starts, Levinson’s first theatrical feature since 2015’s “Rock the Kasbah” is comfortably entombed in the same deep sense of resignation that inspires its main character to get out of the game. Frank Costello knows that his era in the underworld has come to a close, and he narrates the limp saga of his own life as if it were already irrelevant. As if he were deeply embarrassed by the disconnect between how much bloodshed he survived, and how little it all mattered in the end. As if there were nothing else to say about it at this point.

It goes without saying that a man like that can be a very compelling subject for a movie, but the movie itself can’t afford to agree with him. “The Alto Knights” is steeped in Frank Costello’s mindset to a tedious extreme; it’s the last shot of “The Irishman” stretched out to 123 dramatically inert minutes of “haven’t we seen this 1,000 different times already?” Levinson knows we have, and he doesn’t seem all that excited about showing it to us all over again. But as the war between his twin De Niro’s makes all too clear, retiring is never as easy as it seems.

Written by 92-year-old “Goodfellas” scribe Nicholas Pileggi, produced by 93-year-old “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” producer Irwin Winkler, and shot by 81-year-old “Manhunter” cinematographer Dante Spinotti (whose only other feature since the pandemic is Nick Vallelonga’s “upcoming” musical rom-com “That’s Amore!”), “The Alto Knights” is a gangland tale by and about a handful of legends whose grip on their work has slackened to the point that most of them can’t bear to let it go. Costello is such a notable exception to that rule that Levinson and co. felt like they had to make a movie about him.

When this story begins in 1957, the acting boss of the Luciano crime family is ready to quit or die trying. Frank’s childhood best friend — the hot-headed and increasingly paranoid Vito Genovese, convinced that his rivals will keep gunning for him until they’re buried in the ground — insists upon that second option. Alas, the thick-headed goon that Vito sends to whack Frank in the lobby of his lux Manhattan apartment building (a swollen and unrecognizable Cosmo Jarvis as the aptly named Vincent Gigante) fails to follow through with a double-tap, and Frank survives with a scratch to the head. The botched attempt doesn’t only deepen Frank’s desire to head for the hills (and leave Vito even more determined to finish the job), it inspires Frank to roll back the tape and reflect on his entire life up to that point… which he does by talking directly into the camera as he clicks through a slide projector full of Photoshopped images from his youth. If you’ve ever watched “The Godfather Part II” and thought “I bet this would be better as a glorified Powerpoint presentation,” I’m afraid you might have been wrong about that.

Somehow, distilling Frank and Vito’s friendship into a series of still photographs and a few unnecessary snippets of black-and-white footage doesn’t create the kind of foundation this movie needs to invest our attention in the rivalry that catches up with its characters as old men (it doesn’t help that the “archival” clips inexplicably star a pair of young De Niro look-alikes, as if the image of young Vito Corleone hasn’t been seared into the collective unconscious for the last 50 years). What the history lesson does establish is the “this happened and then that happened and then this other thing happened” cadence of a film that never establishes the narrative rhythm it needs to anchor its story in any sort of present tense, and so “The Alto Knights” tends to exist as less of a crime drama than it does as a loose constellation of dimly recreated events (shot in Cincinnati to better resemble mid-century New York, this cheap-looking period epic tries to squeeze a full American epoch out of a few prop cars and some wonderfully expressive costumes).

That these events are recreated without any semblance of style or urgency is made all the more apparent by the fact that “The Alto Knights” hits most of its beats at least three times in a row, as the film was written and/or cut in a way that often finds its actors repeating the same basic emotion or piece of information from slightly different angles. It almost seems like the cast was trying to satisfy the specific inputs of a video game tutorial; at one point, the critic sitting next to me leaned over to ask “why does this movie feel like it was improvised?”

That fumbling quality creates a strange and uneasy tension with the specificity of watching someone act opposite themselves, and it does a disservice to the relative pleasures of De Niro’s two performances. The guy isn’t exactly breaking new ground here, and the conceit of his casting doesn’t really distract from the discomfort of seeing a mob movie icon prop up a project so derivative of the ones that made him immortal in the first place (imagine if Toshiro Mifune had been alive to star in “The Last Samurai”), but De Niro isn’t phoning this in, and it can be fun to see him play off two very different sides of his screen persona, even if there’s no real thematic weight behind the decision to cast him in both roles.

Known as the “prime minister of the Underworld,” Frank is cautious, rational, and so buttoned-up that he wears a full suit and tie just to watch TV at home with his wife (an unsubtle Debra Messing), and De Niro embodies him with the sedate and semi-vacant curmudgeonliness that the actor tends to bring to his talk show interviews. The highlight of this movie is unambiguously the scene where De Niro, as Frank, is forced to carry his wife’s small dog into the elevator of their apartment building. One of them is a Pomeranian, one of them is a Chorkie, and both of them are wearing little mink coats to keep warm from the New York winter, and also from the intense coldness of De Niro’s frown. It’s a moment of pure cinema in a film where everything else feels manufactured to death.

Vito, by contrast, “was raised on the side of a volcano.” He’s the type of mobster who executes his wife’s ex-husband just for having the temerity to eat at the same restaurant as they do, and De Niro — spray-tanned to hell and back, the tell-tale mole on his cheek digitally removed — inhabits him with the sort of comic fury that makes it seem like he’s channeling Joe Pesci. His friendship with Frank means nothing to Vito, which makes him a vaguely relatable character insofar as it means nothing to us either. Vito’s fiery but troubled relationship with Anna Genovese (Kathrine Narducci) means even less, but “The Alto Knights” is duty-bound to shoehorn it in here as part of the movie’s diligent history of the mafia’s undoing.

It’s ostensibly fascinating that a man like Frank Costello — who profited so much from the proliferation of organized crime — would play such a large role in scaling it down, but Levinson’s film is too busy laying the past to rest to bring it back to life, and “The Alto Knights” is never flatter or more overfamiliar than when it’s doing the things that should feel like gimmies to a well-heeled gangster film. A famous hit towards the end of the story is staged as though it were more beholden to the history of mob movies than it is to the history of the mob itself, while the story’s climax, which dramatically recreates one of the most daring gambits of Costello’s life, is dulled to death by the sheepishness of its telling.

It’s almost as if Frank can’t fathom why anyone today should care about the incredible true story of how some enterprising immigrants without a nickel to their names formed a multi-billion-dollar racket that shaped a huge part of 20th century America. The tragedy of “The Alto Knights” is that Levinson can’t either.

Grade: C-

The central bank left key interest rates unchanged, as expected. Happily for the markets, it also stuck to its previous guidance of two rate cuts this this year. It anticipated higher inflation — in large part due to tariffs — and slower economic growth. Fed chair Jerome Powell said the tariff impact on prices could be “transitory” and that the risk of recession is low.

That said, “There are so many things we don’t know,” he told reporters at a press conference, and “uncertainty is remarkably high.”

Media and tech stocks closed in the green pretty much across the board led by Roku (up 7%), Imax (up 6%), Warner Bros. Discovery (up 5%) and a few others that outpaced the broader market. Major media companies, broadcasters and exhibitors all ended higher.

Watch on Deadline

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 400 points. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Russell 3000 rebounded too.

Markets were in dire need of some calm after a hellish month of tariff chaos that eroded trillions of dollars of value and pushed both the S&P and Nasdaq into official correction territory.

“Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,” the Fed’s Open Market Committee said in a statement. The Fed’s dual mandate is to seek maximum employment and keep inflation in check at about 2% level. It uses interest rates as a tool to keep them in balance.

Powell said the U.S. has a “balanced labor market” and that high-profile layoff of tens of thousands of federal workers by Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has not trickled into national stats — yet at least.

President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, and tariff talk, that started early this year sparked trade wars with Canada, Mexico, China and Europe that are expected to result in higher consumer prices. The latest CPI data, however, showed inflation rose less than expected in February, although, as the Fed had said, still “somewhat elevated.”

Powell cautioned that it’s still early days. The administration is planning a big round of import taxes to take effect on April 2.

If and as prices rise, Powell also said that they’ll try but it’s incredibly complicated to separate out what is tariff related and what is not. Manufacturers can raise prices in anticipation of tariffs amid all the noise He noted a previous round of tariffs that hiked prices for washing machines, but the price of dryers – not subject to tariffs — also went up.

The Fed said its ongoing assessments “will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

Powell was also asked, as he has been for the past five months, if he’s concerned that the Fed’s independence is threatened. That’s especially pressing now as Trump yesterday fired the two Democratic FTC Commissioners, another of his outlier moves step into uncharted territory.

The Fed chief declined respond directly to that query today but noted that he’s answered it before and has nothing more to add. After the Fed’s November meeting, Powell, in response to a question, said that he would not resign if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to and that he doesn’t think the president has the legal authority to fire him.

“If he asked you to leave, would you go?” asked a journalist.

“No,” Powell responded.

“Do you think that legally you are not required to leave?”

“No.”",indiewire

Midway through the Yellowstone prequel’s sophomore run, viewership is on track to beat Season 1 by some 56%, Paramount reported on Wednesday.

That takes into account seven-day viewership of each of Season 2’s first four episodes. Episode 5 (of eight) drops this coming Sunday, March 23.

The Season 2 premiere, which arrived a full two years after the Western’s freshman finale, has to date delivered 17 million global viewers, up 41% vs. Season 1.

(All claims are based on internal streaming data. Paramount+ has not disclosed how it defines a “viewer,” but… you can at least compare Season 2 apples to Season 2 apples in this case.)

Hailing from prolific Yellowstone co-creator (and sometime-actor!) Taylor Sheridan, 1923 stars Academy Award winner Helen Mirren and Academy Award nominee Harrison Ford, leading an ensemble that includes Brandon Sklenar, Julia Schlaepfer, Jerome Flynn, Darren Mann, Brian Geraghty, Aminah Nieves, Michelle Randolph, Sebastian Roché, Timothy Dalton and Jennifer Carpenter.

In Season 2, which launched on Feb. 23, a cruel winter brings “new challenges and unfinished business to Jacob (played by Ford) and Cara (Mirren) back at Dutton ranch. With harsh conditions and adversaries threatening to end the Dutton legacy, Spencer (Sklenar) embarks on an arduous journey home, racing against time to save his family in Montana. Meanwhile, Alexandra (Schlaepfer) sets off on her own harrowing trans-Atlantic journey to find Spencer and reclaim their love.”

https://indiewire.com,The ACC Had a Rough Basketball Season. Here’s One Expert’s Fix,https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2025/acc-basketball-jay-bilas-spending-floor-1234843748/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:01:46 GMT","North Carolina’s First Four victory Tuesday night—after sneaking into the NCAA tournament as the last team selected—only partially makes up for what has been a rough basketball season for the ACC.

The conference placed four schools in the men’s draw, its lowest total in over a decade. Three coaches stepped down, adding to the group of now-seven likely Hall of Fame coaches retired since 2021. And while teams battled it out on the basketball court, conference lawyers were in courts of their own, fighting lawsuits from Florida State and Clemson—the league’s two most valuable members—who were looking to leave for greener pastures.

As college sports continues its rapid professionalization, the ACC is in a difficult spot. Financially, it is falling behind the two richest conferences, the Big Ten and SEC, trying to keep members (and expand) while preserving its status near the top of the NCAA’s power structure. The ACC’s settlement with FSU and Clemson, announced earlier this month, may keep the league intact until 2036 when its current media contract expires, but the entire industry will be turned on its head before then.

Success in football and men’s basketball is paramount to keeping pace in college sports. Sportico recently asked Jay Bilas, a former Duke star and one of ESPN’s most prominent college basketball experts, for his thoughts on how the ACC could reverse its recent trend. He suggested a few changes, all built around establishing a set of minimum standards that might lift the entire league.

“If I was in charge, I would have a spending floor,” Bilas said in an interview. “If you’re not spending X amount of dollars, then whatever you spend under that, you have to give to the other teams in the league.”

Sportico will be publishing daily stories about March Madness throughout the men’s and women’s tournaments. To receive them in your inbox each morning, sign up here via Club Sportico.

Bilas added that ACC schools should not be allowed to schedule “substandard teams” for its non-conference games, since it harms everyone in the league for metrics used by the NCAA Tournament selection committee. He also said the league “should be able to consult on coaching hires,” which is common in some other conferences.

“You’re a member of a league, the league should be able to mandate how you do things,” Bilas said, “Especially when there are significant repercussions on the rest of the league if you underperform.”

A representative for the ACC didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on whether the conference has considered spending floors. The American Athletic Conference earlier this month became the first league to issue a mandate—its teams, minus Army and Navy, will have to spend $10 million in additional benefits for athletes in the next three years. Failure to do so, according to American commissioner Tim Pernetti, could jeopardize a school’s membership. The Pac-12 is reportedly considering something similar.

ACC teams spent an average of $13.5 million on men’s basketball in 2022-23, according to data submitted annually to the Department of Education, the most of any conference. That said the gap is tightening. From 2017-18 to 2022-23, ACC teams reported a 20% increase in spending—the smallest increase among the major conferences and below the rate of inflation. The Big Ten’s spending jumped 21% in the span, followed by 30% in the Big 12, 33% in the SEC and 36% in the Pac-12.

This ACC basketball season wasn’t all bad. Duke received a No. 1 seed and is the tournament’s co-favorite. The Blue Devils are also a No. 2 seed in the women’s draw.

That said, volume matters. Conferences are compensated directly for each team they place in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament (and starting this year, the women’s tournament too). The payout structure is complex, but in simple terms: for every game an ACC team plays during the men’s tournament this year prior to the final, the league will receive about $2 million, paid over six years. That money is distributed back to schools. North Carolina’s surprise selection was worth about $2 million, and that will increase for each successive game played by the Tar Heels, Duke, Louisville and Clemson (including UNC’s win Tuesday).

The SEC, on the other hand, placed a record 14 teams in the tournament. The Big Ten was next with eight teams, followed by the Big 12 with seven and the Big East with five.

Us Weekly confirmed in March 2025 that Sia filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split. The pair’s date of separation was listed one day before she filed.

The documents revealed that she and Bernard share a baby, Somersault Wonder, who was born in 2024. (Sia is also mom to two sons whom she adopted as teens who were aging out of the foster care system in 2019.)

The court documents list Sia and Bernard’s wedding date as December 2022, despite news of their marriage breaking in May 2023 when they held an intimate ceremony in Italy.

She was previously married to Erik Anders Lang from 2024 to 2016. “After much soul searching and consideration we have made the decision to separate as a couple,” the pair told Us in a statement at the time. “We are, however, dedicated to remaining friends. There will be no further comment.”

Years later, Sia shared that her first divorce “really threw me for a loop.” She added during a September 2023 interview on Apple Music 1 with Zane Lowe, “That was such a dark time that I was in bed for three years, really, really severely depressed. And so I couldn’t really do anything for that period of time.”

https://usmagazine.com,Why AJ McLean’s Daughter Hates Classic Backstreet Boys Song,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/why-aj-mcleans-daughter-hates-classic-backstreet-boys-song/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:04:39 GMT","AJ McLean revealed that his 12-year-old daughter, Elliott McLean, is definitely not a fan of the Backstreet Boys’ 1999 hit “I Want It That Way.”

“My oldest daughter hates that song, hates it with a passion,” AJ, 47, told People in an interview published on Tuesday, March 18.

Elliott has an understandable aversion to the classic boy band track: she’s been subject to frequent teasing from her classmates over the beloved millennial ballad.

“She gets teased at school when she walks into school,” he confirmed. “When I drop her off, the boys [sing the lyrics], ‘Tell me why,’ and she’s like, ‘Stop doing that’ … And then I start doing it to embarrass her because that’s what dads do!”

AJ McLean achieved fame as a member of the Backstreet Boys, but a fair share of challenges have come along with his worldwide success. In 1992, the “Larger than Life” performer auditioned for the boyband and became the first official member of BSB. He was later joined by Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Kevin […]

Luckily for McLean, he discovered that Elliott does “secretly” love some Backstreet Boys songs — even if she won’t admit to it.

“We love [‘I Want It That Way’]. We love showing the meaning,” he added.

In 2022, AJ confirmed that his then-9-year-old daughter — whom he shares with former wife Rochelle McLean — asked to change her name from Ava to Elliott.

“For those asking, not that it’s anyone’s business, but Elliot’s name change is not a gender thing,” Rochelle, 43, later explained via her Instagram Story in August 2024. “‘Ava’ has changed her name quite a few times since she was about five. Last year she asked us to start calling her Elliot and it stuck. She wanted something unique that no one else had. (There are so many Ava’s.)”

AJ told People in September 2022 that he was fully supportive of his daughter’s name change simply because it made her happy.

“When my daughter asked to change her name to Elliott, initially, I didn’t know if it was a transgender thing, which it is not, but it is a personal choice,” he said at the time. “And it is her body, it’s her name, it’s her everything. And she’s still Ava. She’ll always be Ava to me.”

The singer went on, “At the same time, whatever reasoning it is, that’s hers, and I’m going to support it a million percent, my wife will [too].”

AJ and Rochelle announced in a joint statement on New Year’s Day in 2024 that they were splitting after nearly 12 years of marriage. The couple confirmed a separation the previous year.

“As you all know we have been separated for over a year now,” the couple said. “While we have hoped for reconciliation we have decided to officially end our marriage. It is with deep love and respect that we have made this decision.”

Their statement continued, “Our focus now is moving forward in the healthiest possible way with friendship and coparenting our girls at the forefront of this next chapter. We appreciate your kindness respect and privacy at this time.”

Cooke launched his alcohol brand, Loverboy, in 2018, with his now-wife, Amanda Batula, and friend Carl Radke by his side. Five years later, the canned cocktails landscape had grown even bigger and pal Conover jumped on the bandwagon.

When Conover announced in April 2024 that he was an investor in Spritz Society, Cooke claimed there was “no bad blood” between them. However, Cooke confessed during a May 2024 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen that it “rubbed me the wrong way” how Conover told him he was working with a competitor.

“First and foremost, all my friends that I’ve filmed with know that I’ve raised money,” Cooke later claimed during a June 2024 episode of the “Trading Secrets” podcast. “The only person that ever expressed interest was Carl.”

The Summer House costars, who tied the knot in September 2021, took fans behind the scenes of their contentious pre-wedding planning on season […]

Cooke, who has known Conover since 2018, alleged, “Craig never expressed interest. He never once asked to invest in Loverboy.”

Scroll down for a complete timeline of Cooke and Conover’s drama surrounding Loverboy — and see where they stand now:

The Initial Announcement

“I’m so excited to announce that I am now an investor in @spritz! I first found out about Spritz last summer when me and Paige [DeSorbo] were on our way to @taylorswift at Metlife and the party bus was stocked with these delicious wine spritzers,” Conover wrote in a lengthy Instagram post in April 2024. “One sip was all it took for me to realize they were onto something and I needed to learn more about the brand — I loved the concept of a refreshing wine based drink & how they brought everyone together.”

He gushed, “I’m so excited to be in the Spritz Society family and for y’all to see the amazing projects we’ve got in the works.”

Craig Breaks Down His Spritz Choice

“Obviously I’ve always had respect for Austen [Kroll] and Kyle and all of them but being in the liquor business or wine liquor business now, I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is a new territory,’” Conover told Page Six in May 2024, referring to Kroll’s Trop Hop beer and Cooke’s Loverboy alcohol brand.

Conover noted that he has “always respected Kyle’s hustle,” but he also “didn’t understand it at times” until he got involved in the industry. “I understand why he’s had to work so hard, because the grind in the alcohol business is extreme,” he added.

Conover alleged that prior to the Spritz Society investment, he “offered to buy into” Kroll’s beer company but Kroll declined his offer. Conover also claimed he “would have loved to invest” in Loverboy, but “that wasn’t an option.”

Kyle Goes on ‘Watch What Happens Live’

Cooke initially told Andy Cohen on a May 2024 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen that there was “no bad blood” between him and Conover over Spritz Society. “I think this is being blown out of proportion,” he explained. “I don’t really think there was an investment, and it seems like all the press is referencing me.”

Cooke later said, “Look, I wish him the best, but the way he handled it, and we don’t have time to get into it, really rubbed me the wrong way, and I’m just trying to take the high road.” He alleged Conover “has a reputation of lying and he lied to me.”

The Investor Issue

After Spritz Society founder Ben Soffer’s wife, Claudia Oshry, claimed during a May 2024 episode of “The Toast” podcast that Cooke denied Conover the ability to invest in Loverboy — and alleged that Loverboy has no investors — Cooke addressed the drama.

“I don’t know what got lost in translation. Loverboy has investors, we’ve had investors since 2019,” Cooke said on Jason Tartick’s “Trading Secrets” podcast in June 2024. “I value them immensely. I’ve had lots of them texting me saying, ‘What in the heck is going on?’ I could not have done it without them.”

Cooke claimed that Conover was well aware that he was looking for investors and fundraising opportunities when they were in Vermont for Winter House in March 2022.

“I am not a sole owner. I wanna make that very clear,” Cooke said on the podcast. “We were actually fundraising — I was very vocal about this with my close friends, Craig included, during Winter House [season 2]. I was busy raising a round of financing. It’s like, this is not a secret.”

Kyle’s Spritz Society Conversation

Nearly two years after Cooke was fundraising in early 2022, he crossed paths with Soffer, Spritz Society’s founder, in New York City. “He had DMed me when we were both at an industry conference in January. And per the timeline his wife laid out, he was already in talks with Craig,” Cooke explained in June 2024 as to how he first connected with Soffer, noting the pair agreed to go to dinner the following month.

“This dinner ended up taking place about two weeks before Craig and I got drinks. We’re talking like receipts and timelines these days [so] dinner was February 7th,” Cooke confirmed. “I really enjoyed the conversation.”

The Summer House star recalled Soffer eventually saying, “‘Hey, maybe we could collab and like throw a party, kind of cross pollinate our audiences.’” While Cooke was entertaining the idea, he learned that Soffer was with Conover the following day and Soffer “never mentioned” it.

“I didn’t know at this time that him and Craig were talking about a collab,” Cooke said, noting, “He knows Craig and I are friends. … I just wish he was a little more transparent with his intentions.”

Cooke confessed that found it “extremely odd” that Soffer didn’t tell him or Conover that he’d been spending time with the other person all while working on an investment deal with Conover.

How Craig Told Kyle About His Spritz Society Situation

Shortly after Cooke met with Soffer in NYC, Conover reached out to go to get drinks in the Big Apple. “It all kind of unfolded in early February, Craig and I got drinks,” Cooke said during the June 2024 podcast episode. “I thought it was just to catch up.”

Cooke claimed that “10 minutes before” their friend Tom Schwartz showed up at the bar, Conover “sprung” his Spritz Society deal on him.

“It sounded very much like the offer on the table was [that] he was being given equity and then boom, he actually left [the bar] early and that was it,” Cooke recalled. “The next day I texted him like, ‘Hey man, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to what you said about this opportunity you have, and please, like, hold off from signing anything. I’d love to put an offer on the table to kind of counter it.’”

Cooke alleged that after some “back and forth” Conover told him it was “too late” for Cooke to counter with a Loverboy offer.

“I just figured he’d at least give me an opportunity to [be] like, ‘Hear me out,’” Cooke continued. “To be honest, I kind of feared that this would impact our friendship because this has been my blood sweat and tears for the last five years.”

Cooke admitted he is “sensitive” about his company, revealing that while he doesn’t need Conover involved in Loverboy he was surprised by the move to go with Spritz Society.

“I just didn’t think one of my good friends would go hop in bed with a competitor,” he said. “You know, that’s it. That was the extent of our conversation.”

‘Watch What Happens Live’ Debacle

Cooke revealed that after his chat with Conover in February 2024, he chose to keep it to himself and not bring up the news publicly. However, that changed when Cohen asked him about their Loverboy quarrel on WWHL in May 2024.

“You’re in the hot seat. … I’ll be honest, like, he caught me off guard, Andy Cohen,” Cooke recalled during the June 2024 podcast, referring to the talk show appearance. “I was ready to talk about Summer House, and I hadn’t thought about this in a while. And I let my emotions get the best of me.”

The reality star continued, “Up until then, I had very consciously decided not to comment via the various press requests about Craig’s involvement in this competitor. I was very much focused on keeping this a private matter.”

Cooke said that it was not his intention to bring it up when he did. He noted that he is not only friends with Conover but he’s close with the Southern Charm star’s then-girlfriend, DeSorbo, as well. (Conover and DeSorbo split in November 2024 after three years of dating.)

“The last thing I’m trying to do is make it awkward for any of us,” Cooke shared, adding that he wishes he “wasn’t so reactionary” on WWHL. (Cooke claimed at the time that Conover “has a reputation of lying and he lied to me.”)

Cooke stands by what he said to Cohen about Conover but confessed he “could have handled it better.” He added: “Sometimes I’m right, but it’s my delivery and it’s my tone and my temper [that] make me dead wrong.”

A Hopeful Future

“I’m pretty bummed with how everything went down,” Cooke told Tartick in June 2024, explaining that the “only choice” now is to “hopefully” not let the career decision “interfere with our friendship.”

Cooked continued: “In all seriousness, I hope to have a chance to talk with Craig. I wanna squash the beef. Like, what’s done is done. I tell ’em straight up like, ‘I’m sorry for being reactionary and Watch What Happens.’”

He concluded, “The irony here is it’s really not about two startups competing against one another. It’s trying to stay relevant in an industry that is really good at keeping the startups small.”

His Instagram Comment

Following Cooke’s appearance on Tartick’s podcast, he doubled down on claims that Conover “never” expressed interest in investing with an Instagram comment.

“The more I think about it, the more I think Craig was intentionally or unintentionally trying to justify things and misled Claudia and Ben as to what we discussed,” Cooke wrote in a comment left on Tartick’s June 2024 Instagram post. “Craig NEVER asked me to invest and never offered to reconsider anything.”

Who Is Summer Houses’ No. 1 Guy in the Group?

Craig’s Rep Weighs In

“Craig is deeply disappointed and saddened by Kyle’s abrupt accusations,” a rep for Conover told Page Six in June 2024 after Cooke’s appearance on the “Trading Secrets” podcast. “The truth only hurts one person in this instance, and it’s not Craig. Therefore, he will not comment further on this matter nor be drawn into an unprofessional arena.”

The statement continued: “Craig has learned to blame himself and not others for everything that happens in his life, including the success of his products and companies. He looks forward to continuing to share his life with everyone and thanks all his friends and supporters, whom he views as family.”

The Cameras Were Rolling

Conover exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2024 that his feud with Cooke was captured by the Summer House cameras. “Unfortunately for you, we did film it,” he teased, confirming season 9 highlights their issues. “That has to carry the tag of you have to wait and watch that.”

Despite their tension during summer 2024, Conover explained they had moved forward. “I love Kyle and we have a really fun history and relationship and he’s one of my favorite people on the network,” he revealed. “I’m glad I was able to go out there and you’ll get to see how that all went.”

The Fences Are Mended

“Andy [Cohen] caught me off guard,” Cooke exclusively told Us at Us Weekly + Pluto TV Reality Stars of the Year Party in October 2024, reflecting on his and Conover’s drama.

Cooke explained, “Ultimately, I cherish friendship above everything else and I think that’s why I was hurt. But [Craig and I are] good. We’re good.”

No Beef With the Oshry Family

After being pulled into Conover and Cooke’s drama, Spritz Society founders Soffer, his wife, Claudia, and her sister, Jackie Oshry, sent a press release titled “Summer House — All About the Canned Cocktail at the Center of the Feud on This Week’s Episode” to announce the drink expanding its markets.

“I mean, I’m the least surprised. I think the only press they’ve received in the last year has had my name on it — or my show,” Cooke said in response to the press release in March 2025 while attending Page Six’s “Virtual Reali-Tea” live event.

Cooke told Us and the rest of the fans in attendance that he didn’t have any issues with the Oshry sisters and Soffer’s business. “Ben, Claudia, you guys are good, I don’t mind anyone jumping into the alcohol [space],” he added. “It’s really just when integrity is compromised is when I have an issue.”

During the same March 2025 “Virtual Reali-Tea” event, Radke backed Cooke and poked fun at Conover’s investment history.

“We were at a bar last week that Craig is an investor in and the bartender was asked about that producer and he said it was the worst thing he’s ever had,” Radke claimed. “That’s what the guy told me. … Kyle was right there. We just asked, ‘How is this?’ And he said, ‘It’s so horrible.’ He actually gave it to someone for free because it was so bad.”

Cooke, meanwhile, reiterated that his biggest issue with Conover over the alcohol drink company was pegged to how Conover depicted the events publicly. “Maybe he forgets saying this [in] an interview, but he called himself an incredible liar. Rewind the tapes,” Cooke alleged at the event.

He teased, “There’s so much more to the story,” that Cooke said would “start coming out a lot more easily” now that Conover isn’t dating his friend DeSorbo.

Ferriera, 28, portrayed Kat on the first two seasons of the HBO drama, but will not return for season 3, which is currently in production. Though rumors circulated at the time of her exit that she walked off set due to behind-the-scenes drama, Ferreira recently told Nick Viall that the reality is much less dramatic.

“I think it was very mutual so it wasn’t just my choice,” she said on the Wednesday, March 19 episode of “The Viall Files” podcast. “There was just nowhere to go and I think instead of me just lingering around for nine months, I think it was best for both of us that we just kind of ended it there.”

Since leaving Euphoria, Ferreira has taken to the stage. Her most recent project was on Broadway, where she starred in the play Cult of Love. She said her Euphoria costars were there to support her.

Even though the entire season hinted at Fez’s (Angus Cloud) potential demise, it was actually his little brother that ended up dying after they were sold out to the police. Instead of allowing Fez to take […]

“I saw Hunter [Schafer] the other day, I saw Maude {Apatow] the other day, Sydney [Sweeney] came to see my play,” she said. “So I mean they’re all so busy. I mean, I’ve been out of town for, like, eight months so I’m like, whoever is in town, we always try to see each other and they came to support the play, which was really sweet.”

Ferreira has moved on, but that doesn’t mean she was eager to leave Euphoria. She explained that “Kat means the world to me” and that she dedicated years of her life to the character.

“But you don’t want to ruin a good thing,” she added. “Everyone decided there was nowhere to go and that’s hard, obviously. Again, with acting, things happen all the time and you have to have a thick skin and just make the right decisions for you and your career.”

Related: More Key 'Euphoria' Characters Are Officially Not Returning for Last Season Eddy Chen/HBO The third season of Euphoria has officially started filming after a major delay — but not every fan favorite is returning for more episodes of the show. Euphoria, which premiered in 2019, follows troubled high school student Rue (Zendaya) as she struggles to remain sober after rehab. The ensemble cast initially included Hunter […]

And, just to dispel the persistent rumors, she said, “I never walked off set, there was never anything like that. I absolutely never did that. You could ask the hundreds of people who were there every day.”

Which Is the Best Teen Drama of All Time?

Ferreira also touched on her former castmate Angus Cloud, who died in 2023 of a multiple drug overdose at the age of 25.

“I don’t think I’ve ever been through anything like that. We all were just really affected by it,” she said. “Angus was the coolest guy, the craziest dude, the amount of stories…I think about him a lot. He was incredible. He was a complete sweetheart, a character. It’s really tragic.”

Euphoria season 3 is expected to premiere in 2026 and will feature a time jump, taking the main cast out of high school. Series regulars Sweeney, Zendaya, and Jacob Elordi will all return, while Grammy Award winner Rosalía, NAACP Image Award winner Kadeem Hardison and former pro football player Marshawn Lynch join the cast.",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,Southern Charm’s Venita Aspen Breaks Down JT Thomas Dating Timeline,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/southern-charms-venita-aspen-breaks-down-jt-thomas-dating-timeline/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 20:21:18 GMT","Venita Aspen is “done” with Jarrett “JT” Thomas after their brief romance — and subsequently being labeled a “homewrecker.”

“I’ve never had someone do me so dirty,” Venita, 31, exclusively told Us Weekly on Wednesday, March 19, while reflecting on her highs and lows with JT, 40.

During season 10 of Southern Charm, Venita and JT’s friendship blossomed into something more. Due to editing, Venita claimed she was depicted as a “homewrecker” as JT revealed on the show that he had a girlfriend. (After the girlfriend was announced, scenes from Venita coming onto JT in the Bahamas aired, which she said were out of order.)

Venita exclusively clarified to Us the real timeline of her and JT’s romance. She revealed that Southern Charm was filmed during spring 2024 into that summer. Once the cameras stopped rolling, Venita and JT gave their relationship a shot.

“We started dating when I got back from New York in September [2024]. It was from September, October, November,” she recalled. “Trying to figure out, ‘OK, are we doing this? Do we actually like each other? Is it because we’re around each other all the time?’”

Venita said in November 2024, JT “posted that he had the girlfriend on Instagram,” which she revealed was “how I found out” he was dating someone else named Ali Pereless.

The influencer noted that she and JT “were just dating” and had not talked about being exclusive at the time.

Related: Southern Charm’s Venita Says JT 'Popped Up' With a GF Amid Their Romance Venita Aspen is spilling the sweet tea about her romance with Jarrett “JT” Thomas — and according to her, it didn’t end well. “I was also excited to come in [this season] with my best friend JT. That was fun,” Venita said of Southern Charm season 10 during the Thursday, January 16, episode of Access […]

“I think it would’ve been nice to just have him be like, ‘Hey by the way, I’m dating someone else, and I’ve decided to go with her versus you,’” Venita explained, claiming, “I would not have cared. I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I appreciate you so much for saying something, being kind about it.’ But he didn’t do that.”

Venita told Us that the girlfriend mentioned on the show is the same one that JT posted about on Instagram months later. However, according to the Bravo star, JT and Ali “weren’t a thing at the time” when she dated him last fall.

“[At least] that I know of. That’s what he was telling me, and I was believing him and trusting him in that,” Venita shared. “It’s too messy. It’s so messy. And I just wish that he could just come out and be like, ‘Hey, listen, I caused all this. I made things messy. Don’t be mad at either [of] these women. I should have done a better job at communicating with both of them what was going on and what I was doing.’”

Related: Southern Charm's Venita Spent $5K on JT Before Knowing About His Girlfriend Southern Charm star Venita Aspen offered further insight on her relationship — or lack thereof — with Jarret “JT” Thomas. “I’m on a walk and I call JT and I say, ‘Hey, listen, I want you to come with me to this event as my date.’ He goes, ‘You know, I don’t think my girlfriend’s […]

She noted it would be “so simple” to clear the air on JT’s part and “be the man that you want all the rest of the guys on the cast to be.”

Venita further alleged that JT didn’t choose that route and left her without any explanation about his love life after going Instagram official with Ali.

Instead, she revealed, “He quit a week after that.” (JT announced in November 2024 that he was exiting Southern Charm before completing his season 10 confessional interviews.)

“I actually don’t know why he quit. I can’t put those two things together. It is not making sense,” Venita confessed. “I’m like, ‘OK, you’re doing this. You’re posting that you have this girlfriend, whatever, but why are you quitting the show? Is it because you were lying about things and that you’re afraid to get caught in those lies?’ That’s the only thing that made sense in my head.”

Venita explained that after JT went public with his girlfriend in fall 2024 — and Southern Charm released a super teaser about the show — she allegedly received hate DMs from the other woman.

At the time, Venita decided to take a step back from JT and stopped talking to him for six months before they filmed the season 10 reunion earlier this year.

What Is The Biggest Moment from Southern Charm?

“I think that’s the part that actually hurts me more. I am mourning my best friend,” she admitted. “We had such fun together. We used to shoot the s—. We would go golfing and dinners and walks in the morning and breakfast and working moments and it was just like I lost all of that and it sucked.”

Venita revealed that she now feels like she’s “collateral damage” after being caught in the crossfire of JT’s alleged misconduct. “Right now, he’s just trying to do anything to tear me down and I don’t like that. That’s not a friend,” she mused.

Venita teased that fans will see her confront JT about their relationship on the season 10 Southern Charm reunion, which airs in two parts starting on Thursday, March 27.

She noted that although she was “sad” after the taping, she briefly left the door open for a possible reconciliation. However, after JT allegedly left her out to dry in the press, Venita told Us there is no way back for them.

Related: ‘Southern Charm’ Cast Reacts to JT Leaving Show: ‘He Was No Longer Wanted’ Jarrett “JT” Thomas raised more than a few eyebrows when he announced his exit from Southern Charm weeks before season 10 was set to premiere — and his castmates took notice. “I think it became more of this, like, he caught the house on fire and then stepped away when everyone had a reaction — […]

“Now the door’s completely shut. Closed and barred. Padlocked. No one’s getting here,” she confirmed. “I was still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and be like, just communicate with me and talk me through it. … I was willing to give him the chance to be like, ‘This is what happened. I’m so sorry. Can we try this again?’”

Venita added that once she saw JT “trying to make me this liar and not standing up against the fact that I’m a homewrecker” she had her answer. “That says a lot about who he is. And I cannot be with someone like that,” she concluded.

JT, for his part, claimed via his Instagram Story on Wednesday that Southern Charm “has basically shattered both relationships” for him, referring to Venita and Ali.

“In time, I hope the friendships can be restored fully with both … and in the meantime, I just want peace,” he wrote.

The Southern Charm season 10 finale airs on Bravo Thursday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.

“According to the reported information, the decedent Jeffrey Baena is a 47-year-old Caucasian male,” the medical examiner wrote in the synopsis of an investigative summary report, which was obtained by Us Weekly. “He was experiencing recent marital difficulties and was separated from his wife since September 2024.”

News broke in January that Baena died by suicide after he was found unconscious inside his Los Angeles home. According to the medical examiner’s report, Baena’s dog walker discovered his body.

“This is an unimaginable tragedy,” a spokesperson for Plaza, 40, told Us in a statement that month. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who has offered support. Please respect our privacy during this time.”

In addition to Plaza, the late director is survived by his parents and other relatives. Baena and the actress had been together for 14 years, initially meeting in 2011 before tying the knot in 2020.

“A lot of things happened during COVID for me. Yes, we got married. Big deal,” Plaza recalled during a December 2021 appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. “We got a little bored one night. We got married and I’ll tell you how: Onehourmarriage.com. That’s real, look it up.”

She added, “We were in the lockdown. Things got a little crazy, especially in my house. My husband got really into tie-dying and when I say tie-dying, I mean 50 shirts a day.”

According to Plaza, she hoped to “do something” special for their 10th anniversary.

Things of that nature,” the Parks and Recreation alum recalled at the time. “Then the man from Alhambra showed up in a Hawaiian shirt with a briefcase [to perform the ceremony]. … I can’t remember a lot of it, it was fuzzy. But I’m pretty sure it’s legal.”

Plaza and Baena also collaborated on the big screen in the likes of movies Life After Death, The Little Hours and Spin Me Round.

“She’s awesome. I’d be working with her if she wasn’t my wife, but luckily she is my wife,” Baena told Reel Talker in August 2022 of Plaza’s career. “The opportunity to do something creative [together] where we’re both fulfilled — how rare is that?”

Plaza has not further addressed Baena’s death or their alleged separation. She made her first public appearance since his passing, after skipping the Golden Globes, at the SNL 50 anniversary special in February. Plaza, a former SNL intern, introduced Miley Cyrus and Brittany Howard’s joint musical performance.

As Plaza welcomed the musicians to the stage, she wore a tie-dye T-shirt underneath a blazer. Fans immediately speculated that the DIY top was a nod to Baena’s own wedding attire.

Rossdale, 59, reflected on his and Stefani’s shared home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles while sitting down with Jesse Tyler Ferguson for the Tuesday, March 18, episode of the “Dinner’s on Me” podcast.

“Oh, [I had] unbelievable memories because that was such an exciting time,” Rossdale said of the shared house while learning Ferguson, 49, lived there after he and Stefani, 55, sold it. “I was there for a number of years when we just were together. I was there when we first got married. We had our first kid there.”

The Bush singer continued to share rare insight into his time with Stefani before their 2015 split, praising her design aesthetic in their L.A. pad. “Gwen did a beautiful job on the nursery,” Rossdale recalled. “That house has fantastic memories.”

The No Doubt singer filed for divorce […]

He remembered hosting “amazing” New Year’s Eve parties “every year” with the Voice coach. “We never knew what to do, so it was easier to make the party come to us. So fantastic times,” Rossdale said.

The British rocker noted that when he and Stefani lived in that house it was “right at the height of everything really fun” in his career.

“It was really a great time for us,” he continued. “So I have a great memory of that house. … Beautiful time.”

And I think we just parent,” […]

Ferguson agreed that the house was “such a special place” for him and his husband, Justin Mikita, as well, since it was where they welcomed their first child. “I would still get your Restoration Hardware catalog,” he said with a laugh.

Rossdale and Stefani tied the knot in 2002. They went on to welcome three sons, Kingston, 18, Zuma, 16, and Apollo, 11, during their marriage. (Rossdale also shares daughter Daisy, 36, with ex Pearl Lowe.)

The pair announced their separation in August 2015 after 13 years of marriage. “While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment,” Rossdale and Stefani told Us Weekly in a joint statement at the time. “To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time.”

The exes finalized their divorce in 2016, and Stefani moved to have the marriage annulled in 2020 after she got engaged to Blake Shelton. Once the annulment was granted by the Catholic church, Stefani and Shelton, 48, got married in July 2021.

Rossdale, who is now dating Xhoana Xheneti, has been somewhat quiet about his and Stefani’s divorce over the years. However, he confessed in March 2024 that he regretted not working harder to have a friendship with his ex-wife.

“The biggest thing would be when you see the kids that sometimes there’s a loss,” Rossdale said during an episode of the “Amy and T.J.” podcast. “It’d be nice if there was sort of more of a connection with the person who made them with me.”

The singer added that since their split, he made a conscious choice not to speak poorly about Stefani or their relationship.

“Less said, soonest mended and I said nothing,” Rossdale explained. “It’s not my place to say anything. I’m handcuffed because I would never want to overly say anything negative about their mom. That’s just not right.”

Rossdale has continued to take that approach, speaking only positively about Stefani on the “Dinner’s on Me” podcast.

“I’d been inspired by Gwen,” he told Ferguson when asked about becoming a solo artist. “She’d done an amazing job with her solo career. So, I thought, ‘Oh that’s possible.’ But with her of course she made it possible because effortlessly going into pop like that.”",usmagazine

https://usmagazine.com,"Stars Who Have Responded to Kanye West’s Tweets: Iggy Azalea, More",https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/stars-who-have-responded-to-kanye-wests-tweets-iggy-azalea-more/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:54:46 GMT","Kanye West continues to cause controversy with his latest storm of offensive tweets.

West, who changed his name to Ye in 2021, has a long history of espousing antisemitic views, though he has tried to walk them back at various points. The rapper ignited controversy again in February 2025 by writing via social media that he “loves Hitler” and asked for jewelers to make him “swastika chain designs.”

The “Power” musician has also been widely condemned for his defense of Sean “Diddy” Combs in light of the latter’s federal sex trafficking and related charges (for which Diddy has pleaded not guilty).

As if West wasn’t facing enough scrutiny, he has alarmed many with his comments about his “dominion” over wife Bianca Censori. (Censori, for her part, denied writing a viral “plea” about West and has been by his side at events.)

Keep scrolling for a look at some famous faces who have responded to West’s most recent firestorm:

Playboi Carti

The release of Playboi Carti’s third studio album, Music, has been somewhat overshadowed by West’s criticism of the record. West is credited as a producer on the track “Backd00r” but later condemned Carti for including Kendrick Lamar on three of Music’s tracks.

Related: Ben Platt: ‘I Really Notice All of the Silence’ Amid Rising Antisemitism Taking a stand. Reese Witherspoon, Kim Kardashian and more celebrities spoke out against anti-Semitism amid the growing backlash to Kanye West‘s comments. “Hate speech is never OK or excusable,” the Skims mogul, 42, tweeted on Monday, October 24. “I stand together with the Jewish community and call on the terrible violence and hateful rhetoric towards […]

“I don’t like Kendrick Lamar’s music,” West complained via X. “He raps very good, but I didn’t need to hear him on Carti[‘s] album.”

He took issue with Carti messaging his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, to playfully ask for a future musical collaboration with her and West’s daughter North West. Kardashian later shared the message on her Instagram Story, sparking an outburst from West.

“Hey North your dad gave me my biggest song and co sign and I left him off of my album because of his tweets oh but North you my niece I gotta use your vocals,” West tweeted. “I held my tongue about mot[sic] being on Carti album him going to my ex to ask my daughter to be on a song 2 days later was too far nobody finna play with me.”

Carti’s response via social media was swift and blunt, telling West: “Ye STFU.”

West later insisted: “I decided North won’t be doing any songs with Carti. How it look for me to get left off the album and then he ask Kim to have vocals from my daughter? I don’t give a f— about none of this industry s—.”

Iggy Azalea

West continued his vendetta against Playboi Carti by targeting his ex-girlfriend Azalea, with whom he has a 5-year-old son named Onyx. The couple split around the time Azaela gave birth in June 2020.

In a series of tweets, West warned that unless Azalea let her young son contribute vocals to one of his tracks, he would “rap about one of [her] businesses.” Azalea responded by asking West to keep her 5-year-old son out of his beef with Carti.

“Ye, I understand the point you want to make. I say this with kindness & as a mother: Please, leave my child out of this,” she wrote via X.

She argued that bringing Onyx into the situation “creates a digital legacy & an odd (s*****) situation for him to one day discover & endure in perpetuity from strangers online.”

West responded with a crude tweet saying he “intentionally never smashed” Azalea because of her rumored dating history.

Cassie

West has been a staunch supporter of Diddy since the latter was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution in September 2024. In March 2025, West announced the release of a new song, “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” featuring his daughter North and Diddy.

West took aim at Diddy’s ex-girlfriend Cassie, who filed suit against the producer in 2023 over alleged abuse allegations. Diddy denied Cassie’s accusations but ultimately settled the suit.

“HOW EVERY N—- YOU KNOW HIT A GIRL BEFORE BUT EVERYBODY SO MAD AT PUFF,” Ye wrote on Tuesday, March 18 (via Vibe). “SO CASSIE AINT EXTORT PUFF?”

Related: Ty Dolla Sign Denounces 'Hate Speech' After Kanye West’s Antisemitic Posts Ty Dolla $ign is taking a stance against hate speech following Kanye West’s antisemitic online rants. “I don’t condone ANY form of hate speech towards anybody,” Dolla $ign, 42, wrote via his Instagram Story on Tuesday, February 11, alongside a series of first emojis in various skin tones. Dolla $ign (real name Tyrone William Griffin […]

He continued, “CASSIE CAME TO PUFF AND SAID GIMME 30 MILLION OR IMA RELEASE A TELL ALL BOOK THATS LOOK LIKE EXTORTION TO ME.”

Cassie responded on her Instagram Story by sharing Playboi Carti’s tweet: “YE STFU.”

Punch

Terrence “Punch” Henderson Jr. weighed in on the criticism of Lamar’s featured slots on Playboi Carti’s Music mere moments after West tweeted.

“Aye… What’s up with this Kanye West n—-,” Punch tweeted just 20 minutes after West slammed Lamar on his X account.

Punch has a long professional relationship with Lamar, as he is the president of the hip-hop icon’s former record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). He also executive produced Lamar’s debut solo album Section.80 in 2011.

David Schwimmer

The former Friends star has been hugely vocal in his opposition to West over the last several years. He wrote via Instagram in February that while it was impossible to “stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bile,” social media companies should step in to deplatform him.

Schwimmer specifically referenced West calling himself “a Nazi” and perpetuating the harmful stereotype that Jewish people “steal” money from their coworkers.

Related: Everything Kanye West Lost After Series of Antisemitic Social Media Posts Victor Boyko/Getty Images Kanye West has found himself at the center of controversy — again — after sharing a series of antisemitic posts during a days-long social media rant. West turned heads on Friday, February 7, when he shared a series of X posts that included antisemitic remarks, the rapper praising Hitler and him declaring […]

“Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,” Schwimmer argued.

The actor went on, “I don’t know what’s worse, the fact that he identifies as a Nazi (which implies he wants to exterminate ALL marginalized communities including his own) or the fact that there is not sufficient OUTRAGE to remove and ban him from all social media at this point. Silence is complicity.”

Amber Rose

The model spoke out after Kanye defended his wife, Censori, for wearing a see-through dress at the 2025 Grammy Awards in February.

“My wife’s first red carpet opened a whole new world,” he tweeted on February 6. “I keep staring at this photo like I was staring in admiration that night Thinking wow I am so lucky to have a wife that is so smart talented brave and hot.”

West’s tweets took a decidedly dark turn the following day as he wrote, “I have dominion over my wife. This ain’t no woke as feminist s—.”

Rose, who dated West from 2008 to 2010, told the “Club Shay Shay” podcast on March 5 that the rapper was “for sure dressing [Censori] like that.”

“He did the same thing to me and Kim [Kardashian]. That’s who he is. He wants other men to want his woman. That’s what he’s into. He likes that,” she insisted.

“He likes that men are drooling over his woman,” Rose added. “That’s what he is into.”

X

Twitter / X owner Elon Musk suspended West’s account in December 2022 for violating the social media company’s “rule against incitement to violence” with his tweets against the Jewish community. However, Musk reversed course in 2023 by reactivating West’s account, along with a number of other controversial figures.

Numerous activists and X users have once again called on Musk to ban West from the platform following his latest string of offensive tweets. While no action has yet been taken in that direction, X users are now warned of “potentially sensitive content” when they navigate to West’s account.",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,The Handmaid's Tale Season 6: What to Know About the Final Season,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-handmaids-tale-season-6-what-to-know-about-the-final-season/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:55:39 GMT","The Handmaid’s Tale cast and fans alike are preparing to say goodbye to the show during its sixth and final season.

Based on Margaret Atwood’s novel of the same name, The Handmaid’s Tale takes place in a dystopian future where low fertility rates have led women to be assigned to men for bearing children. Elisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski, Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd, O-T Fagbenle, Max Minghella, Samira Wiley and Amanda Brugel have led the cast since the show premiered in 2017.

The series also became a critical success with multiple award nominations over the years. The Handmaid’s Tale notably was the first show produced by Hulu to win a major award and the first series on a streaming network to win an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.

Despite The Handmaid’s Tale coming to an end, the universe is expanding with Atwood’s 2019 novel The Testaments. It was previously announced that Hulu and MGM were developing the sequel series but there hasn’t been any more news yet.

Keep scrolling for everything we know so far about season 6 of The Handmaid’s Tale:

When Will Hulu Release ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Season 6?

The Handmaid’s Tale was renewed in 2022 shortly before season 5 premiered. Filming, however, got delayed due to the dual SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and Moss’ real-life pregnancy.

Disney TV boss Craig Erwich told Deadline in 2024 that production would start over the summer, and the final season will premiere one year later. Hulu confirmed that the show would return with three episodes on April 8th and continue to release new episodes leading up to the May 27th finale.

Who Is Coming Back — and Who Is Joining — the Final Season?

The main cast mentioned above are expected to return alongside recurring actors Bradley Whitford, Sam Jaeger and Ever Carradine. Ahead of season 6, Josh Charles was cast as a series regular while Timothy Simons andD’Arcy Carden joined as a guest star but details about their characters was not immediately released.

Alexis Bledel is not expected to return after she left ahead of season 5.

Where Does the Story Pick Up?

The fifth season ended with June (Moss) and Serena Joy (Strahovski) both fleeing Toronto for Vancouver.

Amid the growing anti-refugee movement in Toronto, June was targeted by a hit-and-run driver and her husband, Luke (Fagbenle), brutally attacked the assailant. The Gilead supporter, a native Canadian, didn’t survive his injuries, and June and Luke knew that the attention and threats to their safety would only get worse. They decide to leave for Vancouver, but authorities at the train station were already looking for Luke. He convinced June to get on the train without him, taking baby Nichole with her. June is surprised to find Serena (with baby Noah) asking her for a diaper.

It isn’t clear what happens next — and the book that served as inspiration hasn’t been a big help with predicting the show’s ending. Atwood’s novel wrapped up with the protagonist Offred — whose real name was never revealed — being taken away in a van.

After the first season adapted the entire book, Hulu’s version went beyond what was on the page. Where Serena and June go from here is anyone’s guess.

What Do the Cast Members Want to See From the Ending?

“June is going to figure out who she is and who she’s going to be for the rest of her life,” Moss told Elle in November 2022 about her character’s potential story lines for the final season.

Moss teased that the final season centers on a fight that “is not just about one individual.” According to Moss, fans shouldn’t expect a happy ending, adding, “I don’t think we feel an obligation to tie up the entire story of Gilead.”

What Changes Took Place Behind the Scenes?

Showrunner Bruce Miller has been with The Handmaid’s Tale since it debuted in 2017. Before season 6, Miller offered a glimpse at his vision for the show’s ending.

“We are ending our show on our own creative terms,” he told Entertainment Weekly in 2022. “Do I know what happens in season 6? Yes, I did think about the stuff that happens in season 6 for a while.”

However, Miller stepped down as showrunner in 2023. He is expected to remain a writer and executive producer but passed on his duties to executive producers Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang.

What Did the Official Trailer Reveal?

Hulu released the first look at the sixth and final season of the beloved series in March 2025 where June was seen returning to Gilead.”For years, we have been afraid of them,” June said. “Now it is time for them to be afraid of us.”

Elsewhere in the trailer, Serena seemed to play a big role as she switched from the signature dark blue to a light periwinkle ensemble — and it seems like she’s walking down the aisle in a wedding dress. The other surprising moments included Luke Bankole going into Gilead, June and Nick kissing and Aunt Lydia trying to save Janine (Madeline Brewer), who seems to be working as a Jezebel.",usmagazine

“It might upset [the fans], and they might come up with their theories, and that’s fine, but I think we kind of had to sit ourselves down too and talk about that,” Charity, 29, exclusively told Us Weekly at the recent 2025 iHeartRadio Music Awards. “They do have these expectations and I think, sometimes, it is a little unreasonable. And you kind of have to tune that out because we’re real humans with real lives and not TV characters.”

Charity noted that it’s “nice” to have fans that are so invested in her and Dotun’s love story, but the pair also wants their privacy.

“Just putting the reminders out that, you know, we still also have a life and we have finances that we have to figure out a lot of things that go into a wedding, and that’s real,” Charity told Us at The Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. “We’re on our timeline, not anyone else’s.”

Related: Bachelorette's Dotun Says Fiancee Charity Makes 'Every Day Brighter' Dotun Olubeko and Charity Lawson appear to be living their best lives together after falling in love on The Bachelorette. Dotun, 32, posted a carousel of photos and videos of the couple via his Instagram account on Monday, February 17, in a belated Valentine’s Day celebration. “They say love is patient and kind, but true […]

While Charity last updated fans that she and Dotun, 32, were putting wedding planning on “pause,” the former Bachelorette told Us that she “kind of did regret” using that wording.

“I was like, ‘That’s not gonna sound great.’ But it was just more of, like, I think we came off the show and we rushed into everything, and it became extremely overwhelming,” Charity said. “And for anyone who has done wedding planning before, they know it takes a lot, and we’re not just planning one, it’s two weddings. So that’s kind of just what I meant by that.”

Charity continued, “It’s just more of just moving at a slower pace, rather than trying to get everything done so soon and so quickly. But it is coming soon. We just haven’t obviously given the public the official date. We’re gonna keep that to ourselves because it’s a meaningful thing, and we wanted to not lose that.”

Bachelor Nation met Charity when she vied for the affections of Zach Shallcross on The Bachelor season 27. After not finding The One in Zach, Charity became the lead of The Bachelorette season 20. The pair got engaged in the season finale after she sent home runner-up Joey Graziadei.

And while the twosome are still going strong, they aren’t rushing down the aisle. “We’ve taken a pause on it and I’m […]

When Us asked Charity how Dotun makes her happy, she replied, “I think it’s very obvious, because if you watched our season, you would see it through the camera. But I think something about Dotun is so thoughtful and very selfless. He puts others before himself. And for me, it’s not about materialistic things, and I think that’s what also provides quality and like substance to our relationship. Whether it’s big or small, him just thinking of me and prioritizing a need of mine that I may not even know about myself, but he’s observant about that, it’s the best. I love him.”

Which Is the Best ‘Bachelor’ Couple of All Time?

Dotun, for his part, gushed that Charity has “probably the warmest energy” that he’s ever seen. “It’s infectious and people love her,” he said. “And anywhere you go, you see the way that she captures the attention [of] the audience.”

As the couple prepares to say “I do,” Dotun revealed what they are most looking forward to this year. “Quality time and really just getting this chance to refocus,” he said. “This is a year where I’m certainly prioritizing myself and us instead of events and other things.”

Teen Mom star Kailyn Lowry previously opened up about her experience having several surgical procedures — including a breast reduction, tummy tuck and liposuction — since giving birth to her seven kids. (Lowry shares son Issac with Jo Rivera, son Lincoln with Javi Morroquin, sons Lux and Creed with Chris Lopez and sons Rio and Verse and daughter Valley with Elijah Scott.)

“I just pray that my kids never struggle with their body images enough to mutilate their bodies to be skinny,” Lowry shared in an Instagram video in January 2025, after undergoing a breast reduction. “I think a little nip and tuck in terms of a nose job or a boob job is OK. But to go through this to be skinny is mental illness, truly. And I say that with the most respect to anyone going through it.”

Meanwhile, Patricia Heaton shared that she had cosmetic surgery after giving birth, which made her feel “more confident.” (The Middle actress shares sons Samuel, John, Joseph and Daniel with husband David Hunt.)

“I had four C-sections. I gained 50 lbs. with every kid and I’m 5’2. Wasn’t pretty. It just does something to your body,” she told People in May 2018. “I was really in the prime of my career when that was all going on, so it just felt better and made me more confident to reconstruct my stomach, take care of all that stuff.”

TMZ has confirmed Pete's dating Elsie Hewitt -- a model and actress with a few big-time credits to her name -- after Daily Mail published photos of the two frolicking in the cool ocean waves together.

Pete and Elsie locked lips and held hands ... with Pete's back tattoos visible, and nearly every inch of Hewitt's body on display.

Like we said, if Elsie looks familiar, it might be because she's known for dating high-profile stars -- like music producer and Selena Gomez's future husband Benny Blanco.

And, just last year, Hewitt was linked to one of Davidson's fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alums, Jason Sudeikis. Page Six broke the news about Hewitt's identity.

Obviously, Pete's dated his fair share of Hollywood stars too ... most notably Kim Kardashian from late 2021 to the middle of 2022 after the pair kissed on an episode of ""Saturday Night Live.""

As a result, the prosecutor dismissed the case out of concern for Stewart's safety. Morris says he's now calling media outlets and asking them to take down Lily's booking photo since the case is no longer active. Still, Morris says Lily is facing some punishment for driving 84 miles per hour in a 55 MPH zone. She has to do community service and take a defensive driving class.

A Georgia sorority girl's not letting her recent arrest get her down ... 'cause she was grinning from ear-to-ear in her mug shot -- and, her smile's got social media users in a tizzy.

Lily Stewart -- a 20-year-old university student from the University of Georgia -- was arrested earlier this month and booked on a speeding in excess of maximum limits charge, a misdemeanor in the state.

Unlike President Donald Trump's scowl in his mug shot, Lily decided to go with the Miss America look, like she just won the lottery -- instead of a one-way ticket to a holding cell.

TMZ has obtained the incident report ... where the officer claims he observed her driving 79 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone at around 10 in the morning. He says he pulled her over, cited her for the speeding ticket and actually let her go initially.

Unfortunately, the run-in with police apparently didn't do anything to quell Stewart's alleged need for speed ... 'cause this officer says mere minutes later he saw her driving 84 in a 55 -- and arrested her.

As you can imagine ... people online are in Lily's corner -- with some joking they've got no idea why she was arrested, but they're sure she's innocent of all charges.

BTW ... Lily clearly thinks a good picture's a good picture, regardless of why it was taken -- 'cause she decided to post the mug shot along with her favorite comments from other social users.

Christina Applegate says she's been hospitalized ""upwards of 30 times"" from throwing up, diarrhea, and excruciating pain ... and she thinks it stems from her MS.

The ""Married... with Children"" star -- who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021 -- opened up about her rather crappy experiences on her latest 'MeSsy' podcast episode as she and her cohost Jamie-Lynn Sigler addressed a note from a listener also battling the autoimmune disease and dealing with frequent diarrhea and vomiting.

During the candid discussion, CA admits when she needs to go No. 2, she oftentimes also pukes ... and is certain there's a correlation between her upset stomach and MS, despite doctors not being totally convinced.

She says she's experienced ""every test known to man"" to get to the bottom of her toilet issues and is going to push harder about the possible correlation at her upcoming colonoscopy thanks to the listener's note.

Christina calls the whole situation ""scary"" and also urges her fan to chat with their doctors about motility issues and their relation to MS.

She leaves the listener with some sage advice in the meantime ... ""Always have a little trash can next to your toilet. Because you can do both without it being messy.""

TMZ has learned.

Aubrey and Jeff's marital difficulties are revealed in the Medical Examiner's report ... in the documents, obtained by TMZ, the ME notes Jeff was separated from his wife since September 2024.

The ME says Jeff's manner of death is suicide ... which lines up with what we were originally told by our law enforcement sources.

TMZ broke the story ... Aubrey's husband was found dead in his Los Angeles-area home back in January.

The ME's death investigation summary says Jeff's dog walker found him dead in his home and called police.

Officers say the dog walker told them she showed up to his home on January 3 at her normal time to walk his dog, and she heard loud music coming from within the house, which was unusual. She says she unlocked the front door to find his body.

Cops say they were told Jeff had been separated from Aubrey since September 2024 when she moved to New York ... and officers note they were told Jeff had a phone conversation with Aubrey the night before he was found dead.

Police say they spoke to Aubrey on the phone after he was found dead and she confirmed their separation. Officers also say Aubrey told them Jeff made concerning remarks in October 2024 which prompted her to call a friend to perform a welfare check on her husband.

Cops say Aubrey told them Jeff had been attending therapy since the alleged October incident and she claimed he did not have any previous suicide attempts.

The ME says Jeff was pronounced dead at 10:39 AM PT on January 3 and police say Aubrey told officers she last heard from him earlier that morning at 7:36 AM PT when he sent her a text message.

The docs say no illicit drugs or alcohol were found on the scene or in Jeff's system and no suicide note was found.

The story reappeared on the DoD's government site Wednesday afternoon ... after a wave of public backlash over its removal.

It's unclear whether the initial takedown was intentional or accidental.

TMZ Sports, before the Robinson story was republished, asked Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot for answers ... and he seemed to indicate that while the Secretary of Defense wants anything DEI-related pulled, the Robinson story was taken down in error.

“As Secretary Hegseth has said, DEI is dead at the Defense Department. Discriminatory Equity Ideology is a form of Woke cultural Marxism that has no place in our military. It Divides the force, Erodes unit cohesion and Interferes with the services’ core warfighting mission. We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms.""

""In the rare cases that content is removed -- either deliberately or by mistake -- that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content accordingly.”

Ullyot, in a separate statement, also praised Robinson's military service.

""Everyone at the Defense Department loves Jackie Robinson, as well as the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen, the Marines at Iwo Jima and so many others - we salute them for their strong and in many cases heroic service to our country, full stop.""

Shortly after, the article was back up and running.

Of course, Robinson's exploits on the diamond are widely known ... but not everyone is aware of his service to the country.

Jackie was drafted into the military in 1942. In January 1943, JR was commissioned a second lieutenant, and was ultimately assigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st ""Black Panthers"" tank battalion, admirably serving for about two years.

As for the Commander-In-Chief's take, President Donald Trump hasn't weighed in on the controversy ... but it's safe to say he's a big fan of Jackie.",tmz

Pete Davidson was seen heating things up with his new flame during a sun-soaked getaway in Palm Beach, exclusive DailyMail.com photos show.

Hollywood's serial dater, 31, was recently reported to have a new lady in his life with whom he's said to be 'very happy', following his split with actress Madelyn Cline last year.

Notorious for his high-profile romances with A-list stars, the comedian is now dating a 'non-celebrity' - now identified by DailyMail.com as model and actress Elsie Hewitt, 29 - and appears to be keeping the relationship more lowkey this time around.

But that didn't stop him from packing on the PDA with the glamorous brunette on the beach over weekend, according to the new images.

The pair spent Saturday afternoon at a luxury beachfront hotel in Palm Beach, where they were seen swimming, lounging in the sun, and naturally, making out in the ocean.

Photos show the couple locking lips during a steamy makeout session amid the waves, seemingly undaunted by onlookers.

Yet the couple did not shy away from being affectionate with one another and locking lips in public during Saturday's beach trip in South Florida

Hewitt, a model and actress, looked just as besotted, playing around and cozying up to her new beau on and off the sand

Adding to the beachside spectacle was the SNL alum's numerous tattoos, which were still very much visible on his back and torso despite him undergoing a painful and pricey removal process.

Still, the Bupkis star, clad in black swimming trunks, appeared happy and in his element during the beach outing.

His unnamed girlfriend looked just as besotted, splashing around and smooching with her new beau on and off the sand.

She showed off her fit physique in a patterned multi-colored, cheeky bikini and kept her hair pulled back in a neat bun.

Back at the hotel beachfront, the pair were joined by two friends as Davidson and his latest lover lounged on sunbeds and exchanged smooches.

News of Davidson's hot new romance emerged earlier this week, with sources describing his love interest as a 'non-celebrity' and unlike 'anybody else he's ever dated', Page Six reported.

The outlet added that Davidson is 'very happy' with the woman, who 'respects Pete and his desire for privacy'.

The comedy actor and unlikely ladies' man has attracted more attention over his personal life in recent years.

His previous high-profile relationships include his whirlwind engagement to Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley, and Kaia Gerber.

He famously sparked up a relationship with Kim Kardashian after the two first crossed paths when she was a guest star on Saturday Night Live.

However, after nine months of dating, their split was revealed in August 2022.

Pete then briefly dated supermodel Emily Ratajkowski and started a relationship with his Bodies Bodies Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders in 2023.

More recently, Davidson has made headlines over his decision to remove his tattoos, which he once estimated to have over 200. He revealed he plans to get rid of all the ink before he turns 40.

Davidson has spoken publicly about embarking on the lengthy, expensive, and painful process over four years ago amid his sobriety journey.

The seemingly remarkable results of the grueling process appeared to be visible last month when he unveiled his ink-free body in a new Reformation ad campaign.

Days earlier he was also seen flaunting his bare arms at Michael Rubin's Fanatics bash in New Orleans ahead of Super Bowl LIX.

But these new beachside snaps suggest the process isn't quite finished.

He spoke about the removal process as he reunited with his friend and former Saturday Night Live costar Seth Meyers on Late Night last month.

Aside from the heavy PDA, the pair looked casual and blended in with fellow beachgoers

On the talk show, Davidson admitted that he does not know how long removing all of his tattoos will take but said he hopes to complete the process in under 10 years.

'No, I didn't realize it would take — like, when I'm 40, it'll all be gone, like the chest and the back,' Davidson told Meyers when the talk show host asked about getting his ink erased.

Then, Davidson clarified that each tattoo takes multiple visits with several weeks in between for the healing process.

'It's at least seven visits,' Davidson explained. 'And if it's black and white, it's a little easier. But if it's a color tattoo, it takes forever.'

When Meyers asked if there was a particular piece of body art he was glad to be rid of, the comedian said he wanted to remove 'all of them.'

'Well, I made a lot of those decisions when, you know, before rehab. So I got the dumbest tattoos,' he admitted.

A recent photoshoot for Reformation showed Pete's usually ink-covered chest clear from tattoos as he went shirtless in white trousers to showcase his transformation

He previously began the lengthy and expensive process of erasing the ink on his arms over four years ago amid his sobriety journey (pictured January 2025)

When asked about some of his worst ones in his opinion, Davidson replied: 'I got a collection of cartoons smoking a blunt.'

He said there was one of The Muppets along with 'the Tootsie Pop owl,' which he said was 'weird because I wasn't old enough to be around for that commercial.'

Regarding the tattoos, a source claimed last week that Davidson had 'just woke up one day and wanted them gone, and it's been a years-long process.'",tmz

Officials from the U.S. Attorney's Office in L.A. held a press conference Wednesday confirming 10 people have been arrested, including part-time rappers Bricc Baby and Luce Cannon ... who've been frequent guests on the 'No Jumper' podcast.

Big U is listed in the docs as the Rollin' 60s kingpin and is accused of murdering an aspiring Las Vegas rapper in January 2021 in Las Vegas after the unnamed rapper allegedly recorded a diss track taking shots at Big U.

The feds claim Big U drove to North Las Vegas with another charged defendant -- Sylvester ""Vey"" Robinson -- fatally shot the aspiring rapper in the head, dragged the body off Interstate 15 into the desert and left the corpse in a ditch.

Big U and Robinson allegedly then drove back to L.A. and told all witnesses not to speak with law enforcement about the slaying. The feds claim they also deleted surveillance footage of the slain rapper's time spent in the studio.

If it sounds like a scene from the movie ""Casino,"" the complaint characterizes Big U's enterprise as ""a mafia-like organization"" that used intimidation tactics to get over on local businesses.

There's also an allegation Big U took millions of dollars in grants from the city of L.A. and COVID 19 relief -- intended to help the community -- and instead sunk into his criminal enterprise.

The feds claim he also pocketed 2 separate $20,000 donations intended for community development from a former NBA superstar and a current one -- who, reportedly, are Shaquille O'Neal and Draymond Green.

Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally ripped Big U and his operation during the press conference, saying, ""The allegations in the complaint unsealed today reveal a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder, extortion, human trafficking, and fraud -- all led by a supposed anti-gang activist and purported music entrepreneur who was nothing more than a violent street criminal.”

In a new court filing, obtained by TMZ Sports, Jordan and his attorneys revealed the 34-year-old has been dealing with ""challenges"" related to his ""alcohol/substance use"" ... and now, he wants a judge to order him to complete a Pre-Trial Substance Abuse Education and Treatment Intervention Program in an effort to help him with these issues.

Jordan's attorneys argued the program would ""not only benefit him personally but also serve the community by reducing the likelihood of future offenses."" They added in the documents that Michael's son ""is amenable to treatment.""

Marcus, according to the docs, would waive his right to a speedy trial if the judge grants the motion.

Court records show a hearing date to discuss the matter has not yet been set.

Marcus is currently facing three separate charges in the case -- one felony count of ketamine possession, one misdemeanor count of DUI with property damage, and one misdemeanor count of resisting an officer. He submitted not guilty pleas to all three charges in early February.

The case, of course, stems from his Feb. 4 run-in with cops ... who said they found him and his Lamborghini Urus stuck on some railroad tracks in Maitland, Fla. at around 1 AM.

An incident report stated authorities threw him behind bars after he exhibited several signs of intoxication as well as failed field sobriety tests. Body camera video from the scene was later released, and it showed Jordan, at times, arguing with officers.",tmz

Video of the incident -- which happened back in December -- captures Daniel H. Escalera, an Indiana man, who was at River Glen of St. Charles assisted living facility in Illinois, revving the chainsaw as officers arrive on the scene.

The responding officer repeatedly tells the man to drop the chainsaw, as Escalera says he just wants to see his wife ... while trying hard to get it started. Eventually, he's able to get the tool going -- which is when the officer tases him.

The Taser doesn't stop him ... and, Escalera pops back up with the saw, running through a cafeteria and into a hallway and shrieking, while other officers swarm the assisted-living facility.

In another body cam clip, Escalera rushes at an officer with chainsaw in hand ... hitting the officer with it and dropping it before running down the hall.

Escalera's passing residents of the living facility in the hallway -- including one in a mobility scooter -- before he's finally shot multiple times. First aid was rendered at the scene, but Escalera died.

A joint press release from the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Illinois State Police and the St. Charles Police Department, says Escalera was initially on the property to cut down a tree when he went into the lobby and started harassing residents with the chainsaw.

An autopsy revealed Escalera had traces of amphetamines, methamphetamines, and olanzapine -- a medication used to treat schizophrenia -- in his blood at the time of his death.",tmz

The singer-songwriter reshared an IG post featuring Playboi Carti's response to Ye ... after Ye recently said both he and Playboi ""beat women"" but they're not hated as much as Diddy is ... a post that pushed Carti to share ""YE STFU.""

Cassie doesn't add any of her own words to the post on her IG Story ... but, it looks like she's co-signing PC's message wholeheartedly.

Diddy was captured on video hitting Cassie multiple times in a hotel hallway in L.A. back in 2016 ... video CNN first shared last year has become the center of controversy in recent days after Diddy's attorney claimed the network destroyed the video.

As we've told you ... West has been showing a lot of public support for Diddy in recent days -- including sharing clips from a phone call with the music mogul while he's behind bars in MDC Brooklyn, a notorious federal detention center.

Of course, a collaboration between Kanye and Diddy -- the song ""Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,"" where some of their phone call plays as the intro -- may end up causing Ye some difficult personal problems.

As we told you, our sources say Kim Kardashian's considering asking a judge to strip Kanye of joint legal custody after the song's release ... since their attorneys had previously agreed any version of the song that was released wouldn't feature the ex-spouses' daughter North.

Ye broke that promise and put her on the track with Diddy, Diddy's son Christian ""King"" Combs, and a singer named Jasmine Williams.",tmz

A team spokesperson tells TMZ Sports the Sparks have used male practice squad players since the team's inception in 1997 ... and they're not alone.

Teams like the Phoenix Mercury and the Dallas Wings have hosted their own tryouts in the past, too ... and it's a practice used in women's college basketball as well.

Brink -- the No. 2 overall pick in 2024 -- recently raised concerns after the inappropriate reactions to the Sparks' social media post about the tryout ... but the team made it clear it has the entire roster's best interests.

""The Los Angeles Sparks are committed to fostering a safe and respectful environment for all our players and want to emphasize that player safety remains our top priority,"" the team said.

The org. also explained no one on the roster will participate in the tryout -- nor will they even be in attendance.

Once the guys are picked, the team will do a deep dive into their history and make sure they have a crystal clear understanding of who will be around their talent.

""Additionally, any players selected for the practice squad will undergo a thorough background check process to ensure the safety and well-being of our athletes,"" the team said.
