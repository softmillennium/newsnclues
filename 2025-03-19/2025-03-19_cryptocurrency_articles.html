Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 12 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) stands against other best bitcoin stocks to invest in.

Bitcoin was the top-performing asset of 2024, driven by the launch of new ETFs and optimism about potential deregulation under a new US administration. However, the cryptocurrency remained volatile, with significant price swings throughout the year. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin had more than doubled in value from its starting price of around $40,000, reaching nearly $94,000, according to a report by CNBC. The most significant surge occurred in the weeks following the US presidential election. By mid-December, Bitcoin surpassed $108,000 for the first time, fueled by expectations that President Donald Trump's victory over former VP Kamala Harris would lead to clearer regulations and increased investment in the crypto space.

​​One of the main factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements is the halving mechanism, a fundamental feature of its network. Bitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism in the Bitcoin network that reduces the rewards miners receive for processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This event occurs roughly every four years, or after 210,000 blocks are mined, gradually slowing the introduction of new bitcoins into circulation. Its main purpose is to regulate Bitcoin's supply, ensuring it remains limited to a maximum of 21 million coins. Halving can influence Bitcoin's value by reducing the number of new coins entering the market. The first halving took place on November 28, 2012, cutting the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoins. This was followed by a significant price increase, a trend observed in later halvings. The most recent halving occurred on April 20, 2024, at block 740,000, reducing the reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, halvings have been linked to price increases as the reduced supply can boost demand. This scarcity strengthens Bitcoin's role as a digital store of value, often compared to gold. Additionally, market anticipation around halving events tends to drive investor interest and trading activity, further impacting Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin's growing influence is also reflected in broader financial markets and institutional investment trends. By the end of 2024, global investable assets surpassed $200 trillion, with cryptocurrencies accounting for over $3 trillion, or 1.5% of the market. Institutional investors increasingly embraced Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), with inflows surpassing $34 billion as Bitcoin gained wider acceptance in multi-asset portfolios. Bitcoin has solidified its status as both a benchmark for the crypto market and a measure of investor risk appetite. Its fixed supply and decentralized structure set it apart from traditional investments, making it an alternative growth asset in today's changing economic environment. This view is further supported by the US proposal to classify Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The proposal comes as the US faces rising debt and borrowing costs. President Trump's “America First” policies which combine tax cuts and tariffs could add to inflation concerns, which are already evident in bond markets, where 30-year yields neared 5% in early 2025.

Despite the cryptocurrency sector's volatility, some billionaire investors remain optimistic about its future. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of a leading business intelligence firm, was the top crypto billionaire gainer by percentage on Forbes‘ 2024 list. The software company he founded in the 1990s has since transformed into a major Bitcoin investment entity. By 2024, it held approximately 193,000 bitcoins, making it the largest corporate bitcoin holder globally, according to its CFO. Tech billionaire Mark Cuban is also investing in crypto. He believes its value could rise as adoption increases and it becomes more integrated into the global financial system. In fact, he has even speculated that it could one day replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.

To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of billionaires' stock holdings and picked the top 12 companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry with the highest number of billionaire investors in Q4 of 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Billionaire Investors: 3

Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT), a New York-based company, focuses on bitcoin mining, treasury management, digital asset staking, and Ethereum staking. It is one of the best bitcoin stocks to monitor. On February 10, the company announced a colocation agreement with a major AI hardware firm. The partnership will be managed through WhiteFiber, Inc., its rebranded high-performance computing division, which offers cloud services and operates the Enovum Data Centers platform.

In the third quarter of 2024, Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) reported a revenue of $22.7 million, a 96% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by contributions from its high-performance computing business, though partially offset by lower mining revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the company held approximately $106 million in cash and restricted cash, while its digital assets were valued at around $118 million. By the end of the third quarter, total assets stood at $376 million, with shareholders' equity reaching $315 million.

On January 21, Craig-Hallum began coverage of Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) with a Buy rating and a price target of $6. Analysts at the firm view Bit Digital as being in the early stages of a major transformation, one that could pave the way for a more stable and profitable business model.

Overall, BTBT ranks 11th on our list of the best bitcoin stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of BTBT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BTBT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Global M2 money supply is at an all-time high — so why isn't Bitcoin surging? Is something broken, or is a delayed breakout coming?

Table of Contents

Markets are heading into the Federal Reserve's Mar. 18-19 meeting with mounting uncertainty as economic conditions remain volatile. Stock markets have stumbled, inflation remains persistent, and investors are reassessing their expectations for interest rate cuts.

Adding to the unpredictability, President Trump's tariff policies and federal layoffs have raised fresh concerns about the broader economic outlook, injecting further instability into an already fragile market.

Despite the turbulence, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25-4.5%, with CME Group's FedWatch tool assigning a 99% probability to no immediate adjustments.

However, the real focus is on the timing of the first rate cut. Current projections suggest a potential reduction in June, with a 55% chance that rates will move to 4-4.25%. 

Overall, investors anticipate a cumulative reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point in 2025, which could bring the Fed's benchmark rate down to 3.5-3.75%.

Amid this uncertainty, financial markets have responded sharply. The S&P 500 has dropped more than 8% from its Feb. 19 all-time high, while the Nasdaq plunged 4% on Mar. 10 — its worst trading day since 2022. 

Meanwhile, the volatility index has surged to its highest level since August, reflecting the difficulty investors face in maneuvering shifting policies, particularly Trump's tariff hikes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has also struggled to find its footing, remaining range-bound around $82,300 as of Mar. 18 — down nearly 25% from its all-time high of $109,114 in January.

The question now is: What comes next? How will markets react if the Fed signals a shift in policy? And what does all of this mean for crypto in the coming weeks?

Global liquidity is surging, and history suggests that risk assets like Bitcoin may soon react. As of Mar. 10, global M2 money supply reached an all-time high of $108.2 trillion, marking a 3.5% increase from its 2025 low of $104.5 trillion recorded on Jan. 6.

Yet, in this cycle, Bitcoin's price action has shown inconsistencies despite the rise in liquidity, raising questions about whether a delayed response is at play.

M2 money supply serves as a broad measure of global liquidity, encompassing cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money assets.

When M2 expands, liquidity typically finds its way into high-yielding investments, leading to rallies in stocks, commodities, and Bitcoin. Conversely, contractions in M2 often coincide with risk-off periods, where assets struggle to find upside momentum.

Keep an eye on changes in global liquidity – it's one of the most important long term factors driving Bitcoin.In fact, using data from 2013 to 2024, BTC has a 94% correlation with global M2. Now you know why so many people are begging for an end to QT & even a return of QE. pic.twitter.com/E27bkhS5Vx

A closer look at historical data highlights Bitcoin's strong correlation with M2 growth. Bitcoin's most significant bull runs have occurred during periods of rapid liquidity expansion, whereas downturns in M2 have preceded price declines or prolonged consolidations.

However, a key observation is that Bitcoin does not react immediately to liquidity surges. Research suggests an average lag of approximately 10 weeks before Bitcoin fully reflects changes in M2 growth.

The above M2 chart further supports this narrative. Bitcoin's recovery from its 2022-2023 lows coincided with a significant uptick in M2 growth. Similarly, in mid-2024, a renewed expansion in M2 was followed by Bitcoin reaching new highs.

However, in early 2025, Bitcoin entered a period of consolidation despite M2 continuing its ascent. The missing ingredient appears to be the rate of change in liquidity rather than its absolute level.

A deeper analysis of Bitcoin's year-on-year returns relative to the YoY change in M2 reveals a clearer pattern — Bitcoin's strongest bull runs tend to emerge when liquidity growth accelerates rapidly rather than when it remains steady.

Hence, mere liquidity expansion isn't enough to trigger a breakout — acceleration in M2 growth is the critical factor.

The Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) program, which has been running since June 2022, may be approaching its final stretch.

As of Mar. 18, over $6.2 million has been wagered on Polymarket, with traders assigning a 100% probability that the Fed will end QT by Apr. 30.

At its core, QT is the opposite of quantitative easing (QE). Instead of injecting liquidity into the system by purchasing bonds, the Fed has been allowing assets to mature off its balance sheet, effectively pulling money out of circulation.

This policy, alongside aggressive rate hikes, helped curb inflationary pressures but also created liquidity constraints that have weighed on markets. While stocks and crypto assets managed to rally despite QT's tightening effects, concerns have emerged that continued balance sheet reduction could drain liquidity at a time of rising economic uncertainty.

The minutes from the January FOMC meeting revealed that several policymakers were open to either slowing or pausing QT, largely due to uncertainties surrounding the federal debt ceiling and evolving money market conditions, Reuters reported.

Analysts note that the Treasury Department's extraordinary measures to keep government operations funded have been injecting temporary liquidity into the system. 

This has made it harder for the Fed to accurately assess true reserve levels, creating a risk that it could withdraw too much liquidity too quickly, increasing financial market volatility.

Despite rising expectations of a near-term end to QT, not all analysts agree on the timing.

Barclays maintains its projection that QT will conclude between September and October, arguing that pausing in March or May only to restart reductions later would be inefficient.

Meanwhile, Wrightson ICAP analysts believe the Fed is more likely to slow the pace of asset runoffs rather than halt them entirely, noting that a full stop could force the Fed to resume asset purchases later, creating communication challenges for policymakers.

Others, like research firm LH Meyer, caution that any pause in QT could risk turning into a full stop, as resuming the process later could prove difficult — especially if market conditions remain fragile.

The Fed's ability to gauge the right stopping point has been complicated by mixed signals from liquidity indicators.

A survey of major banks and money managers conducted before the last policy meeting suggested QT could conclude between June and July.

Fed holdings, which have already declined to $6.8 trillion from a peak of $9 trillion in 2022, are expected to fall further to around $6.4 trillion by the end of the process.

However, estimates suggest that bank reserves will only dip to $3.125 trillion from the current $3.3 trillion, while the Fed's reverse repo facility — a measure of excess liquidity — has remained below $100 billion throughout February, indicating that financial conditions may already be tighter than intended.

Historically, unwinding QT has been a delicate process, and if the Fed signals a stop in the coming months, it may effectively mark the end of the program.

If that happens, the implications could be broad—lower long-term interest rates, a weaker dollar, and potentially increased demand for risk assets like Bitcoin and equities.

While rising M2 money supply has been a strong precursor to Bitcoin bull runs, on-chain indicators and institutional developments suggest that the short-term outlook may not align with this trend just yet.

Despite global M2 reaching a record high, Bitcoin's price action has shown signs of exhaustion. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, warns that “every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” pointing to fresh liquidity drying up and new whales offloading BTC at lower prices.

His analysis, which applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to various metrics, suggests that Bitcoin's price may not immediately react to rising liquidity.

One of the key metrics is MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which compares Bitcoin's market value to the price at which coins last moved, helping to determine whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued.

Another critical metric is SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which measures whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a profit or a loss.

Additionally, NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) tracks the overall profitability of Bitcoin holders based on unrealized gains and losses across the network.

Based on these indicators, Bitcoin may be entering a 6–12 month consolidation phase — a pattern historically seen after major bull runs. 

If this holds true, Bitcoin's reaction to rising liquidity could be delayed rather than immediate, mirroring previous cycles where liquidity expansions took months to translate into bullish price action.

At the same time, institutional headwinds are mounting. The U.S. recently adopted a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, marking a key shift in how the government views Bitcoin as an asset.

However, this move has not been well received by global financial institutions. Max Keiser, a longtime Bitcoin advocate and senior Bitcoin advisor to El Salvador's government, notes that the IMF and credit rating agencies have begun lowering the U.S. credit rating, citing Bitcoin's “destabilizing influence.”

The IMF (and various credit rating agencies) are lowering US credit rating citing the destabilizing influence of Bitcoin. They recommend the US to immediately liquidate their BSR (Bitcoin Strategic Reserve).

Keiser adds that the IMF is now recommending the immediate liquidation of the BSR, raising concerns about potential political pressure on the U.S. Bitcoin holdings.

If the U.S. government begins selling its Bitcoin reserves under such pressures, it could introduce additional downward momentum, at least in the short term.

Investors should remain cautious of near-term volatility while closely monitoring liquidity trends and government actions. Bitcoin's movement in the coming months may require patience before the next major move takes shape. 

Trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Key Takeaways:

As investment products surrounding crypto-assets see a global surge and Japan embraces a new regulatory environment, South Korea is considering its next steps towards Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Now, South Korea is reportedly monitoring its neighbor closely. Traders speculate that Seoul is likely to follow Tokyo's decision on crypto ETFs.

Japan, which had been extremely skeptical of digital assets, is now contemplating a major policy overhaul. In February, Nikkei reported the FSA is considering designating cryptocurrencies as financial products alongside traditional securities, and possibly allow crypto ETFs.

News of the potential policy change is drawing attention across Asia. Japan's move is reportedly influencing South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which has shared its analysis of Japan's legislative trends on digital assets with relevant institutions in South Korea. This indicates a significant level of interest in Japan's policy changes. Given the close economic and financial ties between the two nations, it is not surprising that South Korea is closely monitoring Japan's next move. Historical patterns suggest that South Korea often aligns its financial policies with major regional players to ensure competitiveness and market stability.

Japan's talks are expected to drag into the first half of 2025 before a legislative plan is drafted and submitted to the National Assembly in 2026, but even the mention of them is enough to rouse debate in South Korea.

Amid the excitement, South Korea is keeping its guard up. “I have continued to say that I would carefully review (spot Bitcoin ETFs), and it is similar in the broader context. There are countries that have not yet introduced it. There are England and Japan,” Kim So-young, vice chairman of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, said after a virtual asset committee. Some nations, such as England and Japan, have yet to introduce this.

Of course, there's South Korea's track record with strict crypto regulations. In the meantime, last year, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) imposed restrictions on asset managers offering ETFs linked to crypto-related companies, such as Coinbase. This more cautious stance is somewhat in line with South Korea overall's outlook on cryptocurrency, which has seen both excitement from the public and skepticism from officialdom.



Regulatory headwinds in South Korea are still amajor hurdle. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju likened South Korea's cautious approach to crypto regulation to that of the US SEC, where Gary Gensler stalled the approval of crypto ETFs for a decade until 2024.

The government has thus to walk a tightrope between encouraging innovators and protecting asset owners, with more than 30% of South Korean citizens investing in crypto assets. While it offers potential risks, regulators are carefully evaluating the impact of a volatile crypto market.

The Financial Services Commission previously announced that the universities and charities will be able to sell cryptocurrency donations starting from the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was also served with a suspension notice for possible Know Your Customer violations. Upbit has apparently also lodged a complaint against South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit to rescind the business penalties. It illustrates an ongoing struggle to gain control of the industry.

To revive its capital markets, South Korea's Exchange Chairman, Eun-Bo Jeong, is keen on launching crypto-based ETFs this year.

South Korea's financial markets lagged global peers as the domestic economy was contracting and export growth had been slowing, Jeong pointed out. The soaring success of Bitcoin ETFs worldwide has led to a quest for solutions to these challenges, including cryptocurrency-based ETFs.

South Korea is at a crossroads. While pushing an ETF has proven to be an uphill battle, the global momentum behind Bitcoin ETFs and potential regulatory changes in Japan have pressured Seoul to reconsider its stance. It is worth noting just how influential other countries' decision-making processes are within the South Korean government. Other countries have significantly influenced various sectors of the South Korean economy. For instance, many believe that the early development of South Korea's auto industry was shaped by the American auto sector.

 To start accepting BTC payments, small businesses can use a crypto payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions and ensure compliance.  

And it's not just a rehash of old news. For years, you might have seen luxury brands like Gucci and telecommunications companies like AT&T accepting Bitcoin. But today, crypto payments are much more than an easy bit of PR — they're seamlessly integrating into e-commerce, hospitality, travel and even your neighborhood coffee shop.

What started as a niche trend in the early 2010s has accelerated over the years. As of 2025, over 659 million people worldwide — roughly 1 in 13 individuals — are using cryptocurrency. Moreover, approximately 15,000 businesses globally accept Bitcoin (BTC), including around 2,300 in the United States.



While there are considerations to keep in mind, many view accepting BTC and other cryptocurrencies, even as a small business, as a win-win. The benefits often outweigh any challenges, with minimal downsides and significant potential rewards.

The following sections explore the whos, the whys and the hows.

As briefly touched upon, it's not only niche crypto-specific sectors that are accepting Bitcoin payments. Here are some sectors that you might not have considered, with accompanying case studies.

Did you know? The first-ever real-world transaction using Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Today, those 10,000 BTC would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, making it one of the most expensive pizza orders in history. This event is now celebrated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day in the crypto community.

So, all the big brands are in. But what's driving this trend, and can small businesses benefit, too?

One of the most significant advantages is lower transaction fees. Traditional payment processors and credit card companies typically charge businesses between 2% and 4% per transaction, while crypto payment gateways often reduce this to less than 1%. For businesses processing high volumes of transactions, these savings can be substantial.

Another key factor is the ability to access a global market without the restrictions of currency exchange rates and international banking fees. Cryptocurrency payments enable seamless cross-border transactions, allowing businesses to serve international customers without friction. This is especially beneficial for industries like travel, luxury goods and digital services, where cross-border commerce is common.

Security and fraud prevention also play a role. Cryptocurrency transactions are final, eliminating chargebacks — something that costs businesses billions of dollars annually in fraudulent disputes. This makes crypto payments particularly appealing to merchants in industries where chargebacks are common, such as e-commerce and online services.

Did you know? In 2025, chargeback fraud, particularly friendly fraud, has become a significant concern for merchants. Notably, a recent survey revealed that 55% of Generation Z and 49% of Millennials earning over $100,000 annually admitted to engaging in digital shoplifting — a form of first-party fraud where consumers falsely claim issues with online orders to secure refunds or avoid payments. 

Additionally, businesses recognize that accepting cryptocurrency aligns with the preferences of a growing demographic of crypto users. Companies integrating crypto payments position themselves as forward-thinking and innovative, appealing to solvent, tech-savvy consumers who prefer digital transactions over traditional banking systems.

Finally, some businesses are drawn to the potential of holding crypto as an asset. While many use payment processors that instantly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency to avoid volatility, others see it as an opportunity to gain exposure to a growing asset class. With major corporations like Tesla and MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, smaller businesses are following suit, recognizing the potential long-term value.

Small businesses stand to benefit the most here, as accepting crypto payments is an easy way to carve out a niche for the brand, reaching far more customers than would be possible by offering only fiat payments. The strategy might well mean the difference between failure and success in a competitive startup environment.



Did you know? A survey by Deloitte found that 85% of merchants see crypto payments as a way to reach new customers.

While accepting crypto payments is often seen as a win-win, businesses must also be aware of potential risks in doing so on their own, without proper accounting systems and crypto processing partners.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are known for significant price fluctuations. For example, in early 2025, Bitcoin's price dropped from $109,071 to around $80,000 — a nearly 25% decline within a short period. Such volatility can impact the value of received payments if not promptly converted to stable currencies.

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies by jurisdiction and is continually evolving. For example, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, which introduces complexities in tax reporting and compliance. Businesses must stay informed about applicable regulations to ensure adherence to tax obligations and avoid potential legal issues.

Accepting cryptocurrencies necessitates the use of digital wallets and exchanges, which can be susceptible to cybersecurity threats.Without robust security measures, businesses risk unauthorized access and theft of digital assets. Implementing strong cybersecurity protocols is essential.

Integrating cryptocurrency payment systems requires technical knowledge that some small business owners may lack. Establishing digital wallets and navigating digital currency exchanges can be challenging, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies or errors. Investing in employee training or consulting with experts may be necessary to overcome these hurdles.

Despite growing adoption, cryptocurrencies are not universally accepted or understood. Some customers may be hesitant to use digital currencies due to concerns about security or unfamiliarity, potentially limiting the perceived benefits of offering crypto payment options. Businesses should assess their customer base to determine if accepting cryptocurrencies aligns with their clientele's preferences.

It's unlikely that, as a small business, you'll take this road alone — especially when leading crypto payment processors offer zero up-front integration costs:



The next section will explore a number of crypto processing providers that you may wish to choose from as a small business.

Founded in 2011, BitPay is a pioneering cryptocurrency payment processor. As of 2024, it holds a 6.26% market share in the Bitcoin payment processing sector, serving over 523 customers. 

BitPay caters to a diverse clientele, including retailers, investment banking firms, and nonprofit organizations. The company offers direct crypto-to-fiat settlements, helping businesses avoid volatility while ensuring seamless integration with existing accounting systems. 

Its security infrastructure includes two-factor authentication (2FA) and encrypted transactions, making it a trusted option for enterprises looking to accept cryptocurrency payments.

Established in 2014, CoinsPaid has grown into a comprehensive crypto payment gateway, processing over 41 million transactions worth 23 billion euros. The company facilitates approximately 8% of all onchain Bitcoin transactions, making it a major player in the crypto payments sector. 

Supporting over 30 cryptocurrencies, CoinsPaid serves industries such as IT, marketing, financial services, real estate and gambling. The platform offers a business wallet, an over-the-counter (OTC) desk for large-volume transactions and software-as-a-service solutions tailored for crypto integration. 

CoinsPaid is licensed in Estonia and complies with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations while undergoing regular independent security audits to maintain its reputation for secure and compliant processing.

Launched in 2018 by Coinbase, Coinbase Commerce enables merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet. It provides seamless integration with major e-commerce platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce, allowing businesses to accept ETH, Litecoin (LTC) and USDC (USDC). 

Notably, in February 2024, Coinbase Commerce ended support for Bitcoin and other unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based coins. To make Bitcoin payments, users will need a Coinbase account. The decision comes as Coinbase faces challenges in implementing updates to its Ethereum Virtual Machine payment protocol for Bitcoin.

While specific market share data is limited, Coinbase Commerce is widely used by small to mid-sized businesses across sectors such as computer software, utilities and telecommunications. 

The platform offers a straightforward setup with no transaction fees apart from standard network costs, making it an attractive option for businesses looking for a simple crypto payment solution without intermediaries.

Binance Pay, introduced by Binance, is a cryptocurrency payment solution that enables merchants and users to conduct transactions using various cryptocurrencies. It supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH and BNB (BNB), allowing for versatile payment options. 

The platform offers zero transaction fees for both merchants and users, making it an attractive option for businesses aiming to integrate crypto payments without incurring additional costs. Binance Pay also emphasizes security by incorporating features such as 2FA and encrypted transactions, ensuring safe and reliable payment processing.



Despite a run-in with the Lazarus Group last year, CoinsPaid continues to operate as a major crypto payment gateway, maintaining competitive setup costs and fees. As such, this section will walk you through the steps you'd be expected to take when integrating any crypto payment processor, using CoinsPaid's flow as an example.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate CoinsPaid into your business, offering your customers the option to pay with cryptocurrencies. 

With lower transaction fees, access to a global customer base and protection from chargebacks, crypto payments provide clear advantages over traditional payment methods.

The risks associated with crypto payments — such as volatility, regulatory compliance and security concerns — are easily mitigated by using a trusted payment processor like CoinsPaid, BitPay or Coinbase Commerce. These platforms handle everything from instant fiat conversion to security and compliance, making the transition to crypto seamless and low-risk.

With major brands already embracing digital currencies, there's no reason for small and medium-sized businesses to be left behind. Crypto payments are fast, borderless and cost-effective, making them a no-brainer for any forward-thinking business. 

Whether you're a startup looking to gain a competitive edge or an established company seeking new revenue streams, integrating cryptocurrency payments is an investment in the future.

 BTC price pressures are everywhere as risk-asset traders wait for what they hope will be hints of positivity from the US Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed local highs of $84,358 on Bitstamp.

Risk assets were on edge ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the Fed expected to hold rates steady until at least June, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

The nature of subsequent commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell was of more concern to traders. Already hawkish, Powell faces pressure from US trade tariffs as inflation markets only just begin to fall.

“Tonight's FOMC meeting is highly likely hold rates steady. However, we will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers on the day. 

While holding above $80,000 throughout the week, Bitcoin's fate hung in the balance as US stocks saw notable downside.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index traded down 4% and 8.7% year-to-date at the time of writing compared to 10% for BTC/USD.

“TC has found some support at the $80k, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” QCP continued.

Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter identified a potential silver lining in the form of increasing equities allocation by US retail investors.

“Retail net inflows into Nasdaq 100 index stocks as a percentage of market cap have reached 0.1%, the highest in at least a year. Retail flows have DOUBLED in just a few weeks,” it wrote in a post on X.

Analyzing BTC price action, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital hoped that the upside gap in CME's Bitcoin futures market would be fully “filled” with a spike to $87,000.

Such gaps, as Cointelegraph reported, continue to act as short-term price magnets.

“Bitcoin continues to successfully retest the CME Gap as support (orange box, $78k-$80.7k),” Rekt Capital explained alongside an illustrative chart.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, meanwhile suggested that a dovish Powell could have a clear impact on price momentum.

“A dovish tone that reduces recessionary fears could send Bitcoin price above the 200-Day and 21-Day MAs, and avert what seemed like an imminent death cross between those two key MAs,” part of an X post stated.

Alan referred to two nearby simple moving averages, with the 200-day and 21-day MA sitting at $84,995 and $84,350, respectively.

Bad news, on the other hand, could spark a retest of multimonth lows at $76,000, he warned.

The Bitcoin price was placid early Wednesday after the Bank of Japan decided "by unanimous vote" to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.5%.  Now, traders are waiting to see if the Federal Reserve will do the same.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver his remarks today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin had gained 1.7% on the day and was changing hands for roughly $83,765, according to CoinGecko data.

But it's still the case that not much BTC is changing hands at all. Trading volume over the past 24 hours was $25 billion—a far cry from the $42 billion daily volume average it saw last week.

Users of decentralized prediction market MYRIAD, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are confident that Bitcoin will manage to maintain this price level through the weekend—with over 68% expecting that Bitcoin will still be above $83,000 by the end of the week, up from 52% at the start of the day.

Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has lost 2 points since yesterday, leaving it stuck in "Fear." It had been coasting along in "Neutral" territory as recently as last month. Since the start of the year, the index—which ranges from 0 for extreme fear to 100 for extreme greed—has reached as high as 84 two days after President Donald Trump's inauguration. But it's experienced a bumpy descent since then as geopolitical tensions and global trade tirades have plagued markets.

Traders are waiting to see whether Powell will offer any hope of a rate cut later this year. They seem to have already given up hope that he will announce a surprise rate cut later today, with 99% of traders expecting the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

But BRN analyst Valentin Fournier thinks they're looking to DC for a different reason—and perhaps, with more optimism.

"The dominant narrative driving this cycle is Bitcoin accumulation at a national level," he wrote in a market note Wednesday. "While immediate actions are awaited, their potential impact is expected to be sudden and significant."

This comes after Bo Hines, executive director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, told several participants at a closed-door roundtable hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute on last week that the White House is intent on acquiring as much Bitcoin as it can.

An analyst from multinational bank Standard Chartered believes that crypto exchange Coinbase “proactively sold” 12,652 Ethereum (approximately $37 million) throughout Q4 2024. They explained that Coinbase's layer-2 network Base drives demand for Ethereum but the company's profit taking is hurting the underlying blockchain's price action.

Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000 earlier this week. At the time, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the bank, claimed that layer-2 network Base had removed $50 billion from ETH's market cap—now, he's saying this is because of profit taking.

“My view is that increased activity on Base increases demand for ETH in the first instance,” Kendrick shared with Decrypt. “But then all of Base's profits (which are circa 80% of all Base revenue) are sold (ETH-USD selling) to effectively repatriate profits back to Coinbase.”

To back up his claim, the analyst points to Coinbase's quarterly Ethereum holdings for investments and operations which Kendrick then subtracted from the Base profits.

“This tells me that in Q4 2024 Coinbase proactively sold 12,652 ETH,” he explained. “Over the 3 quarters the net proactive selling was 1,558 ETH. So while there are only 3 quarters of relevant post-Dencun data so far, I think we can conclude that Coinbase is not in the business of HODLing Base's ETH profits.”

Taking the average price in Q4 2024, using the quarter's open and close, this works out to approximately $37.68 million sold by Coinbase.

Ethereum's Decun upgrade went live in March of last year and significantly reduced the gas fees on layer-2 networks. Since then, the analyst believes, Coinbase has shown its intention to sell as part of a “normal risk adjusted decision process.”

A spokesperson for Coinbase told Decrypt that Base, "earns ETH from sequencer fees, and the ETH we earn is primarily held for long term investment or used for operational expenses, including tax liabilities and reinvesting in growth via things like salaries, grants, acquisitions, and public goods funding."

They added that, "Separately, we also hold some ETH for long-term investment, and Coinbase reports our crypto assets specifically held for long -erm investment as part of our public quarterly earnings filing." Citing the firm's 10K, the spokesperson noted that, "crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term...we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them," adding that, "Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024."

In the Standard Chartered analyst's note from earlier in the week, he argued that making transactions via layer-2 networks negatively impacts the underlying blockchain because Ethereum receives less fees overall. In turn, this lowers the “GDP” of the Ethereum blockchain and the amount of gas fees it collects from transactions, meaning the Foundation mints more new coins to pay expenses.

Created by Coinbase, Base is a layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum that aims to help extend the capabilities of the underlying blockchain, as well as offering a bridge off of the popular centralized exchange.

The Standard Chartered analyst believes that looking at Coinbase's Ethereum holdings over the past three quarters reveals even more about its goals as a company.

“The fact they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick added.

Despite Standard Chartered's target price for Ethereum being slashed, the cryptocurrency is up 5.6% on the day and 4.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko, while Bitcoin has traded mostly flat during the same time.

As a result, over 70% of users on decentralized prediction market MYRIAD—launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN—believe that Ethereum's relative price to Bitcoin will be above $0.023 by the end of the week.

Oops, something went wrong

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech National Bank board member Jan Kubicek is "sceptical" about the inclusion of bitcoin among the bank's hefty reserves, wary of legal uncertainties and concerns around volatility of the digital currency.

CNB Governor Ales Michl put bitcoin up for consideration earlier this year, and the bank has begun an analysis looking into broadening the asset classes it holds in its reserves portfolio.

"We will assess different classes of assets. Bitcoin is just one of them," Kubicek said in an interview on Tuesday. "My position is rather sceptical about bitcoin."

He said bitcoin's legal status was one concern, and that direct ownership would mean developing many new processes in accounting or auditing, for example.

Volatility was another worry and assessing market price developments was difficult, he said.

"We cannot be certain that bitcoin's volatility in the coming years will mirror the patterns observed over the past decade because I suspect that, if more institutional investors accept bitcoin as an investment asset, it will start to behave differently from what we have seen so far."

The bank's study on new asset classes could come by October, Kubicek said.

Holdings of international corporate bonds could be explored, he said, as well as the possibility of investing in more targeted equity indices, such as for technology, and property investment funds.

CNB Vice Governor Eva Zamrazilova has said bitcoin is not a suitable asset for reserves, while European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde has also said Europe's central banks are not the place for it.

The Czech central bank's reserves - at 142.8 billion euros ($155.75 billion) - are around 45% of gross domestic product, and it has diversified holdings in recent years, gradually purchasing gold, and shifting a larger portion of the portfolio into equities.

($1 = 0.9168 euros)

Ether (ETH) zoomed nearly 7% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among majors as traders await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.

ETH's gains were coupled with a 4% gain in memecoin dogecoin (DOGE), which historically tends to act correlated to the asset's movements. Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.

Elsewhere, majors XRP, BNB Chain's BNB, Solana's SOL and Cardano's ADA rose 3%. Tron's TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a no-fee update in the Sunpump platform.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.

The widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.

Ether rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).

Testing began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.

“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won't attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”

“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.

Meanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.

“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its "digital gold" role,” Lee added.

The adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors has accelerated in recent years, reshaping the financial landscape. Institutions, including banks, hedge funds, and asset managers, are engaging in crypto institutional lending, a process where institutions lend out their idle crypto assets through specialized platforms to earn interest, facilitating liquidity and capital efficiency in the market. This enables capital efficiency, liquidity provisioning, and yield generation. Alongside lending, they are also participating in trading and custody services. This shift is driven by various factors, such as regulatory clarity, market maturity, and technological advancements.

One of the catalysts for institutions' adoption of digital asset is the establishment of clear regulatory guidelines. Governments and financial authorities worldwide are developing frameworks that facilitate compliance and risk management. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Union's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations aim to provide legal clarity, reducing uncertainties for institutional investors. Regulatory compliance in crypto ensures transparency, security, and legitimacy, encouraging large-scale participation.

The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, offering institutions robust trading platforms, liquidity solutions, and reliable price discovery mechanisms. The emergence of crypto institutional trading platforms provides secure and regulated environments for institutional investors to engage in digital asset markets. Moreover, enhanced liquidity and sophisticated risk management tools have reduced volatility concerns, making crypto a more attractive asset class.

A key barrier to institutional investment in crypto has been the security of digital assets. The development of institutional-grade custody services, provided by reliable firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, has significantly reduced these risks. These solutions offer secure, insured, and compliant storage for digital assets, allowing institutions to manage large crypto holdings safely.

Traditional banks have started integrating blockchain technology for institutions, leveraging its benefits for efficiency, security, and cost reduction. Some notable examples include:

The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions has facilitated institutional access to cryptocurrencies without requiring direct ownership. These financial instruments have bolstered crypto market growth, attracting institutional investors looking for regulated and easily accessible investment tools.

As mentioned earlier, secure custody solutions tailored for institutions have significantly improved the landscape. By addressing security concerns, these custody services have enabled hedge funds, asset managers, and banks to participate in the crypto space more confidently.

The tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, stocks, and bonds, is revolutionizing financial markets. By leveraging enterprise blockchain solutions, institutions can enhance liquidity, reduce settlement times, and provide fractional ownership opportunities. Companies like BlackRock and HSBC are exploring tokenization to improve efficiency and accessibility in traditional finance.

The rise of decentralized finance solutions for institutions, increasing corporate treasuries' crypto allocations, and partnerships between fintech firms and traditional banks indicate a strong institutional commitment to the crypto ecosystem. These institutional crypto trends highlight the continued integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.</p>

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal-Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin, Boxford Police said in a news release.

The bitcoin (BTC) price showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Wednesday, a decision that aligned with market expectations, as policymakers assessed the potential impact of U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump on Japan's export-driven economy.

The BOJ highlighted “high uncertainties” surrounding trade policies, with Governor Kazuo Ueda emphasizing the need to monitor how the tariff plans could ripple through global and Japanese markets.

The decision comes ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, where rates are also expected to remain steady as Trump's tariff policies loom large.

Japan's monetary policy and bond yields have often influenced BTC markets. A stronger yen and rising yields tend to weigh on bitcoin by attracting capital to traditional assets while a stable or weaker yen supports the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative store of value.

 That said, when the bank raised rates in January, the bitcoin price held steady because attention was focused on potential policy developments under Donald Trump's residency.

Wednesday's rate decision keeps Japanese bond yields in check, limiting pressure on bitcoin's price.

A Bitcoin bill has been presented to the Minnesota state senate that proposes allowing investments in Bitcoin and promotes cryptocurrency use in certain areas.

In a March 18 statement, Senator Jeremy Miller, who introduced the bill, said the Minnesota Bitcoin Act (SF2661) aims to modernize the state's financial landscape and position Minnesota as a leader in digital assets.

Under SF 26661, the Minnesota State Board of Investment would be allowed to allocate state funds to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, treating them similarly to traditional investments like stocks and bonds.

Further, state employees will have the option to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their retirement plans.

The legislation would also allow residents to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin, following in the footsteps of states like Colorado and Utah. 

Additionally, the bill includes tax incentives for cryptocurrency earnings, allowing certain gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be subtracted from taxable income.

“I believe global digital currencies are here to stay, and it's inevitable that they become more and more mainstream,” Miller said.

According to him, cryptocurrencies would benefit Minnesota by providing “new financial opportunities” and giving the state a “strategic position to take advantage of being on the forefront of this digital revolution.

“Crypto is a versatile digital asset that can be used in multiple ways, including as investments, global currency, or a hedge against inflation,” he added.

Minnesota follows over a dozen other U.S. states that are mulling state cryptocurrency investments. Some states like Arizona and Texas have introduced multiple bills.

On March 11, Texas state lawmakers presented House Bill 4258, which allows Texas' chief accountant and financial watchdog to invest up to $250 million of the state's economic stabilization fund balance in Bitcoin or other kinds of crypto assets.

The following day, Senator Cynthia Lummis presented an updated version of her July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which allows the government to hold more than 1 million Bitcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) prices face resistance around their key levels; a firm close above indicates recovery on the cards, while Ethereum (ETH) price finds support at its critical level, suggesting a bounce ahead.

Bitcoin price has faced resistance around the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,496 since Friday and trades below it. This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the Bitcoin price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.

If bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

Ethereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.

If XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Dogecoin price hovers around $0.168 on Wednesday after bouncing off its 200-week EMA last week. Santiment's data shows that DOGE's utility and whale wallets are rising, hinting at a potential rally for the dog-themed memecoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $83,300 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing resistance around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,500 since last week, with a break above this level suggesting a potential recovery. 

XRP open interest and funding rates have remained largely negative in recent weeks. Investors remained calm despite the high bearish sentiment in the futures market, likely due to their large profits.

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.
