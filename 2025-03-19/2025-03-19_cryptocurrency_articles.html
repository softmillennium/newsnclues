This decline brings into focus the challenges facing traditional DEXs, such as fragmented liquidity and scalability issues. Enter BinoFi, the first hybrid crypto exchange, which promises to redefine how digital assets are traded. Uniswap, like other traditional DEXs, operates solely on a decentralized model, leading to challenges like isolated liquidity pools and vulnerability to market inefficiencies during periods of high volatility. BinoFi’s hybrid approach addresses these limitations, offering both the speed and liquidity of centralized systems alongside the security and autonomy of decentralized platforms. This makes BinoFi a compelling alternative for traders seeking the best of both worlds. This approach ensures deep liquidity, minimizing slippage and enabling faster, more efficient order execution. Traders no longer need to juggle between platforms for the best prices or liquidity pools; BinoFi brings it all into one seamless interface. BinoFi eliminates the need for typically cumbersome and insecure bridge protocols. Its cross-chain trading infrastructure allows users to execute transactions directly across multiple blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. This simplifies the trading process while significantly reducing risks associated with asset wrapping and bridge exploits. The excitement surrounding BinoFi’s platform has been matched by impressive traction in its ongoing presale. Its hybrid CEX/DEX architecture, combined with cross-chain capabilities and AI tools, positions it as a frontrunner in a future where efficiency, security, and liquidity reign supreme. For those watching the DeFi space closely, BinoFi represents more than just a new platform; it’s a shift in how we think about trading and asset management in decentralized finance.

Robert Wickens' return to top level of racing will be in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. He's slated to team with two-time GTLM champion Tommy Milner and race for DXDT Racing in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach April 11-12. Wickens will team with veteran racer Milner to pilot a specially equipped Chevrolet Corvette Z06 GT3.R with a state-of-the-art hand-control braking system. Ever since Robert Wickens was critically injured in an August 2018 IndyCar crash at Pocono Raceway that left him paralyzed, he's been on the comeback trail. It's all part of Wickens' return to top-level racing. He's slated to team with two-time GTLM champion Tommy Milner and race for DXDT Racing at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach April 11-12. Wickens plans to race in the IMSA sprint races this season with designs on a full-season run at the series championship in 2026. "But honestly, taking the green flag in Long Beach is going to be an enormous step forward in my career and my journey back to the highest levels. There's still some work to be done, but I think you can say it's definitely a massive box checked—probably the biggest box that we could check off so far in my return." Making this return to the big stage possible are the efforts of Bosch, General Motors, Pratt & Miller, and DXDT Racing. The team's Corvette Z06 GT3.R has been equipped with special hand controls that allow Wickens to control the electronic braking and throttle with hand controls that top anything the driver has experienced since his accident. "I think the biggest takeaway I have so far is that it feels like the Bosch EBS and the hand-control system that was developed by Pratt & Miller, it's like it belonged in this car," Wickens said midway through his second day of testing. "Immediately, I felt way more comfortable with the braking feeling and braking sensation than I even had in my past racing in TCR with the Bosch EBS. "And I think after driving this Corvette Z06, I feel like the next step for me is actually to start doing more throttle application with my right hand, just to build that muscle memory. With this car, like turn 7 (at Sebring), there's a few corners here where I feel like I need to start practicing using throttle with both hands a little bit more. "But the home simulator, it definitely didn't hurt. The brake that I use on my home simulator is very different to what we have in the race car, but for throttle purposes, I think it's very helpful." Milner says it won't be an issue on race day. "Him being paralyzed from the chest down, he has no use of his feet, really. And there's a brake ring, there's a throttle, throttle paddles, and those obviously take the place of what I would normally use in the pedal box. The tires and the fuel typically take a little bit less energy, take a little bit less time. "Robbie obviously comes from a place where he has the sports-car racing experience, where he's had to do those driver changes. Milner added that it's hard not to be inspired by Wickens' return. "His drive and determination is pretty incredible," Milner said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ford Motor Company is re-recalling more than 50,000 vehicles for camera, battery and window issues that were incorrectly repaired as part of prior recalls, according to multiple National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) notices. Four separate recall notices reported to the NHTSA on March 13 include 64,531 cars across seven models and four model years, including Explorer, Edge, Lincoln, Bronco Maverick, F-250 and F-350 vehicles. In the fourth and smallest recall, which concerns only nine cars, the front driver and passenger windows may fail to automatically retract when they encounter an obstacle (such as a finger or hand), increasing the risk of injury. Here's what to know about the four latest Ford recalls. The recalled vehicles were previously repaired under four separate past recalls – NHTSA recall numbers 22V-151, 23V-342, 24V-267 and 23V-507. This round of recalls includes the following Ford vehicles: 2021-2022 Edge vehicles previously repaired under NHTSA recall number 22V-151 (Ford number 22S14) are being recalled due to rearview camera displays that may show a blank or distorted image. 2020-2023 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-342 (Ford number 23S23) are being recalled due to loss of rearview camera input. 2020-2022 Lincoln Corsair vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-342 (Ford number 23S23) are being recalled due to loss of rearview camera input. This recall is part of the 49,399 cars listed above. 2021-2024 Bronco Sport vehicles previously repaired under recall number 24V-267 (Ford number 24S24) are being recalled due to failure in a module that detects low battery and may result in the unexpected loss of driving power due to undetected loss of battery charge. 2022-2023 Maverick vehicles previously repaired under recall number 24V-267 (Ford number 24S24) are being recalled due to failure in a module that detects low battery and may result in the unexpected loss of driving power due to undetected loss of battery charge. This recall is part of the 12,833 cars listed above. 2023 Super Duty F-250 and F-350 vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-507 are being recalled due to windows that may not automatically reverse when they encounter an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury. Ford is recalling over 50,000 vehicles, including Explorers, Lincolns, Edges and more. The front passenger and driver windows failed to automatically roll back down when they met an obstruction, leading to increased injury risk. This was fixed via a free software update at dealerships. USA TODAY reached out to Ford for comment on the recurring nature of these recalls. What to do if you have a recalled car If you have any of the vehicles mentioned in any of the above recalls, owners can take their vehicles to a Ford dealership for a free software update or module recalibration. Owner notifications for all four recalls are expected to be mailed on April 24.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are up—along with U.S. equities—after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady and the central bank's chair gave a calming press conference. The biggest cryptocurrency had jumped before the Fed's announcement, but is now up even more: Bitcoin's price now stands at $85,648, a more than 4% rise over the past day. And Solana is currently trading hands for nearly $134, climbing by 8% over a 24-hour period; the coin, which is the sixthbiggest digital asset, jumped by 2% in the hour after Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke. The wider crypto market is now up by more than 3% over the past day, and its total market cap stands at $2.91 trillion. U.S. stocks surged following Powell's press conference but have cooled off slightly since, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up by more than 1% on the day. Equities and crypto had taken a battering earlier this month after President Trump's unpredictable tariff announcements left Wall Street second-guessing what the White House would do next. But Powell shrugged off concerns in a press conference Wednesday, claiming that Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" effect on inflation. As expected, the U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50% on Wednesday. The Fed cut borrowing costs in September for the first time in four years, ahead of sizable gains for both crypto and stocks—with the surge only accelerating once President Trump won November's election.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The National Corvette Museum (NCM) announced the appointment of Ken Lingenfelter, a respected leader in automotive performance, to its Board of Directors as an At-Large Member. He acquired the company from his cousin, legendary racer John Lingenfelter, in 2008 and has since propelled it to prominence by developing performance upgrades for GM vehicles, particularly Corvettes. Lingenfelter’s passion for Chevrolet and Corvette culture has deep roots. His father served as a manager at General Motors' Fisher Body Assembly plant in Ohio, instilling an appreciation for American automotive engineering from an early age. Today, Ken Lingenfelter’s private car collection is one of the largest and most impressive in the U.S., regularly attracting attention from enthusiasts nationwide. An ardent supporter of the National Corvette Museum’s mission to preserve and celebrate Corvette history, Lingenfelter has previously lent several vehicles from his extensive collection to the museum, including the rare and historically significant 1954 Corvette EX-87 Duntov Mule. In his new role on the board, Lingenfelter is expected to significantly influence the museum’s future projects, exhibitions, and strategic direction, ensuring its continued appeal as a premier destination for Corvette enthusiasts worldwide. Located near the Corvette’s exclusive production facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the museum serves as a vital cultural center for Corvette fans and automotive historians alike. Recently, Lingenfelter Performance Engineering unveiled a new 427-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) stroker engine upgrade for the C8 Corvette, enhancing its output from the standard 490 horsepower to an impressive 700 horsepower.

Alfa Romeo boss Santo Ficili said in a LinkedIn post that the next-generation Stelvio and Giulia will be available with hybrid power. Taking to LinkedIn, Alfa Romeo’s CEO has confirmed that the upcoming Stelvio and Giulia models will both see hybrid powertrains under the hood. Now, this goes against the company’s previous all-electric push, which was planned to start in 2027. But this isn’t exactly a new position from Stellantis and has been echoed across other brands. Both Dodge and Jeep have tried to walk the line of battery-electric powertrain adoption, while also taking advantage of the parent company’s multi-energy platforms. As for which hybrid powertrain will power the Stelvio or Giulia’s wheels, that’s a question still being answered in Turin. It would make sense to rely on a variant of the Hurricane engine family if a six-cylinder is an option, or could lean on the four-cylinder GME, or Global Medium Engine. However, Ficili made it clear that all of the Stelvio’s questions will be answered when it shows its face later this year. The Giulia should follow shortly after, and both are slated to be built in Italy. Do you think it’s smart for Alfa Romeo to stick with gasoline engines?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/four-cheapest-lease-deals-available-200000503.html'>Four of the Cheapest Lease Deals Available Today</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 20:00:00 <p>
There are more attractive lease choices out there than ever before and manufacturers are offering leases on high trims, as well. As of March 2025, several manufacturers are offering attractive lease deals that combine affordability with desirable features. Below are four of the most cost-effective automotive lease deals available this month. Don’t say sedans are dead because the Kia K4 is one seriously compelling compact sedan with gobs of style and tech. It borrows edgy styling from its K9 EV SUV sibling, and the airy interior upends what an economy sedan should feel like inside. Standard equipment on the LXS trim includes features such as heated side mirrors, twin 12.3-inch screens for instrumentation and infotainment, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, a smart trunk, and a slew of high-end safety tech. This lease deal only applies to the 2025 Kia K4 LXS front-wheel drive. If you’re searching for a no-nonsense but still attractive compact sedan, now is the time to lease a 2025 Nissan Sentra. This compact sedan offers a balance of style, comfort, and efficiency. Powered by a 149-hp four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, the Sentra won’t set your hair on fire, but it will give you 34 mpg in combined driving. The Sentra SV comes standard with 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an 8-inch color touchscreen infotainment system, a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and adaptive cruise control. Nissan will have you pay a mere $229 per month for 39 months, with $2,499 due at signing. The diminutive 2025 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV that combines practicality with a touch of style and is known for its compact dimensions and urban-friendly design. Every Venue trim level gets a user-friendly 8.0-inch color touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The Venue also gets praise for roominess that belies its small exterior size, and the large physical controls make it easy to operate. The 121-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn’t powerful, but it offers 33 mpg highway for good fuel economy. The purchase price of $20,200 is definitely approachable for most folks, but an excellent lease offering of $239 a month for 36 months with $3,499 due at lease signing can surely draw in customers looking for a low payment and a short commitment. Not only does it look pricier than its $20,500 base MSRP, but it also has precise and communicative steering that befits a sports car. The midpack Trax LT comes with standard features like 17-inch machined aluminum wheels, an 11-inch diagonal color touch-screen, an 8-inch diagonal color instrument cluster, wireless smartphone integration, remote vehicle start, and automatic climate controls. The purchase price is $23,995, but a lease of $299 per month for 24 months with $1,879 due at signing improves its affordability even more. Leasing presents an attractive option for car shoppers who want affordable payments, low commitment, and a warranty throughout the life of ownership.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Clean As A Whistle: Joe Rogan’s Heavily Modified ‘69 Nova When you’re the number one podcaster in the world, or in other words Joe Rogan, and you really like cars, you can afford to pour ridiculous resources into a build like this super clean ’69 Nova. That’s a testament to their dedication in doing an excellent job instead of having a “good enough” attitude about their cars. Instead of going for a period-correct engine, Pure Vision and Rogan opted for a supercharged LT4, the same engine used in the sixth-gen Camaro ZL1. Instead of getting crazy, they kept the engine entirely stock. Considering it makes about 650-horsepower, that’s more than enough to get the Nova moving in a hurry. Plus, it’s more reliable than pushing the envelope with that cost. The exhaust, brake lines, and fuel line are all tucked away nicely, plus the old Chevy has an eight-inch ground clearance, helping to guard against damage. Surprisingly, this thing has manual steering, which we guess for Rogan works since he can handle the work.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/2025-ford-escape-plug-hybrid-192657183.html'>Is the 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid Worth $38,400?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 19:26:57 <p>
If you're shopping for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) crossover or small SUV under the $50,000 mark, you really don't have a ton of options to sort through. With a price tag that's nearly $2,000 more than the better-equipped gas-powered Escape ST-Line Elite, "value" might not be the first word that springs to mind if you're shopping for a 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid. The 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid is available in a single, well-equipped trim level A quick glance at the spec sheet may surprise you. And, if you want to load up your Escape with even more goodies—like a Bang & Olufsen stereo or power sunroof—there's nearly $8,000 in optional packages waiting for you. Of course, many shoppers will likely care most about the SUV's powertrain. The 2025 Escape Plug-in Hybrid relies on a 2.5-liter inline-four combustion engine paired with an electronic motor integrated into the vehicle's electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT) that puts out 210 hp. A 14.4-kWh lithium-ion battery allows for up to 37 miles of all-electric driving range. It offers 33 miles of range but makes a more impressive 261 horsepower. Small things like wireless device charging and digital key functionality make a big difference. You can't talk about hybrid SUVs in this price range without mentioning the Toyota RAV4 PHEV (formerly RAV4 Prime). There are places the former Prime falls flat, though, like its smaller 8.0-inch touchscreen and 33.5 cubic feet of cargo space. In that niche, it's a good value and worth $38,400. If you don't need all-wheel drive or value the RAV4's quickness, and don't care about the Tucson's slightly more graceful screen integration, save yourself some money and pick up an Escape PHEV instead.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amazon, the seller of everything, apparently wants to try its hand at selling used cars next. Jin made the announcement on Automotive News' Daily Drive podcast earlier this week. She says people in 68 markets can now buy a new Hyundai on Amazon. The retainer has also expressed interest in working with other car manufacturers to get their new vehicles on its platform. Amazon's goal here isn't to be like an AutoTrader or Cars.com type of used car market. In Jin's mind, it is more of a Carvana-style system where everything can be done on the website. Delivering an online marketplace for used cars could position dealers to compete with the likes of Carvana, which sells used vehicles directly to consumers via a fully digital environment. Since Amazon Autos is relying on dealers for their inventory, the platform can be leveraged as an omnichannel for those who want to shop online and visit a dealership during their transaction.

Europol has warned that blockchain and AI will “accelerate serious and organised crime” in the coming years, with a new report from the EU law enforcement agency even predicting that fully autonomous AI “could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks.” In its 2025 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, Europol suggested that the combination of AI and crypto will serve to expand online fraud schemes, which already represent “the most rapidly expanding sector” in organised crime. While not data-focused, the assessment offers a broad and far-reaching summary of the expanding role cryptocurrencies are now playing in serious crime in Europe. The report concluded that cryptocurrency has “moved beyond the scope of cybercrime” and is found increasingly in more “traditional” areas such as “drug trafficking or migrant smuggling.” Europol’s evaluation of finds support in private research, with blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs releasing a report in January of this year which revealed that bad actors “are increasingly leveraging AI to carry out hacks and conduct fraud.” Isabella Chase, the Head of Policy for EMEA at TRM Labs, told Decrypt that there are three primary ways in which criminals are already using AI. Less visibly, AI is also being used to support cybercrime and other exploits by providing criminals with additional information, providing data and details they may have otherwise missed. The use of AI is likely already adding millions on to the cost of organised crime, but TRM Labs estimates that more criminals will adopt AI “in the coming years” as they experiment with different ways of harnessing it for their particular ends. “Criminals will use AI for targeting and engaging with victims whether these be individuals or entities,” Chase told Decrypt, adding that the technology will also be used for “more programmatic laundering of criminal funds which could make it easier to profit from crime.” While this may paint a bleak picture, Chase ultimately suggested that there will be a parallel growth in law enforcement and the private sector using AI and more advanced analytic tools, thereby improving “their ability to identify criminals and their activities.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Volatility Shares, a Florida-based issuer of exchange-traded funds, will debut two ETFs on Thursday that track Solana’s price using futures contracts in the U.S., the firm’s co-founder and CEO Justin Young confirmed to Decrypt. The Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) will track Solana futures, which recently launched in the U.S. through Coinbase’s derivatives arm, while the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF (SOLT) will allow investors to access amplified returns. Both funds will be listed on the Nasdaq, as first reported by Bloomberg. “We launched the first leverage Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., so this fits really well into our wheelhouse,” he told Decrypt. “It’s really us being first to market again.” Volatility Shares first filed for a futures-based Solana ETF in December, and registration statements posted to the firm’s website say they are “subject to completion.” At the time, Volatility Shares filed for a “-1x Solana ETF.” However, the company has put that offering “on hold for now” despite a green light from the SEC, Young said. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) listed SOLZ and SOLT last month before futures regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission began trading. Solana futures began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Monday, generating $12.3 million in notional trading volume. Over the past month, the asset has dropped 27% as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have unsettled crypto traders on edge.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Danger On The Road: Camaros Recalled For Wheels Locking Up Yet another safety recall for an American muscle car has been issued recently, this time for Chevy Camaros. If that were to happen at highway speeds, the result might not be pretty. This only applies to cars outfitted with the 10-speed automatic transmission. Apparently, the issue is a transmission control valve can wear excessively over time, resulting a pressure loss, which then lads to hard shifting. Considering what might happen if your wheels were to lock up while you’re driving, especially at higher speeds, we still wouldn’t put off getting your Camaro or Cadillac fixed. Sadly, this can’t be done through an over-the-air update, so you have to visit a dealer and either drop off your ride or sit around in the waiting room for the software to be installed. With the new software, GM says it will detect excessive valve wear in the transmission about 10,000 miles before the whole wheel lock up thing could happen, which is great. We know recalls happen all the time these days, but this problem could cause a serious crash. Also, this is yet another reason why we love manual transmissions and wish automakers would do over-the-air software updates for recalls like this.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Republican tariffs may soon wreak havoc on new car sales, but at least for now, we haven't seen any massive changes. That isn't necessarily the case with every new car, though. Some of the most in-demand models still command a premium, and if you can find a comparable alternative, it could easily save you thousands of dollars. So which new cars are currently the worst deals? Our friends at Consumer Reports recently crunched the numbers on actual transaction data from TrueCar and found 10 of the worst offenders.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310718/bitcoin-wavers-as-fed-holds-rates-steady'>Bitcoin Shrugs as Fed Projects Two Rate Cuts in 2025, Holds Rates Steady</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 18:21:55 <p>
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, prolonging a months-long pause on rate cuts amid economic uncertainty fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which rose on Wednesday morning, was roughly flat immediately after the central bank stood pat for a third consecutive time but was still up 4% over the past 24 hours to trade at about $84,500, according to data provider CoinGecko. In remarks following the announcement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank’s latest inflation forecast was “a little higher than projected with December." “It is going to be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs,” he said, adding that price pressures from Trump's trade policy may prove transitory. At the same time, Powell said "recent indications point to a moderation in consumer spending," signaling that one of the U.S. economy's main drivers of economic growth may cool. An updated forecast weighing expectations from 19 Fed officials showed two rate cuts this year, effectively matching policymakers’ outlook in December. In December, however, one Fed official foresaw as many as five rate cuts this year, or a reduction of 1.5% in the Fed’s benchmark rate. On Wednesday, no fed official envisioned more than three rate cuts this year, suggesting a firmer policy outlook. The president’s approach to tariffs has sparked inflation concerns, but some fear that it may also hamstring U.S. economic growth as consumers and businesses face elevated costs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in cooler than expected a week ago, indicating that inflation eased slightly last month. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, is expected to show a 2.7% annual increase later this month, per Trading Economics. Prior to Wednesday's interest rate decision, Fed futures traders foresaw a 51% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates in June, according to CME FedWatch. Those remained a tossup as market participants mulled the Fed’s latest projections.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I, for one, am shocked that an Elon Musk-led company would be this stubborn. The show features over 200 vehicles over the course of five days from automakers like Cadillac, Ford, Hyundai, Chevy and Toyota, but Tesls will no longer be among them. Tesla's initial inclusion in the auto show royally pissed off some British Columbians who are miffed at Musk for questioning Canada's sovereignty and his role as one of the top advisors to President Trump. Trump has slapped tariffs on all sorts of Canadian goods and threatened to make Canada the "51st state." In February, Musk posted on X that Canada "is not a real country," which ended up sparking a petition to remove his passport and citizenship that received "...over 375,000 signatures," according to CNN. Musk, funnily enough, has a Canadian passport that he obtained as a teenager through his mother who was born in Saskatchewan. It's understandable why Canadians aren't thrilled with these two jokers. nvironmental activists protest near the Tesla Gigafactory electric car factory on May 11, 2024 close to Gruenheide, Germany. "Bottom line, I want them to take it out," Gagnon told the outlet. I would not be terribly surprised if other auto shows around the globe pull similar moves. Right now, people are pissed off at both Musk and Tesla pretty much everywhere. Unless something serious is done about Musk's leadership at the company, it's unlikely his reputation will do anything but harm Tesla's.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

No matter what generation or variant, Porsche's 911 GT3 is now seen as one of the best cars ever made. Good news: Just as with the stuff you buy at Costco, there can be savings when buying in bulk when it comes to special naturally-aspirated 911s — and auction house RM Sotheby's is offering a unique opportunity for just that. Next month, the group is auctioning off a hauler full of six effectively new 911s in Munich, all either based on the 991-generation GT3. Just 991 examples were built, and the model offered here is No. Two race cars are also included in the lot. One, a 911 GT3 Cup, is a spec racer that could have been used in Porsche Carrera Cup-style series around the world. The other, a 911 GT3 R, is a GT3-spec car that could have been raced in IMSA GTD and at major events like the Nürburgring 24 Hours. Neither was actually raced, but both can still be run in categories that allow older cars. RM Sotheby's has not listed an estimate for the lot, but another 911 R with delivery miles sold for $575,000 last year. That said, if you were already debating buying a half-dozen rare 911s, this certainly would simplify the task.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The U.S. has never actually lived up to the ideals we were taught in school, but less than two months into Trump's second term, our country has become a truly dangerous place to visit. So it shouldn't be surprising that a pair of power-tripping cops who had nothing to do with immigration enforcement took it upon themselves to harass non-citizens, including subjecting Canadian folk duo Cassie and Maggie MacDonald to a completely uncalled for loyalty test during an Ohio traffic stop, as the Globe and Mail reports. And it doesn't sound like something two different cops independently came up with, either. They were forced to wait while two Guernsey County Sheriff's Deputies brought out a drug dog that allegedly discovered narcotics. "It seemed very much in line with the narrative that has recently been touted." Read more: This SEMA Ford Maverick Show Truck Is A Symphony In Teal Their search for drugs that didn't exist may have been a bust, but the deputies also put the sisters in separate patrol vehicles and started asking even more inappropriate questions. "It seemed weighted, as if whether we were going to be given a further difficult time or if we were going to have the opportunity to go on our way depended on the answer I gave." And while it's entirely possible the two deputies acted on their own, Cassie told the Canadian news outlet that it sure didn't feel that way. She also added, "I found it to be a very jarring question. And the fact we were both asked that question independently makes me think it was a mandate coming from above." Both Cassie and Maggie MacDonald have had U.S. work visas for more than a decade, so there was no reason for them to suspect they would have any issues. And even though cops harassing Canadian drivers isn't completely new, it's also hard to imagine they'll risk booking another tour in the U.S. now that they know how quickly a simple traffic stop can escalate. You shouldn't speed or use a phone while driving, but it's also very normal to make mistakes while driving in a new country. And as much as it would be wonderful if we could guarantee law enforcement would treat people fairly and follow the law in those situations, that just isn't possible anymore. For your own sake, it's probably better to spend your tourist dollars in a country where you don't have to worry about being disappeared without due process. And while change does take time, maybe if all the tourist dollars dry up, business owners will finally get fed up enough with Republicans taking money out of their pockets to demand that change happen faster.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/buy-one-electric-pickup-trucks-172500764.html'>Buy One Of These Electric Pickup Trucks Instead Of Humiliating Yourself With A Tesla Cybertruck</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 17:25:00 <p>
When it was first revealed back in 2019, the Tesla Cybertruck was just a ridiculously angular truck that nobody thought would ever actually exist. By the time it finally went on sale in December 2023, it had become an emblem of everything wrong with Tesla boss Elon Musk, and over the past year that's only got worse for the big dumb truck. Things have now gotten so bad for Cybertruck owners that they're getting poop and eggs thrown at their stainless steel trucks, and some are resorting to novelty bumper stickers to argue that they aren't fans of Musk anymore, either. If all the abuse has got too bad for your friendly neighborhood Cybertruck owner, then they needn't worry, as there are a handful of other electric pickup trucks out there that aren't half as dumb as Tesla's Cybertruck. Read more: The 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor Is Exactly What You Want It To Be It looks like a regular F-150, drives like a regular F-150 and, despite having to haul around its own weight, is still rated to tow around 8,500 pounds of stuff whenever you need it to. It's also much cheaper, but isn't able to charge quite as quickly as Tesla's truck, and can also share its power in an emergency situation through clever tech called bidirectional charging, which the Cybertruck also has. The American startup's flagship boasts distinctive style, but not in an "I was designed by a five-year-old" kind of way, a very usable range and a host of innovative flourishes baked into the design. The R1T produces up to 1,025 hp, more than the Cybertruck; has an 11,000-pound tow capacity, more than the F-150; and comes with a nifty gear tunnel to add in extra storage space, also not offered on any of its rivals. It also starts at nearly $10,000 less than Tesla's offering. Prefer your electric pickup truck from a legacy automaker? The electric iteration of Chevy's iconic truck comes with a little design flair to set it apart from the gas-powered truck, as well as increased range compared with the options from Ford and Rivian — albeit at a premium. If you want to be able to cover more than 500 miles in your electric truck, then the GMC Sierra EV could be the perfect replacement for your Cybertruck. Based on the same platform as the Silverado EV, GMC's offering comes with more range and a whiff of luxury that you might miss in Chevy's EV. It is, however, a pretty ugly truck and might not appeal to everybody out there. Like the sound of all that but don't totally want to lose the attention your Cybertruck brings, get a Hummer EV instead. What more could you want from an enormous electric pickup? If you aren't in a rush to abandon your Cybertruck out of fear it'll be the victim of a domestic terrorism, then you could soon swap it for Stellantis' electric truck offering: the Ram 1500 REV. When it launches in 2026, the 1500 REV will offer the greatest towing capacity of the trucks listed here at around 14,000 pounds, a range of roughly 350 miles on a single charge, and a payload capacity of more than 2,600 pounds, which is over 100 more than the Cybertruck can manage. Revived by VW last year, the Scout Terra is an all-electric truck that offers 350 miles of range, a towing capacity of 10,000 pounds, and it'll be sold direct-to-consumers, so you won't have to deal with a salesperson piling on markups.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have generated more than $500 million in net inflows over the past three days, regaining lost ground amid a small rally in the funds underlying asset and wider gains in risk-on assets. The ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) were responsible for almost all these increases with ARKB receiving $180 million in net inflows over the three-day period, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. "The shift from outflows to inflows over the last three days signifies growing confidence driven by BTC's price stabilization and institutional interest," Alan Orwick, co-founder of layer 1 protocol Quai Network, wrote in an email to Decrypt. The surge follows five weeks of net outflows that occurred as crypto and other markets slumped—a result of investor jitters about a looming trade war, geo-political tensions and other macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin's price was recently trading at about $84,500, up more than 3% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is down more than 11% during the past month, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. (MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) Stocks were up Tuesday as investors awaited the latest interest rate decision and signs that the U.S. central bank would continue its quantitative easing, a boon for risk-on assets. Orwick noted: "As the end of the quarter approaches, institutional investors are adjusting their portfolios to align with strategic asset allocations, which this rebalancing leading to increased investments in assets such as BTC ETFs, especially if Bitcoin has under or overperformed relative to other holdings." The 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading last year, have been wildly successful and now manage roughly $100 billion in assets. Looming economic issues, including the increased prospect of a recession have trumped U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly policies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a speech at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City on March 20. This will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has addressed a Bitcoin and crypto conference, highlighting the growing influence of digital assets in mainstream financial policy. Although this marks his first speech as a sitting president at a crypto event, Trump has previously engaged with the Bitcoin community, having spoken at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference in Nashville last summer while on the campaign trail. Trump’s speech at DAS comes only a couple weeks after moving forward with officially integrating Bitcoin into his national strategy, when he signed an executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning BTC as a key asset for the country’s financial future. Joining the lineup tomorrow at DAS is Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who will deliver a keynote speech and engage in a fireside chat with Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. Additionally, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will host a panel discussion with BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robbie Mitchnick and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products Giang Bui, where they will delve into the evolving landscape of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption. The announcement of Trump’s participation follows remarks from Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for President Trump, who spoke earlier this week at DAS. “I think it’s high time that our President started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away.” Trump’s executive order has already sparked legislative action aiming to build on this momentum.

The Samourai and Tornado Cash developers are being prosecuted under money laundering legislation for developing purely self custodial software that, in no circumstances in which their software could be used, gave them any control over user funds. I’m calling on every United States citizen reading this to take the form letter below, fill it in appropriately, and send it to your congressman or congresswoman — especially if you are in a district with a representative claiming publicly to be pro-Bitcoin. Opinions expressed are entirely the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine. I am writing as a concerned citizen of [your State]. I wish to bring to your attention a very important matter regarding the criminal prosecution of open source developers writing software for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem. All four of these men have done nothing but produce and publish open source software that was/is freely available to the public. A foundational reality of decentralized networks like Bitcoin is the ability their architecture gives to their users to interact and transact with their money using nothing but open-source and freely available software that communicates with a decentralized computer network. Blockchains by their very nature, however, are public stores of information. This is not only very sensitive information to have in the public domain in general, but it can present a very serious risk to people’s physical safety. Incidents of kidnapping, physical assault, and home invasion in order to steal bitcoin from private individuals have increased in frequency as its value has increased. Both Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash do so in a purely self-custodial manner, meaning no entity other than the end users themselves ever has control, or ability to influence, the transactions that are made. This also means that there is no legal entity that the current charges actually apply to (i.e. a custodial financial institution subject to financial regulations). Separately, Roman Sterlingov has been convicted in criminal court of operating a custodial mixing service used to achieve privacy on the Bitcoin network. While this service was custodial, and as such would have financial regulatory obligations, the evidence presented at trial of Roman’s involvement in operating this service is purely circumstantial. Many details of the nature of this evidence, and its questionability, exist on the public record from Sterlingov’s attorney Tor Ekeland.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310689/lista-dao-revolutionizes-bnb-ecosystem-bringing-launchpool-rewards-to-btc'>Lista DAO Revolutionizes BNB Ecosystem: Bringing Launchpool rewards to BTC</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 14:51:15 <p>
Lista DAO Breaks New Ground in BNBFi with Listings on Pendle and Innovative SolvBTC.BNB Integration. Notably, Lista DAO is the only DeFi protocol permitted to participate directly in Binance’s Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop initiatives before a new token goes live. lisUSD is a decentralized stable coin designed to provide capital efficiency and liquidity for DeFi users. It is soft-pegged to the US dollar, minted through an over-collateralized debt mechanism. Each lisUSD is fully backed by deposited collateral in the Lista vault, which helps maintain its peg and stability, providing a reliable dollar-denominated asset within the ecosystem for trading, lending, or yield earning. This token’s value appreciates relative to normal BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing holders to potentially earn passive staking yield over time while maintaining liquidity. With the unveiling of its 2025 roadmap, Lista DAO has set forth a three-pronged growth strategy that places emphasis on enhancing benefits for veLISTA token holders, expanding liquidity solutions, and optimizing staking mechanisms. Expansion of lisUSD Adoption: Lista DAO aims to scale the lisUSD ecosystem by driving its adoption across multiple blockchain networks, particularly within ecosystems that lack stable and reliable liquidity solutions. These initiatives will allow newly introduced staking assets to participate in Binance’s Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop programs, offering an estimated 30% APR. lisUSD has established liquidity pools with memes such as TST and CHEEMS in the BNB Chain ecosystem. This integration sparked the creation of new financial products, PT-clisBNB, YT-clisBNB, and LP-clisBNB, These assets offer a range of opportunities for users seeking passive income, fixed returns, or diversified yield exposure, all while leveraging Binance’s Launchpool incentives. By holding YT-clisBNB, investors gain direct access to Launchpool airdrops from Binance’s top projects, capturing additional rewards with no active management required. For those seeking predictable and stable returns, PT-clisBNB (Principal Token) offers a fixed-yield solution. LP-clisBNB (Liquidity Provider Token) provides a balanced approach, combining the benefits of both YT and PT tokens. Holders enjoy dual exposure to staking yields and Launchpool airdrops, while also potentially earning liquidity rewards. This collaboration enhances BNB staking yields by introducing a flexible, composable financial strategy, enabling users to separate principal and yield components for optimized returns. This action enables BTC holders to generate BTC-denominated rewards, access Binance’s Launchpool, and earn incentives across the BNB Chain ecosystem. As the only DeFi project within Binance’s ecosystem to be able to participate directly in Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop initiatives, Lista DAO remains at the forefront of BNBFi innovation. Whether through DeFi-powered capital efficiency, meme-driven liquidity expansion, or cross-chain integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Lista DAO continues to provide a robust suite of strategies for BNB holders. Lista DAO is the leading BNBFi protocol on BNB Chain, offering overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin (CDP), BNB LST, and innovative solutions that allow users to earn rewards from Binance Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrops. As the first to have DeFi BNB recognized for Binance Launchpool, Lista DAO has achieved a TVL growth of 896.92% year-to-date, reaching $1.1B, making it the fourth-largest protocol on BNB by TVL.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"I'm finally able to announce that this case has ended. It's over," Garlinghouse said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Ripple, which uses XRP Ledger and the XRP cryptocurrency, got a partial ruling in its favor in 2023, but the SEC filed an appeal seeking to have that decision overturned. A federal New York judge found that Ripple’s "programmatic sales” of XRP on a secondary market did not constitute securities transactions, while those made to institutional investors did. To be clear, the SEC has not yet made an announcement that it will drop its appeal. A Ripple spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that the SEC’s decision is “subject to Commission vote and approval.” It may take “several weeks” for the case to be officially withdrawn, they said, adding: “That timeline is completely in the SEC's control.” The SEC’s legal about-face was widely expected. Since SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda took over, the regulator has retreated from several enforcement actions, including its cases against the crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. If the SEC had been successful in its Ripple case, it could have had wide reaching impact on which cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities versus commodities. Ripple Labs Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told Decrypt in October, before President Donald Trump’s reelection, that the SEC’s appeal “will backfire.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310637/standard-chartered-coinbase-proactively-sold-37-million-of-ethereum-in-q4'>Standard Chartered: Coinbase 'Proactively Sold' $37 Million of Ethereum in Q4</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:48:57 <p>
An analyst from multinational bank Standard Chartered believes that crypto exchange Coinbase “proactively sold” 12,652 Ethereum (approximately $37 million) throughout Q4 2024. Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000 earlier this week. At the time, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the bank, claimed that layer-2 network Base had removed $50 billion from ETH’s market cap—now, he’s saying this is because of profit taking. “My view is that increased activity on Base increases demand for ETH in the first instance,” Kendrick shared with Decrypt. So while there are only 3 quarters of relevant post-Dencun data so far, I think we can conclude that Coinbase is not in the business of HODLing Base’s ETH profits.” Ethereum's Decun upgrade went live in March of last year and significantly reduced the gas fees on layer-2 networks. Since then, the analyst believes, Coinbase has shown its intention to sell as part of a “normal risk adjusted decision process.” They added that, "Separately, we also hold some ETH for long-term investment, and Coinbase reports our crypto assets specifically held for long -erm investment as part of our public quarterly earnings filing." Citing the firm's 10K, the spokesperson noted that, "crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term...we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them," adding that, "Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024." “The fact they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick added. As a result, over 70% of users on decentralized prediction market MYRIAD—launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN—believe that Ethereum’s relative price to Bitcoin will be above $0.023 by the end of the week.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-etfs-mining-btc-price-cycles'>How Bitcoin ETFs and Mining Innovations Are Reshaping BTC Price Cycles</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 12:11:15 <p>
Bitcoin’s market structure is evolving, and its once-predictable four-year cycles may no longer hold the same relevance. In a recent conversation with Matt Crosby, lead analyst at Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Mitchell Askew, Head Analyst at Blockware Solutions, shared his perspective on how Bitcoin ETFs, mining advancements, and institutional adoption are reshaping the asset’s price behavior. According to Askew, Bitcoin’s historical pattern of parabolic price increases followed by steep drawdowns is changing as institutional investors enter the market. Askew suggests that Bitcoin may no longer experience the extreme cycles of past bull and bear markets. Historically, halving events reduced miner rewards, triggered supply shocks, and fueled rapid price increases, often followed by corrections of 70% or more. However, the increasing presence of institutional investors is leading to a more structured, macro-driven market. Askew also notes that since Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, price movements have become more measured, with longer consolidation periods before continued growth. However, over the long term, a rising hash rate reflects greater investment in Bitcoin infrastructure and network security. However, deploying new mining rigs and setting up facilities takes time, leading to a delayed impact on hash rate expansion. Askew also highlights that mining hardware efficiency is reaching a plateau, which has significant implications for miners and Bitcoin’s supply structure. There's a trend developing in mining hardware that will bode extremely well for miners: Today, however, new models are only about 10% more efficient than the previous generation. As a result, mining rigs can now remain profitable for 4-8 years, reducing the pressure on miners to continuously reinvest in new equipment. Electricity costs remain the biggest factor in mining profitability, and Askew explains that miners are increasingly seeking low-cost power sources to maintain long-term sustainability. Many companies, including Blockware Solutions, operate in rural U.S. locations with stable energy prices, ensuring better profitability even during market downturns. Another important discussion point raised by Askew is the potential for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). However, he cautions that government action is slow and would likely involve gradual accumulation rather than sudden large-scale purchases. Even if implemented over several years, such a program could further reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term bullish trajectory by removing available supply from the market. Based on current trends, Askew remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory, though he believes the market’s behavior is shifting toward more gradual, sustained growth rather than extreme speculative cycles. Askew sees several key factors driving Bitcoin’s price over the next decade, including: While dramatic parabolic runs may become less frequent, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory appears stronger and more sustainable than ever.

We’re ringing the bell a little late – but make no mistake – cryptos are a mainstream asset today. Banks might be evil but they aren’t stupid. Same goes for the biggest governments on earth. Anyone remember when we thought cryptos would be money? Unfortunately, it isn’t the everyday person using them. A new policy stance in the US will allow banks to become blockchain validators. However, with money center banks as validators, other issues arise. All of this is speculative for the moment. But it would be an amazing way to slurp up data! No bank has announced it will jump into the blockchain node game. But make no mistake – with a profit incentive – it is only a matter of time until US banks start sniffing around the blockchain node ecosystem. We are getting decentralized systems – but not the kind that Bitcoin was supposed to create. Nations like Russia and China are dodging US sanctions with USDT and Bitcoin – but few actually use it as a currency. We think they will also be interested in market making, given how quickly investors are adopting cryptos as an asset. We know for a fact that Western money center banks use their power to rig markets. From gold to government bonds, the big banks work as handmaidens for central banks – and make sure the cartel maintains power. The idea of decentralized systems also thrives today – and it’s terrifying! Last year’s Q4 pump was loads of fun – but something darker is metastasizing at the highest levels of crypto. According to a post from Binance, “…discussions are ongoing about the Trump family possibly acquiring Binance US or becoming shareholders, it was also mentioned in the Wall Street Journal that former CEO CZ had requested a pardon from Donald Trump.” We never want to be accused of taking things out of context – so the headline of the post mentioned is – “Trump will not buy BinanceUS” – which is according to CZ. Trump is clearly taking the long view on cryptos – and hell – maybe Binance US and World Liberty Financial (WLF) are going to team up in the form of a new bank that validates “decentralized” transactions. Unfortunately for CZ negotiating position, Trump is already going gangbusters in the crypto world via WLF. People seem to love the centralized-decentralized model, as most of his supporters are seduced by Trump’s wild rhetoric, or willingness to make deals on their behalf. We suspect it is the have-nots who are flocking to WLF. Trump knows a good thing when he sees one. While the hoi polloi are still ignoring cryptos – especially as money – nations across the planet are using it. Some, like El Salvador, see it as a new industry and way to insulate itself from Western fiat madness. Other nations like China and Russia are actually using it for cross-border transactions! It’s great to see cryptos used as money – but sad that it’s happening as a way to skirt sanctions. Cryptos should liberate people from centralization – not empower one of the most totalitarian nations on the planet (China). North Korea also loves stealing cryptos – which fits – they also produce huge amounts of meth – just ask the great leader’s skinny @$$ sister… Here’s the deal – decentralized money is dead. But take heart – decentralization is alive and well! Prez McTrumper just sent a whole bunch of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador to be incarcerated. According to the USA, incarceration in El Salvador will cost a small fraction of what it would in the USA. El Salvador is also home to a project that will tap volcanic heat to mine Bitcoin – so if the Tren de Aragua crew isn’t up to working in the Slaveadorean mega prison – into the volcano they go. Wish we didn’t have to say it – but these are all trends that have decades or more to run. Few in number, these people control 50%+ of global wealth. And they are tired of the constraints nations create for them. Still in its infancy, offshore network-states (decentralization) are the future of power and wealth. What the above videos should tell you is that de-facto control over the world’s largest economy and military isn’t enough for this lot.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL, has attracted over $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) within a year of its debut, according to data from RWA.xyz. Data shows that BlackRock’s flagship tokenized fund saw a 56.4% asset surge in 30 days, crossing $1 billion. Ethereum holds the lion’s share of $825.4 million, with the remainder distributed across multiple networks like Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Arkham Intelligence data shows that $200 million worth of BUIDL tokens were minted on Thursday evening. USDtb is primarily backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL tokens, holding over 90% of its reserves in BUIDL with additional backing from stablecoins like USDC and USDT. BUIDL is designed for qualified institutional investors, offering them exposure to U.S. dollar yields on-chain. Apart from Ethena, Ondo Finance also leverages BUIDL in its financial offerings. BUIDL’s rapid ascent to over $1 billion in assets is a key driver in the tokenized treasuries market, which has now exceeded $4.4 billion, as tracked by RWA.xyz. Other competing funds from Franklin Templeton, Ondo Finance, and Superstate also play an important role in sector growth. Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) reported a 16% increase in total asset value in the last 30 days. Franklin’s FOBXXX was previously one of the largest tokenized funds, but with increased competition from major entities like BlackRock’s BUIDL, it now ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, with a market cap of approximately $689 million.

Open Builders, the company behind influential Telegram tap-to-earn game Notcoin, announced Wednesday that it is expanding beyond individual games with the rollout of Not Games, a platform with unified progression and rewards shared across multiple new games. Recently teased by Notcoin, the platform aims to unify what has previously been a fragmented gaming experience on Telegram by creating persistent player profiles, shared inventories, and an integrated economy across multiple games. Not Games will feature a single player profile that maintains achievements and rankings across all titles within the ecosystem. Not Games will be powered by the existing NOT token on The Open Network (TON), which Notcoin launched last year in a large-scale airdrop to millions of players. NOT surged to a peak market cap of nearly $3 billion last year, making it last year’s top gaming token launch by that metric. However, its price has fallen substantially since then, like many other gaming tokens. According to Open Builders, the top players will compete for NOT rewards every three weeks in skill-based challenges. VOID launched to the public last week following a closed beta period. Open Builders founder Sasha Plotvinov had previously teased plans for a Not Games-like platform last spring, ahead of the NOT token launch, saying that the studio hoped to cultivate a Netflix-like platform for discovering and playing a steady selection of new games. “We want it to become the Netflix of social, viral games,” he told Decrypt last April.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Arweave-based project AR.IO, which is the world’s first permanent cloud network, is today announcing the debut of its utility token - $ARIO - on gate.io, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform. Currently valued at $600 billion, the cloud market is set to hit $1 trillion in 2030 as AI drives demand for storage. A unique feature of the AR.IO ecosystem, ArNS domains exceed current domain name models as they can be used for hosting data, applications, identities or even websites - all on the permanent “pay once, store forever” model that means owners never need to renew a subscription, or else lose their data and/or site permanently. Commenting on $ARIO’s listing, Phil Mataras, Founder and CEO of AR.IO, says: “This centralized exchange launch follows the successful rollout of our mainnet in February, which was warmly welcomed by the community. We feel there has never been a more important time, where self-sovereignty is crucial, and a verifiable trust layer is pivotal with the growing influence of AI.” Utilizing Arweave’s permanent storage protocol, AR.IO turns the traditional centralized cloud storage model on its head by offering a permanent alternative that isn’t susceptible to data loss and manipulation. This is not least because it provides a solution to growing technological problems such as de-platforming, centralized control and access to information, and the need for tamper-proof provenance. AR.IO is the first permanent cloud network, providing decentralized, censorship-resistant access to data, storage, and domains. Its incentivized gateway network enhances reliability, while self-sovereign, permanent domains eliminate renewals and offer true digital ownership.

Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential short-term rally to $0.29 despite recent price drops Active addresses have reached over 150,000 daily, the highest since mid-November 2024 Long-term price predictions range from $1 (possibly by 2025-2027) to $10 (projected for 2035 and beyond) The digital asset is currently trading at around $0.16, down from its December 2024 peak of $0.4843. Despite this downturn, several technical indicators suggest a recovery may be imminent. Market analyst Igor Bondarenko predicts DOGE could reach $0.29 in the short term. This prediction is based on the cryptocurrency approaching its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has identified an Ascending Triangle pattern on DOGE’s 4-hour chart. The emergence of this pattern suggests a possible upward breakout. This type of candlestick is often associated with market reversals. The last time this pattern appeared, it preceded an upward movement. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that wallet addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE have increased by 62 since February. Such accumulation patterns often precede price movements, according to on-chain analysts. These optimistic forecasts cite various catalysts, including BlackRock’s filing of a DOGE ETF application. Institutional interest could drive mainstream adoption of the meme cryptocurrency. For higher targets like $5, analysts project a timeline between 2029 and 2035. The $10 mark is considered a “long shot” by most analysts. Such ambitious targets would require substantial upgrades to Dogecoin’s utility and adoption as a global payment system. The cryptocurrency would need to move beyond its meme status. This modest recovery offers a glimmer of hope to investors. Technical patterns and on-chain metrics suggest the potential for a short-term rally.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum is currently trading around $1,900 after falling from $2,000 to a low of $1,750 on March 11 Ethereum has experienced significant price pressure in recent weeks, dropping below the important $2,000 level to trade around $1,900. This decline has sparked mixed signals among analysts, with some pointing to technical patterns suggesting a potential recovery while others warn of further drops ahead. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached a low of $1,750 on March 11, marking its lowest point since November 2023. An increase in trading volume would provide confirmation that Ethereum is breaking out with momentum. This technical setup has created some optimism among traders despite the broader bearish market sentiment. While some technical analysts see hope on the charts, on-chain data tells an interesting story about investor behavior. According to data from Nansen, large Ethereum holders have been quietly accumulating coins despite the price decline. Whales holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have increased their holdings by more than 12% in early 2025. This accumulation by larger holders comes even as retail investors have been reducing their ETH balances. This divergence in behavior between whales and smaller holders offers an interesting contrast to the price action. Median gas prices have reportedly dropped nearly 50 times since early 2024, suggesting less demand for block space on the network. This migration raises questions about Ethereum’s competitive position in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Each rejection has led to further price declines, with the latest pushing ETH below its mid-range level. The ETH/BTC trading pair has also been underperforming, indicating weakness in Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin. In March, the net assets of spot Ether ETFs decreased by 9.8%, amounting to $2.54 billion. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs suffered a slight decrease of 2.35% to $35.74 billion during the same period. This difference suggests institutional fund managers may be losing interest in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. Despite maintaining a market cap of $231.96 billion, the ongoing downward trend suggests continued selling pressure. The next few weeks will be crucial for Ethereum as it tests key technical levels.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Introduced by Republican Senators Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash, and Timothy Moffitt—the bill envisions Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina’s economic standing. Under SB327, the Treasurer should ensure Bitcoin will be stored in multi-signature cold storage and subject to monthly audits for transparency and security. The bill enforces strict controls on the use of Bitcoin, limiting liquidation only to instances of a “severe financial crisis” and requiring approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly for any sale. It further mandates the creation of a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board, tasked with providing ongoing guidance on the reserve's management. SB327 authorizes the State Treasurer to engage in Bitcoin-backed investment strategies, including staking, lending, and other regulated yield-generating activities. Alongside SB327, the state’s lawmakers recently proposed House Bill 92 (HB 92), to allow the State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). HB92 proposes to allocate up to 10% of public funds and retirement systems into these ETPs, which must track digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $750 billion over the past twelve months, with the only asset fitting the criteria being Bitcoin. Arizona is currently one of the frontrunners in this movement, with three Bitcoin reserve bills under discussion. Meanwhile, in Texas, Senate Bill 21 (SB21) seeks to establish a state-managed investment fund dedicated to Bitcoin and other high-market-cap cryptos. Utah was initially poised to become the first U.S. state to establish a Bitcoin reserve, but its bill, HB230, underwent significant amendments.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

North Dakota Senate passed a bill regulating crypto ATMs, capping daily transactions at $2,000 Fraud through Bitcoin ATMs has increased nearly tenfold from 2020 to 2023, with consumers aged 60+ most vulnerable Similar legislation has been passed in Nebraska and proposed at the federal level North Dakota is close to establishing new regulations for cryptocurrency ATMs following the state Senate’s approval of House Bill 1447. It aims to protect residents from the growing problem of crypto ATM scams. The legislation would cap daily transactions at $2,000 per user across an operator’s network of ATMs. This limit is tighter than what the House had previously approved. House Bill 1447 was first introduced to the state’s legislative assembly on January 15. The bill’s primary sponsor, Representative Steve Swiontek, pointed out that crypto ATMs currently lack protection measures. This has “allowed criminals to exploit them for theft,” he said during a House committee hearing. The bill requires crypto ATM operators to obtain money transmitter licenses in North Dakota. This is a key requirement for anyone wanting to run these machines in the state. Quarterly reports on kiosk locations, names, and transaction data would be required. After that, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong will decide whether to veto or sign it into law. If signed, it will create a regulatory framework for the industry. The legislation comes amid growing concerns about crypto ATM scams nationwide. The Federal Trade Commission reported that fraud losses at Bitcoin ATMs increased nearly tenfold from 2020 to 2023. A report by TRM Labs found that crypto ATMs have helped facilitate at least $160 million in illicit transactions since 2019. Law enforcement agencies worldwide view these machines as a major money laundering and scam risk. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act into law on March 13. At the federal level, US Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois has proposed similar legislation. This suggests that increased regulatory scrutiny may be impacting the industry’s expansion.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Director Carl Erik Rinsch arrested for allegedly defrauding Netflix of $11 million Netflix had previously paid Rinsch $44 million for the show that was never completed Facing wire fraud and money laundering charges with potential 20-year prison sentences Federal authorities arrested filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch on March 18, 2025, charging him with fraud and money laundering after he allegedly misused $11 million in Netflix funds. Prosecutors claim that instead of using the funds to finish the show called “White Horse” (later renamed “Conquest”), Rinsch diverted $10.5 million to a personal brokerage account. He lost over $5.5 million on call options for a biopharmaceutical company within less than two months of receiving the funds from Netflix. While his stock trading flopped, Rinsch had better luck with cryptocurrency. According to the indictment, he made several million dollars trading crypto in February 2021. Rinsch had assured Netflix that “Conquest” was “moving forward really well” even while losing their money on risky trades. They referred to it only as “a subscription video on-demand streaming service.” Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky stated that “Rinsch’s arrest is a reminder that this Office and our partners at the FBI remain vigilant in the fight against fraud.” He also reportedly spent $395,000 on stays at the Four Seasons hotel and various luxury rental properties. Last year, an arbitrator awarded Netflix $8.8 million in damages after Rinsch initiated arbitration claiming the streaming giant had breached their contract. Rinsch’s lawyer, Annie Carney, declined to comment when approached outside the court. Netflix representatives also declined to comment on the indictment when contacted by reporters.

The Daily Active Addresses (DAA) metric more than tripled to 530,000 on March 2, up from 165,000 in December 2024. The recently launched Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has quickly reached a market cap of over $130 million, showing strong user adoption.

Additionally, XRP is trading below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average of $2.33, which now acts as resistance. The price has failed to reclaim this level, which some traders see as a bearish signal. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a concerning pattern in the UTXO Realized Price Distribution. He warns of an “air gap” between $2 and $1.60, meaning there hasn’t been much buying activity in this range. The ongoing SEC lawsuit continues to be a major factor for XRP. The uncertainty of this legal situation remains a significant influence on investor sentiment. Looking ahead, the DC Blockchain Summit could provide a catalyst for XRP price movement. With Ripple being a US-based company, any positive developments regarding crypto regulation could benefit XRP. Some analysts believe this could help propel the price toward $3 if market conditions remain favorable.

The meme coin sector’s market cap has dropped around 65% from its peak in December 2024. Pump.fun’s graduation rate, which measures tokens successfully moving from incubation to full tradability, has been below 1% since February 17.

Bank of America predicts the Fed will announce an end to Quantitative Tightening (QT) program Jerome Powell’s speech at 2:30 PM ET will address inflation outlook and potential policy changes Trump’s trade tariffs have created market uncertainty, affecting both crypto markets and broader economic outlook Bitcoin investors are closely watching today’s Federal Reserve meeting for potential relief as the cryptocurrency market seeks to recover from recent losses. The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision today at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 UTC). This will be followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM ET. Bank of America and other investment banks predict the Fed will announce a pause in QT during today’s meeting. This would be a key shift in monetary policy that could help risk assets like Bitcoin. This program has been working to reduce the $9 trillion balance sheet that expanded during COVID-19 stimulus measures. Lower yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note might increase investor appetite for higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. “If he mentions it in today’s statement or press conference, that would end up signaling that we’re in a new monetary regime,” noted Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. Trump’s recently implemented tariffs on Mexico and Canada have raised inflation risks while simultaneously threatening economic growth. Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, believes the Fed will delay policy easing. “The Fed would likely prefer to wait until they have policy clarity and a clear line of vision into the economic outlook, suggesting that policy easing will be delayed until late second quarter or even early third quarter,” she said. At the same time, forward-looking inflation metrics have been rising, likely adjusting to Trump’s trade policies. The FOMC members will also release updated projections for GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, and federal funds rate forecasts. Investors are particularly interested in the Fed’s “dot plot,” which shows committee members’ expectations for future interest rates. Chair Powell recently emphasized there is “no need to be in a hurry” as central bankers seek “greater clarity” on the direction of Trump administration policies. Current market pricing suggests traders don’t expect an initial rate reduction until at least June. The cryptocurrency market has seen major volatility in recent weeks, with nearly a trillion dollars wiped from valuations. Today’s Fed announcements could play a key role in determining whether Bitcoin and other digital assets can resume their upward trend.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Blockchain network eos announced its rebrand to “vaulta” on tuesday as it pivots towards “Web3 banking” in a Bid to Capitalize on Growing Demand for Innovative Financial Products. The swap will be bi-diectional for four months, allowing users to exchange their eos tokens for vaulta at a 1: 1 ratio through a dedicated portal. Vaulta's "Web3 Banking OS" will provide a suite of tools to enable fractional ownership of real-world assets, strike, custody, and bitcoin yield strategies, among other offerings, eos said. The platform will build on the existing eos technology, making some key upgrades to improve how it works with other blockchains. One of the main upgrades is a feature called Exsat, which will help further smart contracts on bitcoin, allowing vaulta to interact with other blockchain networks. The platform also plans to establish a banking advisory council to advise on the project's direction, including finch and web3 representatives from Systemic Trust, Tetra, and atb Financial. Launched in 2018 to Challenge Ethereum, EOS initially garnered significant attention for its high transaction throughput and Lower festival, Owing to its unique delegated proof-or-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism.

Crypto exchange Coinbase announced on Tuesday the launch of Verified Pools, a new service it claims reduces counterparty risk for decentralized finance (DeFi) participants. Verified Pools are liquidity pools—collections of funds that facilitate digital asset trades—only available to users who complete Coinbase’s identity verification process. The service is designed for institutional and retail traders, offering KYC-verified liquidity pools to maintain what Coinbase is positioning as the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets, according to a statement. Verified Pools is powered by Coinbase's Ethereum-centric Layer 2 network, Base, and utilizes the Uniswap v4 protocol. The exchange has also partnered with Gauntlet, a risk management firm, to shore up liquidity. The pools are non-custodial, meaning users maintain control over their assets.

Bitcoin’s market liquidity is tightening as the crypto continues to consolidate following a steep correction from its February peak above $102,000. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that capital inflows have slowed significantly, with liquidity conditions deteriorating across both spot and futures markets. Exchange inflows—a key measure of market activity—have dropped more than 54% from their cycle peak, reflecting lower investor participation, Glassnode wrote in a report on Tuesday. At the same time, open interest in Bitcoin futures has declined by 35%, falling from $57 billion at the market’s all-time high to $37 billion, signaling a reduction in leverage and speculative activity. Another factor analysts point to is the shifting sentiment on macroeconomic developments abroad, a pivot from knee-jerk responses earlier in the month to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. “In the absence of fresh tariff headlines, geopolitics has returned to the forefront,” Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a note on Tuesday. With the market shifting into a risk-off mode, institutional players are scaling back those positions, leading to ETF outflows and further downside pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. Meanwhile, Short-Term Holders are experiencing substantial unrealized losses, prompting some to capitulate. Bitcoin now faces a delicate equilibrium: with declining liquidity and fading speculative activity, volatility could remain elevated in the near term. Whether fresh capital returns to support higher prices remains a key question as traders assess macroeconomic conditions and the broader risk environment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

With lingering security concerns in managing digital assets, once again pulled into spotlight by crypto exchange Bybit's $1.5 billion exploit, "Organizations don’t have many options today," said Rabi. “They’re either using outdated institutional wallets that lack key features or simple wallets that aren’t enterprise-ready," Rabi added. Its platform leverages multiparty computation (MPC) technology, which splits a private key across multiple parties, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. It also features insurance coverage against security threats and asset losses, business continuity offering to mirror features that already have a service in place. The funding will help Utila expand globally and enhance its product offerings, including advanced gas management, API integrations, and smart contract support.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum is set to discontinue its largest test network, Holesky, after it encountered challenges testing the forthcoming Pectra upgrade. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The just-launched Hoodi test network, deployed on Monday, will serve as Holesky's replacement. The deprecation plan comes after Holesky fell offline due to February's faulty test of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra update. Developers took weeks to recover Holesky, which came back online in March but suffered from residual damage — so-called "inactivity leaks" that clogged up Holesky's entire validator apparatus. Test networks essentially replicate the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow developer teams and infrastructure providers to test out new software before launching them in a more high-stakes environment. It was built to model close-to-real network conditions with its support for a giant 1.4 million validators — more than Goerli, which Holesky replaced in 2023, and even the real Ethereum network. Currently, Holesky is used by validators and staking providers, but the similarly-constructed Hoodi network will serve that function moving forward. Hoodi went live earlier this week and plans to test the Pectra upgrade on March 26. Should that test proceed smoothly, developers intend to push Pectra onto Ethereum’s mainnet 30 days later.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hello, Hoodi: Ethereum welcomes a new test network: Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, will be used this week to implement the next "sicking" update of the blockchain. Pectra will be launched in Hoodi on March 26 and, if everything is going well, the expected update will be implemented in the Ethereum main network approximately 30 days later. Hoodi was created following defective tong tests in other Ethereum, Holesky and Sepolia test networks, which did not end correctly due to configuration problems. Test networks such as Holesky, Sepolia and Hoodi seek to imitate the main network of Ethereum, allowing developers to prove code changes or important updates such as sicking in a low risk environment before implementing them on the main network.

Untangled Finance and Moody’s Ratings have completed a Proof of Concept to move credit ratings on-chain by testing a system to allow for decentralized access to Moody's financial data.

The proof-of-concept, conducted on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, integrated Moody’s Ratings into Credio, Untangled Finance’s risk oracle. Using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, the system allowed credit ratings to be securely published, updated, and withdrawn on-chain while protecting proprietary information.

“Our oracle solution ensures real-time data visibility and immutability while preserving privacy,” said Manrui Tang, co-founder of Untangled Finance, in a release.

Bringing credit ratings on-chain could make risk assessment more transparent and efficient, allowing DeFi protocols and other blockchain-based applications to integrate real-time credit data without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

This follows Untangled Finance's 2024 move to launch a $6 million private credit pool on Celo, as CoinDesk previously reported, which allowed accredited investors to lend USDC under Luxembourg securitization rules.

A South Korean man who attacked the CEO of collapsed crypto firm, Haru Invest, is now facing a potential decade behind bars, according to local media reports.

Prosecutors in Seoul have requested a 10-year prison sentence for someone local media is only identifying by his last name Kang, a man in his 50s who stabbed Haru Invest CEO Lee Hyung-soo during a court hearing last year.

Haru Invest paused withdrawals in 2023, citing partner issues, without giving a specific reason, before its executives were arrested in 2024 for allegedly stealing $828 million in customer funds.

Kang’s defense argued that he had no intent to kill, noting that he did not target a fatal area and acted in a moment of extreme emotional distress after losing 100 BTC (worth $8.3 million) due to Haru Invest’s collapse.

His lawyers pushed for a reduced charge of aggravated assault rather than attempted murder, citing his severe financial and psychological hardship.

Ahead of the hearing, the local media reported that Haru Invest Victims’ Association held a press conference demanding Kang’s release, arguing that fraud victims like him were being treated unfairly while executives accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars walked free on bail.

Kang is due back in court on April 4 for sentencing.

The U.S. State of North Dakota is close to creating a licensing regime for crypto ATMs after its Senate passed a bill that provides a regulatory framework for the industry. Originally introduced on Jan. 15, House Bill 1447 aims to protect consumers from scams involving crypto ATMs by mandating operators to issue on-screen fraud warnings to users, obtain money transmitter licenses, use blockchain analytics software to detect and combat fraud, as well as submit quarterly reports on kiosk locations and transactions.

Additionally, operators must appoint a compliance officer. A report by TRM Labs found that crypto ATMs have facilitated at least $160 million in illicit transactions since 2019, CoinDesk previously reported, with law enforcement worldwide viewing them as a major money laundering and scam risk. FTC data also shows a nearly tenfold rise in bitcoin ATM scam losses since 2020. Osunkoya was recently sentenced to four years for his role in the illegal crypto ATM network, and was also convicted for forgery, using false identity documents, and possessing criminal property. With rising fraud and regulatory scrutiny, the number of crypto ATMs are not growing despite BTC's price growth in 2024. Market data from CoinATMRadar shows that the number of crypto ATMs in the U.S. has been roughly flat since 2022.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"However, if the AI ​​market experiences a recession or demand for high performance computing weakens, Core could face winds against similar ones, since its business is increasingly linked to the wider ecosystem," Zhao added. The agreement will allow Coreweave to diversify its income, moving away from Microsoft, which currently contributes approximately two thirds of the company's income. This diversification should benefit Core Scientific, since Coreweave is its main client. It is unlikely that this search for diversity harms the relationship between Coreweave and Core Scientific, wrote the investment firm HC Wainwright on March 11. Both signatures not only have a long collaboration career, but also usually reach agreements so that Core Scientific provides even more infrastructure to the IA hyperscalador.
