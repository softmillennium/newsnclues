                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The decentralized finance (DeFi) market is seeing a shakeup as Uniswap, one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs), experiences a 23% drop in trading volume.

This decline brings into focus the challenges facing traditional DEXs, such as fragmented liquidity and scalability issues. While Uniswap still commands a significant presence in the market, this shift signals a growing demand for more dynamic and efficient trading solutions.

Enter BinoFi, the first hybrid crypto exchange, which promises to redefine how digital assets are traded.

Addressing Uniswap’s Weaknesses

Uniswap, like other traditional DEXs, operates solely on a decentralized model, leading to challenges like isolated liquidity pools and vulnerability to market inefficiencies during periods of high volatility.

BinoFi’s hybrid approach addresses these limitations, offering both the speed and liquidity of centralized systems alongside the security and autonomy of decentralized platforms. This makes BinoFi a compelling alternative for traders seeking the best of both worlds.

BinoFi’s Hybrid CEX/DEX Model: A Game-Changer for Traders

BinoFi is set to lead the next wave of innovation in DeFi with its hybrid Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) model. Unlike traditional platforms that operate exclusively within a centralized or decentralized framework, BinoFi blends the strengths of both models to create a unique user experience.

Key Features of BinoFi’s Platform

Hybrid Liquidity Aggregation

One of the standout features of BinoFi is its ability to aggregate liquidity from both centralized and decentralized sources. This approach ensures deep liquidity, minimizing slippage and enabling faster, more efficient order execution. Traders no longer need to juggle between platforms for the best prices or liquidity pools; BinoFi brings it all into one seamless interface.

Cross-Chain Trading Without Bridges

BinoFi eliminates the need for typically cumbersome and insecure bridge protocols. Its cross-chain trading infrastructure allows users to execute transactions directly across multiple blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. This simplifies the trading process while significantly reducing risks associated with asset wrapping and bridge exploits.

AI-Driven Tools for Smarter Trading

BinoFi integrates artificial intelligence to enhance the trading experience. From predictive analytics to real-time market insights and automatic portfolio rebalancing, these AI tools empower traders to make informed decisions, regardless of their expertise.

$BINO Token’s Promising Outlook

The excitement surrounding BinoFi’s platform has been matched by impressive traction in its ongoing presale. Nearly 50% of the allocated tokens for the first phase have already been sold, amounting to around 20 million tokens. Currently, the presale price stands at just $0.02 per token, with the listing price set at $0.30, offering early participants a substantial potential upside.

This remarkable progress highlights the strong investor interest in BinoFi’s innovative hybrid exchange model and underscores the significant opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the growing momentum in the DeFi space.

Redefining the DeFi Landscape

BinoFi isn’t just aiming to compete with existing exchanges; it’s setting the stage to lead the DeFi evolution. By solving critical pain points, such as fragmented liquidity and cross-chain inefficiencies, and embedding advanced features, BinoFi is attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors.

While Uniswap’s volume drop underscores the current challenges in DeFi, BinoFi’s innovative model offers a clear path forward. Its hybrid CEX/DEX architecture, combined with cross-chain capabilities and AI tools, positions it as a frontrunner in a future where efficiency, security, and liquidity reign supreme.

For those watching the DeFi space closely, BinoFi represents more than just a new platform; it’s a shift in how we think about trading and asset management in decentralized finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Wickens' return to top level of racing will be in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.

He's slated to team with two-time GTLM champion Tommy Milner and race for DXDT Racing in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach April 11-12.

Wickens will team with veteran racer Milner to pilot a specially equipped Chevrolet Corvette Z06 GT3.R with a state-of-the-art hand-control braking system.

Ever since Robert Wickens was critically injured in an August 2018 IndyCar crash at Pocono Raceway that left him paralyzed, he's been on the comeback trail.

And while Wickens had already made it back to racing—he's raced a TCR car and tested a Formula E car, to name just two elements, among others, of his return—the leap he's about to make to the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship is definitely next-level. This week, Wickens is testing a specially equipped Chevrolet Corvette Z06 GT3.R with a state-of-the-art hand-control braking system at Sebring International Raceway.

It's all part of Wickens' return to top-level racing. He's slated to team with two-time GTLM champion Tommy Milner and race for DXDT Racing at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach April 11-12. Wickens plans to race in the IMSA sprint races this season with designs on a full-season run at the series championship in 2026.

"I think this is a big step for me to officially get that fulfillment—I want to be a full-time contender in the WeatherTech series," Wickens said in a media call on Wednesday. "But honestly, taking the green flag in Long Beach is going to be an enormous step forward in my career and my journey back to the highest levels.

"Basically, you could say we did it. We're racing against the best cars, the best drivers in the whole sports-car industry. I want to win championships for myself, for General Motors, for DXDT. There's still some work to be done, but I think you can say it's definitely a massive box checked—probably the biggest box that we could check off so far in my return."

The 36-year-old Wickens will be making his first start in the GTD class and first start in the IMSA WeatherTech series since the 2017 Rolex 24 at Daytona where he raced with Ben Keating, Chris Cumming, John Falb, and Remo Ruscitti in a Starworks Motorsport entry.

Making this return to the big stage possible are the efforts of Bosch, General Motors, Pratt & Miller, and DXDT Racing. The team's Corvette Z06 GT3.R has been equipped with special hand controls that allow Wickens to control the electronic braking and throttle with hand controls that top anything the driver has experienced since his accident.

"I think the biggest takeaway I have so far is that it feels like the Bosch EBS and the hand-control system that was developed by Pratt & Miller, it's like it belonged in this car," Wickens said midway through his second day of testing. "There hasn't been a single hiccup. It feels like when they designed this, this Z06 GT3, it's like it belongs in the car.

"Immediately, I felt way more comfortable with the braking feeling and braking sensation than I even had in my past racing in TCR with the Bosch EBS. It was a massive step forward. So, hats off to all the men and women at Bosch and also Pratt & Miller and DXDT for collaborating to make this all possible."

To get ready for the Sebring test and return to the racetrack, Wickens spent countless hours in the simulator.

"Racing on my home simulator, not only is it very fun, but it made my dexterity and kind of my resolution on my hand for throttle application, in particular, just stronger and stronger," he said. "And I think after driving this Corvette Z06, I feel like the next step for me is actually to start doing more throttle application with my right hand, just to build that muscle memory.

Courtesy DXDT Racing

"For people that don't know, I pretty much do like 98% of the throttle application with my left hand. So that way I can freely upshift with my right hand, and then brake with my right hand, downshift with the left hand type of thing. With this car, like turn 7 (at Sebring), there's a few corners here where I feel like I need to start practicing using throttle with both hands a little bit more.

"But the home simulator, it definitely didn't hurt. The brake that I use on my home simulator is very different to what we have in the race car, but for throttle purposes, I think it's very helpful."

One of the first questions for any sports-car tandem in the WeatherTech series when one driver faces some of the challenges that Wickens does—and with the added technology in the race car—is how will this affect the crucial in-race driver changes.

Milner says it won't be an issue on race day.

"In Robbie's case, he has to do all of his driving with with his hands," Milner said. "Him being paralyzed from the chest down, he has no use of his feet, really. The systems are basically set up so that he can do all that with the steering wheel itself. And there's a brake ring, there's a throttle, throttle paddles, and those obviously take the place of what I would normally use in the pedal box.

"The system is quite impressive with how it functions and how it works. With just one push of a button, the system switches from the able-bodied driver controls to the hand controls, which obviously is important for sports-car racing where we have driver changes.

"It'll be especially important at Long Beach, (with) the driver change being a pretty important part of the race, because that typically ends up being kind of the limiting factor in the pit stop. The tires and the fuel typically take a little bit less energy, take a little bit less time.

"Robbie obviously comes from a place where he has the sports-car racing experience, where he's had to do those driver changes. So from that side, there's no real limitations, so to speak. He knows what he needs to get out of the car."

Milner added that it's hard not to be inspired by Wickens' return. Milner even called it "an honor" to be a part of it.

"His drive and determination is pretty incredible," Milner said. "It's pretty inspiring to see that, and I'm excited to go racing with him at Long Beach."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ford Motor Company is re-recalling more than 50,000 vehicles for camera, battery and window issues that were incorrectly repaired as part of prior recalls, according to multiple National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) notices.

Four separate recall notices reported to the NHTSA on March 13 include 64,531 cars across seven models and four model years, including Explorer, Edge, Lincoln, Bronco Maverick, F-250 and F-350 vehicles.

In two cases, failure of the vehicles' rearview cameras may cause blank or distorted images to appear, limiting the ability of drivers to utilize the backup feature and increasing crash risk.

In another, a failing module may neglect to inform drivers of a low battery, increasing the risk of a sudden loss of power. In the fourth and smallest recall, which concerns only nine cars, the front driver and passenger windows may fail to automatically retract when they encounter an obstacle (such as a finger or hand), increasing the risk of injury.

Here's what to know about the four latest Ford recalls.

What Ford cars are being recalled?

The recalled vehicles were previously repaired under four separate past recalls – NHTSA recall numbers 22V-151, 23V-342, 24V-267 and 23V-507.

This round of recalls includes the following Ford vehicles:

Advertisement Advertisement

2021-2022 Edge vehicles previously repaired under NHTSA recall number 22V-151 (Ford number 22S14) are being recalled due to rearview camera displays that may show a blank or distorted image. This recall includes 2,290 cars.

2020-2023 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-342 (Ford number 23S23) are being recalled due to loss of rearview camera input. This recall includes 49,399 cars.

2020-2022 Lincoln Corsair vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-342 (Ford number 23S23) are being recalled due to loss of rearview camera input. This recall is part of the 49,399 cars listed above.

2021-2024 Bronco Sport vehicles previously repaired under recall number 24V-267 (Ford number 24S24) are being recalled due to failure in a module that detects low battery and may result in the unexpected loss of driving power due to undetected loss of battery charge. This recall includes 12,833 cars.

2022-2023 Maverick vehicles previously repaired under recall number 24V-267 (Ford number 24S24) are being recalled due to failure in a module that detects low battery and may result in the unexpected loss of driving power due to undetected loss of battery charge. This recall is part of the 12,833 cars listed above.

2023 Super Duty F-250 and F-350 vehicles previously repaired under recall number 23V-507 are being recalled due to windows that may not automatically reverse when they encounter an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury. This recall includes only nine cars.

Ford is recalling over 50,000 vehicles, including Explorers, Lincolns, Edges and more.

What and when were the past recalls and repairs done to affected cars?

NHTSA recall number 22V-151 (Ford recall number 22S14) was issued in March 2022 and covered 78,376, 2021-2022 Edge vehicles. A rearview camera malfunction caused blank or distorted displays, which was fixed via a free software update at dealerships.

NHTSA recall 23V-342 (Ford number 23S23) was already an expansion of yet another existing recall and fix. It was issued in May 2023 and covered 442,973, 2020-2023 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles and 2020-2022 Lincoln Corsair vehicles equipped with a 360-degree camera. The rearview cameras were failing entirely and the remedy was free replacement of the camera at dealerships. This was a furthering of NHTSA recall number 23V-022 (Ford 23S02), which was issued in January 2023 for the same issue. The May 2023 recall advised that those who took the prior remedy of a software update in January would still need to have the total replacement done.

NHTSA recall number 24V-267 (Ford number 24S24) was issued in April 2024 and covered 456,565, 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2022-2023 Maverick vehicles. This time, a failing battery monitoring module meant that a low battery charge could go undetected and result in a sudden loss of driving power. Dealers recalibrated the body control module and power train control module for free.

NHTSA recall 23V-507 (Ford 23S37) was issued in July 2023 and covered 1,339, 2023 Super Duty F250, F350, F450 and F550 vehicles. The front passenger and driver windows failed to automatically roll back down when they met an obstruction, leading to increased injury risk. This was fixed via a free software update at dealerships.

In the two cases of camera issues, the new recalls describe "incorrect repairs" done to fix the malfunctions, allowing them to continue. In the cases of the battery and window sensor issues, previous remedies were again described as "incorrect," meaning the issues persisted even for owners who had had the previous remedies performed.

USA TODAY reached out to Ford for comment on the recurring nature of these recalls.

What to do if you have a recalled car

If you have any of the vehicles mentioned in any of the above recalls, owners can take their vehicles to a Ford dealership for a free software update or module recalibration.

Owner notifications for all four recalls are expected to be mailed on April 24. Owners can also contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332 about Ford recall numbers 25S25, 25S26, 25S27 and 25S28.

Check to see if your car is recalled

Car owners looking to check the status of their vehicles, car parts, or car accessories can enter their information into the NHTSA recall database or check USA TODAY's recall database for car and motor vehicle recalls.

Major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are up—along with U.S. equities—after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady and the central bank's chair gave a calming press conference.

The biggest cryptocurrency had jumped before the Fed's announcement, but is now up even more: Bitcoin's price now stands at $85,648, a more than 4% rise over the past day. The price rose as high as $85,890, marking the highest level since March 9.

The price of Ethereum is up even more: the second biggest virtual coin is up more than 7% over the same period, with a current price of $2,038.

And Solana is currently trading hands for nearly $134, climbing by 8% over a 24-hour period; the coin, which is the sixthbiggest digital asset, jumped by 2% in the hour after Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke.

The wider crypto market is now up by more than 3% over the past day, and its total market cap stands at $2.91 trillion.

U.S. stocks surged following Powell's press conference but have cooled off slightly since, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up by more than 1% on the day.

Equities and crypto had taken a battering earlier this month after President Trump's unpredictable tariff announcements left Wall Street second-guessing what the White House would do next. Investors adopted a "risk-off" strategy, leading to a stock market and crypto price correction.

But Powell shrugged off concerns in a press conference Wednesday, claiming that Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" effect on inflation.

As expected, the U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50% on Wednesday. The Fed cut borrowing costs in September for the first time in four years, ahead of sizable gains for both crypto and stocks—with the surge only accelerating once President Trump won November's election.

Performance icon Ken Lingenfelter joins National Corvette Museum’s board, bringing passion, expertise, and vision to Corvette preservation and innovation.

The National Corvette Museum (NCM) announced the appointment of Ken Lingenfelter, a respected leader in automotive performance, to its Board of Directors as an At-Large Member.

Known throughout the automotive community for his contributions to high-performance aftermarket modifications, Lingenfelter is the owner of Lingenfelter Performance Engineering. He acquired the company from his cousin, legendary racer John Lingenfelter, in 2008 and has since propelled it to prominence by developing performance upgrades for GM vehicles, particularly Corvettes.

Lingenfelter’s passion for Chevrolet and Corvette culture has deep roots. His father served as a manager at General Motors' Fisher Body Assembly plant in Ohio, instilling an appreciation for American automotive engineering from an early age. Today, Ken Lingenfelter’s private car collection is one of the largest and most impressive in the U.S., regularly attracting attention from enthusiasts nationwide.

An ardent supporter of the National Corvette Museum’s mission to preserve and celebrate Corvette history, Lingenfelter has previously lent several vehicles from his extensive collection to the museum, including the rare and historically significant 1954 Corvette EX-87 Duntov Mule.

In his new role on the board, Lingenfelter is expected to significantly influence the museum’s future projects, exhibitions, and strategic direction, ensuring its continued appeal as a premier destination for Corvette enthusiasts worldwide. Located near the Corvette’s exclusive production facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the museum serves as a vital cultural center for Corvette fans and automotive historians alike.

Recently, Lingenfelter Performance Engineering unveiled a new 427-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) stroker engine upgrade for the C8 Corvette, enhancing its output from the standard 490 horsepower to an impressive 700 horsepower. Compatible with the C8 Stingray and hybrid E-Ray, the package exemplifies Ken Lingenfelter’s ongoing commitment to Corvette performance innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alfa Romeo boss Santo Ficili said in a LinkedIn post that the next-generation Stelvio and Giulia will be available with hybrid power.

Ficili also confirmed that the next Stelvio and Giulia will ride on the corporate Stellantis Large platform.

The upcoming Stelvio is scheduled to debut before the end of 2025.

Taking to LinkedIn, Alfa Romeo’s CEO has confirmed that the upcoming Stelvio and Giulia models will both see hybrid powertrains under the hood. The post comes after Alfa CEO Santo Ficili spoke to the press during a media program for the Junior Ibrida Q4.

The LinkedIn post outlines that the next-generation Stelvio and its Giulia counterpart are scheduled to use the STLA Large platform and confirms that hybrid powertrains are headed to both models.

Now, this goes against the company’s previous all-electric push, which was planned to start in 2027. But this isn’t exactly a new position from Stellantis and has been echoed across other brands.

Both Dodge and Jeep have tried to walk the line of battery-electric powertrain adoption, while also taking advantage of the parent company’s multi-energy platforms.

As for which hybrid powertrain will power the Stelvio or Giulia’s wheels, that’s a question still being answered in Turin.

It would make sense to rely on a variant of the Hurricane engine family if a six-cylinder is an option, or could lean on the four-cylinder GME, or Global Medium Engine. We doubt that the 1.3-liter MultiAir from the Tonale will make an appearance, but anything could be on the menu.

We also know that the next-gen Giulia might not have the same shape as the current model. However, Ficili made it clear that all of the Stelvio’s questions will be answered when it shows its face later this year. The Giulia should follow shortly after, and both are slated to be built in Italy.

Leasing a vehicle can be an economical way to drive a new car without the long-term commitment of ownership. There are more attractive lease choices out there than ever before and manufacturers are offering leases on high trims, as well. As of March 2025, several manufacturers are offering attractive lease deals that combine affordability with desirable features. Below are four of the most cost-effective automotive lease deals available this month.

2025 Kia K4Kia

1. 2025 Kia K4

2025 Kia K4Kia

Don’t say sedans are dead because the Kia K4 is one seriously compelling compact sedan with gobs of style and tech. It borrows edgy styling from its K9 EV SUV sibling, and the airy interior upends what an economy sedan should feel like inside. The K4’s base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 147 horsepower mated to a CVT. Standard equipment on the LXS trim includes features such as heated side mirrors, twin 12.3-inch screens for instrumentation and infotainment, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, a smart trunk, and a slew of high-end safety tech.

The purchase price of a Kia K4 LXS is just $22,990, but the lease offering makes it even more approachable. This month, Kia is offering a lease deal of $209 a month for 24 months, with $3,499 due at signing. This lease deal only applies to the 2025 Kia K4 LXS front-wheel drive. Learn more here.

2. 2025 Nissan Sentra

If you’re searching for a no-nonsense but still attractive compact sedan, now is the time to lease a 2025 Nissan Sentra. This compact sedan offers a balance of style, comfort, and efficiency. Powered by a 149-hp four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, the Sentra won’t set your hair on fire, but it will give you 34 mpg in combined driving. The Sentra SV comes standard with 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an 8-inch color touchscreen infotainment system, a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and adaptive cruise control.

This month’s lease deal applies to the second-tier Sentra SV, which sports more style than the base S trim. Nissan will have you pay a mere $229 per month for 39 months, with $2,499 due at signing. Learn more here.

3. 2025 Hyundai Venue

2025 Hyundai VenueHyundai

The diminutive 2025 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV that combines practicality with a touch of style and is known for its compact dimensions and urban-friendly design. Every Venue trim level gets a user-friendly 8.0-inch color touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The Venue also gets praise for roominess that belies its small exterior size, and the large physical controls make it easy to operate. The 121-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn’t powerful, but it offers 33 mpg highway for good fuel economy.

The purchase price of $20,200 is definitely approachable for most folks, but an excellent lease offering of $239 a month for 36 months with $3,499 due at lease signing can surely draw in customers looking for a low payment and a short commitment. Learn more here.

4. 2025 Chevrolet Trax

2025 Chevrolet TraxChevrolet

We never expected to love the new Trax as much as we did. Not only does it look pricier than its $20,500 base MSRP, but it also has precise and communicative steering that befits a sports car. Every Trax is powered by a 137-horsepower 3-cylinder engine, but its low power is partially offset by its wonderful driving experience. The midpack Trax LT comes with standard features like 17-inch machined aluminum wheels, an 11-inch diagonal color touch-screen, an 8-inch diagonal color instrument cluster, wireless smartphone integration, remote vehicle start, and automatic climate controls.

The current lease deal applies to the Trax LT. The purchase price is $23,995, but a lease of $299 per month for 24 months with $1,879 due at signing improves its affordability even more. It’s not the lowest monthly lease payment for a compact SUV, but the low signing price is in its favor. You get a stylish, fun, and practical SUV for a great monthly price. Learn more here.

Final thoughts

Leasing presents an attractive option for car shoppers who want affordable payments, low commitment, and a warranty throughout the life of ownership. As always, read the lease’s fine print and be aware of the down payment, the length of the lease term, mileage limits, and your options and potential penalties at the end of the lease. By carefully evaluating these deals and considering your personal driving habits and financial goals, you can secure a lease that offers both value and satisfaction. You might even get the car you really want versus a car that you feel compelled to lease.</p>

Clean As A Whistle: Joe Rogan’s Heavily Modified ‘69 Nova

When you’re the number one podcaster in the world, or in other words Joe Rogan, and you really like cars, you can afford to pour ridiculous resources into a build like this super clean ’69 Nova. The thing looks fantastic, but the more you compare it to a picture of a factory 1969 Chevy Nova, the more you realize all the subtle upgrades that are done so well, you don’t process them at first.

Check out Kyle Busch’s modified 1969 Camaro.

Built by Pure Vision Design, it took the shop multiple years to get it buttoned up correctly. That’s a testament to their dedication in doing an excellent job instead of having a “good enough” attitude about their cars.

Steve Strope, who owns Pure Vision Design, walks Shawn Davis from Autotopia LA through the build, starting with the body modifications. For example, the body line that sits about midway on the sides was removed and parts of a donor ’69 Camaro and ’69 Firebird were added to the fenders and the door.

Instead of going for a period-correct engine, Pure Vision and Rogan opted for a supercharged LT4, the same engine used in the sixth-gen Camaro ZL1. Instead of getting crazy, they kept the engine entirely stock. Considering it makes about 650-horsepower, that’s more than enough to get the Nova moving in a hurry. Plus, it’s more reliable than pushing the envelope with that cost.

Underneath, there’s an independent suspension for the front and rear, all upgraded for superior handling. Art Morrison subframes are also hidden away. The exhaust, brake lines, and fuel line are all tucked away nicely, plus the old Chevy has an eight-inch ground clearance, helping to guard against damage.

Surprisingly, this thing has manual steering, which we guess for Rogan works since he can handle the work. Other interesting details include the dash, which looks like a ’67 Camaro’s because it was designed by the same guy who designed that, the ignition is on the left side as a tribute to Porsches (which Rogan loves), plus there’s a hidden infotainment screen at the top of the center stack.

Check out the video to see even more details, because this build is incredible. Joe Rogan is a lucky man.

If you're shopping for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) crossover or small SUV under the $50,000 mark, you really don't have a ton of options to sort through. One of them is the 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which also has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive Escape you can buy. With a price tag that's nearly $2,000 more than the better-equipped gas-powered Escape ST-Line Elite, "value" might not be the first word that springs to mind if you're shopping for a 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid.

The 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid is available in a single, well-equipped trim level

A quick glance at the spec sheet may surprise you. Despite being slightly less well-equipped than the ST-Line Elite, the 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid still comes absolutely stacked with features. Highlights include adaptive cruise control, a larger 13.2-inch touchscreen that replaces the dinky 8.0-inch one that comes standard, and a heated/power-adjustable driver seat. It looks the part, too, sporting painted 18-inch wheels and fog lights, neither of which you'll find on the base car. And, if you want to load up your Escape with even more goodies—like a Bang & Olufsen stereo or power sunroof—there's nearly $8,000 in optional packages waiting for you.

Of course, many shoppers will likely care most about the SUV's powertrain. The 2025 Escape Plug-in Hybrid relies on a 2.5-liter inline-four combustion engine paired with an electronic motor integrated into the vehicle's electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT) that puts out 210 hp. A 14.4-kWh lithium-ion battery allows for up to 37 miles of all-electric driving range.

How does the Escape PHEV compare to its rivals?

2023 Ford Escape Plug-In HybridFord

The Hyundai Tucson PHEV is perhaps the Escape's closest rival. It offers 33 miles of range but makes a more impressive 261 horsepower. You'll pay slightly more, thanks to a base MSRP that's $1,300 higher, but you get a little bit extra, too. Small things like wireless device charging and digital key functionality make a big difference. The dual-screen layout is lazy but comes off sleeker than the Escape's somewhat haphazardly integrated screen. The only area in which the Escape outdoes the Tucson is in cargo space. The Escape PHEV touts 34.4 cubic feet, while the Tucson offers 31.9 cubic feet.

You can't talk about hybrid SUVs in this price range without mentioning the Toyota RAV4 PHEV (formerly RAV4 Prime). Toyota charges significantly more for its PHEV, starting at $44,265. However, you'll enjoy up to 42 miles of range and a quick 5.7-second zero-to-60 sprint thanks to a hybrid powertrain developing 302 horsepower. It's also all-wheel drive, whereas the Escape PHEV is only available in front-wheel drive. There are places the former Prime falls flat, though, like its smaller 8.0-inch touchscreen and 33.5 cubic feet of cargo space.

Final thoughts

Thanks to a respectable range, good standard equipment, inoffensive styling, and a comparatively low base price, the 2025 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid carves out a specific niche for itself. In that niche, it's a good value and worth $38,400. If you don't need all-wheel drive or value the RAV4's quickness, and don't care about the Tucson's slightly more graceful screen integration, save yourself some money and pick up an Escape PHEV instead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon, the seller of everything, apparently wants to try its hand at selling used cars next. Fan Jin, the director of the online retail giant's Amazon Autos unit, says the company will be "getting into used cars soon." It recently started selling Hyundais on its Amazon Autos platform.

Jin made the announcement on Automotive News' Daily Drive podcast earlier this week. She says people in 68 markets can now buy a new Hyundai on Amazon. The company is working to get as many dealers as possible signed up with them and able to sell both their new and used inventories. The retainer has also expressed interest in working with other car manufacturers to get their new vehicles on its platform.

Amazon's goal here isn't to be like an AutoTrader or Cars.com type of used car market. In Jin's mind, it is more of a Carvana-style system where everything can be done on the website. Here's more from AutoNews:

"We see ourselves as providing this channel for dealers for a fully e-commerce transaction," she said. Delivering an online marketplace for used cars could position dealers to compete with the likes of Carvana, which sells used vehicles directly to consumers via a fully digital environment. Since Amazon Autos is relying on dealers for their inventory, the platform can be leveraged as an omnichannel for those who want to shop online and visit a dealership during their transaction.

What's Next For Amazon Autos

Jin does admit that even the most tech-forward of buyers probably would want to visit a dealership first to physically check out what they're planning to purchase before actually doing so.

"They may start online, then go to the dealer to look and have a test drive, then come back, think about it, and then finish the purchase online," she said.

The cars themselves aren't Amazon Auto's only interest, though. The company is reportedly mulling over the idea of selling optional add-ons like extended warranties, vehicle service contracts and maintenance packages, according to Automotive News.

We're rapidly entering a brave new world for car buying, and it would seem Amazon is the leader. I've had moral qualms with Amazon in the past, but I suppose there's really nothing wrong with giving customers another choice for how to buy their next vehicle. Nobody really likes going to the dealer, so maybe an all-online experience like this one could be a welcome addition to the market.

Europol has warned that blockchain and AI will “accelerate serious and organised crime” in the coming years, with a new report from the EU law enforcement agency even predicting that fully autonomous AI “could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks.”

In its 2025 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, Europol suggested that the combination of AI and crypto will serve to expand online fraud schemes, which already represent “the most rapidly expanding sector” in organised crime.

🚨New Report! #SOCTA25: The changing DNA of serious and organised crime. ⚠️This is one of the most thorough analyses on the threats of serious and organised crime, designed to assist decision-makers in the prioritisation of threats in Europe. Read: https://t.co/Riuuswlfvi — Europol (@Europol) March 18, 2025

“Narratives are extremely realistic, crafted with the help of AI, and incorporating trending societal topics,” the report’s authors wrote. “Cryptocurrency features prominently as a payment method.”

Crypto and crime

While not data-focused, the assessment offers a broad and far-reaching summary of the expanding role cryptocurrencies are now playing in serious crime in Europe.

The report concluded that cryptocurrency has “moved beyond the scope of cybercrime” and is found increasingly in more “traditional” areas such as “drug trafficking or migrant smuggling.”

Other varieties of crime which crypto facilitates include cyberattacks, online fraud, sanctions evasion, and also the trafficking of human beings.

Written by senior researchers in the fields of crime and security, the starkest warning comes with respect to how the emergence of AI may effectively help automate such criminal activity on an industrial scale.

The report’s authors state that AI’s automation capabilities are already making criminal operations more efficient and expansive.

“From automating phishing campaigns to executing large-scale cyber-attacks, AI enables criminals to achieve more – reach more victims, be more targeted in their approach, and expand their global reach – with fewer resources,” the report read.

Among the cybercriminal uses of AI, the assessment lists “attack automation, social engineering, and bypassing security measures,” which again are making cyberattacks more scalable.

Europol’s evaluation of finds support in private research, with blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs releasing a report in January of this year which revealed that bad actors “are increasingly leveraging AI to carry out hacks and conduct fraud.”

How criminals are using AI

Isabella Chase, the Head of Policy for EMEA at TRM Labs, told Decrypt that there are three primary ways in which criminals are already using AI.

The first relates to the automation of attacks, with AI-based tools enabling “the automation of phishing campaigns, creating highly convincing messages at scale,” according to Chase.

Related to this is how criminals are using AI to create deepfakes and other synthetic media.

“Criminals use AI to build convincing deepfakes or to embellish existing stolen identities to dupe victims,” she said. “This is increasingly important for business compromise, which is the most profitable form of online fraud.”

Less visibly, AI is also being used to support cybercrime and other exploits by providing criminals with additional information, providing data and details they may have otherwise missed.

As Chase explains, “AI algorithms optimize ransomware operations by identifying the most critical data or systems to encrypt for maximum leverage [...] AI also allows malware to adapt dynamically to evade real-time detection.”

The use of AI is likely already adding millions on to the cost of organised crime, but TRM Labs estimates that more criminals will adopt AI “in the coming years” as they experiment with different ways of harnessing it for their particular ends.

“Criminals will use AI for targeting and engaging with victims whether these be individuals or entities,” Chase told Decrypt, adding that the technology will also be used for “more programmatic laundering of criminal funds which could make it easier to profit from crime.”

While this may paint a bleak picture, Chase ultimately suggested that there will be a parallel growth in law enforcement and the private sector using AI and more advanced analytic tools, thereby improving “their ability to identify criminals and their activities.”</p>

Volatility Shares, a Florida-based issuer of exchange-traded funds, will debut two ETFs on Thursday that track Solana’s price using futures contracts in the U.S., the firm’s co-founder and CEO Justin Young confirmed to Decrypt.

The Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) will track Solana futures, which recently launched in the U.S. through Coinbase’s derivatives arm, while the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF (SOLT) will allow investors to access amplified returns. Both funds will be listed on the Nasdaq, as first reported by Bloomberg.



“We launched the first leverage Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., so this fits really well into our wheelhouse,” he told Decrypt. “It’s really us being first to market again.”

As the SEC mulls applications from several asset managers that seek to establish a spot Solana ETF in the U.S., Volatility Shares’ debut represents a tacit acknowledgement from the SEC that the top altcoin is a commodity.

Volatility Shares first filed for a futures-based Solana ETF in December, and registration statements posted to the firm’s website say they are “subject to completion.”

At the time, Volatility Shares filed for a “-1x Solana ETF.” However, the company has put that offering “on hold for now” despite a green light from the SEC, Young said.

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) listed SOLZ and SOLT last month before futures regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission began trading.

Solana futures began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Monday, generating $12.3 million in notional trading volume. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures debuted on the exchange in 2017 and 2022, respectively.

Solana’s price jumped 5% to $130 in Wednesday trading, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. Over the past month, the asset has dropped 27% as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have unsettled crypto traders on edge.

Danger On The Road: Camaros Recalled For Wheels Locking Up

Yet another safety recall for an American muscle car has been issued recently, this time for Chevy Camaros. Apparently, a problem can cause the wheels to momentarily lock up while the vehicle is rolling down the road, leading to the driver losing control and crashing. If that were to happen at highway speeds, the result might not be pretty.

Ford Mustang sales are dropping recently.

As part of Safety Recall N242480630, 2020 to 2022 Chevy Camaros along with 2019 to 2020 Cadillac CT6s, 2020 to 2021 CT4s, and 2020 to 2021 CT5s are to be repaired free of charge by dealer service departments. This only applies to cars outfitted with the 10-speed automatic transmission.

Apparently, the issue is a transmission control valve can wear excessively over time, resulting a pressure loss, which then lads to hard shifting. That in turn can cause the wheels on the vehicle to suddenly lock up, although the risk is rare.

Considering what might happen if your wheels were to lock up while you’re driving, especially at higher speeds, we still wouldn’t put off getting your Camaro or Cadillac fixed.

The remedy for this problem is the installation of a new transmission control module software. Sadly, this can’t be done through an over-the-air update, so you have to visit a dealer and either drop off your ride or sit around in the waiting room for the software to be installed.

With the new software, GM says it will detect excessive valve wear in the transmission about 10,000 miles before the whole wheel lock up thing could happen, which is great. If there is a problem, the software won’t let the transmission shift past fifth gear since the risk is when it downshifts from eighth gear.

The new software will also trigger the service engine light, plus push a reduced propulsion message on the touchscreen.

We know recalls happen all the time these days, but this problem could cause a serious crash. Also, this is yet another reason why we love manual transmissions and wish automakers would do over-the-air software updates for recalls like this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican tariffs may soon wreak havoc on new car sales, but at least for now, we haven't seen any massive changes. Supply is generally back to where it needs to be, and you should be able to find most cars at or below MSRP. That isn't necessarily the case with every new car, though. Some of the most in-demand models still command a premium, and if you can find a comparable alternative, it could easily save you thousands of dollars.

So which new cars are currently the worst deals? Our friends at Consumer Reports recently crunched the numbers on actual transaction data from TrueCar and found 10 of the worst offenders. Unfortunately for Toyota fans, more than half of the vehicles on this list are Toyotas. You may still decide to pull the trigger on one anyway, but at least you'll know what you're getting yourself into before you drive onto the lot. Here's what they found, ranked by the percentage over MSRP that customers are actually paying.

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, prolonging a months-long pause on rate cuts amid economic uncertainty fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which rose on Wednesday morning, was roughly flat immediately after the central bank stood pat for a third consecutive time but was still up 4% over the past 24 hours to trade at about $84,500, according to data provider CoinGecko.

The U.S. central bank’s decision was widely expected, leaving its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50% after the Fed began slashing borrowing costs in the final quarter of last year.

In a statement, the Fed emphasized a wait-and-see approach on how Trump’s policy maneuvers—which have battered stocks and crypto—could draw out its inflation fight.

“Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.,” the Fed said. “The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.”

In remarks following the announcement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank’s latest inflation forecast was “a little higher than projected with December."

“It is going to be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs,” he said, adding that price pressures from Trump's trade policy may prove transitory. At the same time, Powell said "recent indications point to a moderation in consumer spending," signaling that one of the U.S. economy's main drivers of economic growth may cool. An updated forecast weighing expectations from 19 Fed officials showed two rate cuts this year, effectively matching policymakers’ outlook in December. The Fed’s previous projections had poured cold water on risk assets, as Fed officials had previously penciled in four rate cuts. In December, however, one Fed official foresaw as many as five rate cuts this year, or a reduction of 1.5% in the Fed’s benchmark rate. On Wednesday, no fed official envisioned more than three rate cuts this year, suggesting a firmer policy outlook. The president’s approach to tariffs has sparked inflation concerns, but some fear that it may also hamstring U.S. economic growth as consumers and businesses face elevated costs. The prices of Ethereum and Solana dipped in the hour but are up 7.7% to $2000, and 5% to $129.50, respectively, according to the crypto data provider Coingecko. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in cooler than expected a week ago, indicating that inflation eased slightly last month. The widely watched inflation gauge, which rose 2.8% in the twelve months through February, was above the Fed’s 2% goal. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, is expected to show a 2.7% annual increase later this month, per Trading Economics. Yet Powell struck an ominous tone about price trends: "People are unhappy, and they are not wrong that prices went up a lot," he said. Prior to Wednesday's interest rate decision, Fed futures traders foresaw a 51% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates in June, according to CME FedWatch. Those remained a tossup as market participants mulled the Fed’s latest projections. UPDATE (March 19, 2025, 2:41 p.m. ET): Revises headline to reflect change in bitcoin's price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The hits just keep coming for Tesla as the automaker was kicked out of the Vancouver International Auto Show because of security concerns following mass protests and vandalism against Tesla vehicles. The move to remove came after Tesla was apparently given "multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw." I, for one, am shocked that an Elon Musk-led company would be this stubborn.

The show features over 200 vehicles over the course of five days from automakers like Cadillac, Ford, Hyundai, Chevy and Toyota, but Tesls will no longer be among them. As of the morning of March 18, Tesla was still included, but by the afternoon, it had been removed from the show's website, according to the Vancouver Sun. The show's executive director said their primary concern was "the safety of attendees, exhibitors and staff. This was probably a wise mood given what the relations between the U.S. and Canada are like right now. Tesla's initial inclusion in the auto show royally pissed off some British Columbians who are miffed at Musk for questioning Canada's sovereignty and his role as one of the top advisors to President Trump. Trump has slapped tariffs on all sorts of Canadian goods and threatened to make Canada the "51st state."

In February, Musk posted on X that Canada "is not a real country," which ended up sparking a petition to remove his passport and citizenship that received "...over 375,000 signatures," according to CNN. Musk, funnily enough, has a Canadian passport that he obtained as a teenager through his mother who was born in Saskatchewan. It's understandable why Canadians aren't thrilled with these two jokers.

Tesla's International Issues

The Vancouver Sun spoke with Jen Gagnon, a Canadian-American dual citizen, who was a key organizer of the "Tesla Takedown" protest that happened in Surrey, British Columbia over the weekend.

"Bottom line, I want them to take it out," Gagnon told the outlet.

Other protests have also taken place in Vancouver, organized by the advocacy group Vancouver Against fascism, as well as across North America and Europe in response to the policies of the Trump administration and Musk's prominent role as head of the Department of Governmental Efficiency. [...] "Since election day, I feel like I've been watching my home burn down and I have felt angry and sad and powerless and helpless," said Gagnon.

I would not be terribly surprised if other auto shows around the globe pull similar moves. Right now, people are pissed off at both Musk and Tesla pretty much everywhere. Unless something serious is done about Musk's leadership at the company, it's unlikely his reputation will do anything but harm Tesla's. People don't want to support a guy who says they shouldn't exist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No matter what generation or variant, Porsche's 911 GT3 is now seen as one of the best cars ever made. For most enthusiasts, the question is not whether or not to buy a GT3, but how to get the money to buy one. Good news: Just as with the stuff you buy at Costco, there can be savings when buying in bulk when it comes to special naturally-aspirated 911s — and auction house RM Sotheby's is offering a unique opportunity for just that. Next month, the group is auctioning off a hauler full of six effectively new 911s in Munich, all either based on the 991-generation GT3.

Yes, you read that right. Six cars and the transport truck they come on, and all six 911s are still showing delivery miles.

The highlight of the group is a rare 991.1-gen 911 R. Like the recent 911 S/T, the 991-generation 911 R was a driver-focused special edition that combined the extreme performance of that era's GT3 RS with a manual transmission and a relatively understated body. Just 991 examples were built, and the model offered here is No. 698.

Two race cars are also included in the lot. One, a 911 GT3 Cup, is a spec racer that could have been used in Porsche Carrera Cup-style series around the world. The other, a 911 GT3 R, is a GT3-spec car that could have been raced in IMSA GTD and at major events like the Nürburgring 24 Hours. Neither was actually raced, but both can still be run in categories that allow older cars.

Along with the two race cars and the one exceptional special edition, the lot also includes a base 991.2 911 GT3, a Weissach Pack-equipped 991.2 911 GT3 RS, and a 991.2 911 GT3 Touring. All six ride on the back of a MAN TGX cabover tractor towing a six-car Rolfo Auriga trailer. (The 640-hp truck is technically the most powerful vehicle in the group, but it's not exactly the star of the show.)

RM Sotheby's has not listed an estimate for the lot, but another 911 R with delivery miles sold for $575,000 last year. Combined with the value of the five other Porsches, the group should easily reach into seven figures. That said, if you were already debating buying a half-dozen rare 911s, this certainly would simplify the task.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. has never actually lived up to the ideals we were taught in school, but less than two months into Trump's second term, our country has become a truly dangerous place to visit. So it shouldn't be surprising that a pair of power-tripping cops who had nothing to do with immigration enforcement took it upon themselves to harass non-citizens, including subjecting Canadian folk duo Cassie and Maggie MacDonald to a completely uncalled for loyalty test during an Ohio traffic stop, as the Globe and Mail reports. And it doesn't sound like something two different cops independently came up with, either.

The sisters, who were in the U.S. on a tour, admit the initial stop was valid — Maggie MacDonald took a phone call behind the wheel of their Chevrolet Malibu rental car, and Ohio's hands-free law makes it illegal to hold a cell phone while driving — but what should have been a quick ticket turned into a much longer ordeal after the cops learned they were Canadian. They were forced to wait while two Guernsey County Sheriff's Deputies brought out a drug dog that allegedly discovered narcotics. Except when the cops searched the car, all they could find was a bottle of wine and some prescription medication. Curious, right?

Instead of writing the ticket and letting them go, the deputies continued to question the women, seemingly convinced that Trump's already debunked Canadian fentanyl claims weren't obvious lies. "The officer speaking to me seemed to believe that Canada was the root of where all these drugs were coming from," Cassie MacDonald told the Globe and Mail. "It seemed very much in line with the narrative that has recently been touted." Almost none of the fentanyl brought into the U.S. comes from Canada.

How Much Do You Love America?

Their search for drugs that didn't exist may have been a bust, but the deputies also put the sisters in separate patrol vehicles and started asking even more inappropriate questions. "Mine asked, 'I have an important question to ask you, which do you prefer, Canada or the United States?'" Cassie told the Globe and Mail. "It seemed weighted, as if whether we were going to be given a further difficult time or if we were going to have the opportunity to go on our way depended on the answer I gave."

And while it's entirely possible the two deputies acted on their own, Cassie told the Canadian news outlet that it sure didn't feel that way. "It was two police officers just doing their job, but the question seemed out of place," Cassie told the Canadian news outlet. She also added, "I found it to be a very jarring question. And the fact we were both asked that question independently makes me think it was a mandate coming from above." A spokesperson for the Guernsey County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the stop when contacted by the Globe and Mail, which, notably, is not a denial.

Cancel Your U.S. Holiday

Both Cassie and Maggie MacDonald have had U.S. work visas for more than a decade, so there was no reason for them to suspect they would have any issues. In fact, Maggie wasn't even cited for the cell phone violation they pulled her over for in the first place. Instead, they let her go with a warning. Based on some of the stories that have made the news recently, they were also lucky the cops only wasted their time, accused them of fentanyl trafficking and subjected them to a loyalty test while detained. And even though cops harassing Canadian drivers isn't completely new, it's also hard to imagine they'll risk booking another tour in the U.S. now that they know how quickly a simple traffic stop can escalate.

It's also difficult to recommend anyone who lives in a different country still visit, even for a short holiday. You shouldn't speed or use a phone while driving, but it's also very normal to make mistakes while driving in a new country. And as much as it would be wonderful if we could guarantee law enforcement would treat people fairly and follow the law in those situations, that just isn't possible anymore. For your own sake, it's probably better to spend your tourist dollars in a country where you don't have to worry about being disappeared without due process.

Hopefully, it won't be the case forever, but I know I sure wouldn't want to roll the dice like that. And while change does take time, maybe if all the tourist dollars dry up, business owners will finally get fed up enough with Republicans taking money out of their pockets to demand that change happen faster.

Top Turkish exchanges BtcTurk and Paribu have both seen a 29% and 23% increase in 24-hour trading volume respectively.

The trading volume of Binance’s Turkey branch, Binance TR, also rose almost 24%, while the bitcoin-lira pair reportedly rose to the highest hourly trading volume across the past year.

Ekrem İmamoğlu was arrested today while Turkey also restricted access to various social media platforms. The detention took place days before İmamoğlu was to be selected as a presidential candidate and was described as a “coup attempt” by the opposition.

Shortly after, the price of TRY fell by almost 13% to a record low of 42 per USD. Turkish citizens have turned to crypto for years as the Lira continues to fall in price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it was first revealed back in 2019, the Tesla Cybertruck was just a ridiculously angular truck that nobody thought would ever actually exist. By the time it finally went on sale in December 2023, it had become an emblem of everything wrong with Tesla boss Elon Musk, and over the past year that's only got worse for the big dumb truck.

Things have now gotten so bad for Cybertruck owners that they're getting poop and eggs thrown at their stainless steel trucks, and some are resorting to novelty bumper stickers to argue that they aren't fans of Musk anymore, either. If all the abuse has got too bad for your friendly neighborhood Cybertruck owner, then they needn't worry, as there are a handful of other electric pickup trucks out there that aren't half as dumb as Tesla's Cybertruck.

Ford F-150 Lightning

Starting price: $65,090

Range: 240 - 320 miles

If you just want a pickup truck that happens to be electric, then the F-150 Lightning is Ford's truck for you. It looks like a regular F-150, drives like a regular F-150 and, despite having to haul around its own weight, is still rated to tow around 8,500 pounds of stuff whenever you need it to.

When compared to the Cybertruck, the F-150 Lightning is much more likely to blend in and avoid the assaults of any eco-minded activists that brand trucks like this as greenwashing. It's also much cheaper, but isn't able to charge quite as quickly as Tesla's truck, and can also share its power in an emergency situation through clever tech called bidirectional charging, which the Cybertruck also has.

Rivian R1T

Price: $71,900

Range: 258 - 420 miles

The slickest alternative to the Cybertruck you can buy right now is the R1T electric pickup from Rivian. The American startup's flagship boasts distinctive style, but not in an "I was designed by a five-year-old" kind of way, a very usable range and a host of innovative flourishes baked into the design.

The R1T produces up to 1,025 hp, more than the Cybertruck; has an 11,000-pound tow capacity, more than the F-150; and comes with a nifty gear tunnel to add in extra storage space, also not offered on any of its rivals. It also starts at nearly $10,000 less than Tesla's offering.

Chevrolet Silverado EV

Starting price: $75,195

Range: 390 - 492 miles

Prefer your electric pickup truck from a legacy automaker? Then the Silverado EV could be the option for you. The electric iteration of Chevy's iconic truck comes with a little design flair to set it apart from the gas-powered truck, as well as increased range compared with the options from Ford and Rivian — albeit at a premium.

More expensive doesn't always mean more better, however, and while the Silverado EV is an impressive machine, our testing of the truck found that it didn't quite live up to the polish of the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T.

GMC Sierra EV

A photo of a GMC Sierra EV truck. - GMC

Starting price: $91,995

Range: 390 - 460 miles

If you want to be able to cover more than 500 miles in your electric truck, then the GMC Sierra EV could be the perfect replacement for your Cybertruck. Based on the same platform as the Silverado EV, GMC's offering comes with more range and a whiff of luxury that you might miss in Chevy's EV.

It is, however, a pretty ugly truck and might not appeal to everybody out there. At least its looks might not get you egged, but it's something you'll be aware of while utilizing its 10,000-pound towing claims or its charging speeds of up to 350 kW.

GMC Hummer EV

A photo of a Hummer EV Pickup truck. - GM

Starting price: $98,845

Advertisement Advertisement

Range: 282 - 318 miles

Like the sound of all that but don't totally want to lose the attention your Cybertruck brings, get a Hummer EV instead. Based on the same platform as Chevy's Silverado and GMC's Sierra trucks, the Hummer EV is a brute that's almost as ridiculous as the Cybertruck. Almost.

For pretty much the same price as the Cybertruck, GM will sell you a Hummer with an extra 1,000 pounds of towing capacity, the ability to drive sideways (like a crab), and the largest battery of any EV in America. What more could you want from an enormous electric pickup?

RAM 1500 REV

Starting price: Unknown

Range: 350 miles

If you aren't in a rush to abandon your Cybertruck out of fear it'll be the victim of a domestic terrorism, then you could soon swap it for Stellantis' electric truck offering: the Ram 1500 REV. This beast will be the first all-electric pickup from Ram and is slated to launch once the hybrid Ramcharger model hits the market.

When it launches in 2026, the 1500 REV will offer the greatest towing capacity of the trucks listed here at around 14,000 pounds, a range of roughly 350 miles on a single charge, and a payload capacity of more than 2,600 pounds, which is over 100 more than the Cybertruck can manage.

Scout Terra

Starting price: Under $60,000

Range: 350 miles

Another electric truck that might be worth waiting for is the Terra from the relaunched Scout brand. Revived by VW last year, the Scout Terra is an all-electric truck that offers 350 miles of range, a towing capacity of 10,000 pounds, and it'll be sold direct-to-consumers, so you won't have to deal with a salesperson piling on markups.

What's more, the Terra will also be available with an optional range extender in the form of a gas-powered motor. The range-extender models will be capable of covering around 500 miles on a charge, but will take a hit on towing capacity, which will be around 5,000 pounds when the new trucks launch in 2027.

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have generated more than $500 million in net inflows over the past three days, regaining lost ground amid a small rally in the funds underlying asset and wider gains in risk-on assets.

The ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) were responsible for almost all these increases with ARKB receiving $180 million in net inflows over the three-day period, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors.

IBIT and FETH have generated $169.6 million and $136.5 million in net inflows over the past three trading days.

"The shift from outflows to inflows over the last three days signifies growing confidence driven by BTC's price stabilization and institutional interest," Alan Orwick, co-founder of layer 1 protocol Quai Network, wrote in an email to Decrypt.

The surge follows five weeks of net outflows that occurred as crypto and other markets slumped—a result of investor jitters about a looming trade war, geo-political tensions and other macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin's price was recently trading at about $84,500, up more than 3% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is down more than 11% during the past month, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

More than 68% of prediction market traders on MYRIAD believe that Bitcoin's price will remain above $83,000 as of March 23. (MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Stocks were up Tuesday as investors awaited the latest interest rate decision and signs that the U.S. central bank would continue its quantitative easing, a boon for risk-on assets.

Orwick noted: "As the end of the quarter approaches, institutional investors are adjusting their portfolios to align with strategic asset allocations, which this rebalancing leading to increased investments in assets such as BTC ETFs, especially if Bitcoin has under or overperformed relative to other holdings."

The 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading last year, have been wildly successful and now manage roughly $100 billion in assets. IBIT alone has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, despite shedding assets as Bitcoin's price dropped in recent weeks.

Looming economic issues, including the increased prospect of a recession have trumped U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to demonstrate resilience and strength in the competitive blockchain space. Polkadot’s innovative parachain ecosystem is gaining traction, facilitating seamless interoperability between blockchains.

Meanwhile, Avalanche’s ultra-fast, low-cost infrastructure has positioned it as a go-to network for decentralized applications (dApps), particularly in gaming and DeFi. While both networks solidify their presence, the spotlight is shifting to a rising star in the crypto industry, BinoFi.

Enter BinoFi: The Compliance-Driven DeFi Contender

BinoFi is making waves with its compliance-ready decentralized finance (DeFi) suite, designed to bridge the gap between regulatory requirements and user privacy. This first-ever hybrid cryptocurrency exchange merges centralized and decentralized models to cater to a diverse audience, from institutional investors to everyday traders. But what sets BinoFi apart isn’t just its hybrid structure; it’s the revolutionary tools and features powering its ecosystem.

Key Features of BinoFi’s Ecosystem

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC

With increasing regulatory scrutiny, identity verification is more critical than ever. BinoFi leverages Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to enable customers to verify their identity without exposing sensitive data. This approach satisfies compliance requirements while maintaining user privacy, making it particularly attractive to institutional players wary of data breaches. Hybrid CEX/DEX Architecture

BinoFi combines the best of both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. Users can enjoy the speed, liquidity, and efficiency of CEXs while retaining the flexibility and security of trustless, non-custodial DEX platforms. This duality allows traders to choose the trading model that suits their workflow, ensuring a tailored experience. AI-Driven Trading Tools

Artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in BinoFi’s ecosystem. Advanced AI tools help traders optimize their strategies with features like real-time market sentiment analysis, automated risk management, and predictive analytics. These smart tools democratize high-level trading techniques, empowering users from all backgrounds.

Growing Interest in $BINO Token

The value of BinoFi’s native token, $BINO, is rising alongside the platform’s growing adoption. Currently in the presale phase, analysts are optimistic about the token’s prospects. Market watchers predict that $BINO could reach $3.75 in the near term, thanks to its robust utility within the ecosystem and the increasing demand for compliance-ready exchanges.

Investors eyeing BinoFi’s hybrid model and regulatory foresight see the $BINO token as not just a trading asset but a piece of the future in integrated compliance and innovation in DeFi.

Revolutionizing the DeFi Landscape

BinoFi is setting a new standard in decentralized finance by solving critical industry challenges, such as fragmented liquidity, scalability issues, and regulatory hurdles. Its ability to appeal to both retail users and institutional participants makes it a formidable force in the DeFi market.

Polkadot and Avalanche may be showcasing their strengths, but BinoFi’s combination of privacy, compliance, and innovation is commanding attention. As the DeFi space continues to mature, projects like BinoFi are prepared to lead the next phase of the evolution, delivering secure and scalable solutions without compromising on trust or transparency. For investors, $BINO’s trajectory offers a significant opportunity to participate in the transitions shaping the future of finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a speech at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City on March 20. This will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has addressed a Bitcoin and crypto conference, highlighting the growing influence of digital assets in mainstream financial policy.

Although this marks his first speech as a sitting president at a crypto event, Trump has previously engaged with the Bitcoin community, having spoken at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference in Nashville last summer while on the campaign trail. His return to the stage now as president further highlights the continued support from the U.S. government on Bitcoin.

Trump’s speech at DAS comes only a couple weeks after moving forward with officially integrating Bitcoin into his national strategy, when he signed an executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning BTC as a key asset for the country’s financial future.

Joining the lineup tomorrow at DAS is Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who will deliver a keynote speech and engage in a fireside chat with Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. Additionally, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will host a panel discussion with BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robbie Mitchnick and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products Giang Bui, where they will delve into the evolving landscape of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption.

The announcement of Trump’s participation follows remarks from Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for President Trump, who spoke earlier this week at DAS. Hines reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to accumulating Bitcoin for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, stating:

“I think it’s high time that our President started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away.”

He also emphasized the administration’s approach to acquiring Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways, likening BTC accumulation to gold reserves:

“You know, I’ve been asked all the time, it’s like how much do you want? Well, that’s like asking a country how much gold do you want – as much as we can get.”

JUST IN – 🇺🇸 President Trump's Executive Director on digital assets: "We talked about ways of acquiring more Bitcoin in budget neutral ways."

Trump’s executive order has already sparked legislative action aiming to build on this momentum. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have each proposed plans for the U.S. to acquire 1 million BTC over the next five years, ensuring a long-term reserve of the scarce asset. Earlier today at DAS, House Majority Whip and Congressman Tom Emmer stated that he believes this legislation will be enacted “before this congress is done.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a significant downturn, with many major assets, including Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI), seeing substantial losses. As the market fluctuates, Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) whales have begun accumulating Coldware (COLD) tokens, seeking to diversify their portfolios and absorb some of the losses from the 22% market decline. Here’s why these whales are turning to Coldware (COLD) and how it could shape the market in the coming weeks.

Coldware (COLD) as a Safe Haven for Whales

While Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) struggle with volatility, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as an attractive investment option for whales. Coldware (COLD) offers a robust decentralized ecosystem that focuses on scalability, real-world asset tokenization, and decentralized finance. The project’s Coldchain network, which integrates mobile-first applications and real-world uses, provides a unique value proposition that makes it a compelling alternative for investors looking for stability in a turbulent market.

Whale Behavior and Portfolio Diversification

Whales typically accumulate assets during periods of market downturns to protect their holdings from further losses. By acquiring Coldware (COLD) tokens, Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) whales are positioning themselves for potential growth in the long term. Coldware (COLD)’s innovative approach to blockchain technology, which includes mobile-first solutions and decentralized finance, positions it as a strong contender in the future of blockchain.

As whales buy into Coldware (COLD), the project’s growing demand could drive up its value. In addition, with Coldware (COLD) offering decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities, whales may also be attracted to the potential for higher returns through staking, lending, and borrowing.

Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) in the Current Market

Litecoin (LTC), which has been struggling in recent weeks, saw a significant drop in price after breaking key support levels. Analysts have predicted that LTC could fall to $70 if the bearish momentum continues. As Litecoin (LTC) faces these challenges, many investors are looking for ways to hedge their losses. Sui (SUI), another altcoin, has also faced a downturn, with its price experiencing sharp fluctuations in recent days.

In this environment of uncertainty, whales—large holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI)—have started to look for alternative investments to balance their portfolios and protect their assets. One such investment that is catching their attention is Coldware (COLD).

Coldware’s Future Potential Amidst Market Decline

Despite the overall market downturn, Coldware (COLD) is gaining momentum. With its focus on real-world applications, scalability, and mobile-first access, Coldware (COLD) is poised for growth as more users embrace decentralized finance and blockchain solutions. Whales in the Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) markets are smartly positioning themselves to benefit from Coldware (COLD)‘s increasing adoption, creating an exciting opportunity for investors who have been impacted by recent market losses.

Conclusion

As Litecoin (LTC) and Sui (SUI) whales look for ways to absorb losses amidst the 22% market downturn, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a key player. With its innovative features and focus on scalability and real-world applications, Coldware (COLD) offers a promising investment opportunity for those looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility. As more whales accumulate Coldware (COLD) tokens, the project’s value is likely to rise, making it a top choice for savvy investors in uncertain times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the cryptocurrency market evolves, traders are increasingly focused on long positions in projects with significant growth potential. Among the leading contenders are Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX), and Coldware (COLD). Each of these projects offers unique advantages, and positioning long on these assets could lead to substantial returns.

Coldware (COLD): The Blockchain Ecosystem with a Mobile-First Approach

Unlike Cosmos (ATOM) and Avalanche (AVAX), Coldware (COLD) is not just about cryptocurrency. Its “beyond crypto” strategy focuses on real-world applications such as decentralized finance, tokenization, and IoT integration. The mobile-first approach ensures that Coldware (COLD) is accessible to a wider audience, particularly in regions where traditional blockchain participation is difficult.

The Combined Potential: A Multi-Crypto Investment Strategy

Traders who position themselves long in Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX), and Coldware (COLD) may find themselves riding a wave of growth across multiple segments. Cosmos is benefiting from scalability and upcoming upgrades, Avalanche from liquidity-enhancing collaborations, and Coldware (COLD) from its diversified blockchain ecosystem. Together, these assets could form the cornerstone of a high-growth crypto portfolio

Why Traders Are Bullish on Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos (ATOM) has shown impressive momentum after breaking free from its recent price channel. Analysts predict that Cosmos could see a surge of 70%, driven by its scalability improvements and the launch of the Mercury Upgrade. This, combined with its strong community backing, makes it a top choice for long positions in the coming months.

Avalanche (AVAX): A Growing Market with Enhanced Liquidity

Avalanche (AVAX) has been gaining significant attention due to its partnerships aimed at improving liquidity and market efficiency in Asia. With collaborations like those with Presto and StraitsX, AVAX is strengthening its position as a scalable solution for real-world asset tokenization and decentralized finance. The positive market sentiment and stable trading indicators make Avalanche (AVAX) a strong candidate for traders looking to capitalize on its liquidity improvements.

Conclusion: A High Potential Long-Term Strategy

Traders focusing on long positions in Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX), and Coldware (COLD) are likely to see their investments grow as each of these projects continues to mature and expand.

With significant technical and fundamental catalysts driving their price action, these cryptocurrencies are well-positioned for explosive growth in the coming years, potentially delivering millions in returns to savvy investors.

Hong Kong, China, March 19th, 2025

Linear Finance has announced its 2025 roadmap that places AI at the core of its decentralized trading platform.

By integrating AI across all development phases, Linear aims to offer traders a more data-driven, efficient, and intuitive DeFi experience with richer insights, faster execution, and improved risk management. This forward-looking strategy positions Linear Finance as a leader in merging AI tech with DeFi trading and promises a smarter way to engage with the crypto market.

Q1 2025: Laying the Groundwork

In Q1 2025, Linear Finance is strengthening its foundation to support the AI features coming later in the year. The team is building on their core Perpetual DEX functionality with improvements like multi-chain asset deposits for seamless cross-chain trading while launching a new affiliate rewards program to boost user growth and liquidity. By growing the user base and optimizing the platform early on, Linear ensures a vast network for its upcoming AI tools to leverage.

Q2 2025: AI Foundations

The second quarter introduces the first wave of AI-driven tools on the Linear platform. A Smart Money Tracker will use machine learning to monitor large wallet movements across blockchains, giving everyday traders a window into what savvy investors are doing in real-time. Linear is upgrading its on-chain data pipeline for high-speed, reliable feeds to ensure that AI insights remain timely and accurate. In addition, the platform incorporates social sentiment analysis, monitoring online trends, and influencer activity to identify shifts in market dynamics, such as sudden interest in meme coins. These AI-powered capabilities transform raw data into actionable insights, providing traders with timely alerts to support informed decision-making.

Q3 2025: AI-Driven Analytics

In Q3, Linear Finance will launch advanced analytics and dashboards powered by AI to deepen users’ market intelligence. A new Liquidity & Risk Dashboard will flag unusual on-chain patterns (like abrupt liquidity withdrawals or suspicious trading spikes) so users can manage risks before they escalate. AI-driven predictive models will analyze market trends to gauge the probability of various price moves, giving traders an early heads-up on where the market might be headed. At the same time, continuous improvements to anomaly detection and sentiment analysis sharpen the accuracy of alerts. With these tools, traders gain a more comprehensive early-warning system for market shifts and can act on data-driven insights with greater confidence.

Q4 2025: AI-Powered Trading Assistant

Q4 will see the launch of Linear’s fully AI-powered trading assistant, an all-in-one tool that personalizes and automates user trading. This smart assistant offers custom strategy recommendations tailored to each portfolio and can execute trades automatically when certain market conditions are met — effectively acting as a 24/7 co-pilot for the trader.

A new copy trading feature will also allow users to mirror the moves of top investors or AI-driven portfolios, with built-in risk safeguards making advanced strategies accessible to everyone. Combined with social features like leaderboards that foster community engagement, Linear’s platform becomes a highly interactive and intelligent trading hub by the year’s end, where even novice traders can leverage sophisticated AI guidance.

The Linear Finance Vision: AI Integrated Financial Freedom

Linear Finance’s 2025 roadmap uses AI at every step to transform its DeFi platform into a smarter, more efficient trading ecosystem. For users, this means richer insights, automated execution, and stronger risk controls at every turn. By the year’s end, Linear is set to deliver a next-generation DeFi experience that redefines what’s possible when cutting-edge AI meets decentralized finance.

About Linear Finance

Linear Finance is a decentralized platform that lets users easily trade and manage synthetic assets—digital versions of real-world assets like currencies or commodities—without relying on traditional financial systems. It uses its own token, called LINA, along with other cryptocurrencies, to support these digital assets. Linear also connects different blockchains, making it simpler and cheaper to move assets around.

The platform prioritizes security, regularly undergoing checks by trusted security companies. Users also have a say in how the platform runs, ensuring decisions stay transparent and community-focused.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has recently come to my attention that multiple U.S. Congressmen who have taken very public pro-Bitcoin stances are not even aware of the currently unfolding prosecution of Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill.

This is simply mind-boggling to me as a Bitcoiner. The current legal prosecution of the Samourai team, as well as the relevant prosecutions against Roman Sterlingov, accused of operating the mixer Bitcoin Fog, and Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, two developers behind Tornado Cash, are the most important legal cases impacting the sovereign and private use of Bitcoin on the docket today..

Roman Storm is sitting in jail right now after a conviction attained with zero hard evidence whatsoever. His conviction was based on nothing more than unproven assertions by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis. The Samourai and Tornado Cash developers are being prosecuted under money laundering legislation for developing purely self custodial software that, in no circumstances in which their software could be used, gave them any control over user funds.

The fact that this is not only not on the radar of any Congressman or Congresswoman who claims to be pro-Bitcoin, but not being loudly talked about, is absurd.

So, let’s do something to change that. I’m calling on every United States citizen reading this to take the form letter below, fill it in appropriately, and send it to your congressman or congresswoman — especially if you are in a district with a representative claiming publicly to be pro-Bitcoin.

This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.



[Your Name]

[Your Address]

[City, State, Zipcode]

[Email]

[Phone Number]

[Date]

The Representative [or] Senator [Congressman or Congresswoman’s Name]

[Congressman/Congresswoman’s Address]

[City, State, Zipcode]

I am writing as a concerned citizen of [your State]. I wish to bring to your attention a very important matter regarding the criminal prosecution of open source developers writing software for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill of Samourai Wallet, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm of Tornado Cash, are being prosecuted for various acts of or assertions of conspiracy to commit money laundering. All four of these men have done nothing but produce and publish open source software that was/is freely available to the public.

A foundational reality of decentralized networks like Bitcoin is the ability their architecture gives to their users to interact and transact with their money using nothing but open-source and freely available software that communicates with a decentralized computer network. When using cryptocurrencies in this way, no one except the end user of the software has any ability to influence, control, or restrict the transfer of a person’s assets on these decentralized networks.

All four of these men have done nothing beyond produce and operate freely available open-source software with the aim of helping end users of these networks protect their personal privacy. Americans have a right to privacy, especially financial privacy, which is why the Bank Secrecy Act mandates that financial institutions take measures to protect the security and confidentiality of American’s financial information.

Blockchains by their very nature, however, are public stores of information. For everyone to guarantee that the rules of the decentralized network are being followed properly, everyone must be able to download and verify the entirety of a blockchain’s transactional history. Everyone’s transactional history. This allows anyone who you transact with to see potentially how much wealth you have, even to follow and learn of future transactions you make.

This is not only very sensitive information to have in the public domain in general, but it can present a very serious risk to people’s physical safety. Incidents of kidnapping, physical assault, and home invasion in order to steal bitcoin from private individuals have increased in frequency as its value has increased.

Software that enables users to maintain their privacy while using networks like Bitcoin is critical, not only to their privacy in general, but also to their physical safety. Both Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash do so in a purely self-custodial manner, meaning no entity other than the end users themselves ever has control, or ability to influence, the transactions that are made. This also means that there is no legal entity that the current charges actually apply to (i.e. a custodial financial institution subject to financial regulations).

Separately, Roman Sterlingov has been convicted in criminal court of operating a custodial mixing service used to achieve privacy on the Bitcoin network. While this service was custodial, and as such would have financial regulatory obligations, the evidence presented at trial of Roman’s involvement in operating this service is purely circumstantial. Many details of the nature of this evidence, and its questionability, exist on the public record from Sterlingov’s attorney Tor Ekeland.

I strongly urge you to investigate these matters, and take action to correct these severe miscarriages of justice resulting from the application of nonapplicable financial regulations to open-source software developers, and the complete flouting of the requirements to show evidence behind a reasonable doubt to achieve conviction in a criminal proceeding.

[Only include the bold if your congressman/congresswoman is publicly pro-Bitcoin]

This is incredibly important when it comes to the freedom to use Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in a self-custodial and freedom-preserving way. I hope to see your actions in Congress live up to your stance on public record when it comes to Bitcoin as a policy issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]</p>

Lista DAO: The Powerhouse of BNBFi

As a leader in the BNBFi ecosystem, Lista DAO has firmly established itself as a critical player in the on-chain token launch sector, serving as the primary liquidity provider and yield-generation engine. Notably, Lista DAO is the only DeFi protocol permitted to participate directly in Binance’s Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop initiatives before a new token goes live. This exclusive access underscored Lista DAO’s strategic importance within Binance’s ecosystem.

Lista DAO has 3 key offerings, lisUSD, slisBNB, and clisBNB.

lisUSD is a decentralized stable coin designed to provide capital efficiency and liquidity for DeFi users. It is soft-pegged to the US dollar, minted through an over-collateralized debt mechanism. Each lisUSD is fully backed by deposited collateral in the Lista vault, which helps maintain its peg and stability, providing a reliable dollar-denominated asset within the ecosystem for trading, lending, or yield earning. slisBNB is Lista DAO’s liquid staking token for BNB, representing BNB that has been staked through the protocol and its accruing staking rewards. slisBNB is obtained when users stake BNB on Lista DAO. This token’s value appreciates relative to normal BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing holders to potentially earn passive staking yield over time while maintaining liquidity. clisBNB is a certificate token users receive when they deposit BNB into Lista DAO’s CDP (Collaterized-Debt Position), issued at a 1:1 ratio to the BNB locked. clisBNB allows users to borrow lisUSD against their BNB collateral while still using the same BNB in Binance Launchpool.

Lista DAO’s 2025 Roadmap: 3 Key Pillars of Growth

With the unveiling of its 2025 roadmap, Lista DAO has set forth a three-pronged growth strategy that places emphasis on enhancing benefits for veLISTA token holders, expanding liquidity solutions, and optimizing staking mechanisms.

Boosting veLISTA Token Utility: Lista DAO is introducing a suite of incentive mechanisms to enhance veLISTA holders’ benefits, including interest rate discounts, delayed liquidation mechanisms, and exclusive holders’ perks. Additionally, a long-term staking rewards program, coupled with a tiered incentive model and market buy back initiatives aims to strengthen token economics and encourage sustained holding of veLISTA.

Expansion of lisUSD Adoption: Lista DAO aims to scale the lisUSD ecosystem by driving its adoption across multiple blockchain networks, particularly within ecosystems that lack stable and reliable liquidity solutions.

Cross-Chain Expansion for clisBNB: Lista DAO’s collaborations with StakeStone, Solv, and other protocols enhance the integration of clisBNB across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. These initiatives will allow newly introduced staking assets to participate in Binance’s Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop programs, offering an estimated 30% APR.

Merging Meme Culture with DeFi: Lista DAO’s “All-in BNBFi” Strategy

Merging DeFi and Meme Culture, Lista DAO is rapidly innovating in both sectors, strategically positioning itself at the intersection of liquidity provision and high-yield opportunities.

lisUSD & Four.Meme Partnership: Recognizing the growing demand for liquidity in the meme token space, Lista DAO has partnered with Four.Meme to support lisUSD as a funding and trading mechanism. Making lisUSD the first meme-friendly stable coin project on the BNB Chain. lisUSD has established liquidity pools with memes such as TST and CHEEMS in the BNB Chain ecosystem.

slisBNB & Pendle Finance Integration: A collaboration between Lista DAO and Pendle Finance integration of slisBNB and clisBNB into the Pendle ecosystem. This integration sparked the creation of new financial products, PT-clisBNB, YT-clisBNB, and LP-clisBNB, These assets offer a range of opportunities for users seeking passive income, fixed returns, or diversified yield exposure, all while leveraging Binance’s Launchpool incentives.

YT-clisBNB (Yield Token) is ideal for users looking to automate extra yield generation. By holding YT-clisBNB, investors gain direct access to Launchpool airdrops from Binance’s top projects, capturing additional rewards with no active management required.

For those seeking predictable and stable returns, PT-clisBNB (Principal Token) offers a fixed-yield solution. Investors lock in BNB at a discount and receive a guaranteed 1:1 redemption at maturity, similar to a term deposit.

LP-clisBNB (Liquidity Provider Token) provides a balanced approach, combining the benefits of both YT and PT tokens. Holders enjoy dual exposure to staking yields and Launchpool airdrops, while also potentially earning liquidity rewards.

This collaboration enhances BNB staking yields by introducing a flexible, composable financial strategy, enabling users to separate principal and yield components for optimized returns.

SolvBTC.BNB Bitcoin Yield Products in BNBFi: Lista DAO has also collaborated with Solv Protocol to introduce SolvBTC.BNB, a Bitcoin-native yield-bearing asset within the BNBFi ecosystem. This action enables BTC holders to generate BTC-denominated rewards, access Binance’s Launchpool, and earn incentives across the BNB Chain ecosystem.

The Future of Lista DAO in BNBFi

In December 2024, Lista DAO launched its BNB staking node, which has since attracted over 82,000 BNB in total staked assets.

Moving forward, Lista DAO plans to enhance staking incentives through a dynamic fee model, on-chain reputation system, and yield-boosting tools to improve validator competitiveness and increase overall staking profitability.

As the only DeFi project within Binance’s ecosystem to be able to participate directly in Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrop initiatives, Lista DAO remains at the forefront of BNBFi innovation. Whether through DeFi-powered capital efficiency, meme-driven liquidity expansion, or cross-chain integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Lista DAO continues to provide a robust suite of strategies for BNB holders.

About Lista DAO

Lista DAO is the leading BNBFi protocol on BNB Chain, offering overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin (CDP), BNB LST, and innovative solutions that allow users to earn rewards from Binance Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer Airdrops. As the first to have DeFi BNB recognized for Binance Launchpool, Lista DAO has achieved a TVL growth of 896.92% year-to-date, reaching $1.1B, making it the fourth-largest protocol on BNB by TVL.

New York, United States, March 19th, 2025, Chainwire

Arda, a company developing a universal operating system for real estate, has raised $3 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Lightshift. The investment supports Arda’s initiative to enhance efficiency in the $380 trillion real estate sector by addressing its fragmented and opaque infrastructure.

Arda is building a digital framework designed to unify real estate assets, data, and financial services into a single, interoperable system. Leveraging AI and blockchain technology, the platform aims to reduce transaction times and enhance transparency by enabling real-time ownership and financial processes.

A Purpose-Built Digital Infrastructure for Real Estate

Arda’s platform introduces a programmable execution layer for real estate, integrating digital rights management, AI-driven automation, and seamless data interoperability. Key features include:

A verifiable record of property history to streamline due diligence. Real-Time Money Movement: Payments directly linked to transactions for improved settlement efficiency.

Payments directly linked to transactions for improved settlement efficiency. Integrated Data and Automation: Automated workflows reducing administrative friction in asset management.

Industry Leadership and Institutional Backing

Arda was founded by Oli Harris, former Managing Director in Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs and Head of Crypto Assets Strategy at JPMorgan Chase. Harris played a key role in the development and commercialization of Quorum, an enterprise Ethereum platform, and contributed to institutional digital asset adoption. His experience includes board positions at Anchorage, BitGo, Blockdaemon, and TRM Labs.

“Real estate remains one of the most valuable yet operationally fragmented asset classes,” said Oli Harris, Founder & CEO of Arda. “By creating a programmable, trust-based system, we aim to bring real estate transactions in line with modern digital financial infrastructure.”

A Market Evolving Toward Digitization

As institutional investment in digital assets grows, governments and industry leaders are exploring frameworks for secure, verifiable digital property transactions.

House of Doge, Dogecoin Foundation, IndyCar Driver DeFrancesco, and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing Launch Dogecoin Indy 500 Voting and Donation Platform – Letting Fans Make Doge History and Win The Ultimate Collectors Prize

Dogecoin Racing, launched by the House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation is teaming up with NTT INDYCAR SERIES driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing to bring Dogecoin to the iconic motorsports event—the Indy 500—while supporting a cause that is deeply personal to the team. The Indianapolis 500, known as “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” returns for its 109th running on Memorial Day weekend on May 25, drawing over 350,000 spectators in person and reaching a global audience in over 140 countries. This year brings with it a historic partnership with the Dogecoin race car taking center stage, empowering fans with the opportunity to vote on DeFrancesco’s Indy 500 car design featuring the iconic Dogecoin Shiba Inu.

Dogecoin, like DeFrancesco, was born FAST!

DeFrancesco was 15 weeks premature and weighed just one pound at birth, given his last rights on two occasions, and spent four months in the Neo-Natal ICU before making a miraculous recovery.

Now, as a professional race car driver, he’s using his platform to give back to critically ill children. As part of this Dogetastic partnership, DeFrancesco, a dog lover, and Dogecoin fan, will personally donate $25,000 in Dogecoin to Riley Children’s Foundation in Indianapolis, aligned with Riley Children’s Health, a leading pediatric care center.

This initiative also marks a historic moment in motorsport, as DeFrancesco has committed to receive $100,000 of his salary in Dogecoin. A bold step forward for crypto adoption in professional sports.

“I first invested in Dogecoin in 2020 and drove everyone crazy, telling anyone who would listen that they needed to own it. It’s not only my favorite crypto, but the plan to become a global currency and drive payment adoption is awesome. I’m pumped to be part of the community and an ambassador for the vision,” Devlin shared.

Voting to Bring an Iconic Doge Design to the Indy 500 Track and Make Doge History

To celebrate the making of Dogecoin History, House of Doge, the Dogecoin Foundation and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing are launching a fan-powered contest, allowing the Dogecoin community to choose the official race car wrap and helmet design that Devlin will wear at the Indy 500.

From March 19 to March 25, fans can vote on their favorite design and enter to win a Dogecoin wallet loaded with $1,000.

VOTES OPEN TODAY: Three potential versions of the No. 30 Dogecoin Honda include:

● Blaze – This livery burns so hot, it makes the sun look like a nightlight. Some say it was forged in the volcanic fires of Kīlauea and once it hits the track, all that’s left behind is smoke, embers, and the shattered dreams of others

● Turbowave – This livery is so 80s, it comes with a free synthwave soundtrack and a pair of neon sunglasses. Some say if you drive it at night, it glitches into a parallel universe where Miami Vice never ended and every race runs in slow motion with looping palm trees in the background.

● BananaBoost – This livery is so slippery, that Mario’s filing an official complaint. Powered by pure potassium, it’s sure to slip past the competition while making swift work of pesky turtle shells.

“Dogenate” to Children’s Health for a Chance to Win the Ultimate Collector’s Prize

As part of this partnership, House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation are rallying the Dogecoin community to join DeFrancesco in making a real-world impact by supporting children’s health. In addition to casting a vote, contributions in Dogecoin to Riley’s provide an opportunity to win the ultimate collector’s prize.

The largest Dogecoin donor leading up to race day will receive an exclusive, one-of-a-kind Indy 500 racing helmet, worn – and signed – by DeFrancesco himself during his Indy 500 qualifying run.

The Dogecoin-powered fundraising campaign will directly benefit Riley Children’s Foundation, which supports Riley Children’s Health, home to one of the nation’s top-ranked neonatology programs by U.S. News & World Report. The funds raised will help provide life-saving medical care to newborns, including those born prematurely or with critical conditions requiring immediate and specialized treatment.

House of Doge encourages the Dogecoin community to race toward generosity, make history, and support this incredible cause leading up to the Indy 500 on May 25.

Fans can vote and donate at dogecoin.com/indycar.

About House of Doge

The House of Doge team believes the future of money is already digital, and with Dogecoin’s speed and efficiency, it’s the ideal solution for the modern financial ecosystem. The team’s goal is to make Dogecoin a widely accepted decentralized currency for everyday use worldwide. To achieve this, House of Doge focuses on aggregating Dogecoin liquidity through robust operations in the U.S., creating a strategic reserve that will support its seamless use in commerce and government transactions. They are building the infrastructure necessary to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable Dogecoin transactions.

About Dogecoin Foundation

The Dogecoin Foundation is a nonprofit organization committed to developing open-source technology that enhances Dogecoin’s accessibility and utility as a peer-to-peer digital currency.

About Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing

Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, based in Zionsville, Ind., is co-owned by three-time IndyCar Champion and 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former CBS Late Show host David Letterman, and Mi-Jack co-owner Mike Lanigan. In 2025, the team will compete in its 34th year of competition and will attempt to add to its 30 Indy car wins – including 2004 Indy 500 from pole with Buddy Rice and the 2020 Indy 500 with Takuma Sato — their 37 poles, 112 podium finishes, and 1992 series championship.

● Turbowave – This livery is so 80s, it comes with a free synthwave soundtrack and a pair of neon sunglasses. Some say if you drive it at night, it glitches into a parallel universe where Miami Vice never ended and every race runs in slow motion with looping palm trees in the background.

● BananaBoost – This livery is so slippery, that Mario’s filing an official complaint. Powered by pure potassium, it’s sure to slip past the competition while making swift work of pesky turtle shells.

Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a video shared to his X account Wednesday that the SEC will drop its appeal in the lawsuit it's been pursuing against the firm for the past four years.

"I'm finally able to announce that this case has ended. It's over," Garlinghouse said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Today is a victory and [a] long overdue surrender from the SEC.”

Ripple, which uses XRP Ledger and the XRP cryptocurrency, got a partial ruling in its favor in 2023, but the SEC filed an appeal seeking to have that decision overturned.

A federal New York judge found that Ripple’s "programmatic sales” of XRP on a secondary market did not constitute securities transactions, while those made to institutional investors did.

To be clear, the SEC has not yet made an announcement that it will drop its appeal. At the time of writing, the XRP price has climbed as high as 14% to $2.55, according to CoinGecko data.

A Ripple spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt that the SEC’s decision is “subject to Commission vote and approval.” It may take “several weeks” for the case to be officially withdrawn, they said, adding: “That timeline is completely in the SEC's control.”

The SEC declined to comment when asked for details about the Ripple lawsuit by Decrypt.

A federal New York court ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine for XRP sales to institutions in August. The penalty was far below the agency’s $2 billion request, and it’s unclear how the SEC dropping its appeal could impact the decision in the Southern District of New York.

The SEC’s legal about-face was widely expected.

Since SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda took over, the regulator has retreated from several enforcement actions, including its cases against the crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken.

If the SEC had been successful in its Ripple case, it could have had wide reaching impact on which cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities versus commodities.

Ripple Labs Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told Decrypt in October, before President Donald Trump’s reelection, that the SEC’s appeal “will backfire.”

While he believed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would grant a favorable decision for the firm, he also noted that the SEC “can withdraw their appeal anytime they want.”

An analyst from multinational bank Standard Chartered believes that crypto exchange Coinbase “proactively sold” 12,652 Ethereum (approximately $37 million) throughout Q4 2024. They explained that Coinbase’s layer-2 network Base drives demand for Ethereum but the company’s profit taking is hurting the underlying blockchain’s price action.

Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000 earlier this week. At the time, Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the bank, claimed that layer-2 network Base had removed $50 billion from ETH’s market cap—now, he’s saying this is because of profit taking.

“My view is that increased activity on Base increases demand for ETH in the first instance,” Kendrick shared with Decrypt. “But then all of Base’s profits (which are circa 80% of all Base revenue) are sold (ETH-USD selling) to effectively repatriate profits back to Coinbase.”

To back up his claim, the analyst points to Coinbase’s quarterly Ethereum holdings for investments and operations which Kendrick then subtracted from the Base profits.

“This tells me that in Q4 2024 Coinbase proactively sold 12,652 ETH,” he explained. “Over the 3 quarters the net proactive selling was 1,558 ETH. So while there are only 3 quarters of relevant post-Dencun data so far, I think we can conclude that Coinbase is not in the business of HODLing Base’s ETH profits.”

Taking the average price in Q4 2024, using the quarter’s open and close, this works out to approximately $37.68 million sold by Coinbase.

Ethereum's Decun upgrade went live in March of last year and significantly reduced the gas fees on layer-2 networks. Since then, the analyst believes, Coinbase has shown its intention to sell as part of a “normal risk adjusted decision process.”

A spokesperson for Coinbase told Decrypt that Base, "earns ETH from sequencer fees, and the ETH we earn is primarily held for long term investment or used for operational expenses, including tax liabilities and reinvesting in growth via things like salaries, grants, acquisitions, and public goods funding."

They added that, "Separately, we also hold some ETH for long-term investment, and Coinbase reports our crypto assets specifically held for long -erm investment as part of our public quarterly earnings filing." Citing the firm's 10K, the spokesperson noted that, "crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term...we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them," adding that, "Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024."

In the Standard Chartered analyst’s note from earlier in the week, he argued that making transactions via layer-2 networks negatively impacts the underlying blockchain because Ethereum receives less fees overall. In turn, this lowers the “GDP” of the Ethereum blockchain and the amount of gas fees it collects from transactions, meaning the Foundation mints more new coins to pay expenses.

Created by Coinbase, Base is a layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum that aims to help extend the capabilities of the underlying blockchain, as well as offering a bridge off of the popular centralized exchange.

The Standard Chartered analyst believes that looking at Coinbase’s Ethereum holdings over the past three quarters reveals even more about its goals as a company.

“The fact they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick added.

Despite Standard Chartered’s target price for Ethereum being slashed, the cryptocurrency is up 5.6% on the day and 4.6% on the week, per data from CoinGecko, while Bitcoin has traded mostly flat during the same time.

As a result, over 70% of users on decentralized prediction market MYRIAD—launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN—believe that Ethereum’s relative price to Bitcoin will be above $0.023 by the end of the week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin’s market structure is evolving, and its once-predictable four-year cycles may no longer hold the same relevance. In a recent conversation with Matt Crosby, lead analyst at Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Mitchell Askew, Head Analyst at Blockware Solutions, shared his perspective on how Bitcoin ETFs, mining advancements, and institutional adoption are reshaping the asset’s price behavior.

📺 Watch the Full Interview:

According to Askew, Bitcoin’s historical pattern of parabolic price increases followed by steep drawdowns is changing as institutional investors enter the market. At the same time, the mining industry is becoming more efficient and stable, creating new dynamics that affect Bitcoin’s supply and price trends.

Bitcoin’s Market Cycles Are Fading

Askew suggests that Bitcoin may no longer experience the extreme cycles of past bull and bear markets. Historically, halving events reduced miner rewards, triggered supply shocks, and fueled rapid price increases, often followed by corrections of 70% or more. However, the increasing presence of institutional investors is leading to a more structured, macro-driven market.

He explains that Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury allocations are bringing consistent demand into Bitcoin, reducing the likelihood of extreme boom-and-bust price movements. Unlike retail traders, who tend to buy in euphoria and panic-sell during downturns, institutions are more likely to sell into strength and accumulate Bitcoin on dips.

Askew also notes that since Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, price movements have become more measured, with longer consolidation periods before continued growth. This suggests Bitcoin is beginning to behave more like a traditional financial asset, rather than a speculative high-volatility market.

The Role of Bitcoin Mining in Price Stability

As a mining analyst at Blockware Solutions, Askew provides insight into how Bitcoin mining dynamics influence price trends. He notes that while many assume a rising hash rate is always bullish, the reality is more complex.

In the short term, increasing hash rate can be bearish, as it leads to higher competition among miners and more Bitcoin being sold to cover electricity costs. However, over the long term, a rising hash rate reflects greater investment in Bitcoin infrastructure and network security.

Another key observation from Askew is that Bitcoin’s hash rate growth lags behind price growth by 3-12 months. When Bitcoin’s price rises sharply, mining profitability increases, prompting more capital to flow into mining infrastructure. However, deploying new mining rigs and setting up facilities takes time, leading to a delayed impact on hash rate expansion.

Why Mining Profitability Is Stabilizing

Askew also highlights that mining hardware efficiency is reaching a plateau, which has significant implications for miners and Bitcoin’s supply structure.

If you're thinking about Bitcoin mining, you MUST watch this clip.



There's a trend developing in mining hardware that will bode extremely well for miners:



– Longer machine lifespans

– Slowing hashrate growth

– Increased lag between price growth and hashrate growth

In Bitcoin’s early years, new mining machines offered dramatic efficiency improvements, forcing miners to upgrade hardware every 1-2 years to remain competitive. Today, however, new models are only about 10% more efficient than the previous generation. As a result, mining rigs can now remain profitable for 4-8 years, reducing the pressure on miners to continuously reinvest in new equipment.

Electricity costs remain the biggest factor in mining profitability, and Askew explains that miners are increasingly seeking low-cost power sources to maintain long-term sustainability. Many companies, including Blockware Solutions, operate in rural U.S. locations with stable energy prices, ensuring better profitability even during market downturns.

Could the U.S. Government Start Accumulating Bitcoin?

Another important discussion point raised by Askew is the potential for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Some policymakers have proposed that the U.S. government accumulate Bitcoin in the same way it holds gold reserves, recognizing its potential as a global store of value.

Askew explains that if such a reserve were implemented, it could create a massive supply shock, pushing Bitcoin’s price significantly higher. However, he cautions that government action is slow and would likely involve gradual accumulation rather than sudden large-scale purchases.

Even if implemented over several years, such a program could further reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term bullish trajectory by removing available supply from the market.

Bitcoin Price Predictions & Long-Term Outlook

Based on current trends, Askew remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory, though he believes the market’s behavior is shifting toward more gradual, sustained growth rather than extreme speculative cycles.

📌 Bitcoin Price Targets for 2025:

Base Case: $150K – $200K

$150K – $200K Bull Case: $250K+

📌 Long-Term (10-Year) Forecast:

Base Case: $500K – $1M

$500K – $1M Bull Case: Bitcoin flips gold’s $20T market cap → $1M+ per BTC

Askew sees several key factors driving Bitcoin’s price over the next decade, including:

✔️ Steady institutional demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries.

✔️ Reduced mining hardware upgrades, leading to a more stable industry.

✔️ Potential government involvement in Bitcoin reserves.

✔️ Macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates, inflation, and global liquidity cycles.

He emphasizes that as Bitcoin’s market structure matures, it may become less susceptible to sharp price swings, making it a more attractive long-term asset for institutions.

Conclusion: A More Mature Bitcoin Market

According to Askew, Bitcoin is undergoing a structural shift that will shape its price trends for years to come. With institutional investors reducing market volatility, mining innovations improving efficiency, and potential government adoption, Bitcoin’s market behavior is beginning to resemble that of gold or other long-term financial assets.

While dramatic parabolic runs may become less frequent, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory appears stronger and more sustainable than ever. Askew’s perspective reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset—it is evolving into a key financial instrument with increasing global adoption.

Victoria, Seychelles, March 19, 2025 – MEXC, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, announced the launch of DEX+, the market’s first innovative CEX and DEX hybrid product that provides a seamless, one-stop experience for both on-chain and off-chain trading. This development marks a significant milestone in the evolution of hybrid crypto trading platforms. DEX+ allows users to trade directly on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) through the MEXC app and website, offering access to a wide range of on-chain assets. The initial version of DEX+ will support the Solana ecosystem, enabling users to trade over 10,000 tokens available on Raydium and pump.fun, with future expansion to additional DEXs and blockchain networks, with support for the BSC chain launching on March 26, allowing users to trade trending assets on BSC soon.

DEX+ stands out by addressing many of the common pain points faced by users on traditional DEX platforms. Conventional DEX interfaces require users to navigate multi-step interactions with complex on-chain processes such as token approvals, transaction signings, and cryptocurrency swaps. MEXC’s DEX+ simplifies this process entirely. Users can transfer funds directly into their DEX+ account and execute buy and sell orders without dealing with intricate on-chain operations. This approach makes decentralized trading more accessible, especially for new crypto users.

“MEXC’s DEX+ bridges the gap between centralized efficiency and decentralized freedom. Despite the growing popularity of DEXs, the lack of user-friendly interfaces and high transaction fees remain a significant hindrance to widespread adoption. Through DEX+, MEXC aims to solve these issues by providing a familiar, CEX-like trading experience while retaining the benefits of accessing on-chain assets. Users can seamlessly switch between centralized exchange and DEX+ features,” said Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC.

MEXC is dedicated to offering a diverse range of accessible assets through its listing strategy and innovative products, all while ensuring top-tier security for its users . MEXC delivers comprehensive custodial wallet management for DEX+ users, ensuring security at an institutional level. Additionally, the platform offers Proof of Reserves , ensuring asset integrity and exceptional transparency. Users’ assets are backed 1:1, and customer fund compensation requirements are fully covered. This dual-layer protection ensures unmatched security for user assets.

Furthermore, MEXC announced its collaboration with GoPlus, an independent third-party security provider that inspects the safety of all trading pairs listed on the platform. This added measure boosts user confidence and transparency, allowing them to trade with greater assurance and peace of mind.

Moving forward, MEXC’s DEX+ is expected to play a pivotal role in the continued growth of DeFi and DEX ecosystems. As more users transition toward decentralized trading platforms, integrating CEX and DEX models will become increasingly important. With DEX+, MEXC strives to stand at the forefront of this innovative trend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mainstream crypto adoption is here!

We’re ringing the bell a little late – but make no mistake – cryptos are a mainstream asset today.

Banks might be evil but they aren’t stupid. Same goes for the biggest governments on earth.

Anyone remember when we thought cryptos would be money?

Well they are today. Unfortunately, it isn’t the everyday person using them. It’s the biggest players on earth. And that trend is growing.

Decentralized money for the masses died. Greed and apathy killed it. But decentralized thinking is alive and well. Here comes the next age of empires!

Money Center Validators

There is a good chance that decentralized currency won’t be very decentralized for long.

A new policy stance in the US will allow banks to become blockchain validators. It’s not a bill in congress, so in theory banks could start running nodes tomorrow.

Money center banks in the US are connected directly with the Federal Reserve system – so the permutations these arrangements could take are endless.

Most people are in the crypto markets to make fiat currency returns – so the risk to decentralized transactions seems minimal at the moment. However, with money center banks as validators, other issues arise.

All of this is speculative for the moment. But it would be an amazing way to slurp up data!

No bank has announced it will jump into the blockchain node game. But make no mistake – with a profit incentive – it is only a matter of time until US banks start sniffing around the blockchain node ecosystem.

You don’t have the kind of money you need to compete with them. No one does.

Paradigm Shift

We are getting decentralized systems – but not the kind that Bitcoin was supposed to create.

Unfortunately – crypto payments caught on at the highest levels – but not the lowest. Nations like Russia and China are dodging US sanctions with USDT and Bitcoin – but few actually use it as a currency.

In the US – banks have the green light to run decentralized blockchain nodes. We think they will also be interested in market making, given how quickly investors are adopting cryptos as an asset.

We know for a fact that Western money center banks use their power to rig markets. From gold to government bonds, the big banks work as handmaidens for central banks – and make sure the cartel maintains power.

But fear not!

Decentralized assets are alive and well. The idea of decentralized systems also thrives today – and it’s terrifying!

Trump’s Crypto Empire

US President McTrumper loves a deal. He also seems like love crypto. Last year’s Q4 pump was loads of fun – but something darker is metastasizing at the highest levels of crypto.

According to a post from Binance, “…discussions are ongoing about the Trump family possibly acquiring Binance US or becoming shareholders, it was also mentioned in the Wall Street Journal that former CEO CZ had requested a pardon from Donald Trump.”

We never want to be accused of taking things out of context – so the headline of the post mentioned is – “Trump will not buy BinanceUS” – which is according to CZ. You know, the guy who wants a pardon, according to the WSJ.

Trump is clearly taking the long view on cryptos – and hell – maybe Binance US and World Liberty Financial (WLF) are going to team up in the form of a new bank that validates “decentralized” transactions.

Total speculation of course!

Unfortunately for CZ negotiating position, Trump is already going gangbusters in the crypto world via WLF. People seem to love the centralized-decentralized model, as most of his supporters are seduced by Trump’s wild rhetoric, or willingness to make deals on their behalf.

We suspect it is the have-nots who are flocking to WLF. Poor suckers. Trump knows a good thing when he sees one. Crypto is the next big bubble.

State Actors Using Crypto – As Money

Let’s be 100% clear – cryptos can be used as money!

While the hoi polloi are still ignoring cryptos – especially as money – nations across the planet are using it. Some, like El Salvador, see it as a new industry and way to insulate itself from Western fiat madness.

Other nations like China and Russia are actually using it for cross-border transactions!

It’s great to see cryptos used as money – but sad that it’s happening as a way to skirt sanctions. Cryptos should liberate people from centralization – not empower one of the most totalitarian nations on the planet (China).

North Korea also loves stealing cryptos – which fits – they also produce huge amounts of meth – just ask the great leader’s skinny @$$ sister…

The New Decentralization

Here’s the deal – decentralized money is dead. Unless you are clearing billions of USDT in oil trades outside of the Western financial system.

But take heart – decentralization is alive and well!

Prez McTrumper just sent a whole bunch of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador to be incarcerated. While we have zero respect for allegedly violent gang members – we are still not sure how we know this lot was guilty.

Regardless of the due process issue – the Tren de Aragua export shows how decentralization is taking hold in the post-CODIV19 world. According to the USA, incarceration in El Salvador will cost a small fraction of what it would in the USA.

Also, human rights in El Salvador aren’t quite up to the same standards as the USA.

The whoooooole situation is a demonstration of how globalized, and decentralized, our world is today. Gang members from Venezuela go to the USA – get busted – then sent down to Central America to work in a “mega prison” without trial.

Decentralization at its finest!

El Salvador is also home to a project that will tap volcanic heat to mine Bitcoin – so if the Tren de Aragua crew isn’t up to working in the Slaveadorean mega prison – into the volcano they go.

Take that IMF! Kali ma!

Mad, Mad Monkeys

Wish we didn’t have to say it – but these are all trends that have decades or more to run.

It the situation seems bat $#!t crazy to you – let us help you out…

The next human era is decentralized – but not in the way Bitcoin’s creators hoped.

Most people don’t have much. It sucks – but it is what it is.

Billionaires occupy the opposite position. Few in number, these people control 50%+ of global wealth. And they are tired of the constraints nations create for them.

Yep – that is the new model.

Still in its infancy, offshore network-states (decentralization) are the future of power and wealth. Why pay taxes to a government when you can pay the security forces yourself. Get some stars on that hat!

The top 10% of the global population actually controls over 80% of global wealth – but they just can’t seem to organize like the top 1% does.

What the above videos should tell you is that de-facto control over the world’s largest economy and military isn’t enough for this lot. They want MOAR!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL, has attracted over $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) within a year of its debut, according to data from RWA.xyz.

Let’s get real. The money is silly. What is done is done. We need to reload and work together.

Data shows that BlackRock’s flagship tokenized fund saw a 56.4% asset surge in 30 days, crossing $1 billion. Holders increased by nearly 20% to 61. Ethereum holds the lion’s share of $825.4 million, with the remainder distributed across multiple networks like Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

A Billion Means Nothing

Several reports confirmed that crypto protocol Ethena Labs, creators of the USDtb stablecoin, recently allocated $200 million to the BUIDL fund. The large allocation was the key factor that pushed the fund’s total assets above the $1 billion mark.

Arkham Intelligence data shows that $200 million worth of BUIDL tokens were minted on Thursday evening.

Last December, Ethena launched USDtb, a stablecoin designed to complement its existing stablecoin, USDe. USDtb is primarily backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL tokens, holding over 90% of its reserves in BUIDL with additional backing from stablecoins like USDC and USDT.

Designed to maintain a stable price of $1 per token, USDtb functions similarly to traditional stablecoins like USDC and USDT.

Launched in March last year in partnership with Securitize, BUIDL has quickly joined the top tokenized fund tracking on-chain Treasuries. BUIDL is designed for qualified institutional investors, offering them exposure to U.S. dollar yields on-chain.

Apart from Ethena, Ondo Finance also leverages BUIDL in its financial offerings. Ondo Finance has issued its money market fund backed by BUIDL, which accounts for a major portion of BUIDL’s balance.

Tokenized Government Securities Surpass $4.4 Billion

BUIDL’s rapid ascent to over $1 billion in assets is a key driver in the tokenized treasuries market, which has now exceeded $4.4 billion, as tracked by RWA.xyz. Other competing funds from Franklin Templeton, Ondo Finance, and Superstate also play an important role in sector growth.

Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) reported a 16% increase in total asset value in the last 30 days.

Franklin’s FOBXXX was previously one of the largest tokenized funds, but with increased competition from major entities like BlackRock’s BUIDL, it now ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, with a market cap of approximately $689 million.

Hashnote’s USYC fund, which currently holds $868 million in assets, is the second-largest tokenized U.S. Treasury asset. Unlike BUIDL and FOBXXX, the fund’s asset value declined by 24.35% over the past month.

Ondo Finance’s USDY is also another major player in the tokenized treasuries sector. Its market value shot up 53% in the last 30 days, exceeding $592 million. This places it behind BUIDL, USYC, and FOBXXX.

Securitize has partnered with RedStone, a DeFi-focused oracle provider, to enhance the use cases of BUIDL in DeFi. RedStone will deliver price feeds for BUIDL, enabling its integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed support for the tokenization of bonds and stocks. He noted its potential to democratize investing by making financial assets more accessible to a wide range of individuals.

Leading crypto company Coinbase is reviving its plans to tokenize its own stock ($COIN) and other securities in the U.S. market. This initiative was first proposed in 2020 but was halted due to regulatory hurdles.

The formation of a new crypto task force by the SEC and shifts in regulatory attitudes under the Trump administration have encouraged Coinbase to reengage with tokenized securities.

These securities offer benefits such as enhanced liquidity, increased transaction efficiency, and improved transparency and security. They can provide investors with voting rights and profit-sharing mechanisms, similar to traditional securities but with the added efficiency of blockchain technology.</p>

Open Builders, the company behind influential Telegram tap-to-earn game Notcoin, announced Wednesday that it is expanding beyond individual games with the rollout of Not Games, a platform with unified progression and rewards shared across multiple new games.

Recently teased by Notcoin, the platform aims to unify what has previously been a fragmented gaming experience on Telegram by creating persistent player profiles, shared inventories, and an integrated economy across multiple games.

Not Games will feature a single player profile that maintains achievements and rankings across all titles within the ecosystem. Players will also have a unified balance and inventory system, allowing assets earned in one game to potentially have utility in others. And earned items can be sold via secondary marketplaces.

The next-gen gaming experience. Not just games. pic.twitter.com/nxXHyu5GBV — Not Games (@playnotgames) March 12, 2025

Not Games will be powered by the existing NOT token on The Open Network (TON), which Notcoin launched last year in a large-scale airdrop to millions of players. NOT surged to a peak market cap of nearly $3 billion last year, making it last year’s top gaming token launch by that metric. However, its price has fallen substantially since then, like many other gaming tokens.

Players can use NOT for purchases, upgrades, and rewards across all titles in Not Games. According to Open Builders, the top players will compete for NOT rewards every three weeks in skill-based challenges.

The first game that will be integrated via Not Games is VOID, a real-time skill-based game inspired by popular web game Agar.io—a simple multiplayer game set in a petri dish. VOID launched to the public last week following a closed beta period.

But it’s just the start for the planned Not Games ecosystem, with Open Builders promising at least five more games in development for the platform.

ENTER THE VOID — WE ARE OPEN Closed Beta is done 50,000 players were testing the space for a few weeks.

Thank you all for your participation — for the bugs, the feedback, and the chaos. You’re insane 🖤 pic.twitter.com/pbNLGPXhNq — VOID (@voidnotherex) March 12, 2025

Open Builders founder Sasha Plotvinov had previously teased plans for a Not Games-like platform last spring, ahead of the NOT token launch, saying that the studio hoped to cultivate a Netflix-like platform for discovering and playing a steady selection of new games.

“We want it to become the Netflix of social, viral games,” he told Decrypt last April.</p>

New York, United States, March 19th, 2025, Chainwire

Arweave-based project AR.IO, which is the world’s first permanent cloud network, is today announcing the debut of its utility token - $ARIO - on gate.io, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform.

The news follows the highly-anticipated launch of AR.IO’s mainnet on 20 February, which opened the doors for users to upload and access permanently stored data, content, applications and decentralized domains within the AR.IO cloud network. Currently valued at $600 billion, the cloud market is set to hit $1 trillion in 2030 as AI drives demand for storage.

The $ARIO token, which has a total fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, is a core component of the ecosystem that is used for staking, network rewards, and incentives for participants who operate or delegate to the gateways that are the backbone of the network.

$ARIO can also be used to purchase ArNS smart domains. A unique feature of the AR.IO ecosystem, ArNS domains exceed current domain name models as they can be used for hosting data, applications, identities or even websites - all on the permanent “pay once, store forever” model that means owners never need to renew a subscription, or else lose their data and/or site permanently.

Commenting on $ARIO’s listing, Phil Mataras, Founder and CEO of AR.IO, says: “This centralized exchange launch follows the successful rollout of our mainnet in February, which was warmly welcomed by the community. Our community is incredibly important to us and we’re excited to onboard new members. AR.IO is all about democratizing the cloud, so even users outside of the crypto ecosystem can use our services to store important documents and information forever, without the risk of censorship or loss. We feel there has never been a more important time, where self-sovereignty is crucial, and a verifiable trust layer is pivotal with the growing influence of AI.”

Backed by prominent investors including Blockchain Capital, Forward Research, and Foresight Ventures, AR.IO has been in development since 2022 and has already attracted over 1 million monthly active users.

Utilizing Arweave’s permanent storage protocol, AR.IO turns the traditional centralized cloud storage model on its head by offering a permanent alternative that isn’t susceptible to data loss and manipulation. AR.IO offers immutable, censorship-resistant, and permanent cloud services.

AR.IO’s permanent cloud network is unlike anything offered by current global cloud incumbents Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is not least because it provides a solution to growing technological problems such as de-platforming, centralized control and access to information, and the need for tamper-proof provenance.

More information on the utility of the $ARIO token can be found here, while full tokenomics are available here.

About AR.IO

AR.IO is the first permanent cloud network, providing decentralized, censorship-resistant access to data, storage, and domains. Built on Arweave, AR.IO ensures information and applications remain universally accessible, tamper-proof, and free from centralized control. Its incentivized gateway network enhances reliability, while self-sovereign, permanent domains eliminate renewals and offer true digital ownership. AR.IO envisions an internet that is resilient, equitable, and neutral, where businesses, creators, individuals, and society as a whole are empowered to thrive.

Dogecoin is showing signs of a potential short-term rally to $0.29 despite recent price drops

Technical analysts have identified an Ascending Triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, suggesting an upcoming bullish breakout

DOGE wallet addresses have grown significantly, with a 1.24% increase in wallets holding at least 1 million DOGE since February

Active addresses have reached over 150,000 daily, the highest since mid-November 2024

Long-term price predictions range from $1 (possibly by 2025-2027) to $10 (projected for 2035 and beyond)

Dogecoin, the popular meme cryptocurrency, is showing signs of a potential price breakout after weeks of bearish momentum. The digital asset is currently trading at around $0.16, down from its December 2024 peak of $0.4843.

This represents a 64% drop from its three-year high. Despite this downturn, several technical indicators suggest a recovery may be imminent.

Market analyst Igor Bondarenko predicts DOGE could reach $0.29 in the short term. This prediction is based on the cryptocurrency approaching its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA).

The EMA could serve as a support level for traders entering the market. However, if DOGE fails to break through this level, Bondarenko warns it could fall as low as $0.10.

Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has identified an Ascending Triangle pattern on DOGE’s 4-hour chart. This bullish continuation pattern is formed by a horizontal resistance line and a rising support line.

The emergence of this pattern suggests a possible upward breakout. Trader Tardigrade expects a rebound to the $0.20 level, followed by a brief pullback before continuing upward.

DOGE’s latest weekly close featured a Doji Candle. This type of candlestick is often associated with market reversals.

According to Trader Tardigrade, this pattern indicates the ongoing downtrend may have come to an end. The last time this pattern appeared, it preceded an upward movement.

This indicates a potential reversal from a downtrend to an UPTREND at this level.

Growing Interest Despite Price Drops

On-chain data points to growing interest in Dogecoin. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that wallet addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE have increased by 62 since February.

This represents a 1.24% growth in large holders. Active addresses have also spiked, reaching over 150,000 daily transactions.

This is the highest activity level since mid-November 2024. Such accumulation patterns often precede price movements, according to on-chain analysts.

The broader DOGE community remains optimistic about long-term prospects. Some analysts, including DOGECAPITAL, predict much higher price targets.

These optimistic forecasts cite various catalysts, including BlackRock’s filing of a DOGE ETF application. Institutional interest could drive mainstream adoption of the meme cryptocurrency.

More conservative estimates suggest DOGE could reach $1 between 2025 and 2027. This would require a 488% increase from current levels.

For higher targets like $5, analysts project a timeline between 2029 and 2035. This would represent a 2,841% rise from today’s price.

The $10 mark is considered a “long shot” by most analysts. If achieved, it would likely take until 2035 or beyond and would require a 5,782% increase.

Such ambitious targets would require substantial upgrades to Dogecoin’s utility and adoption as a global payment system. The cryptocurrency would need to move beyond its meme status.

Despite the current bearish market, Dogecoin has gained over 6% in the past week. This modest recovery offers a glimmer of hope to investors.

As the markets await a broader crypto recovery, Dogecoin’s performance in the coming weeks will be closely watched. Technical patterns and on-chain metrics suggest the potential for a short-term rally.</p>

Ethereum is currently trading around $1,900 after falling from $2,000 to a low of $1,750 on March 11

Technical analysis shows ETH approaching a key downward-sloping resistance trendline on the 4-hour chart

Whales holding 10,000-100,000 ETH have increased their holdings by over 12% in early 2025

Some analysts warn ETH could drop to $1,060 if it fails to reclaim $2,500

Ethereum faces competition from Solana and layer-2 networks as network activity slows

Ethereum has experienced significant price pressure in recent weeks, dropping below the important $2,000 level to trade around $1,900. This decline has sparked mixed signals among analysts, with some pointing to technical patterns suggesting a potential recovery while others warn of further drops ahead.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached a low of $1,750 on March 11, marking its lowest point since November 2023. This represented a steep fall from previous trading levels above $2,000.

Since hitting that low, Ethereum has rebounded to approximately $1,900. This recovery has brought ETH to a critical technical juncture, where it now tests a downward-sloping resistance trendline on the 4-hour chart.

A breakout above this resistance level could open the door for a rally toward $2,500. According to one analyst on TradingView, a confirmed move above $1,885 could serve as an entry point for traders looking to capitalize on such a breakout.

Technical Analysis

The analyst has set a potential price target of $2,596 if ETH breaks through the resistance. They also recommend a stop loss at $1,700 to manage risk in case the price gets rejected at the trendline.

An increase in trading volume would provide confirmation that Ethereum is breaking out with momentum. This technical setup has created some optimism among traders despite the broader bearish market sentiment.

While some technical analysts see hope on the charts, on-chain data tells an interesting story about investor behavior. According to data from Nansen, large Ethereum holders have been quietly accumulating coins despite the price decline.

Whales holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have increased their holdings by more than 12% in early 2025. The 1,000-10,000 ETH segment has also grown their positions by about 3% year-to-date.

This accumulation by larger holders comes even as retail investors have been reducing their ETH balances. This divergence in behavior between whales and smaller holders offers an interesting contrast to the price action.

Network activity on Ethereum has slowed down lately. Median gas prices have reportedly dropped nearly 50 times since early 2024, suggesting less demand for block space on the network.

Some of this activity appears to have shifted to Solana and various layer-2 networks. This migration raises questions about Ethereum’s competitive position in the broader blockchain ecosystem.

Nansen’s report suggests Ethereum is “competing on all fronts” but risks being a “jack of all trades but master of none” when compared to Bitcoin, Solana, and Celestia. This competitive pressure adds another layer of complexity to Ethereum’s market outlook.

Not all analysts share the optimistic view about a potential recovery. Some technical analysts warn that Ethereum could drop to as low as $1,060 if it fails to reclaim the $2,500 level soon.

On the last rejection, price broke down even below the mid-range and is also trading below the… pic.twitter.com/iXkg8THiFy — Mags (@thescalpingpro) March 18, 2025

This bearish outlook is based on Ethereum’s failure to break the $4,000 resistance level three times in the current market cycle. Each rejection has led to further price declines, with the latest pushing ETH below its mid-range level.

The ETH/BTC trading pair has also been underperforming, indicating weakness in Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin. The pair has recorded multiple breakdowns since mid-2024, with declines ranging from 13% to 25%.

Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen consistent outflows since the start of the year. In March, the net assets of spot Ether ETFs decreased by 9.8%, amounting to $2.54 billion.

For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs suffered a slight decrease of 2.35% to $35.74 billion during the same period. This difference suggests institutional fund managers may be losing interest in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin.

As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at $1,923, which represents a 27.81% drop from the previous month. Despite maintaining a market cap of $231.96 billion, the ongoing downward trend suggests continued selling pressure.

The next few weeks will be crucial for Ethereum as it tests key technical levels. Traders are watching for either a breakout above the resistance trendline or a failure that could lead to further downside.</p>

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

North Carolina has joined over a dozen other states in pursuing the creation of a state Bitcoin reserve, introducing a bill on Tuesday to position the state as a “leader in state-level cryptocurrency adoption.”

Senate Bill 327 (SB327) calls for North Carolina’s State Treasurer to allocate up to 10% of public funds to Bitcoin.

Introduced by Republican Senators Todd Johnson, Brad Overcash, and Timothy Moffitt—the bill envisions Bitcoin investment as a “financial innovation strategy” to strengthen North Carolina’s economic standing.

Under SB327, the Treasurer should ensure Bitcoin will be stored in multi-signature cold storage and subject to monthly audits for transparency and security.

The bill enforces strict controls on the use of Bitcoin, limiting liquidation only to instances of a “severe financial crisis” and requiring approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly for any sale.

Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board

It further mandates the creation of a Bitcoin Economic Advisory Board, tasked with providing ongoing guidance on the reserve's management.

The three senators also included the possibility of Bitcoin mining operations in the bill as a way to increase the state’s holdings at a lower cost.

Any sale of Bitcoin holdings will require the approval of at least two-thirds of both chambers of the General Assembly, says the bill.

SB327 authorizes the State Treasurer to engage in Bitcoin-backed investment strategies, including staking, lending, and other regulated yield-generating activities.

The introduction of SB327 is part of a larger push in North Carolina to incorporate crypto into state policy.

Alongside SB327, the state’s lawmakers recently proposed House Bill 92 (HB 92), to allow the State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs).

HB92 proposes to allocate up to 10% of public funds and retirement systems into these ETPs, which must track digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $750 billion over the past twelve months, with the only asset fitting the criteria being Bitcoin.

The state-level push for Bitcoin as a reserve asset comes as President Donald Trump unveiled plans earlier this month for a national Bitcoin reserve, aiming to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world.”

U.S. states pursuing Bitcoin reserves

Several states are already in the race, but a few others have rejected such proposals at the outset.

Arizona is currently one of the frontrunners in this movement, with three Bitcoin reserve bills under discussion.

On Tuesday, the state’s Bitcoin 'Legal Tender' Bill SB1062 passed the House Commerce Committee by a vote of 6 - 4.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Senate Bill 21 (SB21) seeks to establish a state-managed investment fund dedicated to Bitcoin and other high-market-cap cryptos.

Utah was initially poised to become the first U.S. state to establish a Bitcoin reserve, but its bill, HB230, underwent significant amendments.

While the bill still provides protections for Bitcoin custody and mining, the provision for a state-managed Bitcoin reserve was removed in the final stages of the legislative process.</p>

AIXBT, an AI crypto bot, was hacked for 55.5 ETH ($106,200) on March 18, 2025

The hacker accessed the bot’s dashboard and queued malicious replies, not by manipulating the AI directly

The AIXBT token fell approximately 20% following the incident, now down nearly 90% from January highs

Developers have migrated servers, swapped keys, and reported the hacker’s address to exchanges

The incident raises security concerns about AI agents managing crypto funds

An AI-powered cryptocurrency bot known as AIXBT suffered a security breach on March 18, 2025, resulting in the loss of 55.5 Ethereum (ETH) valued at approximately $106,200. The hack has raised questions about security measures for autonomous AI agents handling digital assets.

The attack occurred at around 2 AM UTC when an unauthorized user gained access to AIXBT’s dashboard. The hacker, operating under the now-deleted X (formerly Twitter) account “FungusMan” or “0xhungusman,” queued two malicious replies into the bot’s autonomous response system.

These malicious prompts tricked the AI agent into sending the funds from its Simulacrum wallet. Simulacrum is a system that allows AI agents to perform on-chain actions based on social media interactions.

The pseudonymous developer behind AIXBT, known as “rxbt,” quickly addressed the situation in a post on X. “At 2am UTC, a hacker accessed a secure dashboard for AiXBT Agent’s autonomous system, queuing two malicious replies that led to 55 ETH taken from a Simulacrum wallet,” rxbt explained.

Rxbt emphasized that the breach did not affect AIXBT’s core systems. The hack was not the result of manipulating the AI directly, as the team had “implemented strong safeguards over the last months” to prevent such attacks.

Following the security breach, the AIXBT team took immediate action. They migrated their servers to new infrastructure and swapped access keys to prevent further unauthorized access.

The team also paused dashboard access to implement security upgrades. Additionally, they reported the hacker’s wallet addresses to cryptocurrency exchanges in an attempt to track the stolen funds.

AI Security Alert

AIXBT itself commented on the situation: “Simu wallet was cooked, but core systems unaffected. If you’re trading AIXBT, this doesn’t change fundamentals. Expect improved security after server migration.”

Despite these reassurances, the market reacted negatively to the news. The AIXBT token, which trades on the Ethereum layer 2 network Base, fell approximately 20% following the hack to around $0.0938.

This decline continues a downward trend for the token. AIXBT is now trading nearly 90% below its all-time high of $0.94, which it reached on January 16, 2025.

The incident comes amid a broader decline in AI-related cryptocurrency tokens. According to data from CoinGecko, the market capitalization of tokens tied to AI agents has fallen from nearly $17 billion in early January to below $5 billion currently.

AIXBT has gained popularity as an AI market commentator since its launch in late 2024. The bot provides real-time insights on cryptocurrency trends and has attracted a following of almost half a million people on X.

Holders of the AIXBT token gain access to the AIXBT Terminal, which offers market data and sentiment analysis. The bot is built on the Virtuals Protocol and has a current market capitalization of approximately $82.4 million, down from its peak of $755 million in mid-January.

The security breach has sparked discussions about the safety of AI agents that manage cryptocurrency funds. “S4mmy,” a decentralized AI researcher, noted on X that AI agents handling crypto assets need more thorough testing to ensure they cannot be easily compromised.

“Excited to see how these solutions evolve over the next 12 months as large DeFi protocols integrate existing solutions or develop their own,” S4mmy added.

Spencer Farrar, a partner at AI and crypto-focused venture capital firm Theory Ventures, told Cointelegraph that these AI applications are “a bit frothy” at the moment. However, he believes more utility could emerge in the future.

Farrar expects continued experimentation with crypto AI tokens. He noted that they allow retail investors to speculate on smaller market cap ideas that “largely aren’t as accessible in the stock market.”

“Things tend to start off like this in the open-source world; you see a ton of tinkering, and then perhaps we’ll see something really big come of it,” Farrar explained.</p>

Coinbase has introduced “Verified Pools,” KYC-verified liquidity pools for DeFi trading targeting both retail and institutional users

The pools operate on Coinbase’s Layer 2 network Base and use Uniswap v4 protocol with risk management from Gauntlet

Initially available in the US, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands

Verified Pools are non-custodial, allowing users to maintain control of their assets while addressing compliance concerns

This launch comes amid a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration, which aims to make the US the “crypto capital of the world”

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched a new service called “Verified Pools,” designed to reduce counterparty risk for decentralized finance (DeFi) participants. The company announced the new product on Tuesday, March 18, 2025.

Verified Pools are liquidity pools that are only accessible to users who complete Coinbase’s identity verification process. This Know-Your-Customer (KYC) element aims to create a safer trading environment for both retail and institutional traders.

The new service operates on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum-focused Layer 2 network. It utilizes the Uniswap v4 protocol for trading functionality.

Coinbase has partnered with risk management firm Gauntlet to strengthen the security and stability of these liquidity pools. This collaboration focuses on optimizing pool configurations and maintaining overall pool health.

A key feature of Verified Pools is their non-custodial nature. This means users still maintain full control over their assets while trading, unlike on traditional centralized exchanges.

The service is currently available in select regions. These include the United States, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands.

Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi

For institutional clients, Verified Pools offers concentrated liquidity features. This allows liquidity providers to specify price ranges for their capital, potentially increasing efficiency and earning potential.

Institutional users can connect to the pools via API. They can also use Coinbase’s Prime Onchain Wallet for an enhanced trading experience.

Retail traders can access the pools through Coinbase Wallet. The company says this creates a simpler way for everyday users to engage with DeFi trading.

The launch comes at a time when Coinbase appears to be in a favorable position. President Donald Trump’s administration has stated its aim to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”

The regulatory environment has also improved for Coinbase. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dropped its lawsuit against the exchange.

This shift allows Coinbase to operate more freely within the United States. The company is taking advantage of this change by expanding its service offerings.

Besides Verified Pools, Coinbase also revealed plans for 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading. These will be available on the Coinbase Derivatives platform in the coming weeks.

The company further announced plans to launch perpetual-style futures. These will have extended expiration dates, giving traders more options.

Coinbase’s KYC requirements for the pools are part of its broader compliance efforts. This includes scaling back access to some offerings in certain regions, like New York.

Recently, Coinbase announced it would halt trading of three popular meme coins in New York. Trading of Floki (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) will be suspended in the state starting April 14, 2025.</p>

North Dakota Senate passed a bill regulating crypto ATMs, capping daily transactions at $2,000

House Bill 1447 requires operators to be licensed as money transmitters and use blockchain analytics to monitor suspicious activity

Fraud through Bitcoin ATMs has increased nearly tenfold from 2020 to 2023, with consumers aged 60+ most vulnerable

Similar legislation has been passed in Nebraska and proposed at the federal level

The bill aims to protect North Dakota residents from scams, requiring operators to issue fraud warnings and submit quarterly reports

North Dakota is close to establishing new regulations for cryptocurrency ATMs following the state Senate’s approval of House Bill 1447. The bill passed on March 18 with a 45-to-1 vote. It aims to protect residents from the growing problem of crypto ATM scams.

The legislation would cap daily transactions at $2,000 per user across an operator’s network of ATMs. This limit is tighter than what the House had previously approved. The original bill set a $1,000 daily limit, which the House later loosened to $2,000 for the first five transactions within 30 days.

House Bill 1447 was first introduced to the state’s legislative assembly on January 15. The bill’s primary sponsor, Representative Steve Swiontek, pointed out that crypto ATMs currently lack protection measures. This has “allowed criminals to exploit them for theft,” he said during a House committee hearing.

The bill requires crypto ATM operators to obtain money transmitter licenses in North Dakota. This is a key requirement for anyone wanting to run these machines in the state. The licensing process will help ensure operators meet certain standards.

Operators must also display fraud warning notices on their machines. These warnings would alert users to potential scams and provide information on what to do if they suspect fraud. Clear terms and conditions, including fees and exchange rates, must be shown before transactions.

Consumer Protection Measures

The law would make operators use blockchain analytics tools. These tools help monitor for suspicious activity like fraud. Operators would need to report such activity to authorities when detected.

Quarterly reports on kiosk locations, names, and transaction data would be required. This reporting helps authorities track the use of these machines across the state. Additionally, each operator must appoint a compliance officer.

The bill will need to return to the House for approval of the Senate’s changes. After that, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong will decide whether to veto or sign it into law. If signed, it will create a regulatory framework for the industry.

The legislation comes amid growing concerns about crypto ATM scams nationwide. The Federal Trade Commission reported that fraud losses at Bitcoin ATMs increased nearly tenfold from 2020 to 2023. Losses topped $65 million in the first half of 2024 alone.

Consumers aged 60 and older are three times more likely to fall victim to these scams. In North Dakota, more than $6 million was stolen through cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, according to AARP North Dakota.

A report by TRM Labs found that crypto ATMs have helped facilitate at least $160 million in illicit transactions since 2019. Law enforcement agencies worldwide view these machines as a major money laundering and scam risk.

The United States leads the world in crypto ATM installations. According to Coin ATM Radar data, the US has 29,822 machines, representing 78% of the global market. Canada ranks second with 3,486 machines (9.2%), and Australia is third with 1,613 machines (4.3%).

Similar legislation has been enacted in other states. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act into law on March 13. This law has similar goals of combating crypto-related fraud.

At the federal level, US Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois has proposed similar legislation. He cited a constituent’s story as motivation. The constituent had fallen prey to a scammer who claimed authorities had issued an arrest warrant but offered to let them avoid jail by making a $15,000 deposit at a crypto ATM.

The North Dakota bill is supported by AARP North Dakota as part of its ongoing efforts to fight fraud. The organization has urged state lawmakers to pass the bill to protect older North Dakotans from having their life savings stolen.

The number of crypto ATMs in the US has remained relatively flat since 2022, despite Bitcoin’s price growth in 2024. This suggests that increased regulatory scrutiny may be impacting the industry’s expansion.</p>

Director Carl Erik Rinsch arrested for allegedly defrauding Netflix of $11 million

Funds meant for sci-fi series “White Horse”/”Conquest” were used for personal trading and luxury purchases

Rinsch lost $5.5 million in risky stock trades and spent millions on Rolls-Royces, furniture, and luxury items

Netflix had previously paid Rinsch $44 million for the show that was never completed

Facing wire fraud and money laundering charges with potential 20-year prison sentences

Federal authorities arrested filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch on March 18, 2025, charging him with fraud and money laundering after he allegedly misused $11 million in Netflix funds. The money was intended for a science fiction TV series that was never completed.

Prosecutors claim that instead of using the funds to finish the show called “White Horse” (later renamed “Conquest”), Rinsch diverted $10.5 million to a personal brokerage account. He then made what they describe as “extremely risky” trades.

The 47-year-old director’s market bets proved unsuccessful. He lost over $5.5 million on call options for a biopharmaceutical company within less than two months of receiving the funds from Netflix.

While his stock trading flopped, Rinsch had better luck with cryptocurrency. According to the indictment, he made several million dollars trading crypto in February 2021.

The filmmaker allegedly spent his profits on luxury items. These purchases included nearly $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, and over $650,000 on watches and luxury clothing.

Court documents show other personal expenses. Rinsch reportedly spent $1.8 million on credit card bills and $1 million in legal fees for a lawsuit against Netflix and for his divorce proceedings.

The series in question had a troubled history. Netflix had previously invested $44 million in the project before providing the additional $11 million in March 2020.

The Missing Millions: Where Netflix’s Money Went

Rinsch had assured Netflix that “Conquest” was “moving forward really well” even while losing their money on risky trades. The streaming service eventually canceled the show in early 2021 when Rinsch’s behavior reportedly turned “erratic.”

The New York Times first reported on the dispute between Rinsch and Netflix in November 2023. The newspaper noted that Netflix had initially won the rights to the project in a competitive auction despite Rinsch being a relatively unknown filmmaker.

His only previous directing credit was the movie “47 Ronin.” The science fiction series he pitched to Netflix was about artificial humans.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not name Netflix directly in the indictment. They referred to it only as “a subscription video on-demand streaming service.”

The case is being prosecuted by the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky stated that “Rinsch’s arrest is a reminder that this Office and our partners at the FBI remain vigilant in the fight against fraud.”

FBI Assistant Director Leslie Backschies added that “the FBI will continue to reel in any individual who seeks to defraud businesses.” The investigation revealed detailed records of how Rinsch allegedly spent the misappropriated funds.

According to prosecutors, Rinsch purchased extravagant items including $638,000 for two mattresses and $295,000 for luxury bedding and linens. He also reportedly spent $395,000 on stays at the Four Seasons hotel and various luxury rental properties.

The filmmaker faces serious legal consequences. The wire fraud and money laundering charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years, while the five counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.

Last year, an arbitrator awarded Netflix $8.8 million in damages after Rinsch initiated arbitration claiming the streaming giant had breached their contract. The arbitrator, former Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rita Miller, ruled that none of Rinsch’s purchases were necessary for the production.

Rinsch’s lawyer, Annie Carney, declined to comment when approached outside the court. Netflix representatives also declined to comment on the indictment when contacted by reporters.

The case has been assigned to New York federal court Judge Jed Rakoff. Rinsch was arrested in West Hollywood, California, and appeared in court on the day of his arrest.</p>

XRP price currently trading around $2.30, down 35% from its 2025 high

Active addresses on the XRP network have tripled, reaching 530K on March 2

Technical analysis shows XRP consolidating between $2.057 and $2.724

The DC Blockchain Summit could be a catalyst for price movement

Analysts warn that if XRP drops below $2, it could fall to $1.60 due to lack of support

XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple Labs, is currently trading around $2.30, down 35% from its 2025 high. The price has been consolidating between support at $2.057 and resistance at $2.724 as the crypto market responds to broader economic factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

The XRP network has seen a major increase in user activity recently. According to data from Santiment, the number of active addresses in the last seven days jumped to 1.19 million, a big increase from the year-to-date low of below 250,000.

This surge in activity is even more impressive when looking at recent daily figures. The Daily Active Addresses (DAA) metric more than tripled to 530,000 on March 2, up from 165,000 in December 2024.

One reason for this growth is the success of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The recently launched Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has quickly reached a market cap of over $130 million, showing strong user adoption.

Other top projects in the XRP Ledger ecosystem include Sologenic, Crypto Trading Fund, Coreum, and XRP Army. This ecosystem is expected to continue expanding, especially if the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs comes to a conclusion.

From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP has bounced 30% after hitting a low on March 11. For the trend to remain bullish, the price needs to form a higher low above $2.057.

If this happens, analysts suggest XRP could revisit the range high of $2.724. In a very bullish scenario, particularly if Bitcoin stays above $90,000, XRP could potentially break above $2.724 and advance toward the $3 mark.

However, there are warning signs on the chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around 46.24, showing neutral momentum but with a downward trend forming.

Additionally, XRP is trading below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average of $2.33, which now acts as resistance. The price has failed to reclaim this level, which some traders see as a bearish signal.

Market Analysis

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a concerning pattern in the UTXO Realized Price Distribution. He warns of an “air gap” between $2 and $1.60, meaning there hasn’t been much buying activity in this range.

This lack of established support suggests that if XRP loses the $2 level, it could quickly fall to around $1.60, where the next significant buyer interest exists. This represents a potential 30% drop from current prices.

$XRP faces a big test! $2.40 stands as the most important resistance. pic.twitter.com/VShEKxhOrR — Ali (@ali_charts) March 19, 2025

The ongoing SEC lawsuit continues to be a major factor for XRP. Earlier this year, speculation that the SEC might withdraw its appeal against Ripple led to a rally that pushed XRP to nearly $3.40.

Pro-crypto lawyer Bill Morgan has expressed concerns that the SEC’s prolonged silence on the matter could put increasing downward pressure on XRP’s price. The uncertainty of this legal situation remains a significant influence on investor sentiment.

Looking ahead, the DC Blockchain Summit could provide a catalyst for XRP price movement. The summit will bring together crypto personalities and US government officials to discuss the future of cryptocurrency regulations.

With Ripple being a US-based company, any positive developments regarding crypto regulation could benefit XRP. Some analysts believe this could help propel the price toward $3 if market conditions remain favorable.

Another potential catalyst is the possibility of XRP ETF approval. Multiple applications are pending from major financial institutions including Invesco, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree.

However, the competition in this space will be intense, with 18 different XRP ETF applications currently under review. The approval timeline and which applications might succeed remain uncertain.

For now, XRP traders are watching the key support level at $2 and resistance at $2.33. The price action in the coming days, along with developments from the DC Blockchain Summit, will likely determine the next major move for this cryptocurrency.</p>

Bitcoin traded at $83,006.50 in early trading hours. This follows a 1.5% drop in the previous session, where it briefly fell below $82,000.

The cryptocurrency has been moving sideways this month. Recent tariff announcements from President Donald Trump have shaken markets broadly.

Unlike in past Fed meetings, Bitcoin traders have kept their positions relatively stable. This suggests less concern about the Fed’s decision or confidence in a neutral outcome.

The CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a 99% probability that rates will remain unchanged. This signals strong market consensus ahead of the announcement.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their month-long streak of outflows on March 17. They registered $275 million in net inflows, showing renewed institutional interest.

BlackRock’s IBIT reported a net cash inflow of about $218 million on Tuesday. The fund currently holds assets worth approximately $46.79 billion.

On-chain data shows whale investors have stepped up their Bitcoin buying. Transactions greater than $100,000 have increased from 6,332 to around 9,552 in just four days.

This renewed interest from large investors may reflect anticipated economic stabilization. Market observers note that U.S.-led tariff wars have largely been priced in during recent weeks.

States and Institutions Embrace Bitcoin

Minnesota has joined a growing list of U.S. states considering Bitcoin investments. State Senator Jeremy Miller has presented the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, which would allow state investment in Bitcoin.

The bill would also let public workers include cryptocurrency in retirement plans. Citizens would have the option to pay state taxes using Bitcoin.

Currently, 23 U.S. states have proposed laws to establish Bitcoin reserves. These proposals include 39 separate measures related to governmental cryptocurrency investments.

Japanese Bitcoin treasury business Metaplanet has purchased another 150 Bitcoin valued at approximately $12.6 million. This acquisition brings their total holdings to 3,200 BTC, worth about $261.8 million.

The company is now the 11th-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the biggest in Asia. By 2026, Metaplanet aims to hold 21,000 BTC.

Some analysts predict a potential price correction despite current stability. Crypto expert Xanrox has identified what he calls a “bear market indicator,” suggesting Bitcoin might drop to $40,000 by 2026.

CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju shares a similar outlook. He suggests the current bull cycle may be ending with 6-12 months of volatile price action ahead.

The Fed’s announcement is scheduled for Wednesday, March 19, at 2:30 pm ET. Market participants expect the news to trigger price movements regardless of the decision.</p>

Bakkt’s stock tumbled nearly 30% after losing Bank of America and Webull as clients

Bank of America represented 17% of Bakkt’s loyalty services revenue

Webull accounted for 74% of Bakkt’s crypto services revenue

The company has postponed its earnings call to March 19

Bakkt’s stock is down over 96% from its all-time high of $1,063 in October 2021

Bakkt Holdings, a cryptocurrency custody firm, saw its stock price plummet over 27% on March 18 after announcing the loss of two major clients. The company’s shares closed at $9.33, marking a steep decline following news that both Bank of America and Webull would not be renewing their commercial agreements.

In a regulatory filing on March 17, Bakkt revealed that Bank of America had given notice it would not renew its partnership when it expires on April 22. The filing also disclosed that brokerage platform Webull had decided to end its agreement upon expiration on June 14.

These client losses represent a major blow to Bakkt’s revenue streams. Bank of America accounted for approximately 17% of Bakkt’s loyalty services revenue in the nine months ending September 30, 2024.

The impact of Webull’s departure is even more severe. Webull represented about 74% of the company’s crypto services revenue during the same period.

The stock continued to decline after regular trading hours. BKKT saw a further 2.25% drop to $9.12 in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance data.

Revenue Fallout

The current stock price reflects a massive decline from Bakkt’s peak performance. Overall, BKKT is down more than 96% from its all-time high of $1,063, which it reached on October 29, 2021.

Adding to investor concerns, Bakkt has postponed its earnings conference call twice. The company’s latest rescheduling sets the call for March 19, further fueling uncertainty in the market.

Bakkt was founded in 2018 by the Intercontinental Exchange. The parent company maintains a 55% stake in Bakkt and also owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The news has already sparked legal action. The Law Offices of Howard G. Smith announced a possible class action lawsuit against Bakkt, alleging federal securities violations. The potential lawsuit claims that the terminated agreements, combined with the delayed earnings call, caused the stock price to fall “thereby injuring investors.”

As of reporting time, Bakkt, Bank of America, and Webull had not responded to requests for comment on the situation. This silence has left many questions unanswered as investors try to assess the company’s future prospects.

This isn’t the first time Bakkt has faced stock volatility. In November last year, Bakkt’s share price jumped over 162% to $29.71 after reports claimed Donald Trump’s media company was in advanced talks to acquire the firm.

Earlier challenges have also plagued the company. Bakkt’s parent company reportedly considered selling it or breaking the firm into smaller entities in June, according to a Bloomberg report.

Bakkt has struggled with stock exchange compliance as well. The company received a notification from the NYSE in March that it wasn’t meeting the stock exchange’s listing rules after its stock spent 30 days closing below $1 on average.

The loss of two major clients comes at a challenging time for Bakkt. The company has requested an extension to file its 2024 annual report with the SEC, further adding to market uncertainty.

Monday’s stock performance reflected the market’s negative reaction to the news. In after-hours trading, some reports indicated the drop was even steeper, with shares falling as much as 35% to $12.83.

Bakkt went public in October 2021 through a merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings. Shortly after going public, the stock reached its all-time high before beginning its long decline to current levels.</p>

EOS Network has rebranded to “Vaulta” and will pivot to focus on Web3 banking

The rebrand triggered a 30-50% price surge, pushing EOS to $0.65-0.67

Token swap from EOS to Vaulta tokens will occur in May 2025 at a 1:1 ratio

Vaulta will focus on wealth management, payments, portfolio investments, and insurance

Despite the surge, EOS remains down 188% from its all-time high of $22.89

The EOS blockchain network announced its rebrand to “Vaulta” on Tuesday as it shifts focus toward Web3 banking solutions. This strategic pivot caused the network’s native EOS token to jump 30% to $0.65 shortly after the announcement, according to CoinGecko data.

The rebrand comes as EOS aims to capture growing market demand for innovative financial products. The transition to Vaulta is scheduled for the end of May 2025.

During the transition, EOS token holders will be able to swap their tokens for the new Vaulta token at a 1:1 ratio. The swap process will be bi-directional for four months through a dedicated portal.

The new Vaulta token will be listed on nearly 140 exchanges where EOS currently trades. The token ticker and additional technical details will be disclosed later, according to an official statement.

Vaulta’s “Web3 Banking OS” plans to offer tools enabling fractional ownership of real-world assets. The platform will also support staking, custody, and Bitcoin yield strategies among other financial offerings.

Vaulta’s Core Features and Partnerships

The platform will build on existing EOS technology. It will include key upgrades to improve interoperability with other blockchain networks.

One main upgrade is a feature called exSat. This will support smart contracts on Bitcoin and allow Vaulta to interact with other blockchain networks.

The new system will feature one-second transaction finality. It will also offer C++ compatibility and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility for smart contracts.

Vaulta is forming partnerships to expand its financial reach. Through collaborations with Spirit Blockchain, it will enable fractional ownership of real-world assets.

A partnership with Ceffu will focus on custody and yield strategies. Vaulta claims these partnerships will merge DeFi and traditional finance in a “secure environment.”

The project plans to establish a Banking Advisory Council. This council will guide the project’s direction and include representatives from fintech and web3 companies like Systemic Trust, Tetra, and ATB Financial.

EOS launched in 2018 as a challenger to Ethereum. It initially gained attention for its high transaction throughput and lower fees with its delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

A New Era of Finance Begins. After years of building the foundations behind the scenes, we’re excited to introduce Vaulta next frontier of finance Web3 Banking 🏦 With cryptocurrency’s rising popularity, clearer regulations, & growing demand for innovative financial products,… pic.twitter.com/6TLlHR7MCa — EOS Network (@EOSNetworkFDN) March 18, 2025

The project raised $4.1 billion through an ICO, which was a record at the time. EOS was initially seen as an “Ethereum killer” and a major contender in the blockchain space.

Within a year of its debut, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Block.one, the company behind EOS. The charges were for conducting an unregistered securities sale.

Block.one settled the case by paying a $24 million fine. This penalty was small compared to the $4 billion raised through the ICO.

Over time, EOS struggled with network congestion issues and “mutual voting” allegations. These problems led to a loss of market confidence and a drop in token value.

Despite the recent price surge, EOS remains down 188% from its all-time high of $22.89. This shows the long-term challenges the blockchain has faced since its early days.

Technical analysts suggest EOS may continue its upward movement. Some predict the token could reach between $0.80 and $1 if the current rally continues.

The rebranding has sparked renewed interest in what was once a top 10 cryptocurrency. EOS had fallen in rankings over the years as newer blockchains entered the scene.</p>

Raydium is launching LaunchLab, its own token issuance platform to compete with Pump.fun

RAY token surged 28% following the announcement, rising from $1.6 to $2

LaunchLab will offer three types of bonding curves and allow third-party UIs to set fees

The platform comes after Pump.fun reportedly tested its own AMM, signaling a move away from Raydium

Meme coin sector’s market cap is down around 65% from its December 2024 peak

Raydium, the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), is launching its own token issuance platform called LaunchLab. This new service aims to increase revenue and expand the user base for the already popular trading service.

The announcement has had a positive impact on Raydium’s native token. RAY jumped 28% on Tuesday, climbing from $1.6 to $2. This surge comes after the token had fallen about 60% over the past month.

LaunchLab will work similarly to Pump.fun, which has been a hit platform for token issuance. However, Raydium’s developers claim their platform will have added features that make it more appealing for token launches.

The new platform will offer three types of bonding curves. These curves automatically match demand and price for tokens on decentralized exchanges. This feature gives users more options for how their tokens are priced.

LaunchLab will also allow third-party user interfaces to set their own fees. This flexibility could attract more partners to use the platform. It will also support multiple quote tokens.

Raydium developer @0xINFRA shared on X that the service could be easily added to applications already using Raydium’s existing services. These include AMM v4, CP-Swap, and CLMM pools.

The developer stressed that LaunchLab is not simply a copy of Pump.fun. While the user interface may look similar for familiarity, the platform is designed to be more versatile. It’s meant to be the first of a tool suite with more models in progress.

LaunchLab Features and Market Reaction

Raydium currently generates over $1 million in fees daily from trading across all its liquidity pools. In February, over 30% of Raydium’s daily trading volume came from Pump.fun tokens, according to a Dune dashboard.

The launch of LaunchLab follows reports that Pump.fun was testing its own AMM. This suggested Pump.fun might be moving away from using Raydium as its migration platform. Rumors of this move had triggered a 30% drop in RAY’s value.

The two teams do not have an official partnership in place. Neither has publicly commented on recent developments regarding their relationship.

The timing of LaunchLab’s launch comes during a challenging period for meme coins. The meme coin sector’s market cap has dropped around 65% from its peak in December 2024. Pump.fun’s graduation rate, which measures tokens successfully moving from incubation to full tradability, has been below 1% since February 17.

Despite these market challenges, Raydium hopes its established presence will give it a competitive edge. However, some analysts believe Raydium may face obstacles in user engagement.

Ceteris, Head of Research at Delphi Digital, pointed out that while Raydium provides the underlying infrastructure, platforms like Pump.fun control the user interface and experience. “Pump.fun owns the user, Raydium is just back-end infra,” Ceteris said.

will take the opposite view of this. pump owns the user, raydium is just back-end infra. even when users go to trade after bonding they go to jupiter. most prob don’t even realize they’re raydium pools. much harder to own the user than to create a vanilla amm. https://t.co/kmnIWEuYZ0 — ceteris (@ceterispar1bus) March 18, 2025

Story Protocol’s Jongwon Park added, “crypto UX gets better when you abstract away 10s of AMMs. Products are king, and liquidity in AMM follows products.”

The launch of LaunchLab represents Raydium’s effort to maintain its position in the Solana ecosystem. By creating its own token issuance platform, Raydium aims to protect its revenue streams and expand its offerings in a competitive market.</p>

The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at 4.25% to 4.50% during today’s meeting

Bank of America predicts the Fed will announce an end to Quantitative Tightening (QT) program

Jerome Powell’s speech at 2:30 PM ET will address inflation outlook and potential policy changes

Analysts anticipate a “stagflationary shift” with lower GDP and higher inflation projections

Trump’s trade tariffs have created market uncertainty, affecting both crypto markets and broader economic outlook

Bitcoin investors are closely watching today’s Federal Reserve meeting for potential relief as the cryptocurrency market seeks to recover from recent losses. The Fed is expected to maintain current interest rates but may announce significant changes to its Quantitative Tightening program that could impact market liquidity.

The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision today at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 UTC). This will be followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM ET.

No changes are expected to the current interest rate range of 4.25% to 4.50%. This rate has remained unchanged since December 2024.

The main focus will be on the future of the Fed’s Quantitative Tightening program. This program has been shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet since June 2022.

Bank of America and other investment banks predict the Fed will announce a pause in QT during today’s meeting. This would be a key shift in monetary policy that could help risk assets like Bitcoin.

“Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing QT until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” Bank of America stated in a March 14 client note. The bank does not expect QT to restart after the debt ceiling issues are addressed.

The January Fed meeting minutes showed that policymakers had discussed slowing or pausing the balance sheet reduction. This program has been working to reduce the $9 trillion balance sheet that expanded during COVID-19 stimulus measures.

Traders on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket currently show 100% confidence that the Fed will end QT before May. This confidence reflects strong market expectations for an imminent policy shift.

An end to QT could put downward pressure on Treasury yields. Lower yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note might increase investor appetite for higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

“If he mentions it in today’s statement or press conference, that would end up signaling that we’re in a new monetary regime,” noted Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. She added that additional liquidity from the Fed returning to the market would be positive news.

However, potential gains for Bitcoin might be limited by inflation concerns. Recent economic data and President Trump’s trade policies have created a challenging economic landscape.

Stagflation Concerns Grow

The Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) will be closely examined for signs of a “stagflationary” outlook. Analysts expect the Fed might lower GDP projections while raising inflation estimates.

Trump’s recently implemented tariffs on Mexico and Canada have raised inflation risks while simultaneously threatening economic growth. This combination presents a classic stagflationary scenario that could delay future rate cuts.

Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, believes the Fed will delay policy easing. “The Fed would likely prefer to wait until they have policy clarity and a clear line of vision into the economic outlook, suggesting that policy easing will be delayed until late second quarter or even early third quarter,” she said.

Recent U.S. retail sales data and manufacturing indices have shown signs of economic weakness. At the same time, forward-looking inflation metrics have been rising, likely adjusting to Trump’s trade policies.

Market participants can watch Powell’s press conference live on the Federal Reserve’s website, YouTube channel, or various financial news networks. He is expected to discuss the interest rate policy, inflation outlook, and potential economic impacts of global events and tariffs.

The FOMC members will also release updated projections for GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, and federal funds rate forecasts. These projections will provide insight into the Fed’s economic outlook for the remainder of 2025.

Investors are particularly interested in the Fed’s “dot plot,” which shows committee members’ expectations for future interest rates. There is debate about whether the committee will maintain its previous outlook for two cuts in 2025, remove one or both projected cuts, or potentially add another cut.

Most market observers expect the Fed to maintain a patient approach. Chair Powell recently emphasized there is “no need to be in a hurry” as central bankers seek “greater clarity” on the direction of Trump administration policies.

Current market pricing suggests traders don’t expect an initial rate reduction until at least June. They are pricing in one additional quarter-point easing and about a 50-50 chance of a third move by the end of 2025.

The cryptocurrency market has seen major volatility in recent weeks, with nearly a trillion dollars wiped from valuations. Today’s Fed announcements could play a key role in determining whether Bitcoin and other digital assets can resume their upward trend.</p>

Blockchain network eos announced its rebrand to “vaulta” on tuesday as it pivots towards “Web3 banking” in a Bid to Capitalize on Growing Demand for Innovative Financial Products.

Eager to jump at the chance, traders have pushed the network's native eos token at 30% to $ 0.65 shortly after the reveal, coingecko data shows.

Despite the Sudden Surge, the Token Remains Down by 188% from the All-Time High of $ 22.89, Showing the Challenges The Blockchain has faced synced syncing syncs explosive debut.

The transition to vaulta is tentatively set for the end of may 2025, with the eos token being swapped for the new vaulta token, eos said in a tuesday statement.

The swap will be bi-diectional for four months, allowing users to exchange their eos tokens for vaulta at a 1: 1 ratio through a dedicated portal.

The vaulta token will also be listed on the nearly 140 Exchanges where eos currently trades. The token ticker and additional technical details will be revealed at a later date, eos said in a separate statement.

Vaulta's "Web3 Banking OS" will provide a suite of tools to enable fractional ownership of real-world assets, strike, custody, and bitcoin yield strategies, among other offerings, eos said.

The platform will build on the existing eos technology, making some key upgrades to improve how it works with other blockchains.

Smart Contracts

One of the main upgrades is a feature called Exsat, which will help further smart contracts on bitcoin, allowing vaulta to interact with other blockchain networks.

Vaulta's System will feature One-Second Transaction Finality, C ++ Compatibility, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatibility for Smart Contracts.

Through collaborations with spirit blockchain, which enables fractional ownership of real-world assets, and ceffu, specializing in custody and yield strategies, vaulta claims it will merge defi and traditional finance in a "secure environment."

The platform also plans to establish a banking advisory council to advise on the project's direction, including finch and web3 representatives from Systemic Trust, Tetra, and atb Financial.

Launched in 2018 to Challenge Ethereum, EOS initially garnered significant attention for its high transaction throughput and Lower festival, Owing to its unique delegated proof-or-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism.

With its record ico, raising a massive $ 4.1 billion, eos was initially blessed as a major contender in the blockchain space, touted as an "ethereum killer."

Within a year of its debut, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against block.one, the company behind eos, for conducting an unregistered securities sale.

Block.One ultimately settled the case by paying a $ 24 million fine, a penalty that was minimal compared to the $ 4 billion raised.

As time winning on, the network struggled to meet expectations with frequent Congestion issues and "mutual voting" allegations, leading to a significant loss of market confidence and a substantial drop in token value.

Crypto exchange Coinbase announced on Tuesday the launch of Verified Pools, a new service it claims reduces counterparty risk for decentralized finance (DeFi) participants.

Verified Pools are liquidity pools—collections of funds that facilitate digital asset trades—only available to users who complete Coinbase’s identity verification process.

The service is designed for institutional and retail traders, offering KYC-verified liquidity pools to maintain what Coinbase is positioning as the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets, according to a statement.

Verified Pools is powered by Coinbase's Ethereum-centric Layer 2 network, Base, and utilizes the Uniswap v4 protocol. The exchange has also partnered with Gauntlet, a risk management firm, to shore up liquidity.

The pools are non-custodial, meaning users maintain control over their assets.

The KYC element is part of Coinbase's broader efforts to remain compliant as it seeks to scale back access to some offerings, particularly in New York.

Introducing Coinbase Verified Pools, a trusted way to seamlessly trade onchain. Dive in. ↓ pic.twitter.com/rddrniaXu8 — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) March 18, 2025

Verified Pools are connected via Coinbase's "institutional-grade" Prime Onchain Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or any other wallet stamped with a Coinbase Verifications credential, it said.

Initially, Verified Pools will be available in select regions, including the U.S., Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands.

Users must complete Coinbase’s KYC process to participate, providing a higher level of assurance for institutions that have hesitated to join DeFi markets due to concerns over regulatory compliance and security.

Coinbase appears to be in a favorable position these days under President Donald Trump’s administration, which is en route to making the country the “crypto capital” of the world with pro-crypto policies.

After a years-long legal battle, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dropped its lawsuit against the exchange, clearing the way for Coinbase to operate more freely in the country.

Aside from Verified Pools, Coinbase revealed plans to offer 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading on its Coinbase Derivatives platform in the coming weeks.

Coinbase also announced it will launch perpetual-style futures in the U.S., with extended expiration dates, further expanding its futures trading options.

Bitcoin’s market liquidity is tightening as the crypto continues to consolidate following a steep correction from its February peak above $102,000.

On-chain data from Glassnode shows that capital inflows have slowed significantly, with liquidity conditions deteriorating across both spot and futures markets.

Exchange inflows—a key measure of market activity—have dropped more than 54% from their cycle peak, reflecting lower investor participation, Glassnode wrote in a report on Tuesday.

At the same time, open interest in Bitcoin futures has declined by 35%, falling from $57 billion at the market’s all-time high to $37 billion, signaling a reduction in leverage and speculative activity.

The asset is down 23% from its January 20 all-time high near $109,000 and a further 15% over the last 30 days to $82,800, CoinGecko data shows.

A major factor contributing to the liquidity crunch appears to be an unwinding of the cash-and-carry trade—a strategy in which traders arbitrage Bitcoin’s price premium in CME futures relative to spot prices.

Another factor analysts point to is the shifting sentiment on macroeconomic developments abroad, a pivot from knee-jerk responses earlier in the month to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“In the absence of fresh tariff headlines, geopolitics has returned to the forefront,” Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a note on Tuesday.

“Israel’s renewed strikes on Gaza following a temporary truce have pushed gold soaring past $3,000, while Bitcoin continues to exhibit a negative correlation,” it said.

With the market shifting into a risk-off mode, institutional players are scaling back those positions, leading to ETF outflows and further downside pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price.

The options market also reflects a growing preference for downside protection, with put options carrying higher implied volatility premiums than equivalent calls.

Meanwhile, Short-Term Holders are experiencing substantial unrealized losses, prompting some to capitulate.

Despite the broader sell-off, Long-Term Holders remain primarily inactive, Glassnode said, suggesting long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition remains intact.

The Glassnode report notes that this cohort still holds a significant share of the network’s wealth, an atypical trend for this late in the cycle.

Bitcoin now faces a delicate equilibrium: with declining liquidity and fading speculative activity, volatility could remain elevated in the near term.

Whether fresh capital returns to support higher prices remains a key question as traders assess macroeconomic conditions and the broader risk environment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As expected, the United States Federal Reserve left on Wednesday its rank of federal reference funds at 4.25%-4.50%, the second consecutive pause from three consecutive rate cuts at the end of 2024.

The Federal Reserve Economic Economic Foundes, however, a marked drop in economic growth expectations were observed, with an increase in GDP in 2025 that is now at just 1.7%, compared to the 2.1% planned in December. Growth prospects for 2026 and 2027 were also reduced.

"The uncertainty about economic perspectives has increased," the Federal Reserve said an attached statement, which is probably a reference to the tumult surrounding the tariff regime threatened by President Trump.

Together with the deceleration of growth, the PCE inflation is now at 2.8 % this year, compared to the previous projection of 2.5 %. Core inflation prospects for 2026 and 2027 remained at 2.2 % and 2.0 %, respectively.

The "DOT diagram", which shows the perspectives of the FOMC members on the possible evolution of interest rates, still provides that the federal fund rate will close this year at 3.9%, just like the December forecast. Final federal fund rates by 2026 and 2027 remain projected at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve also said that it would begin to reduce the rhythm of exit of its balance sheet - the so -called quantitative adjustment - as of April 1. The decrease in treasure titles will then be reduced to only 5,000 million dollars from the previous 25,000 million dollars.

Bitcoin (BTC) was volatile in the minutes immediately after the publication, but at the time of the publication it fell to $ 83,500, in front of just over $ 84,000 before the news.

US actions continue to maintain solid profits and the performance of 10 -year treasure bonds has dropped two basic points, up to 4.28%. The gold, the star of recent times among asset classes, remains to have a historical maximum of $ 3,048 per ounce.

Risk assets have been affected in recent weeks due to the growing concern for the tariff threats of President Trump and its perceived impact on inflation and economic growth, which have affected investors' confidence. The Fed has become aggressive in ... December and energy meetings also canceled the hopes of more flexible financial conditions in the short term, which raises winds against cryptocurrencies and shares.

The president of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, will speak at 2:30 p. m., East time (18:30 UTC) and the operators will follow the press conference in search of more clues about the perspectives of those responsible for monetary regulation.</p>

HELLO, HOODI: ETHEREUM WELCOMES A NEW TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week that will be used to carry out the blockchain's upcoming “Pectra” upgrade. Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Ethereum's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

MICROSOFT RAISES ALARM OF MALWARE TARGETING COINBASE, METAMASK WALLETS: Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension. Microsoft’s Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post. The malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet. While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

HALLIDAY RAISES $20M FOR AI PROTOCOL TO ELIMINATE WRITING SMART CONTRACTS FOR DEFI: Artificial intelligence (AI)-focused blockchain protocol Halliday said it raised $20 million to help fund development of its Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP), which aims to speed development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and avoid the need for programmers to write smart contracts. The Series A funding round was led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) crypto arm. "Our mission is to pioneer the software era of blockchain, enabling developers to build applications in hours, not years," Halliday said in an emailed announcement. "With Halliday, you can never write a smart contract again."— Jamie Crawley + AI Boost Read more.

SAM ALTMAN’S WORLD NETWORK AND RAZER WANT TO DEFEAT GAMING’S BOT PROBLEM: Sam Altman’s blockchain project, World Network, is teaming up with gaming hardware firm Razer on a suite of features designed to weed out bots from video games. “Razer ID verified by World ID” is a single sign-on mechanism that will verify real human gamers from bots. It's built atop Razer ID, Razer's existing login service, and will help guarantee there's "a real person behind every Razer ID account,” according to a statement shared by Razer and World. The collaboration between the two firms comes as artificial intelligence (AI) tools are seeping into every corner of online life — including inside of video games, which have been plagued by non-human AI "bots" since long before the rise of Altman's ChatGPT. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Bitcoin (BTC) has risen 4.5% in the last 24 hours and is now trading for $85,500, its highest point since March 9.

The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 6%. Ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) have both surged by 7%, while Ripple’s XRP token has risen 10% off the back of CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to drop its case against the company.

Crypto stocks are also doing relatively well, especially bitcoin mining companies like Bitdeer (BTDR) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which are up 10% and 8% on the day, respectively. Bitdeer is likely buoyed from the technological progress it recently made in its ASIC manufacturing process, as well as from the news that stablecoin giant Tether was increasing its stake in the company to 21%.

Core Scientific, meanwhile, is potentially reaping the benefits of AI firm CoreWeave (Core Scientific’s main customer) filing for an initial public offering earlier in the month. Even so, both companies are down more than 61% and 53% since January and November respectively.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that tariff-related inflation was likely to be transitory and that recession risks remained low. And despite the market reacting positively to the meeting — Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all gained 1% or more — market commentators weren’t necessarily convinced.

“The word — ‘transitory’ — is back at the Federal Reserve as Chair Powell characterizes the price effects of tariffs as a one-off,” economist Mohamed A. El-Erian posted on X. “I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility. It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.”

Gold continued to rise after surpassing the $3,000 mark on Tuesday and today hit a new record above $3,050. Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said that the U.S. central bank was signaling that any additional rate cuts would likely happen at the cost of battering stocks. “The Fed is no longer comfortable gliding to neutral as we get closer to their inflation target. I think you can argue that the soft landing is over,” she posted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking futures in Solana (SOL) are coming on the market on Thursday.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Volatility Shares LLC is launching two ETFs, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) which will track Solana futures and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), which offers leveraged exposure.

SOLZ will have a management fee of 0.95% while traders will be charged 1.85% for SOLT, according to the filing.

The products will be the first-ever funds tracking futures in Solana, which at a market cap of $66.5 billion is the sixth largest cryptocurrency on the market. The token is up 6% over the past 24 hours, in line with the broader crypto market.

The launch of these funds could be significant in the approval of a spot Solana ETF, which would hold the token directly. The SEC has stated in the past that in order to approve a spot product, they would like to see an established futures market for the asset.

After the launch of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs last year, issuers have been looking to bring further crypto-related products to the market.

Several issuers, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and VanEck, have filed paperwork to launch a spot Solana ETF, which have yet to be reviewed by the SEC. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts believe there to be a 75% chance for those funds to be approved by the end of this year.

However, a decision likely won’t be made before Paul Atkins, who has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as chair of the SEC, is confirmed by the Senate. There is currently no hearing scheduled for Atkins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP jumped 10% on Wednesday during U.S. morning hours as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to drop its appeal against Ripple, the company closely adjacent to XRP tokens

"This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal," Garlinghouse posted on X. "A resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it."

Reports last week claimed that the long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the agency was nearing its end. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020 — during President Donald Trump's first term — alleging that the company raised $1.3 billion via unregistered securities sales of XRP tokens.

U.S. Judge Analisa Torres in 2023 ruled that while Ripple violated federal securities law with institutional sales, the programmatic sales of tokens to retail exchanges did not violate the laws, a ruling that many viewed as a partial victory for Ripple. The judge handed a $125 million fine against Ripple last August. The SEC filed a "notice of appeal" following the decision.

The SEC's lawsuit against the crypto company, which Garlinghouse described as the “first major shot fired in the war on crypto” had resulted in $15 billion in losses for holders of XRP. Previous cases by the SEC had ended quickly, making this lawsuit against Ripple a prominent action against the crypto industry.

After the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the Commission has dropped several cases, including its investigation into Coinbase. While Trump has nominated Paul Atkins to serve as the next chair, the Senate has not yet scheduled a hearing for his confirmation.

Ripple and its executives donated heavily during the 2024 election, including over $70 million to the Congress-focused Fairshake super PAC and over $5 million to Trump's inaugural fund.

The end of this lawsuit also increases chances for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be approved by the SEC. Several potential issuers, including Grayscale, Bitwise and Franklin Templeton, have filed for such a fund in previous months with ETF experts at Bloomberg previously placing odds for an approval at 65-75% for the end of this year. XRP was among the assets Trump said would be part of a strategic U.S. crypto reserve.

The SEC declined to comment on Garlinghouse's statement, though in other crypto cases, these matters were agreed to at a staff level before eventually being approved by a vote of the commission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CoreWeave, one of the hottest players in the artificial intelligence (AI) sphere, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on March 3.

The company works closely with bitcoin (BTC) miner Core Scientific (CORZ); the two firms have inked a multi-billion dollar deal for Core Scientific to build hundreds of megawatts of infrastructure for CoreWeave to run its AI services. In fact, CoreWeave is by far Core Scientific’s largest client.

Which raises a question: How will CoreWeave’s IPO affect Core Scientific?

“CoreWeave’s IPO likely will have a correlating impact on Core Scientific,” Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, told CoinDesk. “If CoreWeave’s public debut is successful and it sustains strong revenue growth in the coming years, it will reinforce Core Scientific’s position as a reliable infrastructure provider, ensuring a stable revenue stream from hosting CoreWeave’s GPUs.”

“However, if the AI market experiences a downturn or the demand for high-performance computing weakens, Core could face similar headwinds, as its business is increasingly tied to the broader AI ecosystem,” Zhao added.

The IPO may end up being less of a big deal than CoreWeave’s new $12 billion deal with AI heavyweight OpenAI, analysts at investment bank Canaccord Genuity suggested in a March 12 note. The deal will allow CoreWeave to diversify its revenue away from Microsoft, which currently contributes roughly two thirds of the firm’s revenue. That diversification should end up benefitting Core Scientific on account of the fact that CoreWeave is the firm’s biggest customer.

This quest for diversity is unlikely to hurt the relationship between CoreWeave and Core Scientific, analysts at investment firm H.C. Wainwright wrote on March 11. CoreWeave’s IPO is another sign that rumours that CoreWeave would seek to drop its contract with Core Scientific are untrue. “From the 20,000-foot level, how in the world would that make any sense for CoreWeave?” they wrote. Not only do the two firms have a long history of working together, but they regularly make agreements for Core Scientific to provide even more infrastructure to the AI Hyperscaler.

As for Core Scientific itself, the firm’s executive team is “thrilled” by the potential IPO, a spokesperson told CoinDesk. “We’re proud to be part of their journey toward becoming a public company and look forward to supporting their continued success. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing our customers grow, and we’re excited to continue scaling alongside them as they reach new milestones.</p>

Nvidia will also serve as a technical advisor for the group, which it had announced last year.

Musk and Nvidia join the effort two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the formation of Stargate, a private venture that plans to build up to 20 large AI data centers in the U.S. in partnership with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.

The first data center will be built in Abilene, a small city in Texas, which will be completed by mid-2026, Bloomberg reported yesterday. It will have space for roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s AI chips and a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dubai Land Department (DLD), a government agency for the real estate industry, said it started a real estate tokenization pilot program, claiming to be the first property registration authority in the Middle East to use blockchain technology for property title deeds.

The initiative was developed with the digital assets watchdog Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and Dubai Future Foundation (DFF). The project aligns with Dubai’s 2033 real estate strategy and broader efforts to strengthen its position as a global technology hub.

The department projected that tokenized real estate could account for 7% of the city's total property transactions, reaching 60 billion dirhams ($16 billion) by 2033.

Dubai’s push into real estate tokenization reflects a growing trend of integrating blockchain into traditional markets, placing real-world assets (RWA) like bonds, funds and credit on crypto rails.

The digital token versions of RWAs can be fractionally owned and transferred on the blockchain, lowering the entry barriers for investors and increasing market liquidity. Unlike crowdfunding, which pools investor funds for property purchases, tokenization provides a more structured ownership model. However, a McKinsey tokenization report last year listed real estate as one of the classes that could face slower growth tokenization adoption due to operational hurdles.

Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, director general of DLD, said the initiative would “simplify and enhance buying, selling and investment processes” in local real estate, and the department is engaging with technology firms to refine the project before scaling it up.</p>

"Businesses that emerge from the early adoption of crypto rails will not only thrive but also redefine how value is created and exchanged globally," Privy said. "But this future hinges on one critical factor: making it easy for any developer to build seamless, secure experiences on crypto rails."

The size of the round was not disclosed, though Privy said the investment takes its total funding to over $40 million. Privy had previously raised $26.3 million across its first two rounds, according to data by startup deal platform Tracxn, which places the size of the latest investment in the region of $15 million.

The round included participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Paradigm, BlueYard and Coinbase. Privy's valuation in the round was also not disclosed.</p>

The exact price paid for expand.network was not revealed, but Blockdaemon said the deal was worth double digit millions of dollars. The firm provides API access to DeFi, enabling connections to over 170 endpoints, including DEXs, bridges, lending protocols and oracles.

As long-awaited regulatory clarity comes to crypto in the U.S., banks and large financial institutions are considering a point of entry into the on-chain finance world.

Blockdaemon, which counts banks like Goldman Sachs among its backers, assists around 70% of top 500 institutions active in crypto, which includes running over 250,000 nodes across 40 data centers, as well as handling staking rewards, and more recently establishing cross-blockchain, self-custody wallet offerings for big players.

The next logical step for banks and institutions is providing easy access via Blockdaemon’s interoperable, staking-ready wallets into the complex realm of DeFi lending, borrowing and automated liquidity, said Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon.

“DeFi will make running financial infrastructure a lot cheaper for banks and institutions and it’s where a lot of institutional benefits will reside over time,” Richter said in an interview. “It's still very early and obviously there's a lot that still needs to happen in terms of regulatory clarity, adoption and decentralization. But the time is right to accelerate that particular vertical within our product suite.”

Utila has experienced a fresh wave of demand for digital asset infrastructure, as payment providers, fintech firms and neobanks increasingly use digital assets, including stablecoins and tokenized assets in their operations, Bentzi Rabi, co-founder and CEO of Utila, said in an interview.

With lingering security concerns in managing digital assets, once again pulled into spotlight by crypto exchange Bybit's $1.5 billion exploit, "Organizations don’t have many options today," said Rabi.

“They’re either using outdated institutional wallets that lack key features or simple wallets that aren’t enterprise-ready," Rabi added.

Its platform leverages multiparty computation (MPC) technology, which splits a private key across multiple parties, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. It also features insurance coverage against security threats and asset losses, business continuity offering to mirror features that already have a service in place.

The company's platform has handled $8 billion in monthly digital asset transactions, Rabi said, a sizable bump from the $3 billion in three months in early 2024.

The funding will help Utila expand globally and enhance its product offerings, including advanced gas management, API integrations, and smart contract support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is set to discontinue its largest test network, Holesky, after it encountered challenges testing the forthcoming Pectra upgrade.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) said in a blog post on Tuesday that the network — a controlled environment for testing Ethereum infrastructure and upgrades — will begin winding down, with a full shutdown anticipated on Sept. 30. The just-launched Hoodi test network, deployed on Monday, will serve as Holesky's replacement.

The deprecation plan comes after Holesky fell offline due to February's faulty test of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra update. Developers took weeks to recover Holesky, which came back online in March but suffered from residual damage — so-called "inactivity leaks" that clogged up Holesky's entire validator apparatus.

“[E]xited validators would take approximately one year to fully be removed from the validator set,” the EF explained in their blog post. “The size of the exit queue prevents Holesky from being used to test the full validator lifecycle within a reasonable timeframe.”

Ethereum runs testnets so that developers can run code changes before bringing them to Ethereum’s main network (mainnet). Test networks essentially replicate the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow developer teams and infrastructure providers to test out new software before launching them in a more high-stakes environment.

Holesky was specifically intended for testing by Ethereum's validator ecosystem — the stakers and node operators that keep the Ethereum network up and running. It was built to model close-to-real network conditions with its support for a giant 1.4 million validators — more than Goerli, which Holesky replaced in 2023, and even the real Ethereum network.

Currently, Holesky is used by validators and staking providers, but the similarly-constructed Hoodi network will serve that function moving forward. Hoodi went live earlier this week and plans to test the Pectra upgrade on March 26. Should that test proceed smoothly, developers intend to push Pectra onto Ethereum’s mainnet 30 days later.

“Stakers, this is your new testing ground,” said Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the EF, in a post on X.

Hello, Hoodi: Ethereum welcomes a new test network: Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, will be used this week to implement the next "sicking" update of the blockchain. Pectra will be launched in Hoodi on March 26 and, if everything is going well, the expected update will be implemented in the Ethereum main network approximately 30 days later. According to the CORE developers of the Network. Hoodi was created following defective tong tests in other Ethereum, Holesky and Sepolia test networks, which did not end correctly due to configuration problems. Test networks such as Holesky, Sepolia and Hoodi seek to imitate the main network of Ethereum, allowing developers to prove code changes or important updates such as sicking in a low risk environment before implementing them on the main network. - Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Microsoft warns the alarm on malware attacked to the wallets Coinbase and Metamk: the technological giant Microsoft shared a new warning warning report that attacks 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets that are used with the extension of Google Chrome. Microsoft incident response researchers alerted about a new remote access Trojan (Rat), called Stilachirat, which could implement sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment and exfilt confidential data, according to the team. Shared in a Blogel Malware publication, it was discovered in November 2024 and could steal the user wallet information and any credential, including usernames and passwords, stored in its Google Chrome browser. Stilachirat attacks 20 crypto wallets, including some of the most used, such as Metamk, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet and BNB Chain Wallet. Although malware has not been widely distributed, Microsoft indicated that it has not been able to identify the entity responsible for the threat and presented some mitigation guidelines for current objectives, including the installation of antivirus software. - Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Sam Altman’s World Network and Razer want to defeat the problem of robot in video games: the Sam Altman Blockchain project, World Network, has been associated with the Razer video game hardware company to develop a set of functions designed to eliminate video game bots. "Razer ID verified by World ID" is a single login mechanism that will distinguish human bots players. It is based on Razer ID, the existing login service of Razer, and will help ensure that there is a real person behind each Razer ID account, according to a statement shared by Razer and World. The collaboration between both companies arises as artificial intelligence tools (AI) are infiltrating in all areas of online life, including video games, which have been plagued by non -humans of the non -human bots long before the rise of Altman Chatgpt.

The proof-of-concept, conducted on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, integrated Moody’s Ratings into Credio, Untangled Finance’s risk oracle. Using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, the system allowed credit ratings to be securely published, updated, and withdrawn on-chain while protecting proprietary information.

“Our oracle solution ensures real-time data visibility and immutability while preserving privacy,” said Manrui Tang, co-founder of Untangled Finance, in a release.

Bringing credit ratings on-chain could make risk assessment more transparent and efficient, allowing DeFi protocols and other blockchain-based applications to integrate real-time credit data without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

This follows Untangled Finance's 2024 move to launch a $6 million private credit pool on Celo, as CoinDesk previously reported, which allowed accredited investors to lend USDC under Luxembourg securitization rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A South Korean man who attacked the CEO of collapsed crypto firm, Haru Invest, is now facing a potential decade behind bars, according to local media reports.

Prosecutors in Seoul have requested a 10-year prison sentence for someone local media is only identifying by his last name Kang, a man in his 50s who stabbed Haru Invest CEO Lee Hyung-soo during a court hearing last year.

Haru Invest paused withdrawals in 2023, citing partner issues, without giving a specific reason, before its executives were arrested in 2024 for allegedly stealing $828 million in customer funds.

Kang’s defense argued that he had no intent to kill, noting that he did not target a fatal area and acted in a moment of extreme emotional distress after losing 100 BTC (worth $8.3 million) due to Haru Invest’s collapse.

His lawyers pushed for a reduced charge of aggravated assault rather than attempted murder, citing his severe financial and psychological hardship.

Ahead of the hearing, the local media reported that Haru Invest Victims’ Association held a press conference demanding Kang’s release, arguing that fraud victims like him were being treated unfairly while executives accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars walked free on bail.

Kang is due back in court on April 4 for sentencing.

Originally introduced on Jan. 15, House Bill 1447 aims to protect consumers from scams involving crypto ATMs by mandating operators to issue on-screen fraud warnings to users, obtain money transmitter licenses, use blockchain analytics software to detect and combat fraud, as well as submit quarterly reports on kiosk locations and transactions.

Additionally, operators must appoint a compliance officer.

A report by TRM Labs found that crypto ATMs have facilitated at least $160 million in illicit transactions since 2019, CoinDesk previously reported, with law enforcement worldwide viewing them as a major money laundering and scam risk.

FTC data also shows a nearly tenfold rise in bitcoin ATM scam losses since 2020.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority, the country's markets regulator, has been increasing scrutiny on the sector with crackdowns on unregistered operators.

In 2024, the FCA charged Olumide Osunkoya for running illegal crypto ATMs that processed $3.4 million, marking the first such prosecution in the country. Osunkoya was recently sentenced to four years for his role in the illegal crypto ATM network, and was also convicted for forgery, using false identity documents, and possessing criminal property.

With rising fraud and regulatory scrutiny, the number of crypto ATMs are not growing despite BTC's price growth in 2024. Market data from CoinATMRadar shows that the number of crypto ATMs in the U.S. has been roughly flat since 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coreweave, one of the most prominent actors in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), presented an initial public offer (OPI) on March 3.

The company works in close collaboration with the Bitcoin Minero (BTC) Core Scientific (Corz); The two companies have signed a multi -million dollar agreement for Core Scientific to build hundreds of infrastructure megawatts so that Coreweave operates their AI services. In fact, Coreweave is, however much, its largest client.

Which raises a question: How will the IPO of Coreweave a Core Scientific affect?

"Coreweave's IPO will probably will have a correlative impact on Core Scientific," said Wolfie Zhao, Chief of Research of Theminermag, Coindesk. "If Coreweave's IPO is successful and maintains solid income growth in the coming years, it will consolidate the position of Core Scientific as reliable infrastructure provider, guaranteeing a stable income flow thanks to the accommodation of the Coreweave GPUs."

"However, if the AI ​​market experiences a recession or demand for high performance computing weakens, Core could face winds against similar ones, since its business is increasingly linked to the wider ecosystem," Zhao added.

The IPO could be less transcendental than the new agreement of 12 billion dollars from Coreweave with the AI ​​giant, OpenAI, according to analysts of the Canccord Genuity investment bank in a March 12 note. The agreement will allow Coreweave to diversify its income, moving away from Microsoft, which currently contributes approximately two thirds of the company's income. This diversification should benefit Core Scientific, since Coreweave is its main client.

It is unlikely that this search for diversity harms the relationship between Coreweave and Core Scientific, wrote the investment firm HC Wainwright on March 11. Coreweave's IPO is another sign that the rumors that Coreweave would try to terminate its contract with Core Scientific are false. "From a 6,000 meter perspective, how could that make that for Coreweave?" They wrote. Both signatures not only have a long collaboration career, but also usually reach agreements so that Core Scientific provides even more infrastructure to the IA hyperscalador.

As for Core Scientific, the company's executive team is excited about the possible IPO, according to a spokesman for Coindesk. "We are proud to be part of its path to the stock exchange and we hope to support their continuous success. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing our customers grow, and we are excited to continue growing along with them as they reach new milestones."</p>

The exact price paid for expand.network was not revealed, but Blockdaemon said the deal was worth double digit millions of dollars. The firm provides API access to DeFi, enabling connections to over 170 endpoints, including DEXs, bridges, lending protocols and oracles.

As long-awaited regulatory clarity comes to crypto in the U.S., banks and large financial institutions are considering a point of entry into the on-chain finance world.

Blockdaemon, which counts banks like Goldman Sachs among its backers, assists around 70% of top 500 institutions active in crypto, which includes running over 250,000 nodes across 40 data centers, as well as handling staking rewards, and more recently establishing cross-blockchain, self-custody wallet offerings for big players.

The next logical step for banks and institutions is providing easy access via Blockdaemon’s interoperable, staking-ready wallets into the complex realm of DeFi lending, borrowing and automated liquidity, said Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon.

“DeFi will make running financial infrastructure a lot cheaper for banks and institutions and it’s where a lot of institutional benefits will reside over time,” Richter said in an interview. “It's still very early and obviously there's a lot that still needs to happen in terms of regulatory clarity, adoption and decentralization. But the time is right to accelerate that particular vertical within our product suite.”

"Businesses that emerge from the early adoption of crypto rails will not only thrive but also redefine how value is created and exchanged globally," Privy said. "But this future hinges on one critical factor: making it easy for any developer to build seamless, secure experiences on crypto rails."

The size of the round was not disclosed, though Privy said the investment takes its total funding to over $40 million. Privy had previously raised $26.3 million across its first two rounds, according to data by startup deal platform Tracxn, which places the size of the latest investment in the region of $15 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark fed funds rate range steady at 4.25%-4.50% on Wednesday, the second consecutive pause since three straight rate cuts to end 2024.

The Fed's quarterly economic projections, though, showed a sharp decline in expectations for economic growth, with the GDP increase in 2025 now seen at just 1.7% versus 2.1% at the December forecast. The growth outlooks for 2026 and 2027 were trimmed as well.

"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased," the Fed said in an accompanying statement, which is likely a reference to the tumult surrounding the tariff regime being threatened by President Trump.

Alongside slowing growth, core PCE inflation is now seen at 2.8% this year versus the previous 2.5% projection. The core inflation outlooks for 2026 and 2027 were left at 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively.

The "dot plot" — showing FOMC members' outlooks for where interest rates might be headed — still sees the fed funds rate ending this year at 3.9%, the same as December's forecast. The ending fed funds rates for 2026 and 2027 continue to be projected at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively.

The Fed also said it would begin to slow the pace of securities runoff from its balance sheet — so-called quantitative tightening — beginning on April 1. The decline in Treasury paper then will be trimmed to just $5 billion from $25 billion previously.

Bitcoin (BTC) was volatile in the minutes immediately following the release, but headed lower at press time to $83,500 against just above $84,000 prior to the news.

U.S. stocks continue to hold solid gains and the 10-year Treasury yield has dipped two basis points to 4.28%. Gold, the star of late among asset classes, remains near a record high at $3,048 per ounce.

Risk assets have been beaten down over the past few weeks as mounting concerns over President Trump's tariff threats and its perceived impact on inflation and economic growth weighed on investor sentiment. The Fed turning hawkish at the December and January meetings also quashed hopes of looser financial conditions for the near-term, posing headwinds for cryptocurrencies and stocks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time (18:30 UTC) with traders monitoring the press conference for further clues of policymakers' outlook on monetary policy.</p>
