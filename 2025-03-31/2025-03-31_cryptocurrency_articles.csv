In fact, the crypto sector as a whole could be facing a severe downtrend reminiscent of 2022.

“I could see us going back to a five handle by the end of the year,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. A ""five handle,"" i.e. a price between $50,000 and $59,999, would be down substantially from the already shaky current $83,000 level and roughly a 50% decline from bitcoin's peak just above $109,000 just more than two months ago.

“I don't think it happens quickly, which is why it would be very painful and shocking to people because nothing about the current market conditions is very volatile, with big liquidations and crashes,” Thompson added. “It's this sort of different market environment, a slow grind down that is almost more unbearable for people because they're like, ‘Is it over? Is the bottom in?’”

Thompson, who had been bearish from far higher levels, has repeatedly called the White House’s crypto announcements — be it the Sovereign Wealth Fund or Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, or anything in-between — ""nothingburgers"" and “sell the news” events. He has also argued that Strategy’s (MSTR) constant bitcoin buys aren’t necessarily bullish for the cryptocurrency, since they seem to be the only significant bid.

The economy’s four headwinds

Central to Thompson’s thesis is the idea that the Trump administration’s various policies will likely hurt the economy for the next six to nine months.

First, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), in its efforts to reduce the U.S. deficit, is bent on cutting government spending — which has been one of the largest drivers of job growth in recent years. The labour market was already wobbly when the Biden team handed over the reins to Trump, Thompson said, and the new government’s fiscal arm isn’t interested in propping things up anymore.

“People get caught up in the politics of it,” Thompson said. “We can disagree on whether we need the Department of Education or not. But those dollars were being printed and going into people's pockets, and those people spent them, and went on vacation and to the grocery store. So it was growth positive.”

Elon Musk, the main force behind D.O.G.E, said last week that he was aiming to cut $1 trillion in government spending by the end of May; he also said he wanted to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, meaning almost $7 trillion.

Even if D.O.G.E fails its stated objective and only manages to cut, say, a hundred billion over the course of four years, the bigger cuts are likely to occur at the beginning of Trump’s term, not the end, Thompson argued. This means that D.O.G.E’s impact on the economy and consumer sentiment is likely to be felt in the coming months, no matter whether the agency actually succeeds or not.

Second, the crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border — combined with the renewed emphasis on deportations — is bound to affect the labour market, Thompson said. Migration is growth positive because it puts pressure on wages; if that labour pool dries up, workers will demand higher salaries, which some businesses won’t be able to afford.

Thompson’s third issue is tariffs. The Trump administration keeps changing up its tariff threats on a day-to-day basis, sometimes promising new ones, sometimes calling them off, creating doubt as to whether the majority of proposed tariffs will actually ever go into effect. But the important thing about tariffs is that they create uncertainty for businesses, which may elect to delay investment or hiring decisions until the tariff situation is resolved.

Finally, the Federal Reserve doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to loosen financial conditions because inflation data hasn’t been great. The U.S. central bank cut interest by a full percentage point at the end of 2024, to 4.25%-4.5%, and even that wasn’t enough to push bitcoin above $110,000. Thompson says he expects the Fed to cut anywhere between 25 and 75 basis points in 2025, but that these cuts will be spread out in the second half of the year.

“I think there's a lot more coordination going on between the Treasury and the Fed than people want to believe,” Thompson said. “People thought Trump and [Fed chair] Powell would be bickering, but they’re actually kind of on the same team right now. [Secretary of Treasury] Bessent and Trump are bringing growth down, and that helps Powell achieve lower inflation.”

When will the bottom be?

With such headwinds working against risk-on assets like stocks and bitcoin, the crypto sector is unlikely to have a good year, Thompson said. The fact that the White House doesn’t seem overly concerned about a potential recession is also a strong signal, he said.

“Bessent is coming in saying, ‘We need to right the ship.’ And righting the ship means cutting off the juice that was powering these crazy asset prices. The direct result of their policies working is a lower stock market,” Thompson said.

But how long is Trump likely to maintain course? Until it becomes too painful and even Trump’s political base tells him to cut it out, or until the beginning of 2026 — you can’t be pushing a country into a recession with midterm elections coming up.

“I equate this to a controlled burn. They’re trying to purposefully clear the brush so that it doesn't become a bigger problem. But sometimes controlled burns become forest fires,” Thompson said. “I think it's going to be a long kind of slog through the year as they try to enact these policies.”",coindesk

The far-fetched claim is rooted in what Good prognosticates as unvarnished reality: Bitcoin's encryption mechanisms are ""getting really stale"" and could be ""completely obsolete within five years,"" creating a business conundrum for the miners behind it.

""You've got people who've invested billions of dollars in hash power for securing a network in ASICs,"" he told CoinDesk at this year's ethDenver conference. ""And the question is like, where do they all go?""

His answer is Ambient, a blockchain with deep capabilities in the AI space – the ""future economy,"" as Good puts it – that could become a ""decentralized competitor to OpenAI."" The network operates on a proof-of-work mechanism with familiar appeal to bitcoin miners, he said, making it an easy switch.

""It's a useful proof of work network, which we don't think anyone has ever done well in crypto,"" Good said.

Many crypto projects have attempted to fuse the two buzzy tech trends on the belief that blockchains and decentralized crowdsourcing can steer AI better toward delivering for humanity than singular, private corporations possibly could.

One of the biggest and best-funded is Bittensor. But Good claims the market leader is woefully deficient because it doesn't actually run AI models on blockchain, despite its original intention to ""be this global computer."" His alternative, Ambient, cooks AI into its core.

Whether Bitcoin miners – let alone users – would actually embrace a radically new and different network likely hinges on Ambient's economic success. Good seeks for Ambient to deliver super-intelligent AI fast, cheap, and critically, in the open, so that users get the answers they paid for.

While Ambient's security rhymes with Bitcoin's, the network itself runs like Solana.

Ambient raised $7.2 million in seed funding from a16z's crypto accelerator program as well as Delphi Digital, one of the VC world's hungriest funds for crypto-AI crossover tech.

""Everyone in crypto is currently using centralized AI to power their apps, to power their frontend,"" said Alex Golding, a venture associate at Delphi. He thinks that's a big issue because it deprives users of understanding what the models are trained on and exposes them to getting hoodwinked with answers derived from inferior models.

""Verified inference"" by miners (the heart of their rewards mechanism) acts as a provenance fact-checker, ensuring that answers spat out by Ambient originate from the model people paid to use.

""If you don't have verified inference, you're guaranteed to get rugged,"" Good said, adding a hyperbolic warning: ""Nation state actors are going to poison your model and just do fun stuff, like we saw with Lazarus,"" North Korea's hackers.

Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are merging their firm, American Data Centers, with a new mining venture called American Bitcoin, taking a 20% stake in the company. The remaining 80% will be owned by Hut 8, a publicly traded crypto infrastructure firm, which is contributing nearly 61,000 mining machines to the new entity. According to the release, no cash changed hands in the deal.

Eric Trump, who will serve as American Bitcoin’s chief strategy officer, describes the initiative as aligned with the family’s focus on hard assets, likening digital currencies to real estate. He emphasized plans to build a “bitcoin reserve” and potentially take the company public.

Although American Bitcoin is separate from the Trump Organization, it may eventually collaborate with World Liberty Financial—the DeFi project launched by the Trump brothers.

Hut 8 will host the mining operations in its 11 U.S. data centers. CEO Asher Genoot said low energy costs and scalable infrastructure will give American Bitcoin a competitive edge.

The board of directors will include Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and FabFitFun co-founder Michael Broukhim. Despite criticism over bitcoin mining’s environmental impact, Eric Trump believes lower U.S. energy costs will help American miners outpace global competitors.

“The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades,"" said Fink in his annual letter to shareholders.But that’s not guaranteed to last forever … If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.”

""I'm obviously not anti-digital assets,"" Fink continued."" But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.""

Fink’s letter comes at a time of high market uncertainty and anxiety among investors about the economic state of the country amid policy changes set in place by U.S. President Donald Trump. To balance out the national deficit, Fink said, investors should diversify their portfolios to add private market assets in addition to stocks and bonds.

Doubling down on his commitment and belief in digital assets, Fink said he believes that tokenized funds will be as well-known among investors as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), provided that the industry can create a better infrastructure for digital identities, which Fink believes to be a hurdle in getting institutional investors from fully embracing decentralized finance.

“Every stock, every bond, every fund— every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,” he wrote. “ If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.”

BlackRock, in January 2024, became one of the issuers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Their product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), became the most successful ETF in the history of the asset class. As of today, the fund handles nearly $50 billion in assets, with half of that coming from retail investors. The asset manager has also issued a tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which is on track to cross $2 billion in assets by April, making it the largest tokenized fund currently on the market.

The backdrop is President Donald Trump's new tariffs, set to be revealed to the world on April 2 in an event he has dubbed ""Liberation Day."" The president plans to impose levies and tariffs on any country deemed to have an unfair trading relationship with the U.S.

""You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens,"" Trump said, according to the Financial Times. His words suggest that while the tariffs may initially apply broadly, he is open to making concessions for some countries, the FT said.

On Friday, U.S. equities dropped after a hotter-than-expected reading in core PCE inflation, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. Market uncertainty may persist with the U.S. jobs report due Friday. Economists forecast the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%, while nonfarm payrolls are projected at 128,000, down from 151,000 the previous month.

Gold is rallying on the back of this uncertainty, surging past $3,100 per ounce for the first time ever — up 1.2% on the day and nearly 20% year-to-date. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle, hovering just above $80,000. It's down more than 3% this month and 12% for the quarter, marking its worst performance since fourth-quarter 2022.

Then consider ether (ETH). The second-largest cryptocurrency has performed significantly worse than bitcoin this quarter, losing 46% in a slide that's the worst since 2018. As a result, the ether-to-bitcoin ratio has dropped to 0.02195, marking its lowest level since May 2020. At that time, bitcoin was trading below $10,000, while ether hovered just above $200.

Token launchpad Pump.fun’s trading platform PumpSwap, which allows tokens to be traded on its own platform rather than on decentralized exchange Raydium, has traded a cumulative $2.6 billion since its March 20 debut, Dune data shows.

That makes it the Solana ecosystem's No. 1 protocol in collected fees over the last 24 hours, bringing in $3.29 million, far above the runner-up, DEX aggregator Jupiter, with $2.47 million.

PumpSwap, Dune’s data shows, has had a total of 710,000 traders on the platform and more than 32.39 million swaps since its introduction, giving it a significant share of the Solana DEX ecosystem.

Yet the protocol faces headwinds with the slowdown of the Solana ecosystem’s activity as the memecoin trading frenzy cools. Artemis data shows daily active addresses on Solana for the year dropped from an 8.1 million peak to 4.2 million on March 29.

Derivatives Positioning

The total open interest on all instruments dropped to $101.3 billion, according to data from Laevitas, continuing its downward trend from last week.

The decline suggests a more cautious stance from market participants as they brace for a volatile week that includes the end of the quarter, anticipated announcements on tariffs from President Trump and the March jobs report on Friday.

In the past 24 hours, total liquidations amounted to $229.3 million, with long positions accounting for 79% of the total. Looking at the BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on Binance, the largest immediate liquidation cluster lies at $81,200, totaling $27.5 million.

The next key clusters are located at $83,100 and $83,600, with liquidations totaling $25.5 million and $24.7 million, respectively. Both levels align closely with the CME gap created over the weekend.

Among tokens with more than $100 million in open interest, the biggest 24-hour increases were seen in EOS (+13.4%), PEPE (+8.99%), TON (+4.85%), and HYPE (+2.55%). The assets with the largest declines in open interest over the last 24 hours include SUI, TAO and NEAR, falling 10.8%, 8.53% and 7.89%, respectively.

Technical Analysis

XRP, one of the year's better-performing major altcoins, is again nearing a critical support zone between $1.95 and $2.05.

This region has consistently acted as a strong demand area, with buyers stepping in multiple times over the past four months.

Adding to its significance, the zone aligns with the 2021 all-time high and is now further supported by the daily 200 exponential moving average, which is also gradually converging toward this level.

Acceptance below this key level is likely to result in a larger expansion to the downside, given the loss of a key level that has reliably held as support for several months.

Many Western markets on the darknet — a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools — had either fully moved to monero or operated with it in parallel with bitcoin before the delistings. XMR dropped off after it was removed from major exchanges.

OKX removed XMR and other privacy-focused tokens including dash (DASH) and ZCash (ZCH) at the end of 2023. Binance announced in February 2024 that it planned to de-list monero.

""When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it,"" Binance said at the time.

On-chain data from BitInfoCharts shows that the daily number of monero transactions has halved from this time last year.

""In order to be an effective kind of medium of exchange, you need a certain amount of liquidity and a certain amount of accessibility,"" Jardine said.

Jardine emphasized that illicit cryptocurrency transactions represent only a minor share of total crypto activity.

""Typically, illicit transactions constitute at or below 1% of total crypto activities. While addressing these issues is essential, broadly labeling crypto negatively is inaccurate and counterproductive.""

Chainalysis data shows that about 0.14% of all transactions in crypto, some $50 billion, involve illicit activity, with a rise in stablecoins as an illicit payment mechanism.

The stablecoin issuers are fighting back, with the Tron-led T3 Financial Crime Unit, a group comprising of Tron, USDT-issuer Tether and TRM Labs freezing over $100 million in illict funds.

Jardine also noted that law-enforcement agencies prioritize darknet markets primarily based on their scale and involvement in the fentanyl trade.

Its presence significantly escalates the likelihood of a darknet market attracting law enforcement attention, he said, because fighting the drug is a priority for international law enforcement.

""Markets have sort of varying levels of sensitivity to fentanyl-related sales,"" he said. ""Some claim they don't do it, then don't police vendors; some claim they don't do it, but then they do. Some will be selling precursor products but not finished products.""

Indeed, one of the most recent darknet market busts was the Nemesis online market. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) specifically cited the market's role in the fentanyl trade as a reason for the bust.

And, as a result, OFAC sanctioned a number of crypto wallets tied to its operator, Behrouz Parsarad: 44 BTC addresses and 5 XMR wallets.",coindesk

For emerging economies — countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Thailand, or Vietnam — strategic exposure to cryptocurrencies is essential for future economic resilience. They collectively represent over 40% of the global population and approximately 25% of global GDP, yet they remain vulnerable to external economic shocks, including currency fluctuations, trade disruptions, and more. Today, their sovereign reserves remain heavily reliant on traditional assets like gold and foreign exchange. But those aren’t sufficient hedges in a rapidly digitizing world.

Cryptocurrencies aren’t an experiment anymore. While Bitcoin is the most widely adopted, making it the primary example in this discussion, the broader argument applies to cryptocurrencies as a whole. The Bitcoin network has been operational for over 99.98% of the time since its inception in 2009. Cryptocurrencies have survived wars, regulatory crackdowns, and multiple financial crises. Over the last decade, bitcoin has appreciated nearly 200X, far outpacing tech giants like NVIDIA or Apple.

The crypto space, no denying, has faced scams, rug pulls, and bad actors. This is common in virtually any financial system — think early stock markets or banking. That’s why smart regulation is critical. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland have already struck a balance between consumer protection and innovation, offering models for others. But these risks don’t negate crypto’s core appeal — they demand careful governance.

Diversification is key. Ask any central banker, fund manager, or financial advisor: you don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and you certainly don’t bet the future of an economy on a single asset class. In a world that’s rapidly digitizing, ignoring digital assets like cryptocurrencies is a mistake. These assets tend to have little correlation with how other traditional assets perform, making bitcoin a strong hedge against economic turbulence.

We’re seeing entire publicly listed companies built around bitcoin as a core asset. Take Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which started as a software firm and now holds over 506,137 BTC (approximately $42 billion as of writing). Countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Vietnam, India, and Thailand rank among the top 10 countries globally for cryptocurrency adoption already. EAEs must follow this shift or fall behind.

Bitcoin isn’t the new digital gold — it serves a very different role. In many cultures, more so in mine, we Indians love our gold. We hoard it, gift it, and trust it as a store of value. Central banks across the world have been buying gold at a record pace in recent years. But gold wasn’t always the safe bet we think it is today — back in the 1980s, its price crashed by 60% before bouncing back.

Bitcoin brings new utility: it can be transferred anywhere in the world in minutes, divided into microscopic fractions, and secured with cryptographic protocols. Gold and Bitcoin share fundamental traits — they’re scarce, resilient, and hedge against uncertainty — but gold preserves value traditionally, while bitcoin expands possibilities digitally. They don’t replace each other; they work together.

Critics often dismiss crypto as mere speculation, but its utility is real. Major companies like Microsoft and Starbucks now accept bitcoin and stablecoins for transactions. U.S. bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $12 billion in institutional inflows within months. Crypto enables faster, cheaper remittances, cutting global fees from 6.4% to under 1%, saving billions for developing economies. With over $100 billion locked in DeFi protocols, it’s clear that the future of finance is already being built on blockchain.

Emerging economies should take a strategic, forward-looking step toward economic resilience. A 1-2% allocation in digital assets is smart, not a gamble. Track its performance, take cues from early movers like the U.S., El Salvador, and Strategy, and refine the approach as you go. Encourage financial institutions to experiment with crypto-backed financial instruments in a limited way. Proactive regulatory frameworks are vital to foster innovation while ensuring stability.

Countries must position themselves for the future. Holding digital assets reduces reliance on external financial systems and insulates them from geopolitical and monetary shifts. We’ve seen this playbook before — these countries weren’t the first to embrace digital payments, yet they built world-class infrastructure like India’s UPI, Brazil’s PIX, and Nigeria’s NIBSS. The same leadership is possible in crypto reserves. With the global crypto market nearing $3 trillion and institutional adoption accelerating, the question isn’t if this shift will happen—it’s who will lead it.

Emerging economies can start building a strategic reserve today or hear in five years at another dinner party in five years, “If only we had bought bitcoin in 2025.” The time is now.

Despite technological advances, this ideal remains elusive in today's fragmented digital economy.

Our current commerce landscape is siloed across competing platforms, each creating its own walled garden. Amazon, eBay, and specialized marketplaces for luxury goods may have digitized commerce, but they've simply replaced physical barriers with digital ones. These platforms deliberately maintain high costs and barriers designed to prevent users from migrating to competitors. Algorithms deployed by these platforms are trained explicitly to maximize revenue by adjusting prices dynamically based on comprehensive market data, often keeping prices artificially elevated depending on the broader internet pricing environment.

Such practices result in significant price disparities for identical assets across platforms. Inefficiencies persist because the costs of exploiting them—such as substantial platform fees, lengthy onboarding requirements, limited interoperability, and time delays in transactions—typically outweigh potential arbitrage profits. When the cost to exploit a price difference exceeds the potential earnings from the trade, these inefficiencies remain entrenched, allowing platforms to maintain control over users..

Platforms: Efficient Coordinators, Extractive Middlemen

Today's platforms serve two essential functions: they aggregate supply and demand, and they establish trusted exchange mechanisms. But they operate with fundamentally misaligned incentives. Platforms don't work for users; they work for shareholders, with a fiduciary duty to maximize extraction.

This results in market failures where platforms invariably exploit their position as intermediaries through high fees, manipulated search results, and proprietary ecosystems designed to lock in participants. The platform model is inherently extractive by design.

The AI-Crypto Revolution in Commerce

The convergence of two powerful technologies is about to disrupt this status quo: AI agents and crypto protocols.

AI agents can perform many platform functions — especially supply and demand aggregation — at a fraction of the cost. Unlike platforms, these agents work directly for users, fundamentally realigning incentives. Meanwhile, crypto protocols solve the fair — exchange problem through low-cost, trust-minimized transactions where users only need to trust audited, immutable code rather than corporate intermediaries.

The combination creates what I call ""decentralized commerce agents"" — AI that can efficiently discover price differences across marketplaces while using crypto protocols to facilitate secure, low-cost exchange. This dramatically reduces the total cost of arbitrage, suddenly making previously non-viable price differences economically feasible to exploit.

The Path to Perfect Markets

Here's where it gets interesting: by enabling these agents to retain profits from successful arbitrage operations, they can strategically redistribute gains to incentivize adoption of decentralized commerce protocols. Each successful arbitrage can offer discounts to buyers, bonuses to sellers, and fund continued development of the agent ecosystem.

This creates a powerful feedback loop: more users generate more transactions, which create more arbitrage opportunities, yielding more profits, which attract more users. Each cycle consolidates liquidity on decentralized protocols while reducing the viability of isolated, extractive platforms.

The result is a steady progression toward that theoretical ideal of a perfect market — a single, liquid marketplace for all assets with minimal transaction costs, maximum price transparency, and efficient pricing.

Why This Matters

For consumers, this means lower prices, better selection, and truly competitive markets free from platform manipulation. For businesses, it means direct access to customers without paying exorbitant platform taxes. For society, it means markets that more efficiently allocate resources based on actual supply and demand rather than platform algorithmic manipulation.

The technical pieces are falling into place. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, while crypto protocols for decentralized commerce continue to mature. What's missing is the recognition of how powerful these technologies become when combined specifically to disrupt platform economics.

Decentralized commerce agents represent not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental realignment of economic coordination. For the first time, we have the tools to make perfect markets more than just a theoretical construct in economics textbooks. The question is whether we'll seize this opportunity to build a more efficient, accessible, and equitable commercial landscape for everyone.

The achievement highlights the platform’s rapid growth in a sector that’s increasingly drawing both institutional and retail interest.

The surge in performance, according to internal data and third-party analytics, is linked to a successful Q1 strategy that included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF, and Big Candle Capital.

Crypto Options: From Niche Strategy to Core Market Structure

Once reserved for quants and hedge funds, options are now becoming a go-to instrument for crypto-native investors. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell assets at a set price — enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays, and directional speculation.

As the broader digital asset market matures, crypto options are increasingly viewed as a critical building block of the financial stack. That narrative hit the mainstream this month when reports emerged of Coinbase being in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the market’s dominant BTC and ETH options venue, for a rumored $4–5 billion. Although negotiations have since slowed, the message from the market is clear: crypto derivatives are no longer a sideshow — they’re center stage.

Youngest in the Top 5 — and Fastest Rising

Coincall’s breakout is notable not just for its velocity, but for the company’s relative youth. Founded in late 2023, Coincall now ranks among the top exchanges in the space, with it currently 9-10% the size of Deribit.

A forthcoming data table will show Coincall’s comparative market share and growth trajectory alongside the major players. This distinction makes Coincall the youngest exchange ever to break into the Top 5, and potentially one of the most viable candidates for acquisition or institutional partnership among rising players. As attention shifts from mature giants to agile challengers, Coincall has positioned itself at the center of that conversation.

Data from Laevitas shows Coincall breaking into the Top 5, growing into almost the same market share as industry giant ByBit

Leadership Backed by Vision

In January, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo — former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space — as Chief Operating Officer and minority shareholder.

“We’re witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value,” Teo said. “Options are the next wave — they provide leverage, flexibility, and strategy. Our mission at Coincall is simple: make investing quick, intuitive, and safe — for everyone.”

""Earn While You Trade"" feature: Unlocking Yield + Capital Efficiency

Coincall’s latest product innovation, Earn While You Trade (EWYT), is designed to eliminate the traditional tradeoff between yield farming and active trading.

With EWYT, users can:

• Earn up to 6.4% APR on USDT holdings

• Access 90% of staked funds as trading margin

• Withdraw funds at any time — no lock-ups

• Maximize capital efficiency in volatile markets

The feature allows users to generate passive yield while maintaining active market participation. For many traders, this represents a structural change in capital allocation approaches.

Users can explore the product here.

Macro Momentum: Crypto Infrastructure Is Back

Coincall’s rise reflects broader tailwinds in crypto infrastructure. According to PitchBook, $11.5 billion in venture capital was invested into crypto and blockchain startups in 2024 across 2,153 deals — a strong rebound after the prior bear cycle.

“The next phase of crypto will be defined by real infrastructure,” said Teo. “The platforms building with intention, with capital efficiency and user accessibility in mind, will shape the decade ahead.”

While yields across major lending platforms have compressed significantly, innovation at the market's edges demonstrates DeFi's continued maturation and growth.

The Great Yield Compression

DeFi yields have declined sharply across all major lending platforms:

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The vaults.fyi USD benchmark has fallen below 3.1%, below the U.S. 1-month T-bill yield of ~4.3% for the first time since late 2023. This benchmark, a weighted average across four leading markets, approached 14% in late 2024.

Spark has implemented four consecutive rate decreases in 2025 alone. Starting the year at 12.5%, rates were cut to 8.75%, then 6.5%, and now sit at 4.5%.

Aave's stablecoin yields on mainnet are around 3% for USDC and USDT, levels that would have been considered disappointing just months ago.

This compression signals a market that’s cooled significantly from late-2024's exuberance, with subdued borrower demand across major platforms.

The TVL Paradox: Growth Despite Lower Yields

Despite falling yields, major stablecoin vaults have experienced extraordinary growth:

Collectively, the largest vaults on Aave, Sky, Ethena, and Compound have nearly quadrupled in size over the past 12 months, expanding from about $4 billion to about $15 billion in supply-side deposits.

Despite Spark's consecutive rate cuts, TVL has grown more than 3x from the start of 2025.

As yields have fallen from nearly 15% to under 5%, capital has remained sticky. This seemingly contradictory behavior reflects increasing institutional comfort with DeFi protocols as legitimate financial infrastructure rather than speculative vehicles.

The Rise of Curators: DeFi's New Asset Managers

The emergence of curation represents a significant shift in DeFi lending. Protocols like Morpho and Euler have introduced curators who build, manage, and optimize lending vaults.

These curators serve as a new breed of DeFi asset managers, evaluating markets, setting risk parameters, and optimizing capital allocations to deliver enhanced yields. Unlike traditional service providers who merely advise protocols, curators actively manage capital deployment strategies across various lending opportunities.

On platforms like Morpho and Euler, curators handle risk management functions: selecting which assets can serve as collateral, setting appropriate loan-to-value ratios, choosing oracle price feeds, and implementing supply caps. They essentially build targeted lending strategies optimized for specific risk-reward profiles, sitting between passive lenders and sources of yield.

Firms like Gauntlet, previously service providers to protocols like Aave or Compound, now directly manage nearly $750 million in TVL across several protocols. With performance fees ranging from 0-15%, this potentially represents millions in annual revenue with significantly more upside than traditional service arrangements. Per a Morpho dashboard, curators have cumulatively generated nearly 3 million in revenue and based on Q1 revenue are on track to do 7.8mm in 2025.

The most successful curator strategies have maintained higher yields primarily by accepting higher-yielding collaterals at more aggressive LTV ratios, particularly leveraging Pendle LP tokens. This approach requires sophisticated risk management but delivers superior returns in the current compressed environment.

As concrete examples, yields on the largest USDC vaults on both Morpho and Euler have outperformed the vaults.fyi benchmark, showing 5-8% base yields and 6-12% yields inclusive of token rewards.

Protocol Stratification: A Layered Market

The compressed environment has created a distinct market structure:

1. Blue-chip Infrastructure (Aave, Compound, Sky)

Function similar to traditional money market funds

Offer modest yields (2.4-6.5%) with maximum security and liquidity

Have captured the lion's share of TVL growth

2. Infrastructure Optimizers & Strategy Providers

Base Layer Optimizers : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency

: Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency Strategy Providers: Specialized firms like MEV Capital, Steakhouse, and Gauntlet build on these platforms to deliver higher yields upwards of 12% on USDC and USDT (as of late March)

This two-tier relationship creates a more dynamic market where strategy providers can rapidly iterate on yield opportunities without building core infrastructure. The yields ultimately available to users depend on both the efficiency of the base protocol and the sophistication of strategies deployed on top.

This restructured market means users now navigate a more complex landscape where the relationship between protocols and strategies determines yield potential. While blue-chip protocols offer simplicity and safety, the combination of optimizing protocols and specialized strategies provides yields comparable to what previously existed on platforms like Aave or Compound during higher rate environments.

Chain by Chain: Where Yields Live Now

Despite the proliferation of L2s and alternative L1s, Ethereum mainnet continues to host many of the top yield opportunities, both inclusive and exclusive of token incentives. This persistence of Ethereum's yield advantage is notable in a market where incentive programs have often shifted yield-seeking capital to newer chains.

Among mature chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism), yields remain depressed across the board. Outside of mainnet, most of the attractive yield opportunities are concentrated on Base, suggesting its emerging role as a secondary yield hub.

Newer chains with substantial incentive programs (like Berachain and Sonic) show elevated yields, but the sustainability of these rates remains questionable as incentives eventually taper.

The DeFi Mullet: FinTech in the Front, DeFi in the Back

A significant development this quarter was Coinbase's introduction of Bitcoin-collateralized loans powered by Morpho on its Base network. This integration represents the emerging ""DeFi Mullet"" thesis - fintech interfaces in the front, DeFi infrastructure in the back.

As Coinbase's head of Consumer Products Max Branzburg has noted: ""This is a moment where we're planting a flag that Coinbase is coming on-chain, and we're bringing millions of users with their billions of dollars."" The integration brings Morpho's lending capabilities directly into Coinbase's user interface, allowing users to borrow up to $100,000 in USDC against their bitcoin holdings.

This approach embodies the view that billions will eventually use Ethereum and DeFi protocols without knowing it — just as they use TCP/IP today without awareness. Traditional FinTech companies will increasingly adopt this strategy, keeping familiar interfaces while leveraging DeFi's infrastructure.

The Coinbase implementation is particularly notable for its full-circle integration within the Coinbase ecosystem: users post BTC collateral to mint cbBTC (Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin on Base) and borrow USDC (Coinbase's stablecoin) on Morpho (a Coinbase-funded lending platform) atop Base (Coinbase's Layer 2 network).

Looking Forward: Catalysts for the Lending Market

Several factors could reshape the lending landscape through 2025:

Democratized curation : As curator models mature, could AI agents in crypto eventually enable everyone to become their own curator? While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users.

: As curator models mature, could AI agents in crypto eventually enable everyone to become their own curator? While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users. RWA integration : The continued evolution of real-world asset integration could introduce new yield sources less correlated with crypto market cycles.

: The scaling institutional comfort with DeFi infrastructure suggests growing capital flows that could alter lending dynamics. Specialized lending niches: The emergence of highly specialized lending markets targeting specific user needs beyond simple yield generation.

The protocols best positioned to thrive will be those that can operate efficiently across the risk spectrum, serving both conservative institutional capital and more aggressive yield-seekers, through increasingly sophisticated risk management and capital optimization strategies.

HashSphere addresses this by restricting access to verified participants, enabling firms to develop tokenized assets, AI-powered services and other blockchain-based products while meeting regulatory standards.

""From the start, the vision for Hedera has been to create 'shared worlds' —interconnected networks where enterprises can leverage the power of DLT [distributed ledger technology] without compromising privacy or control,"" said Andrew Stakiwicz, head of solutions at Hashgraph, in the release.

The network also integrates Hedera’s existing tools, including the Token Service for managing digital assets and the Consensus Service for recording transactions with trusted timestamps. The platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy decentralized applications using Solidity and other EVM languages.

Hashgraph said it is currently working with early partners including Australian Payments Plus, Australia's national payments scheme operator, while adding other users.

""We are interested in HashSphere primarily for its enhanced privacy and regulatory compliance, while also needing network interoperability for the seamless and transparent interchange of stablecoins between public Hedera and private HashSphere and other layer-1 protocols,"" said Rob Allen, head of future payments (Web3) strategy at Australian Payments Plus.

The first advisory rescinded on Friday was Staff Advisory No. 18-14, Advisory with Respect to Virtual Currency Derivative Product Listings. Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. On Friday, the CFTC published a letter saying that “additional staff experience” and “increasing market growth” had rendered the guidance unnecessary.

The second advisory, Staff Advisory No. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.”

The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Under the new leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force that has spearheaded its transformation, engaging with the industry and backing down from a host of lawsuits and investigations into crypto companies that began under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler.

Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.”

Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency.

But Davis also suggested that the changes could be tied to a larger restructuring going on at the CFTC.

“They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.",coindesk

The EFPCs manage retirement savings for tens of thousands of unionized and company-employed workers and their reserves are typically made up of bonds and equities.

“The resolution also prohibits investments in virtual assets, considering their specific investment characteristics and associated risk,” a Ministry of Finance notice circulating among local news outlets reads.

The ruling was published last week under under Resolution 5.202/2025 by the National Monetary Council (CMN).

In contrast, last year British pension specialist Cartwright guided the country’s first pension fund to make a bitcoin allocation worth 3% of its assets. Several U.S. states have begun experimenting with crypto allocations for their pension systems, despite federal-level caution. Wisconsin’s state investment board, for example, revealed in February it had invested $340 million in bitcoin through BlackRock’s ETF (IBIT).

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,The MIT Bitcoin Expo 2025: Freedom Tech,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/the-mit-bitcoin-expo-2025-freedom-tech,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:55:22 GMT","The MIT Bitcoin Club—a passionate coalition of students, alumni, researchers, and community members—presents the 12th annual MIT Bitcoin Expo (April 5–6, 2025), a landmark event exploring how Bitcoin and freedom technologies empower individuals worldwide. With just 5 days remaining, this student-led initiative continues its decade-long tradition of bridging academia, activism, and technical innovation.



Why This Matters



Born from MIT’s 2014 Bitcoin Project—which distributed Bitcoin to undergraduates to study adoption—the expo has evolved into a critical forum for sovereignty-focused dialogue. This year’s agenda of freedom tech focuses on physical liberation through technology.

Speakers like Zimbabwean activist Evan Mawarire (#ThisFlag movement leader) and Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja will dissect Bitcoin’s role in resisting authoritarian control and enabling real-world escape from oppression. This is not about the cryptoeconomics, nor about the meme coins. This is about life, liberty, and Bitcoin.



What to Expect



Day 1: Dive into freedom tech fundamentals with Mawarire’s keynote “Why Freedom Tech Matters” and Dryja’s analysis of Bitcoin’s resilience against nation-states. Corporate adoption takes center stage with Marathon Digital’s Paul Giordano and Bitcoin Core developers like Gloria Zhao. Get more technical in the afternoon with topics such as consensus cleanup, poisoning attacks, censorship resistance, Bitcoin Pipes, etc.

Day 2: Shift to global impact with Mauricio Bartolomeo (exfiltration via Bitcoin) and panels featuring activists from Venezuela, Russia, and Togo. Technical deep dives include MIT’s Neha Narula on scaling self-custody and Steven Roose’s covenant softfork proposals. Other topics include future of freedom tech, quantum resistance, covenant soft fork, Tor project, etc.



Beyond Theory: The Freedom Tech Hackathon



Running parallel (April 4–6), this $10,000-prize event challenges developers to build tools for privacy, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty14. Past projects have secured funding from industry leaders—proof of MIT’s “Mind and Hand” ethos in action4.

Additionally, Anna Chekhovich from the HRF will run a workshop on Bitcoin self-custody 101.



Why Attend?

This event prioritizes substance over spectacle. Tickets remain accessible, speakers present pro bono, and discussions tackle pressing questions:



– How can Bitcoin enable physical escape from authoritarian regimes?



– What technical upgrades strengthen its anti-censorship properties?



– Can corporations adopt Bitcoin without compromising its ethos?



With 40+ speakers and 500+ expected attendees, the expo offers unparalleled networking with developers, activists, and academics shaping Bitcoin’s future.

The bill is an amendment to existing state income tax laws, and the exact language in the proposed legislation is as follows:

“Any sale of [b]itcoin by an individual or business in Rhode Island shall be exempt from state taxation if the total value of sales is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per diem. The limit of the state tax exempt [b]itcoin transaction shall not exceed ten (10) sales per a thirty (30) day cycle.”

And the bill defines a “sale of [b]itcoin” as “any transaction in which [b]itcoin is sold or exchanged for another form of value, such as fiat currency or other physical or digital assets.”

The bill also clarifies that this exemption only applies at the state level and that it doesn’t affect federal tax obligations.

Under the bill, individuals and businesses who engage with these types of tax-exempt bitcoin transactions are responsible for keeping records of these transactions, including the total value of sales per day, and should be prepared to provide these records to the Rhode Island’s department of revenue for audit or compliance purposes.

In a slide deck prepared by the Rhode Island Blockchain Council that was shared with Bitcoin Magazine, Chris Perrotta, Chairman of the Council, wrote that the passing of Bill S. 0451 would help to reduce friction for digital asset payments.

He stated that “current tax implications of spending BTC hamper its utility for Rhode Island citizens and stifle economic activity.”

Perrotta also noted that the passing of this bill would stimulate blockchain-based economic activity in the state, making Rhode Island one of the states at the forefront of this technology.

What is more, he also proposed that small businesses accept bitcoin for products and services as a means to stimulate economic growth.

Thus far, no other U.S. states have introduced comparable bills.

At the federal level, the only bill that has proposed something similar is the Lummis-Gillibrand “Responsible Financial Innovation Act”, which provides a de minimus tax exemption on bitcoin transactions valued up to $200.",bitcoinmagazine

According to a March 31 SEC filing, Strategy purchased the coins for $1.92 billion last week, or around $86,969 per bitcoin. This boosted the company’s total bitcoin treasury to 528,185 BTC acquired for $35.63 billion.

At bitcoin’s current price of approximately $82,000, Strategy’s holdings are now valued at over $43 billion. Michael Saylor continues aggressively accumulating bitcoin.

The recent buys were funded mostly through issuing $1.2 billion of new MSTR common shares. By buying bitcoin funded via equity, Strategy converts its corporate treasury from dollars into hard assets. The company has pioneered using its balance sheet as a leveraged play on bitcoin’s rise.

Strategy’s average purchase price per bitcoin has also steadily increased to $67,458. This shows Saylor is still willing to pay premium prices to keep stacking sats.

However, the gap between Strategy’s average entry price and bitcoin’s market price has narrowed significantly during this prolonged cool-off. The company may soon be buying BTC below its cost basis if prices continue drifting lower.

Regardless, Strategy remains ultra bullish on bitcoin over the long term. The company expects to benefit from bitcoin’s appreciation over decades against fiat currencies being devalued by inflation.",bitcoinmagazine

The deal brings 61,000 mining machines from Hut 8 into American Bitcoin. The company also plans to build its own “bitcoin reserve” by retaining mined coins.

Eric Trump, who will be American Bitcoin’s chief strategy officer, likened bitcoin’s hard asset properties to real estate. By leveraging Hut 8’s low-cost North American data centers, American Bitcoin aims to mine bitcoin more efficiently than competitors. This could become a key advantage as mining gets more difficult over time.

The Trump family has aggressively embraced bitcoin and crypto lately through various projects.

American Bitcoin will remain separate from the Trump Organization empire. But its bitcoin reserve plans align with President Trump’s vision for the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve.

Bitcoin mining has faced environmental criticism for its massive energy use. But Eric Trump believes American Bitcoin’s access to low U.S. energy costs will give it an edge.

By focusing on mining, American Bitcoin appears to be a more serious bitcoin bet compared to Trump’s meme coins and stablecoin talk. The family’s rising bitcoin and crypto profile mirrors the growing mainstream acceptance.",bitcoinmagazine
https://bitcoinmagazine.com,The Bitcoin Advantage: Leveraging the Asset for Value Creation,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/the-bitcoin-advantage-leveraging-the-asset-for-value-creation,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:41:40 GMT","Bitcoin has long been touted as a revolutionary asset class, offering much more than just a means of exchanging value. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has gained widespread recognition for its ability to preserve wealth, unlock liquidity, and provide a framework for risk-managed wealth growth. Its scarcity, decentralization, and robust security make it an ideal choice for savvy investors and businesses seeking to build long-term financial security.

But how exactly can Bitcoin be leveraged to create value? This article explores the strategies for preserving bitcoin’s value, unlocking liquidity without selling, and growing wealth while managing risks, all while maximizing the asset’s potential for value creation.

SALT Lending makes these strategies accessible with our bitcoin-backed loan platform—designed to help you preserve wealth and unlock liquidity without selling.

First, What is the Bitcoin Advantage?

The Bitcoin Advantage lies in its ability to serve as a store of value, source of liquidity, and financial hedge, all within a decentralized and secure framework. Unlike most traditional assets, bitcoin can easily be leveraged as collateral, allowing individuals to access liquidity without selling and forfeiting potential future gains. As bitcoin adoption grows, its role in wealth management, lending, and financial independence continues to expand, reinforcing its position as a cornerstone of the modern digital economy.

To fully appreciate bitcoin’s potential, we must first understand what sets it apart as a financial asset.

Section 1: Value Preservation – Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value

Bitcoin’s long-term value starts with understanding how core principles like scarcity, decentralization, and self-sovereignty ensures security while maximizing wealth preservation. This section outlines the foundation for how you can think about smart accumulation, secure storage, and long-term financial planning.

Value-Protecting Fundamentals: Core Principles to Bitcoin Value

Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition is underpinned by several fundamental principles. These principles not only ensure Bitcoin’s potential for value preservation but also offer exciting opportunities for liquidity access, risk management, and wealth growth. Let’s break down why these principles matter and how they play a crucial role in wealth creation, especially from a lending and borrowing standpoint:

Scarcity and Fixed Supply: Bitcoin’s protocol caps the total supply at 21 million coins, a limit expected to be reached around the year 2140. As of early 2025, over 19 million bitcoin have been mined, underscoring its scarcity. This finite supply contrasts with traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, potentially leading to inflation.

This finite supply contrasts with traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, potentially leading to inflation. Decentralization: Operating on a global, peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin lacks a central authority, reducing the risk of manipulation and censorship. This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the network, aligning with the principles of financial sovereignty.

This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the network, aligning with the principles of financial sovereignty. Security and Immutability: Bitcoin’s blockchain is secured by a vast network of miners who validate transactions, making it one of the most secure digital ledgers. Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and trust.

Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and trust. Self-Sovereignty: Bitcoin allows individuals to hold and transfer value without intermediaries, granting users full control over their assets. This autonomy is particularly valuable in regions with unstable financial systems or restrictive capital controls.

SALT Lending is all about keeping bitcoin safe and making borrowing simple. With smarter security and borrower-friendly lending, they’re making Bitcoin-backed loans safer, faster, and easier for everyone.

Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy: Smart Strategic Stacking for Maximum Value

A well-planned approach to acquiring bitcoin can significantly impact long-term wealth preservation. By adopting disciplined strategies, investors can navigate volatility, optimize their holdings, and strengthen their financial position over time. Here’s how to accumulate bitcoin with confidence and efficiency:

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, helps mitigate volatility and reduces the emotional impact of market fluctuations.

Holding Mentality (HODLing): Resisting the urge to sell during downturns allows investors to benefit from bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential. Historical data shows that bitcoin has experienced significant growth over extended periods, despite short-term volatility.

Custody Management Confidence: Secure Storage Solutions That Protect Holdings

It is important to understand security strategies and tools while managing your collateral for maximum wealth preservation. This section lays out key considerations when thinking about custody management and secure storage for bitcoin:

Cold Storage Solutions: Cold storage refers to storing bitcoin offline, making it inaccessible to hackers. Hardware wallets and paper wallets are popular cold storage methods that provide a high level of security.

These services provide advanced security protocols to ensure the safety of large bitcoin holdings. Backup and Redundancy: It’s important to have secure backups of private keys to prevent the accidental loss of access. A secure backup strategy should include multiple copies of private keys stored in different, secure locations.

While preserving bitcoin’s value is crucial, what if you need liquidity without selling? That’s where bitcoin-backed borrowing comes in.

Section 2: Unlocked Liquidity – Access Cash Without Selling Bitcoin

While bitcoin’s value proposition lies in its ability to preserve wealth, there may come a time when liquidity is needed for other investments or expenses. Instead of selling bitcoin, which could mean missing out on future gains, holders can access liquidity without parting with their BTC. One of the most effective ways to do this is through bitcoin-backed borrowing.

This is where SALT Lending comes in. Our lending platform allows you to access the value of your bitcoin without selling it—perfect for maintaining long-term upside while funding other opportunities.

Bitcoin-Backed Borrowing: Use BTC as Collateral to Unlock Liquidity

Bitcoin-backed loans allow bitcoin holders to unlock liquidity without selling their holdings. These loans use bitcoin as collateral, offering a number of key benefits:

Capital Efficiency: By using bitcoin as collateral, investors can access fiat currency without having to liquidate their BTC. This strategy allows for capital efficiency, enabling holders to retain their bitcoin exposure while unlocking liquidity for other investments or business ventures.

This strategy allows for capital efficiency, enabling holders to retain their bitcoin exposure while unlocking liquidity for other investments or business ventures. Quick Access to Funds: Bitcoin-backed loans are typically faster to process than traditional loans. Because bitcoin’s value is readily accessible and collateralized, the approval process is streamlined, providing quicker access to funds.

Bitcoin-backed loans are typically faster to process than traditional loans. Because bitcoin’s value is readily accessible and collateralized, the approval process is streamlined, providing quicker access to funds. No Credit Score Requirements: Traditional loans often depend on personal credit scores and financial history, but bitcoin-backed loans rely solely on the value of the collateral. This opens up liquidity options for those who may not qualify for conventional financing.

Tax-Efficient Management: Access Liquidity While Maximizing Tax Efficiency

Selling bitcoin triggers capital gains taxes, which can erode the value of the sale. By using bitcoin-backed loans instead, holders can access cash without triggering tax liabilities:

Deferred Tax Liabilities: Since bitcoin is not sold in a loan arrangement, no capital gains taxes are incurred at the time of borrowing. This allows holders to defer taxes and retain the full value of their bitcoin investment.

Since bitcoin is not sold in a loan arrangement, no capital gains taxes are incurred at the time of borrowing. This allows holders to defer taxes and retain the full value of their bitcoin investment. Tax-Deductible Interest: In some jurisdictions, interest on loans may be tax-deductible. This creates an additional incentive to borrow against bitcoin rather than sell it, making the strategy even more tax-efficient.

Portfolio Retention: By borrowing against bitcoin, investors retain their BTC holdings, ensuring that they continue to benefit from its appreciation without sacrificing exposure to future gains.

Leverage Management: Align Borrowing to Risk Profile and Hedge Against Dips

When borrowing against bitcoin, it’s important to manage leverage carefully. Here are some strategies to mitigate risks associated with borrowing:

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Management: Maintaining a conservative LTV ratio ensures that the value of bitcoin used as collateral remains above the loan amount. This reduces the risk of margin calls, especially in volatile market conditions.

Maintaining a conservative LTV ratio ensures that the value of bitcoin used as collateral remains above the loan amount. This reduces the risk of margin calls, especially in volatile market conditions. Strategic Loan Repayments: As bitcoin appreciates, borrowers can use their gains to repay the loan and reduce their exposure. This proactive strategy helps mitigate risks during market downturns.

As bitcoin appreciates, borrowers can use their gains to repay the loan and reduce their exposure. This proactive strategy helps mitigate risks during market downturns. Hedging Strategies: Investors can use options or futures contracts to hedge against potential price declines, protecting themselves from significant downside risks while using their bitcoin as collateral.

Section 3: Risk-Managed Wealth – Grow Wealth While Minimizing Downside Risks

Bitcoin offers immense potential for wealth creation, but its volatility can present risks to long-term wealth preservation. To maximize the potential for growth while minimizing downside risks, it’s crucial to implement a risk-managed wealth strategy.

Long-Term Planning: Grow and Preserve Wealth Over Time

A long-term wealth strategy ensures that bitcoin’s value is maximized over the years while managing exposure to market fluctuations:

Retirement Planning: A portion of bitcoin holdings can be set aside for retirement planning, providing a secure long-term store of value. As traditional retirement accounts face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin can offer an alternative that provides growth potential and independence.

As traditional retirement accounts face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin can offer an alternative that provides growth potential and independence. Trust and Estate Planning: Bitcoin wealth can be passed down to future generations through proper estate planning. Establishing a trust that includes bitcoin holdings ensures that assets are transferred smoothly, preserving wealth for heirs.

Bitcoin wealth can be passed down to future generations through proper estate planning. Establishing a trust that includes bitcoin holdings ensures that assets are transferred smoothly, preserving wealth for heirs. Diversified Growth Strategies: While bitcoin can provide substantial upside, diversification remains key. Combining bitcoin with traditional assets such as real estate or stocks can help balance risk and stability while still benefiting from bitcoin’s growth potential.

SALT’s platform supports these strategies by enabling you to borrow strategically, preserve long-term holdings, and manage your exposure to volatility—all without sacrificing access to capital.

Reinvestment Strategies: Optimize Returns by Compounding Growth

Compounding is one of the most powerful ways to grow wealth over time. Here’s how bitcoin holders can reinvest to optimize returns:

Staking and Yield Generation: Although bitcoin itself isn’t stakeable in the traditional sense, some platforms offer BTC-backed yield products. These can provide an opportunity for holders to generate passive income by leveraging their Bitcoin holdings.

Compounding Growth Over Market Cycles: During bull markets, bitcoin’s price tends to appreciate rapidly. By reinvesting profits during these periods, holders can significantly increase their bitcoin holdings and overall wealth.

Balanced Portfolio Strategy: Diversify While Maintaining Bitcoin Upside

Incorporating bitcoin into a well-diversified portfolio can help manage volatility while enabling long-term growth. By balancing stable assets with high-growth opportunities, investors can strengthen their portfolios against market fluctuations and align with varying risk appetites. A carefully structured mix of assets helps weather economic shifts while positioning for bitcoin’s growth potential.

Here’s how to build a balanced portfolio:

Alternative Asset Allocation: A balanced portfolio should include bitcoin alongside other assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This ensures that the portfolio can weather market volatility while benefiting from bitcoin’s potential growth.

The rebrand also introduces Aster’s future token ticker $AST, which will replace the current $APX token. This follows the earlier merger between Astherus and decentralized perp protocol APX Finance.

APX and Astherus have collectively processed over $258 billion in decentralized perpetual trading volume to date. Building on this foundation, Aster introduces two seamless trading modes:

Simple Mode : On-chain, one-click, MEV-resistant perpetual trading

: On-chain, one-click, MEV-resistant perpetual trading Pro Mode: Advanced order book interface with deep liquidity, extremely low trading fees, and advanced trading tools

Aster is now strategically positioned to challenge industry leaders like Hyperliquid, with a roadmap that includes the integration of zero-knowledge proofs, a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain, and intent-based architecture to simplify the DeFi trading experience.

“The rebrand is central to our ambition of leading the DeFi perps market. Our strategic focus on perpetual trading will also ensure Aster’s long-term sustainability,” said Dust, a Core Contributor of Aster. “Our roots in APX and YZi Labs gave us a strong foundation in both trading infrastructure and yield strategies. Aster will continue to prioritize top-tier user experience, liquidity, and security.”

In line with its rebrand, Aster has significantly upgraded its platform, including:

A fully redesigned homepage reflecting its new identity

Enhanced trading UI and UX with seamless switching between modes

New fee structure: Maker 0.01% , Taker 0.035%

, Deep liquidity provided in partnership with top-tier market makers

provided in partnership with top-tier market makers A referral program offering 20% commission , with a tiered system in the works

offering , with a in the works Rh Points Program , launching within the next 2 weeks, where traders earn points redeemable for future airdrops

, launching within the next 2 weeks, where traders earn points redeemable for future airdrops Welcome all traders to try the platform just like CZ did – with a special $10,000 trading campaign targeting users from other leading perp DEXs

In the long term, Aster is building toward the launch of its own Layer 1 blockchain, optimized for trading performance, and will introduce Aster-native blockchain explorers to bring transparency and insight to on-chain trading activity.

As part of the rebrand, Aster is introducing a new token ticker, $AST, to represent the platform’s evolving identity. While the token listing is planned for the future, Aster’s top priority is building world-class product infrastructure. $AST will play a central role in the ecosystem once the foundation is in place.

Aster will continue to support Astherus’ popular yield products under Aster Earn, including the BNB liquid staking derivative asBNB and yield-bearing stablecoin USDF.

Further ecosystem partnerships, airdrop details, and token mapping timelines will be announced in the coming weeks and months.

About Aster

Aster is a next-generation decentralized perpetual exchange built for everyone. It offers MEV-free, one-click trading with up to 1001x leverage in Simple Mode (BNB Chain, Arbitrum), and full-featured, pro-grade tools in Pro Mode (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana).

https://decrypt.co,The 'Ghibligeddon': People Are 'Melting' OpenAI's GPUs With Studio Ghibli Memes,https://decrypt.co/312482/people-melting-openai-gpus-studio-ghibli-memes,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:32:16 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

OpenAI's GPUs are buckling under unprecedented demand for its new image generation feature, forcing the company to implement emergency limits as users create millions of anime-inspired illustrations. The company’s computing infrastructure has been pushed to the breaking point just days after rolling out the capability in its latest GPT-4o model.

The image generator, which transforms text prompts or existing photos into detailed artwork, has sparked particular enthusiasm for Studio Ghibli-style transformations. Over the last few days, users have flooded social media with pastel-colored landscapes and whimsical character portraits reminiscent of films like ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro.""

""Can y'all please chill on generating images. This is insane, our team needs sleep,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman whine-tweeted early today.

can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep — Sam Altman (@sama) March 30, 2025

That came on the heels of his initial complaint Thursday—“our GPTs are melting”— after the new image-generating capabilities had rolled out and some genius discovered that you could take any photo and turn it into a cutesy Ghibli-style image.

During the ensuing weekend, more and more people tried to Ghblify everything from 9/11 photos to Adolf Hitler. The viral phenomenon spread beyond tech enthusiasts to the White House, which published a Ghibli-style meme making fun of a Latin American woman arrested for drug trafficking.

Finally, OpenAI shut off access to its image generator in some areas, while imposing rate limits of 3 generations per hour for others. That didn’t go over well with users who complained about arbitrary limits and even hallucinated restrictions.

ChatGPT is pushing back on image generation requests. Image: Decrypt

The situation seemed to get a bit more under control Monday with OpenAI announcing that free users—who previously had more freedom of generations with the previous DALL·E 3 image generator—would be limited to just three images per day, if and when the feature becomes publicly available.

Altman may be crying all the way to the bank. Ghibligeddon apparently drove more than 1 million people to sign up for ChatGPT in one hour Monday, though how many of those subscribed to the premium service was not disclosed. Search data shows that as soon as the new model was released last week, the term ""ChatGPT"" briefly overtook ""Google"" in Google Trends.

So why is Ghibligeddon “melting” OpenAI’s servers? GPT-4o's image generation differs fundamentally from previous AI art tools, using more computing power. That’s because most image generators use “diffusion models” that start with a bunch of random pixels, and change them until they form a real representation of an image.

GPT-4o employs an autoregressive approach that generates images pixel by pixel in sequence—predicting what pixel comes next—in the same way it does text-based reasoning. For images, this technique produces more accurate details and better text rendering. But it’s a huge lift for OpenAI’s GPUs.

It’s kind of like the difference between creating an oil painting and creating a tile mosaic.

Each image request triggers complex mathematical operations across many GPU cores working in parallel, consuming power and generating heat that threatens hardware if run continuously at maximum capacity.

The computing crunch comes at a challenging time for OpenAI financially. Despite Altman’s claims of the company “doing really great,” the AI unicorn reportedly loses billions annually, with projections suggesting these losses could reach $14 billion by 2026. The infrastructure demands of maintaining image generation capacity while continuing to develop new AI capabilities put additional pressure on the company's resources.

And it’s unlikely that dealing with memes is the revolutionary use case that could make a multibillion dollar business profitable, but who are we to judge?

For now, users eager to transform their photos into Ghibli-style artwork may need to wait their turn as OpenAI works to strengthen its infrastructure. The company hasn't specified when full capacity might be restored, saying only that the optimization work ""hopefully won't be long.""",decrypt
https://decrypt.co,Trump's Crypto Dealings Are Making Regulation 'More Complicated': House Financial Services Chair,https://decrypt.co/312474/trump-crypto-dealings-regulation-more-complicated-house,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:38:52 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR) said Monday that the personal cryptocurrency dealings of President Donald Trump and his family have made drafting legislation for the novel sector “more complicated,” in a rare rebuke of the president’s personal activities by a key member of congressional Republican leadership.

Hill specifically named the president’s meme coin and stablecoin projects as two endeavors that have negatively impacted the work of lawmakers racing to create rules for the digital assets industry.

“They have made our work more complicated,” Hill told reporters Monday, in reference to those projects.

Since returning to power, Trump and his inner circle have rapidly expanded their crypto portfolios at the same time that the president is determining policies with direct impact on those same assets and sectors. In recent months, Trump and business partners have launched a Solana meme coin and an Ethereum decentralized finance platform called World Liberty Financial, which recently announced its own stablecoin.

Meme coins are speculative crypto assets that derive their value from cultural significance—and which the SEC recently likened to “collectibles”—while stablecoins are digital assets designed to keep a steady peg to the U.S. dollar.

Trump and his family have already netted hundreds of millions of dollars from such endeavors; unrealized earnings from the same projects number in the billions.

Trump’s existing businesses have also aggressively expanded their exposure to crypto in the same period. Last week, the company that runs the president’s Truth Social media platform announced a partnership with Crypto.com to offer crypto ETFs.

Just this morning, the president’s son, Eric and Don Jr, inked a deal to launch their own Bitcoin mining venture.

At the same time, the president has signed multiple executive orders with direct impact on the crypto industry. Further, White House officials are currently, at his direction, working with Republicans in Congress to help shape key pieces of legislation that will create, for the first time, an American crypto regulatory regime.

Earlier this month, the president’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, dismissed the president’s personal crypto endeavors as “irrelevant” to industry regulation.

But it appears patience among congressional Republicans over the scope of those lucrative schemes may be waning. The House Financial Services Committee is set to mark up its version of proposed stablecoin legislation, the STABLE Act, on Wednesday, and will soon consider a newer version of a market structure bill, according to comments made by Chair Hill Monday.

A parallel stablecoin bill is also currently making its way through the Senate. Such bills, if passed into law, would for the first time offer a clear path to legal certainty for a variety of crypto projects and companies, based on their compliance with new rules currently being ironed out. Their passage is anticipated to bring with it a wave of investment and support for the crypto industry from traditional finance institutions that until now have been waiting on the sidelines.

Though those bills possess bipartisan support, Trump’s personal business dealings have offered resistant Democrats a convenient means to protest their passage.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) denounced the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial stablecoin, USD1, as a “grift,” and tied the project to pending crypto legislation.

“Congress should step up and fix the current stablecoin bill moving through the Senate that will make it easier for Trump—and Elon Musk—to take control of your money,” she said.",decrypt
https://decrypt.co,"Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Prices Seesaw Ahead of Trump’s Tariff Deadline",https://decrypt.co/312464/crypto-prices-seesaw-ahead-of-trumps-tariff-deadline,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:10:42 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The price of Bitcoin fell to a two-week low on Monday before recovering some losses, as other major cryptocurrencies also seesawed two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.

The leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.

The upturn comes as investors look toward April 2, when Trump plans on announcing the tariffs in a ceremony scheduled for the White House Rose Garden. The crypto market has been teetering amid widespread market jitters as investors reel from Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Bitcoin’s price was recently down 23% from its record high of $108,800 set on Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground.

Bitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. A week ago, it changed hands around $88,500, as it appeared Trump might impose more limited measures.

After tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD foresee an 80% chance that the index will be at 30 or above on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)

Ethereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month.

The volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager noted in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.”

Some analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that Bitcoin’s price has bottomed. Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently.

Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently changing hands at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%.

Bitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. The tech-heavy index and Bitcoin’s price have each fallen over 5% in the past week.

""BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”

Monday marks the end to what has been a tumultuous quarter for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track to finish down 11% from the beginning of January, while Ethereum is slated to record a 45% fall, according to the crypto data provider CoinGlass.

Willemstad, Curaçao, Netherlands, March 31st, 2025, GamingWire

Cloudbet is opening no-limit betting for April's Dota tournament blitz, seizing the moment as the start of the year shapes up to be Dota 2's busiest season outside of The International. With ESL One Raleigh 2025 (April 7-13) and PGL Wallachia Season 4 (April 18-26) both offering million-dollar prize pools on the heels of the recent 7.38c patch, competitive Dota is about to get interesting.

This means serious Dota bettors on Cloudbet can now tap into the combined resources of global markets, purpose-built for high-stakes action – meaning serious bettors could potentially win more than the tournaments' champions themselves.

Cloudbet's no-limit bets now cover five essential Dota markets:

Map Handicap – Allows wagers on matches where underdogs are given an advantage. Total Maps – Enables bets on the total number of maps played in a series. Winner – Offers the option to bet on the overall winner of the series. Map Winner – Provides betting on the outcome of individual maps. Correct Map Score – Allows predictions of the final map score for a series.

The timing is particularly notable with the 7.38c patch update that dropped during the FISSURE Universe playoffs — shaking up hero rankings and team strategies right in the middle of high-stakes competitions.

""We're listening to all the feedback in our esports community about how to bring them closer to games all season long."" notes John, the Cloudbet Spokesperson. ""And we're doing that with no-limit bets, and integrating many, many more markets. You can bet on which team gets first blood, first barracks, or first Roshan – markets that go beyond the basics but are core to the Dota experience. These are milestone events that make grown adults scream at their monitors, so why not cash in too?”

New Cloudbet users will also have access to the Welcome Package, featuring up to $2500 in cash, ongoing Rakeback Rewards, and straight cash rewards through the Vault. Once claimed, users enter Cloudbet Rewards, the generous loyalty program designed for consistent bettors.

While traditional sportsbooks often limit the size of bets, especially in esports, Cloudbet offering no-limit betting on major Dota 2 markets is an industry first. In high-integrity traditional sports like the NFL and English Premier League, betting limits can reach into the millions. By extending its no-limit betting, already available on major sports, to Dota 2, Cloudbet aims to bring esports into the top tier of the sports betting world. For Dota fans looking to add another dimension to their viewing experience, Cloudbet's no-limit betting offers a way to back predictions with real conviction – and potentially serious returns.

https://decrypt.co,Trump's SEC Is Ending Crypto Lawsuits and Investigations—These Are the Biggest,https://decrypt.co/308273/trump-sec-ending-crypto-lawsuits-investigations,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:29:01 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The momentum has shifted in the yearslong battle between top crypto companies and protocols and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the new Trump administration.

The regulator, which now has a crypto task force led by longtime industry advocate Hester Peirce, is moving away from what Pierce and others have called “regulation by enforcement” to less hostile engagements with crypto.

Thus far, those words have rung true with the SEC recently backing away from fights with multiple top crypto companies. Here are the SEC's biggest pivots, reversals, and exits so far under Trump.

Binance

Following a joint request, a U.S. district judge granted Binance a 60-day pause in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC, allowing both parties an opportunity to reassess the shifting regulatory landscape.

The stay is in effect until April 14, at which point both parties will need to submit a status report. And since the stay was granted, the SEC has ended many other investigations and lawsuits, which may hint at what to expect from the Binance resolution.

The exchange has dealt with alleged securities, money laundering, and sanctions compliance issues since at least 2023, which led to two separate settlements for $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

Crypto rulemaking case

On February 17, the SEC voluntarily dropped an appeal in a case revolving around the regulator's previous attempts to extend securities laws to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and users.

The appeal was made after a federal judge in Texas called the regulator's expanded definitions unlawful, citing that it was conflating DeFi traders with financial brokers.

The dropped appeal ensures that DeFi protocols do not need to register with the SEC as securities exchanges, leading the Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith to call it a “complete and total victory.”

Coinbase

Leading American crypto exchange Coinbase had its lawsuit officially dismissed by the SEC in February.

The suit, which was filed in 2023, alleged that the platform knowingly operated as an unregistered securities exchange, specifically calling out tokens like Solana and Polygon in the process.

In its statement on the move, the Commission said that the decision “rests on its judgement that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.”

Prior to official approval, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said of the dismissal “there will be no settlement or compromise—a wrong will simply be made right.""

OpenSea

The SEC has ended its investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea, the firm said in February, dropping charges that alleged it operated as an unlicensed securities brokerage. The platform indicated it received a Wells notice from the regulator in August 2024, signaling the SEC would take action against it.

“This is a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space,” said OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer. “Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward—one that misinterprets the law and slows innovation.”

Robinhood Crypto

An SEC investigation into Robinhood—one which the platform claims should never have been opened—ended with no action taken by the regulator.

“As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed,” said Robinhood's Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer Dan Gallagher. “We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC.""

The firm was notified of a potential enforcement action in May 2024 when it received a Wells notice from the Gary Gensler-led SEC.

Uniswap Labs

Uniswap Labs, the creator of Ethereum decentralized exchange Uniswap, said in February that the SEC has ended its investigation into the organization without filing any charges.

Like other leading crypto organizations, Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice in April 2024 which alleged it operated as an unregistered securities broker, exchange, and clearing agency, and that had enabled the sale of an unregistered security.

With the investigation said to be over, all of the aforementioned claims have now been dropped, said its CEO Hayden Adams.

“They went after us despite having no clear legal basis, as part of a strategy of arbitrary enforcement to try to force DeFi into a regulatory framework that doesn’t fit—all while refusing to provide clear rules or a path to compliance,” he posted on X. “This is a huge win, not just for Uniswap Labs but for DeFi as a whole.”

Gemini Trust

A two-year investigation into Gemini Trust about the unregistered sale of securities ended last week without an enforcement action from the Commission.

Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss noted the milestone, but said that it “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.”

Winklevoss estimated that the regulator cost his firm “tens of millions in legal fees and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation.""

Justin Sun/Tron

Like Binance, Justin Sun and Tron filed a joint motion alongside the SEC to temporarily stay the regulator's case in the hopes of finding a resolution.

The case stems back to 2023 when the SEC alleged that Sun made more than 600,000 wash trades to create misleading Tron (TRX) volumes that led to around $32 million in profits. The joint filing indicates a resolution would be beneficial on account of “conserving judicial resources.”

Consensys

MetaMask and Linea parent company, Consensys, had its case officially dismissed on March 27, which focused on staking features within MetaMask.

“We were committed to fighting this suit until the bitter end but welcome this outcome,” said Consensys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin on X when it was expected the Commission would drop the case. “Now we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys.”

(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Kraken

The Commission agreed to drop its latest lawsuit into the American centralized exchange Kraken, the firm said on March 3, pending commissioner approval. That approval came on March 27, officially dropping the case.

The SEC originally alleged that the firm violated securities laws with its staking-as-a-service system. That suit was settled in February 2023, with Kraken agreeing to pay a $30 million fine.

But the regulator sued the platform again in November 2023, alleging it was operating as an unregistered securities exchange, dealer, and broker. That lawsuit is the one that it “agreed in principle” to drop.

In conclusion, the exchange indicated there is “no admission of wrongdoing, no penalties paid, and no changes to our business.”

Yuga Labs

Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs announced on March 3 that the SEC closed its investigation into the company.

The investigation had been ongoing since 2022, with the regulator scrutinizing the company’s NFT offerings, as well as the ApeCoin token launch. The Ethereum token’s creation was officially created to the “ApeCoin DAO.”

“This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward,” the company posted on X. “NFTs are not securities.”

Horizen Labs

A representative for Horizen Labs confirmed to Decrypt on March 4 that an investigation into the company—due to its affiliation with the ApeCoin launch—was ended by the SEC with a recommendation of no enforcement action.

“I can say personally how much of a weight off our shoulders this is for those who just want to build and always try to do the right thing,” CEO Rob Viglione said. “Horizen Labs could have gone offshore, like many did, but we chose to stay in the U.S. despite the war on crypto.”

Cumberland DRW

Market maker Cumberland’s case was officially dropped alongside a pair of other crypto cases on March 27. The Commission brought a suit against the firm in October 2024, alleging it acted as an unregistered dealer of securities.

“As a firm deeply committed to the principles of integrity and transparency, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the SEC to help shape a future where technological advancements and regulatory clarity go hand-in-hand,” it posted on X when it first announced the joint filing to drop the case.

BitClout

The SEC and Department of Justice both agreed to drop cases against BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji, after the agencies alleged he defrauded investors, with the SEC claiming that he perpetrated a ""multi-million-dollar fraudulent crypto asset scheme.”

BitClout, a social network that tokenized Twitter (now X) accounts, was backed by notable crypto investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures.

Ripple

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on March 19 that the SEC’s case against the firm is over, with a Ripple spokesperson telling Decrypt that the conclusion is still pending approval by SEC commissioners—similar to other recent case dismissals.

“I'm finally able to announce that this case has ended,” Garlinghouse said in a video to his followers on X.

The longest-standing battle between the regulator and a crypto firm stemmed back to 2021 allegations about the unregistered sale of securities with XRP. In 2023, a partial ruling fell mostly in favor of Ripple, but the SEC later appealed. According to Garlinghouse, that appeal is now dropped—though as of this writing, the SEC has not confirmed that announcement.

Crypto.com

Crypto.com sued the SEC in October 2024 after it received a Wells notice from the regulator over potential securities violations.

But now the Commission has ended its investigation into the platform and will file no enforcement action.

The SEC’s investigation into https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR has been closed with no action being taken against https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR. — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) March 27, 2025

“We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action or settlement,” said Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer of Crypto.com in a statement. “Compliance and integrity are core to Crypto.com’s business and we are excited to work with soon-to-be-confirmed Chair Atkins and the rest of the Commission on our long-awaited desire for legislation and rulemaking.”

Immutable

After receiving a Wells notice in October 2024, the Ethereum-based gaming company announced on March 25 that the SEC had concluded its investigation into the firm.

The investigation centered on potential securities violations surrounding the sale of IMX tokens in 2021 in which Immutable raised at least $12.5 million.

“That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action,” Immutable posted on X. “This is a huge win - not just for Web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights.”

Hawk Tuah Girl

Haliey Welch, better known as the ""Hawk Tuah"" girl, told TMZ that the SEC’s investigation into her meme coin debacle is now over.

“For the past few months, I've been cooperating with all the authorities and attorneys, and finally, that work is complete,” Welch told the outlet.

In December the internet celebrity launched a Solana meme coin—HAWK—which went horribly wrong, leading to allegations of a rug pull as the token's price collapsed very quickly after launch. The team behind the token denied any wrongdoing.

https://decrypt.co,Crocodilus Malware Has Been Draining Crypto Wallets on Android,https://decrypt.co/312378/crocodilus-malware-draining-crypto-wallets-android,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 18:02:40 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Android users beware: A newly discovered piece of malware is targeting smartphone crypto wallets.

Uncovered by fraud prevention firm ThreatFabric, the “Crocodilus” mobile banking trojan employs tools including remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting through accessibility logging to trick crypto holders into handing over their wallet seed phrase.

The malware “is masquerading as crypto-related apps and involves specific social engineering techniques to make victims reveal the secrets stored inside cryptocurrency wallet applications,” Aleksandar Eremin, head of mobile threat intelligence at ThreatFabric, told Decrypt. He added that it’s pointing to the “specific interest of the actors behind it in targeting users of cryptocurrency wallets.”

Crucially, this threat tricks Android users into providing the seed phrase for their own cryptocurrency wallet. It does this by issuing a warning that asks users to back up their key to avoid losing access.

ThreatFabric said Crocodilus is being distributed through a proprietary dropper that bypasses security protections on Android 13 or later.

Once this dropper installs the malware, without triggering Play Protect, it requests Accessibility Service permissions. That allows it to bypass the Accessibility Service restrictions, enabling it to deploy a screen overlay to gain passwords.

The malware shows users a fake warning message that reads: “Back up your wallet key in the settings within 12 hours. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet.”

Crocodilus also works as a remote access trojan (RAT), meaning operators can navigate the user interface, swipe using gesture control and even take screenshots. According to ThreatFabric, this allows the malware operator to use Google Authenticator to access two-factor authentication passcodes.

The malware does all this discreetly by using a black screen overlay, so the phone owner can't actually see what actions are being carried out remotely.

Who is Crocodilus targeting?

At time of publishing it appears that only users in Spain and Turkey have been affected by Crocodilus. The malware was first discovered targeting people in Turkey and Spain, and uses debug language that appears to be in Turkish.

How that initial dropper is downloaded is less clear, according to ThreatFabric, so it could well spread beyond these locations.

According to ThreatFabric, users are tricked into downloading the droppers through malicious sites, social media, fake promotions, text messages and third-party app stores. Android users can mitigate against the risk by only using the Google Play Store to download apps, and not downloading APKs from other sites.

Eremin told Decrypt that despite being a “newcomer to the mobile threat landscape,” Crocodilus’ “rich set of capabilities” could make it a competitor to established malware-as-a-service on underground markets.

Ethereum NFT marketplace X2Y2 is shutting down its trading platform at the end of April, the firm announced Monday, as the development team pivots to the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto.

X2Y2’s smart contracts will persist, so trades can still be executed, but users will not be able to use the website’s front-end after April 30.

“I know this might sting, especially when it comes to token price. X2Y2 tokens were tied to this NFT vision, and as we close this chapter, that's likely to hit hard,” said pseudonymous X2Y2 founder TP in a statement. “I feel that with you, and I'm not here to sugarcoat it.”

2/ What a ride it's been. We peaked as the 2nd largest NFT marketplace behind OpenSea, reached $5.6B in trading volume, and even today stand as the 3rd largest in the space.

The marketplace’s native Ethereum-based token—X2Y2—is down 13% in the last 24 hours to $0.0014 and now trades at a market cap below $540,000. The current price is more than 99% off its all-time high of $4.14 from February 2022.

Once a prominent competitor to major NFT trading platforms like OpenSea and Blur, X2Y2 ranks fourth all-time for Ethereum NFT trading volume, facilitating more than $5.6 billion in transactions according to TokenTerminal.

The marketplace, which routinely saw more than $100 million in weekly NFT trading volumes in 2022, has recently processed around $1 million worth of trades weekly. The volume decline and general lack of interest in NFTs has led the team to discontinue the marketplace moving forward.

“Marketplaces live or die by network effects. We fought tooth and nail to be #1, but after three years, it's clear it's time to move on,” wrote the firm’s founder. “The NFT chapter taught us a lot—most of all, that lasting value beats chasing trends. That lesson's why we're drawing a line here, not a pause or a maybe, but a full stop on X2Y2 as we knew it.”

Despite closing its marketplace, the team is not leaving crypto entirely. Instead it will pivot its focus to the intersection of AI and crypto, primarily focused on “yields in a permissionless way, powered by AI.”

“It's decentralized, it's innovative, and it's built to matter—bull or bear, cycle after cycle. This isn't just another project; it's our shot at creating real, long-term value in crypto, for the broader community we're proud to serve,” TP concluded.

No timeline for the new project was provided. X2Y2 did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

https://decrypt.co,Solana Meme Coin Spikes as Elon Musk Hints at Vine Revival,https://decrypt.co/312454/elon-musk-vine-revival-solana-meme-coin,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:44:43 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The world's richest man Elon Musk appears to have greenlit the revival of old school video app Vine, after an xAI employee announced that the company has acquired the defunct mobile app.

In response, the Pump.fun launched Vine Coin, VINE, created by the app’s co-founder, has spiked 122% over the past three days.

Musk’s love affair with Vine started back in January when he said he was “looking into” bringing back the popular app, amid concerns that TikTok would be banned in the U.S.. Not long after, the co-founder of Vine, Rus Yusupov, launched a Solana meme coin hinting that the app’s return could possibly use the token, prompting it to quickly touch a $498 million market cap.

But that was short-lived. It has since fallen 89% to $55 million.

On Friday, Dane Jacobson, an employee of xAI, the artificial intelligence arm of Musk’s X, said on X that the company now “owns” Vine. He asked his followers what should be done with the app.

Musk responded “feel free to take that on,” with many taking this as the billionaire greenlighting the revival. Yusupov reposted the exchange.

Feel free to take that on — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 29, 2025

Vine Coin pumped 110% from Friday into Saturday to a market cap of $52 million, following the Musk interaction. The token then retraced 41% to $30.55 million on Sunday, before spiking another 80% to $55 million on Monday. Over the entire three day period, the coin climbed 122%, according to DEX Screener.

Polymarket betters believe there is a 24% chance that X relaunches Vine before July, down from 58% at the end of January.

Alongside the launch of Vine Coin, Yusupov created a website of the same name which includes a waitlist. This has spurred on rumors that the popular app will soon return— and might even incorporate the token.

Musk has previously toyed with using cryptocurrencies in his business ventures, including accepting Dogecoin for Tesla vehicles and investing in crypto through his companies. More recently, it was reported that the billionaire was pondering the use of a public blockchain for the Department of Government Efficiency, although this hasn’t come to fruition yet.

Similarly, co-founder of Venmo Iqram Magdon-Ismail has created a podcasting app called JellyJelly that utilizes a Pump.fun token of the same name for a tipping feature. On its January launch, it spiked at a market cap of $248.5 million but has since fallen 94% to a $14.88 million market cap, according to DEX Screener.

Strategy said on Monday that it had recently acquired $1.92 billion worth of Bitcoin, representing the third straight week that the software firm has disclosed purchasing the asset.

After scooping up around 22,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $87,000 per coin, the firm said it now holds 528,185 Bitcoin veiled at $35.6 billion, according to a press release.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm said that it had meanwhile raised $1.2 billion by selling common stock through an at-the-money program unveiled in October, and $1.85 million through the sale of “STRK” perpetual preferred stock, a product introduced in January.

Strategy is authorized to sell $21 billion worth of the Nasdaq-listed product, which features an 8% cumulative dividend that’s payable in either cash or Class A shares. As of Sunday, the company can still issue $20.97 billion worth of its preferred stock. On-chain prediction market Myriad, a unit of Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, forecast a more than 92% probability that Strategy would purchase more Bitcoin during the week starting March 24.

Strategy’s stock price fell more than 3% when markets opened on Monday, dropping below $274, according to Nasdaq, but the stock regained lost ground and was in positive territory more recently.

The price of STRK also fell to $86.26 on Monday morning Eastern Time. Just over a week ago, the product, which began trading in late February, hit an all-time low of $82.

Risk assets, including Bitcoin, have wavered amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. As tensions continued running high ahead of a key tariff deadline, the asset’s price slid as low as $81,350, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko.

The average Bitcoin price that Strategy paid for its recent acquisition is higher than a week prior, when the company said it had bought $584 million worth of Bitcoin around $84,500 per coin.

Strategy’s Bitcoin-buying activity has been heating up for the past three weeks, but it stopped stockpiling the assets for several weeks starting in February, according to Saylor Tracker.

The company purchased around 20,350 Bitcoin over a month ago, paying an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin. The company’s most recent acquisition nearly eclipsed that buy in terms of the dollar amount spent, falling shy by $70 million.

Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings is going all in on BTC again—this time with a $2 billion war chest.

The largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, formerly Marathon Digital, revealed in a Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it entered into an at-the-market (ATM) agreement with major financial firms, including Barclays Capital, BMO Capital Markets, BTIG, and Cantor Fitzgerald.

The agreement allows them to sell up to $2 billion worth of MARA stock “from time to time,” with proceeds earmarked for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.""

As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $81,416.81, down about 2.4% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Analysts said investors have been reacting to heightened trader war tension and signs that inflation could keep inching higher.

Still, investors appeared cautious. Yahoo Finance data shows MARA stock fell 8.58% on March 28 to $12.47 as crypto mining stocks broadly declined amid macroeconomic uncertainty.

The latest offering signals MARA’s intent to double down on a treasury strategy that’s rapidly gaining popularity among corporates—from GameStop’s $1.3 billion convertible note plan to other big players like Semler Scientific and Japan’s MetaPlanet.

The strategy was made famous by Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has turned aggressive Bitcoin accumulation into a corporate identity.

Strategy currently leads all public companies with 506,137 BTC on its balance sheet. MARA is next in line, with 46,374 BTC—worth nearly $3.8 billion at current prices, as per Bitcoin Treasuries data.

Last July, MARA CEO Fred Thiel did say the company was “going full HODL,” committing to retain all mined BTC and even “periodically make strategic purchases on the open market.”

The SEC filing comes just weeks after MARA reported record earnings for Q4 2024, with revenue climbing 37% year-over-year to $214.4 million and net income jumping 248% to $528.3 million.

Despite a 27% drop in BTC production due to last April’s halving, rising Bitcoin prices helped MARA beat expectations with $1.24 in earnings per share.

A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar, last Friday, leaving the immediate area devastated with at least 2,000 people dead and over 3,400 injured, with the number expected to rise as data from neighboring countries such as Thailand comes in.

The 10-kilometer deep quake released energy comparable to hundreds of nuclear explosions, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. It was the most powerful earthquake to have hit Myanmar since 1912 and so far is the second deadliest in the country's modern history.

Rescue efforts continue as hundreds remain missing, including about 80 people at a collapsed construction site in Bangkok.

International response to the situation so far includes the United Nation's $5 million pledge, China's $13.8 million commitment, and support from India, Russia, and the U.S.

How to help?

Relief organizations face significant obstacles. Damaged infrastructure has left many areas inaccessible.

Hospitals report critical shortages of medical supplies amid overwhelming casualties. However, banking restrictions and damaged financial infrastructure could render traditional fund transfers problematic.

Donations made in crypto offer practical advantages in situations such as this, and some in the industry already have efforts underway to help out.

In line with these efforts and in solidarity with those affected, Decrypt searched for some of the major humanitarian organizations that accept crypto for relief efforts.

Here's a list of some organizations that currently receive crypto, and which ones they accept.



For those wishing to donate, the organizations typically provide wallet addresses on their official websites. Traditional donation methods remain equally important alternatives.

While yields across major lending platforms have compressed significantly, innovation at the market's edges demonstrates DeFi's continued maturation and growth.

The Great Yield Compression

DeFi yields have declined sharply across all major lending platforms:

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The vaults.fyi USD benchmark has fallen below 3.1%, below the U.S. 1-month T-bill yield of ~4.3% for the first time since late 2023. This benchmark, a weighted average across four leading markets, approached 14% in late 2024.

Spark has implemented four consecutive rate decreases in 2025 alone. Starting the year at 12.5%, rates were cut to 8.75%, then 6.5%, and now sit at 4.5%.

Aave's stablecoin yields on mainnet are around 3% for USDC and USDT, levels that would have been considered disappointing just months ago.

This compression signals a market that’s cooled significantly from late-2024's exuberance, with subdued borrower demand across major platforms.

The TVL Paradox: Growth Despite Lower Yields

Despite falling yields, major stablecoin vaults have experienced extraordinary growth:

Collectively, the largest vaults on Aave, Sky, Ethena, and Compound have nearly quadrupled in size over the past 12 months, expanding from about $4 billion to about $15 billion in supply-side deposits.

Despite Spark's consecutive rate cuts, TVL has grown more than 3x from the start of 2025.

As yields have fallen from nearly 15% to under 5%, capital has remained sticky. This seemingly contradictory behavior reflects increasing institutional comfort with DeFi protocols as legitimate financial infrastructure rather than speculative vehicles.

The Rise of Curators: DeFi's New Asset Managers

The emergence of curation represents a significant shift in DeFi lending. Protocols like Morpho and Euler have introduced curators who build, manage, and optimize lending vaults.

These curators serve as a new breed of DeFi asset managers, evaluating markets, setting risk parameters, and optimizing capital allocations to deliver enhanced yields. Unlike traditional service providers who merely advise protocols, curators actively manage capital deployment strategies across various lending opportunities.

On platforms like Morpho and Euler, curators handle risk management functions: selecting which assets can serve as collateral, setting appropriate loan-to-value ratios, choosing oracle price feeds, and implementing supply caps. They essentially build targeted lending strategies optimized for specific risk-reward profiles, sitting between passive lenders and sources of yield.

Firms like Gauntlet, previously service providers to protocols like Aave or Compound, now directly manage nearly $750 million in TVL across several protocols. With performance fees ranging from 0-15%, this potentially represents millions in annual revenue with significantly more upside than traditional service arrangements. Per a Morpho dashboard, curators have cumulatively generated nearly 3 million in revenue and based on Q1 revenue are on track to do 7.8mm in 2025.

The most successful curator strategies have maintained higher yields primarily by accepting higher-yielding collaterals at more aggressive LTV ratios, particularly leveraging Pendle LP tokens. This approach requires sophisticated risk management but delivers superior returns in the current compressed environment.

As concrete examples, yields on the largest USDC vaults on both Morpho and Euler have outperformed the vaults.fyi benchmark, showing 5-8% base yields and 6-12% yields inclusive of token rewards.

Protocol Stratification: A Layered Market

The compressed environment has created a distinct market structure:

1. Blue-chip Infrastructure (Aave, Compound, Sky)

Function similar to traditional money market funds

Offer modest yields (2.4-6.5%) with maximum security and liquidity

Have captured the lion's share of TVL growth

2. Infrastructure Optimizers & Strategy Providers

Base Layer Optimizers : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency

: Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency Strategy Providers: Specialized firms like MEV Capital, Steakhouse, and Gauntlet build on these platforms to deliver higher yields upwards of 12% on USDC and USDT (as of late March)

This two-tier relationship creates a more dynamic market where strategy providers can rapidly iterate on yield opportunities without building core infrastructure. The yields ultimately available to users depend on both the efficiency of the base protocol and the sophistication of strategies deployed on top.

This restructured market means users now navigate a more complex landscape where the relationship between protocols and strategies determines yield potential. While blue-chip protocols offer simplicity and safety, the combination of optimizing protocols and specialized strategies provides yields comparable to what previously existed on platforms like Aave or Compound during higher rate environments.

Chain by Chain: Where Yields Live Now

Despite the proliferation of L2s and alternative L1s, Ethereum mainnet continues to host many of the top yield opportunities, both inclusive and exclusive of token incentives. This persistence of Ethereum's yield advantage is notable in a market where incentive programs have often shifted yield-seeking capital to newer chains.

Among mature chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism), yields remain depressed across the board. Outside of mainnet, most of the attractive yield opportunities are concentrated on Base, suggesting its emerging role as a secondary yield hub.

Newer chains with substantial incentive programs (like Berachain and Sonic) show elevated yields, but the sustainability of these rates remains questionable as incentives eventually taper.

The DeFi Mullet: FinTech in the Front, DeFi in the Back

A significant development this quarter was Coinbase's introduction of Bitcoin-collateralized loans powered by Morpho on its Base network. This integration represents the emerging ""DeFi Mullet"" thesis - fintech interfaces in the front, DeFi infrastructure in the back.

As Coinbase's head of Consumer Products Max Branzburg has noted: ""This is a moment where we're planting a flag that Coinbase is coming on-chain, and we're bringing millions of users with their billions of dollars."" The integration brings Morpho's lending capabilities directly into Coinbase's user interface, allowing users to borrow up to $100,000 in USDC against their bitcoin holdings.

This approach embodies the view that billions will eventually use Ethereum and DeFi protocols without knowing it — just as they use TCP/IP today without awareness. Traditional FinTech companies will increasingly adopt this strategy, keeping familiar interfaces while leveraging DeFi's infrastructure.

The Coinbase implementation is particularly notable for its full-circle integration within the Coinbase ecosystem: users post BTC collateral to mint cbBTC (Coinbase's wrapped Bitcoin on Base) and borrow USDC (Coinbase's stablecoin) on Morpho (a Coinbase-funded lending platform) atop Base (Coinbase's Layer 2 network).

Looking Forward: Catalysts for the Lending Market

Several factors could reshape the lending landscape through 2025:

Democratized curation : As curator models mature, could AI agents in crypto eventually enable everyone to become their own curator? While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users.

: As curator models mature, could AI agents in crypto eventually enable everyone to become their own curator?

RWA integration : The continued evolution of real-world asset integration could introduce new yield sources less correlated with crypto market cycles.

The protocols best positioned to thrive will be those that can operate efficiently across the risk spectrum, serving both conservative institutional capital and more aggressive yield-seekers, through increasingly sophisticated risk management and capital optimization strategies.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The first advisory rescinded on Friday was Staff Advisory No. 18-14, Advisory with Respect to Virtual Currency Derivative Product Listings. Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. On Friday, the CFTC published a letter saying that “additional staff experience” and “increasing market growth” had rendered the guidance unnecessary.

The second advisory, Staff Advisory No. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.”

The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Under the new leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force that has spearheaded its transformation, engaging with the industry and backing down from a host of lawsuits and investigations into crypto companies that began under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler.

Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.”

Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency.

But Davis also suggested that the changes could be tied to a larger restructuring going on at the CFTC.

“They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.",decrypt

The EFPCs manage retirement savings for tens of thousands of unionized and company-employed workers and their reserves are typically made up of bonds and equities.

“The resolution also prohibits investments in virtual assets, considering their specific investment characteristics and associated risk,” a Ministry of Finance notice circulating among local news outlets reads.

The ruling was published last week under under Resolution 5.202/2025 by the National Monetary Council (CMN).

FTX will begin repaying major creditors $11.4 billion starting May 30, 2025

Claims are valued at November 2022 prices, when Bitcoin was worth 80% less than today

Smaller creditors under $50,000 have already begun receiving payments

The company faces billions in disputed or fraudulent claims that may delay full distribution

Despite controversy over valuation dates, creditors are expected to receive 118-119% of their claims in cash

Nearly two and a half years after its collapse, cryptocurrency exchange FTX will start repaying its major creditors on May 30, 2025. The company has amassed $11.4 billion in cash for distribution to those with claims exceeding $50,000.

This marks a key milestone in the lengthy bankruptcy process that began in November 2022. The exchange imploded after revelations that founder Sam Bankman-Fried had misused customer funds to prop up his hedge fund Alameda Research.

Smaller claimants with amounts below $50,000 have already started receiving their money. About 98% of these minor creditors were paid within two months of the repayment plan’s activation.

FTX’s bankruptcy attorney Andrew Dietderich confirmed the payment timeline in court this week. The estate is ready to begin distributing funds to larger creditors, including investment firms and institutions.

FTX’s Path from Collapse to Repayment

The company has overcome huge hurdles to reach this point. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved FTX’s payout plan in October 2023, setting the stage for these repayments.

CEO John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s dissolution, has led the asset recovery efforts. His team reclaimed between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion in assets by selling stakes in tech companies, property holdings, and digital currencies.

This successful asset recovery means FTX now has more money than its $11.2 billion in liabilities. The approved restructuring plan should allow creditors to receive 118-119% of their claim value in cash.

However, many creditors remain unhappy with how their claims are being calculated. All cryptocurrency holdings are valued based on November 2022 prices, when Bitcoin traded between $16,000 and $21,000.

Since then, Bitcoin has increased by about 500%. Other cryptocurrencies have seen even more dramatic gains, with Solana up 650% and XRP rising 450% during the same period.

Sunil Kavuri, representing the largest FTX creditor group, acknowledged mixed feelings about the repayments. “It will definitely give closure to many affected by this horrendous ordeal,” he said. “But also, repayment is at petition date prices…so holders are not at full recovery in crypto terms.”

Some creditors had hoped to receive payment in cryptocurrency rather than cash. A few have pursued litigation seeking crypto-denominated repayments, though their chances of success appear low after Judge Dorsey enforced cash settlements.

The estate is also dealing with an overwhelming number of questionable claims. Dietderich described facing “27 quintillion” total submissions, with billions deemed fraudulent or inflated.

Resolving these disputed claims is becoming urgent. While creditors wait for payment, they accrue 9% annual interest on their claims, creating a financial incentive for FTX to complete the process quickly.

The bankruptcy team is reviewing options for creditors in excluded jurisdictions. Russia, China, and Egypt are among the countries currently unable to receive payments.

Bitcoin price is hovering around $82,000 with risk of dropping below $80,000

President Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on Russian oil amid ceasefire concerns

Investors have withdrawn 6,000 BTC from exchanges amid bearish sentiment

Recession odds have increased, with Goldman Sachs raising 12-month probability from 20% to 35%

Institutional investors like Strategy continue buying despite market uncertainty

Bitcoin is feeling the heat as President Trump threatens new tariffs against Russia. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen to around $82,000, marking its seventh consecutive day of lower lows.

The downward pressure comes as Trump expressed disappointment with Russia over delays in reaching a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine. The President has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Russian oil imports “at any moment.”

This geopolitical tension comes at a time when Bitcoin was already showing weakness. The cryptocurrency has been losing ground throughout March, putting it on track for possibly its weakest first-quarter performance since 2018.

US stock futures have already slipped into the red, with the DOW futures shedding 206 points and the S&P 500 futures down 0.56%. Bitcoin’s price has moved in tandem with the equities markets, reflecting the asset’s growing correlation with traditional financial markets.

The broader economic outlook isn’t helping matters. Last week’s core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data showed a higher-than-expected increase in inflation. At the same time, March consumer confidence data from the Conference Board showed the monthly confidence index at a 12-year low.

Goldman Sachs has raised its 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%. The bank cited a lower growth baseline, deteriorating household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating a willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies.

The threat of wider tariffs is adding to market jitters. Trump has repeatedly referred to April 2 as “Liberation Day,” when he plans to assign “reciprocal tariffs” to various countries. This includes a fresh wave of 25% tariffs on cars imported to the US and possible tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators for Bitcoin are largely pessimistic. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows no crossover in sight, confirming bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) paints a similar picture of weakness.

Some analysts have lowered their price targets. Crypto trader Arthur Hayes believes the Federal Reserve could trigger a Bitcoin price boom in April, but others are more cautious. Pseudonymous analyst Crypto Dad noted: “We’re stuck under a clean descending channel, and the price is now grinding within a high-interest demand zone.”

Veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has predicted a steep drop to $65,635. While this represents a more extreme scenario, a decline below $80,000 appears increasingly likely in the short term.

Despite the downward pressure, not all the news is negative. Institutional investors continue to buy Bitcoin. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor recently posted his famous orange dots Bitcoin chart with the caption “Needs even more Orange,” indicating ongoing purchases by the company.

Marathon Digital has launched a $2 billion stock sale to power new Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet and Strategy continue to bolster their holdings despite market uncertainty.

Data from CryptoQuant shows Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses continuing to rise throughout the month. This suggests that long-term holders are using the price dip as a buying opportunity.

Investors have withdrawn 6,000 BTC from exchanges, braving the bearish sentiment. This reduction in exchange supply could eventually help stabilize prices if selling pressure subsides.

The upcoming interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve could also impact Bitcoin’s price. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has clashed with President Trump over the pace of interest rate reductions. Trump has called for rates to be lowered immediately, claiming lower rates would help his plan for wide-scale international trade tariffs.

The last trading day of March will be crucial for Bitcoin. Traders are watching closely to see if the cryptocurrency can maintain support above $80,000 or if it will break down further as fears of “Trump tariffs” intensify.",blockonomi

Whale accumulation reaching 3.27 billion ADA tokens signals potential price movement

Technical analysis shows key resistance at $0.70-0.78 and support at $0.65-0.66

Some analysts predict possibility of $2.5 price target in May if pattern holds

Cardano’s price has entered a consolidation phase that many analysts believe mirrors patterns seen in 2024, potentially setting the stage for a rally in the coming months. Currently trading at approximately $0.66, ADA has been testing the patience of investors as it hovers in a narrow range following a dip to $0.49 in early February.

The cryptocurrency’s current behavior has caught the attention of market analysts who see similarities to price action from the third quarter of 2024. According to cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi, ADA experienced a steep correction in early August last year, followed by a lengthy consolidation period before eventually rallying.

“ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August-September 2024,” noted Master Kenobi in a post on X. “Since the dip on August 5, it hasn’t recorded a new low – just as it hasn’t now, following the dip on February 3.”

💡 ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August–September 2024.

This cyclical pattern has led some experts to predict a potential breakout in May. If the pattern holds true, Master Kenobi suggests that ADA could reach as high as $2.5, representing a substantial increase from current levels.

Whale activity appears to support the bullish outlook. Data from Santiment shows large investors have purchased approximately 240 million ADA tokens in recent weeks, bringing total whale holdings to 3.27 billion ADA. This level of accumulation often precedes major price movements.

Market Analysis

On-chain metrics also show promising signs for Cardano. Transaction volume has remained steady while the number of transactions continues to climb, indicating growing adoption and increased network utility. Historically, rising network activity has been a precursor to positive price action.

Despite these bullish indicators, ADA faces several technical hurdles. The first key resistance level sits around $0.78, marking the upper boundary of the current trading range. A breakout above this level could open the door toward the next major resistance near $0.92-$0.94.

On the support side, analysts highlight the $0.65-$0.66 range as a critical zone that has held firm in recent trading sessions. A drop below $0.64 could accelerate the decline, potentially pushing prices toward the lower $0.50s.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 37.49, suggesting oversold conditions. Additionally, the MACD shows a negative crossover at -0.0183, indicating continued selling pressure in the short term.

Derivatives data reveals waning speculative interest. Open interest in Cardano futures has dropped 4.54% to $771.41 million. Recent liquidations have totaled $3.19 million in the last 24 hours, with $3 million coming from long positions.

This suggests that bullish traders have been caught off guard by recent declines. Technical analyst Mosesifunanya at CoinMarketCap advises caution, suggesting bearish entries below $0.6539 could target $0.6333, while bullish positions should only be considered after a confirmed break above $0.7030.

The pivot point at $0.6824 represents a critical threshold that could determine the short-term trend. Traders are closely monitoring this level for signs of a potential breakout or breakdown.

Cardano’s all-time high stands at $3.10, making current prices a far cry from previous peaks. However, the ecosystem continues to show signs of development and adoption that could support future price appreciation.

Some investors have their sights set on ambitious targets, with some even eyeing $10 after ADA reportedly outperformed top S&P 500 companies. While such predictions may seem optimistic given current price levels, proponents point to the network’s fundamentals as justification.

The coming weeks will be crucial for Cardano’s price action. If the historical pattern repeats, May could bring increased volatility and potential upside. However, traders should remain cautious as technical indicators have not yet confirmed a strong reversal.

Immediate support remains at $0.6545, with stronger support at $0.5778 if selling pressure intensifies. On the upside, breaking through $0.7030 and then $0.7545 would signal growing strength and potentially confirm the bullish outlook suggested by on-chain metrics.

As of March 31, 2025, ADA is trading at $0.6581, down 3.53% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has declined over 20% to $517.32 million, reflecting the current consolidation phase as market participants await clearer directional signals.",blockonomi

Ethereum currently trading around $1,800 after several days of decline

ETH fell from $2,033 to a low of $1,754, breaking below key $1,880 support

Potential double-bottom pattern forming with support at $1,762

Whales holding 125,603 ETH ($229M) face liquidation risks at $1,787 and $1,701

Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum in the short term

Ethereum has been on a downward trend over the past week, with the price struggling to maintain momentum above key support levels. After failing to break through the $2,100 resistance, ETH has seen a string of bearish price action.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading around $1,800. This represents a 12% decline over the past six days.

The price movement shows ETH failed to continue higher above the $2,000 resistance level. This failure triggered a series of declines that pushed the price below several important support zones.

ETH initially dropped below the $1,920 support. It then continued lower, breaking the $1,880 level which had previously served as a stable floor.

The decline brought Ethereum to test the $1,765 zone. A low formed at $1,767 before the price attempted to bounce back above $1,800.

Despite this small recovery, ETH remains below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is calculated from the recent decline from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows ETH is trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. This is often seen as a bearish signal by traders and market analysts.

A connecting bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart. This adds another hurdle for bulls attempting to push the price higher.

On the upside, the price faces several resistance barriers. The first is near the $1,820 level, followed by a stronger resistance at $1,880.

The $1,880 resistance also coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Breaking above this could open the path toward the $1,920 level.

If buyers manage to push the price above $1,920, ETH could target the psychological $2,000 level. A break above $2,000 might trigger more gains, potentially reaching $2,050 or even $2,120.

However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, another decline could follow. The first support on the downside sits near $1,780.

Below that, the major support is at $1,765, which was recently tested. A break under this level could send the price toward $1,720 or even lower to $1,680.

The technical indicators aren’t painting a bullish picture at the moment. The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

Similarly, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for ETH/USD remains below the 50 zone. This suggests bears still have control of the market in the short term.

Some analysts see a potential double-bottom pattern forming. This pattern could signal a reversal if ETH bounces strongly from current levels.

The daily chart shows six consecutive bearish candles. However, price action near the $1,762 support level indicates possible bullish interest forming.

A potential Doji candle formation suggests indecision in the market. This could mark the beginning of a double-bottom reversal pattern.

For this reversal to complete, Ethereum would need to break above the local resistance trendline. The neckline of the double-bottom pattern sits near the $2,100 resistance level.

Adding pressure to the market, crypto whales face liquidation risks. Two large holders on Maker DAO control 125,603 ETH worth approximately $229 million.

These positions face liquidation at price levels of $1,787 and $1,701. If triggered, these liquidations could accelerate ETH’s downward movement.

Despite the current bearish outlook, some analysts remain optimistic. They point to ETH holding the lower boundary of a descending triangle pattern.

A bounce from current levels could challenge resistance at $1,950 and $2,080. More optimistic targets include $2,230 and $2,320 if momentum shifts.

The short-term price action shows rejection from the 24-hour low. This suggests a potential bounce, but the market remains highly uncertain.",blockonomi

XRP has fallen below $2.10, making it the worst-performing top 10 altcoin with a 14.5% weekly decline

Price dropped despite positive news about Ripple’s SEC lawsuit resolution

Large whale sell-offs of over 1.12B XRP (worth $2.3 billion) are intensifying the downward pressure

XRP is approaching the critical $2.00 support level not seen since May 11

Technical indicators show bearish momentum with resistance at $2.15 and $2.20

XRP (XRP) is facing significant downward pressure despite recent positive developments for Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency. The digital asset has dropped below $2.10 and currently trades around $2.09, making it the worst performer among major cryptocurrencies over the past week.

The price decline comes as a surprise to many observers. Ripple recently announced the end of its long-running lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This news briefly pushed XRP to $2.60 on March 19.

However, what should have been a bullish catalyst turned into a classic “sell-the-news” event. XRP has lost about 20% of its value since that March peak. Even last week’s confirmation of the lawsuit closure failed to stop the slide.

XRP’s 14.5% weekly decline stands out compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down just 5.5% in the same period. Ethereum has fallen 11.6%, while Solana dropped 9%.

The broader market correction has hurt all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has retreated to around $82,000. Ethereum has fallen to $1,800. Solana is trading near $125.

Market Analysis

Technical analysis shows XRP facing multiple resistance levels. There is a bearish trend line forming at $2.148 on hourly charts. The price is trading below $2.150 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average.

First major resistance is near $2.180. The next significant barrier is at $2.20. A clear move above this level could send XRP toward $2.250 or even $2.30.

On the downside, initial support is around $2.080. The next major support level is at $2.050. If XRP breaks below this, it could continue falling toward the psychologically important $2.00 mark.

The $2.00 level represents a crucial threshold. XRP has not traded below this support since May 11. Breaking below could trigger a stronger sell-off toward $1.880.

Technical indicators paint a bearish picture. The MACD for XRP/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has dropped below the 50 level.

One key factor behind XRP’s decline appears to be whale activity. Large holders accumulated XRP after the U.S. elections as prices rose from $0.60 to $3.40 within months.

These same whales have recently changed strategy. They’ve sold off 1.12 billion XRP in just two days. This massive sell-off, worth over $2.3 billion, represents almost 2% of XRP’s total market cap.

Retail interest in XRP has also decreased significantly. Google Trends data shows XRP search interest recently hit its lowest level of 2025. The general public seems uninterested despite Ripple’s legal victory.

The cryptocurrency market faces additional pressure from global trade tensions. These economic concerns have impacted all risk assets. Earlier Monday, Japan’s Nikkei index dropped more than 4%.

XRP now stands at a critical juncture. The cryptocurrency must hold the $2.00 support level to avoid a deeper correction. Breaking this support could accelerate selling pressure.

Looking forward, XRP supporters hope for a potential catalyst later this year. Possible XRP ETF approval could reignite momentum for the cryptocurrency.

Until then, traders will be watching key technical levels closely. The $2.15 and $2.20 resistance zones are crucial for any bullish reversal. On the downside, the $2.00 support remains vital.",blockonomi

Stablecoin market cap in SUI ecosystem grew from $370M to $628M since December

Positive developments include Canary Capital’s ETF filing and blockchain surpassing 100 million accounts

A major token unlock for Sui (SUI) is scheduled for April 1, with 64.19 million tokens worth approximately $151 million set to enter circulation. This event represents 2.03% of SUI’s current circulating supply of 3.17 billion tokens.

The unlock comes at a time when SUI trades at $2.32, aligned with its 20-day simple moving average. Traders are watching closely as token unlocks have historically led to price volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

According to data from Tokenimist, only 31.7% of SUI’s maximum supply of 10 billion tokens has been unlocked so far. This indicates substantial future emissions are still expected for the cryptocurrency.

The SUI blockchain has shown mixed signals in recent months. Monthly decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume has reached $5 billion, demonstrating active trading within the ecosystem.

SUI’s stablecoin market has shown growth as well. The market capitalization has increased from $370 million in December to $628 million as of March 31, 2025.

Despite these positive indicators, SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has seen a drop. According to DefiLlama, TVL peaked at $2.08 billion in January but has since fallen to approximately $1.2 billion.

This decline in TVL has occurred during a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. The contrast between rising trading volume and falling TVL suggests mixed sentiment among investors.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows SUI faces immediate resistance at $2.37. If the price breaks above this level, the next resistance points are at $2.64 and $2.78.

On the downside, SUI finds support at $2.23. A break below this level could see the price test the $2.00 mark if selling pressure increases following the token unlock.

Technical indicators present a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 44.5, indicating weak buying interest in the market.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory. This suggests continued selling pressure on SUI in the short term.

However, the Stochastic RSI is approaching oversold levels. This could signal a potential short-term bounce in price after the unlock event.

Some positive developments may help counter selling pressure. Investment firm Canary Capital has filed a registration statement for a SUI-related exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The SUI blockchain recently reached a milestone of over 100 million total accounts. This achievement points to growing adoption of the network despite market uncertainties.

If buyers maintain support at $2.23, SUI could see sideways consolidation around the $2.37 level before potentially moving higher toward $2.64 in coming weeks.

The upcoming token unlock will likely trigger short-term volatility as traders react to the increased supply. Past unlock events for cryptocurrencies have typically led to temporary price pullbacks.",blockonomi

By 2030, about 25% of S&P 500 companies are predicted to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term asset

MicroStrategy pioneered the Bitcoin treasury strategy in 2020, with its stock surging over 2,000% since then

GameStop recently announced a $1.3B convertible note to implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy

Currently 90 public companies hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, but only Tesla and Block are S&P 500 companies

Treasury managers may feel compelled to try Bitcoin strategies to avoid missing potential gains

Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets is gaining attention as more public companies adopt this strategy. According to data from bitcointreasuries.net, 90 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

This trend began when MicroStrategy first announced Bitcoin as its “primary treasury reserve asset” on August 20, 2020. Since then, MicroStrategy’s stock has increased by more than 2,000%, far outpacing both Bitcoin (781%) and the S&P 500 (64.8%) over the same period.

GameStop recently joined this movement. They announced a $1.3 billion convertible note offering on March 26, 2025, with plans to use the funds to buy Bitcoin.

Their CEO stated, “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.” However, GameStop’s stock has dropped more than 20% since this announcement.

The main reasons companies cite for holding Bitcoin include hedging against inflation of fiat currencies (especially the US dollar) and treasury diversification for risk management. Bitcoin offers certain advantages over traditional assets like gold.

While gold must be physically stored and isn’t easily moved, Bitcoin is a digital commodity. It is recognized under GAAP as a tangible asset with a fungible and liquid profile.

MicroStrategy had additional reasons for its Bitcoin strategy. They provided institutional investors with exposure to Bitcoin when many asset managers couldn’t directly own it.

They also positioned for potential price appreciation, with CEO Michael Saylor known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin’s future value. The company benefited from branding itself as a Bitcoin innovator.

Corporate Bitcoin: Risk vs. Reward

Currently, Tesla and Block are the only S&P 500-listed firms that hold Bitcoin. For the prediction of 25% adoption by S&P 500 companies to come true, at least 123 more S&P 500 firms would need to invest in Bitcoin by 2030.

Some tech investors and executives have very optimistic price targets for Bitcoin. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Block CEO Jack Dorsey predict Bitcoin could reach between $500,000 to $1,000,000 by 2030.

Elliot Chun, a partner at tech-focused financial advisory firm Architect Partners, believes treasury managers will feel pressured to try Bitcoin strategies. In his March 28 blog post, he wrote: “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius.”

“If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk,” Chun added.

However, Chun makes a distinction between companies using Bitcoin for genuine treasury diversification versus those pivoting their entire business model around Bitcoin. He warns that companies implementing this strategy hoping to replicate MicroStrategy’s performance “are positioning for disappointment.”

MicroStrategy’s success came partly from being first. They offered Bitcoin exposure to institutional investors at a time when direct ownership wasn’t possible for many asset managers.

That advantage diminished after January 10, 2024, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. These ETFs now provide an alternative way for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure.

Despite growing adoption, using Bitcoin as a treasury asset remains an “unproven strategy” for companies hoping to hedge against inflation or diversify their treasury holdings. The volatility of Bitcoin presents both opportunities and risks.

Education about this strategy is expanding. Last month, Bitcoin Investor Week in NYC dedicated an entire day to educating publicly traded companies on this tactic. Last year, MicroStrategy hosted a full conference in Las Vegas focused on Bitcoin treasury strategies.

Earlier this month, crypto asset manager Bitwise launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. This fund seeks to track companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.

As more companies explore this option, the next few years will show whether Bitcoin becomes a standard component of corporate treasury strategies or remains limited to a small group of tech-forward companies.",blockonomi

Goldman Sachs raised US recession probability from 20% to 35% for the next 12 months

Overall crypto market lost $250 billion in value over the past week with altcoins experiencing steeper declines

Bitcoin’s price continues to face downward pressure, falling below $82,000 on Monday as fears of new trade tariffs under President Trump’s administration weigh on markets.

The cryptocurrency briefly touched $81,300 in early trading, marking a near two-week low. This continues a pattern of decline that has erased much of the gains seen earlier this year.

Investors are reacting to reports that President Trump is preparing to announce reciprocal trade tariffs targeting up to 25 countries. The Wall Street Journal reported these tariffs could reach 20% against individual nations.

Trump’s tariff plans are set to be unveiled on April 2. The announcement is expected to cover key market sectors and has created uncertainty in global markets.

This trade policy news has overshadowed positive sentiment from Trump’s earlier plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Markets tend to view such tariffs as potential destabilizers for global trade.

Recent losses have wiped out nearly 40% of Bitcoin’s value since its record highs around Trump’s January inauguration. This shows the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to broader economic concerns.

Adding to market worries, Goldman Sachs recently increased its forecast for a US recession. The investment bank now sees a 35% chance of economic downturn in the next 12 months, up from its previous 20% estimate.

The bank cited several factors for this revised outlook. These include uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs, persistent inflation, and declining consumer and business sentiment.

On-chain data has also spooked Bitcoin traders. About 4,000 Bitcoins worth approximately $332 million were transferred to the Kraken exchange, often a sign of upcoming sales.

The broader cryptocurrency market has suffered similar declines. The total crypto market cap has fallen by $250 billion in the past week, dropping to $2.75 trillion according to CoinGecko data.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 1.5% to $1,809.93. It has lost 19.2% in March and reached a 16-month low.

XRP dropped 3.5% to $2.10, erasing gains made after the SEC dropped its case against Ripple. Other major cryptocurrencies like Cardano fell 3.4% while Solana remained flat.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysts note concerning patterns forming in the charts. Bitcoin, along with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, appears to be approaching a “death cross” pattern that could signal further bearish momentum.

This technical formation occurs when short-term moving averages cross below longer-term averages. Some analysts wonder if this could mark a market bottom before any potential recovery.

Bitcoin’s price action continues to show strong correlation with traditional equity markets. The S&P 500 lost approximately $2 trillion in market value over three trading sessions last week.

Some market commentators, including economist Peter Schiff, have criticized Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative during this downturn. Gold has reached new record highs above $3,090 while Bitcoin falls.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted another concerning trend. According to Martinez, the global money supply has dropped by nearly $1 trillion over the past two weeks.

One of the current bullish narratives is that #Bitcoin $BTC will rally as global liquidity grows. But what they aren't telling you is that the Global Money Supply dropped nearly $1 trillion in the past two weeks! https://t.co/FVwzeiKzQW pic.twitter.com/whEwEuG65K — Ali (@ali_charts) March 30, 2025

Martinez also reported significant selling by Bitcoin miners. Over the past week, miners have sold more than 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $220 million.

Recent US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data showed persistent inflation, raising concerns that monetary policy will remain tight. This outlook creates additional headwinds for risk assets like Bitcoin.

As markets enter April, traders will be watching Trump’s tariff announcement closely. The policy details could either extend the current bearish trend or provide relief if less severe than expected.",blockonomi

Elon Musk, the head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), has put an end to rumors that the government agency might incorporate the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. His comments came during an America PAC town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Sunday.

“There are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin or anything,” Musk said during his speech. The tech billionaire explained that despite the name similarity, the department’s focus is solely on improving government operations.

The naming choice was more about branding than cryptocurrency connections. Musk revealed he had initially planned to call it the “Government Efficiency Commission.”

“That’s a super boring name,” he admitted. “Then the internet said it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency. I was like, Internet is right.”

The similarity in names had fueled speculation about potential government adoption of Dogecoin. This was further heightened when the official D.O.G.E. website briefly displayed the Dogecoin logo for a few hours after President Trump’s inauguration.

Then the internet said it needs to be Department of Government Efficiency. I was like Internet is right."" pic.twitter.com/5BLBQeN7dL — DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) March 31, 2025

This temporary logo appearance gave more weight to rumors of the meme coin playing a role in the new agency. It also sent Dogecoin prices up 14% to a $58 billion market cap in February.

Musk has long been associated with Dogecoin. He has promoted the cryptocurrency through tweets and public statements, even defending its inflationary model as a feature that supports everyday transactions.

His past Dogecoin promotions have drawn attention from regulators. In 2023, Musk faced a market manipulation lawsuit from the SEC over his Dogecoin-related activities.

D.O.G.E.’s Cost-Cutting Mission

The D.O.G.E. department was first introduced in August 2024. It has since become a central part of the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government.

The initiative aims to cut government spending and streamline operations. Musk says the goal is to make government “15% more efficient.”

Since its formal launch in January, the department claims to have saved an estimated $130 billion. This amounts to an average saving of $840 per taxpayer, according to data provided by the department.

The team has targeted several areas for cost-cutting. One key focus was federal credit card usage, where they found the government had issued 4.6 million cards despite having only 2.3 to 2.4 million employees.

Musk called this oversight “absurd” and pushed for immediate reductions. The department has also carried out mass layoffs and cut funding for various programs.

Agencies affected include the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Programs related to climate change, scientific research, and diversity initiatives have seen funding cuts.

Musk’s exact role in the department remains somewhat unclear. The White House describes him as a senior advisor without policy authority, while President Trump has referred to him as the department’s leader.

In a recent interview with Fox News, Musk stated he will step down from his position after achieving a $1 trillion reduction in the U.S. federal deficit. He expressed confidence that most of the work could be completed within 130 days.

Based on this timeline, Musk estimated his tenure with D.O.G.E. could end by late May. He described his work as “a revolution” that would leave America in a “much stronger financial position.”

While supporters praise the efficiency-driven approach, critics argue the department operates with too much power and insufficient oversight. Several lawsuits are currently challenging D.O.G.E.’s authority to make such sweeping changes.

Critics claim that federal contracts and programs have been cut without proper congressional approval. Musk has defended the team’s actions, stating all decisions were carefully considered.

Following Musk’s recent comments about Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 3.5% in 24 hours. However, this was in line with broader market trends rather than a direct response to his statements.

Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1654, according to data from CoinGecko. Despite the name confusion, the meme coin and government agency continue to operate in separate spheres.

Musk is not being paid for his work with the D.O.G.E. department, according to his statements. His involvement appears to be motivated by his interest in government reform rather than financial compensation.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Dogecoin (DOGE) Price: Technical Analysis Shows Critical Support at $0.16,https://blockonomi.com/dogecoin-doge-price-technical-analysis-shows-critical-support-at-0-16/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:34:06 GMT","TLDR

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading around $0.17, showing recent downward momentum

Key support levels at $0.16, $0.15, and $0.14 will be critical to prevent further decline

A Falling Wedge pattern on the daily chart suggests possible bullish reversal if DOGE breaks above $0.18

Analysts remain divided on whether DOGE will rally toward $0.30 or retest the $0.10 level

Technical indicators show DOGE at a critical juncture with bearish momentum building

Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a pivotal moment as the popular meme cryptocurrency faces mounting pressure from sellers. Trading at approximately $0.17, DOGE has experienced a 1.9% decline recently, leaving investors and traders wondering about its next move.

The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating within key technical levels. Market participants are closely monitoring the situation for signals that could indicate either a breakout or a deeper pullback.

On the weekly chart, DOGE has been moving in a broader downtrend. The price is hovering near a critical support level of $0.14, which has historically attracted strong buying interest.

The daily chart reveals a Falling Wedge formation, which typically signals a bullish pattern. However, DOGE needs to overcome resistance at $0.18 to confirm this bullish outlook.

Looking at the 4-hour chart, DOGE is trading near the mid-point of the Bollinger Bands. This indicates a neutral stance in the very short term.

Technical Analysis

Technical analyst Moein Haddadian notes that DOGE has broken out of a descending trendline. This technical signal suggests that selling pressure may be weakening.

For Dogecoin to establish a strong recovery, it must first surpass the $0.25 price point. A confirmed breakout above this level could drive the price toward the $0.30 mark.

The $0.16 level now serves as a critical line of support. If this level holds, analysts expect a consolidation above $0.205 before a potential rally toward $0.30-$0.334.

However, a decline below $0.16 would be concerning for DOGE holders. Such a move could potentially lead to falls to $0.122 or even $0.113 in the near term.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $0.21 as the primary resistance level. According to Martinez, closing above this resistance would confirm the start of a new bullish cycle for DOGE.

A breakdown below key support levels would likely lead to further sideways movement or even a more severe downturn. Some analysts caution that DOGE could retest $0.10 if selling pressure intensifies.

Historical data shows that Dogecoin tends to follow cyclical patterns. Crypto trader DogeCapital recently pointed out that DOGE’s current price action resembles past patterns that preceded explosive growth phases.

The hourly chart shows a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170. The MACD indicator is gaining momentum in the bearish zone, while the RSI remains below the 50 level.

If DOGE fails to climb above $0.1770, it could start another decline. Initial support is near $0.1635, with the next major support at $0.1620.

The main support sits at $0.1550. A break below this level could push the price toward $0.1320 or even $0.120 in the near term.

While short-term price action remains uncertain, some analysts maintain a bullish long-term outlook. Predictions suggest that if DOGE can establish sustained momentum, it could eventually target $1.

However, market analyst Henry warns that Dogecoin remains at a crossroads. “Dogecoin has shown signs of strength, but unless it can sustain momentum above key resistance levels, we could see another leg down before a potential rally,” he noted.

For now, Dogecoin investors face a critical decision point. The meme coin’s strong community backing and growing adoption may provide support, but the technical indicators suggest caution.

Traders should closely monitor the key support levels at $0.16, $0.15, and $0.14, as well as resistance levels at $0.18, $0.20, and $0.25 for clues about DOGE’s next directional move.",blockonomi

Senior IRGC intelligence officials stole $21 million in cryptocurrency while investigating Cryptoland

Main suspects Mehdi Hajipour and Mehdi Badi sold seized BRG tokens for personal profit

Hajipour’s wealth increased from $40,000 to $14.2 million within four months

Cryptoland CEO Sina Estavi was sentenced to 15 years but fled the country

Half of the 51,000 victims have been repaid, but 25,000 investors remain uncompensated

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is facing serious allegations of corruption after court documents revealed that senior officers stole approximately $21 million in cryptocurrency while pretending to investigate fraud. The case centers on Cryptoland, a digital exchange that was shut down in 2021.

The scheme began in May 2021 when Cryptoland CEO Sina Estavi was arrested on charges of “disrupting the economic system.” At the time of his arrest, Estavi had no formal accusers. The news of his detention soon spread, causing thousands of investors to file complaints.

Blockchain records show that just one day after Estavi’s arrest, six billion BRG tokens were moved from his crypto wallet. This transfer happened before the public was aware of any potential scandal. These tokens were later sold by IRGC officers for tens of millions of dollars.

Court documents identified two key figures in the operation: Mehdi Hajipour and Mehdi Badi. Both men were senior interrogators in the IRGC’s economic intelligence branch. A court-appointed expert confirmed that wallets controlled by Hajipour alone processed and sold over $21 million worth of BRG tokens.

The financial transformation of Hajipour was dramatic. Before the token theft, his assets were valued at approximately $40,000. Within just four months, his fortune had exploded to over $14.2 million (600 billion rials).

Hajipour spent his newly acquired wealth on gold, luxury real estate, and high-end vehicles. Court records detail these purchases as evidence of the sudden and unexplained increase in his personal wealth. This wealth disparity became a key point in the investigation.

Scheme Unravels

In March 2022, IRGC counterintelligence agents arrested Hajipour in a sting operation. He was caught accepting a $10,000 payment from Estavi. The CEO believed he was buying back stolen tokens from a third party, unaware this was a fake identity created by Hajipour himself.

After his arrest, Hajipour was held in Ward 66, a special prison facility reserved for IRGC personnel. His appeal was rejected in September 2022. The court documents do not provide complete information about the sentences for all defendants in the case.

The second main suspect, Mehdi Badi, operated under the alias “Dr. Ebadi.” His name has appeared in many major cases labeled as IRGC economic corruption investigations. Badi is reportedly the nephew of Ali Akbar Hosseini Mehrab, a former high-ranking IRGC official.

Court documents reveal that two other IRGC interrogators were also involved: Majid Jahan Parto and Majid Tabatabaei. Four additional people assisted the group by forging documents to legitimize the transactions. This network of corruption reached deep into the IRGC intelligence organization.

Three months after Hajipour’s arrest, there was a leadership change in the IRGC intelligence organization. Hossein Taeb was dismissed from his position as head and replaced by Mohammad Kazemi. The timing suggests possible connections to the scandal.

Estavi, meanwhile, was sentenced to 15 years in prison, 75 lashes, fines, and a lifetime ban from public service. He was ordered to return the embezzled funds. Despite a travel ban, Estavi managed to flee the country. A video later surfaced showing him in France.

Mizan news, a website controlled by Iran’s Judiciary department, reported that over 51,000 plaintiffs had filed complaints against Cryptoland. About half of these victims—whose losses amounted to $14 million—were repaid from Estavi’s account while he was in prison.

Around 25,000 other investors remain uncompensated. They are creditors of funds that were obtained and never returned by Hajipour, Badi, and other members of the network. With the main suspects in custody and the CEO fled, these investors face an uncertain future.

Estavi was known internationally for purchasing Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million. This high-profile purchase brought attention to Cryptoland before its collapse, adding to the scale of the scandal when it unfolded.

The case is part of a broader pattern of crypto-related crime involving Iranian nationals. Earlier in March 2025, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Behrouz Parsarad, an Iran-based operator of a darknet marketplace, for overseeing nearly $30 million in narcotics sales using cryptocurrency.",blockonomi

Metaplanet issued ¥2 billion ($13.3 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases

The company has accumulated 3,350 BTC, making it Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder

Despite Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet stock crashed 9% amid broader Japanese market decline

Japan’s Nikkei fell 4% as markets prepare for Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2

Metaplanet appointed Eric Trump to its advisory board as part of its Bitcoin strategy

Japanese company Metaplanet has issued ¥2 billion ($13.3 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund more Bitcoin purchases. The announcement came on Monday as the firm continues its aggressive strategy to acquire the cryptocurrency.

The bonds will be redeemed at full face value on September 30, 2025. The entire bond issuance has been allocated to EVO FUND according to the company’s filing on March 31.

Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the company is “buying the dip.” This refers to the practice of purchasing an asset when its price falls.

Bitcoin’s price slipped to an intraday low of $81,362 on Monday. This continues a recent losing streak for the cryptocurrency.

The Japanese firm announced its latest purchase of 150 BTC on March 24. This brought its total holdings to 3,350 Bitcoin.

Metaplanet has spent approximately ¥42.22 billion ($270 million) on Bitcoin since formally adopting it as a core asset in 2024. This makes it the largest corporate holder in Asia.

The company has outpaced other Asian Bitcoin holders such as Chinese game developer Boyaa Interactive and mining firm Cango. Its holdings also put it above U.S.-based mining company Semler Scientific.

Metaplanet tracks a metric called “Bitcoin Yield.” This calculates the percentage growth in BTC holdings compared to fully diluted shares.

This metric surged 309.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024. It currently sits at 68.3% for the first quarter of 2025.

Bitcoin Vision Amid Turbulence

Since beginning its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, Metaplanet’s stock price has soared by over 3,000%. This indicates a positive market response to the company’s Bitcoin strategy.

The company aims to hold 10,000 Bitcoin by 2025. By 2026, it plans to increase holdings to 21,000 Bitcoin.

Despite these ambitious plans, Metaplanet’s stock price crashed more than 9% on Monday. This happened even as the company announced its new Bitcoin purchase plan.

The decline occurred as the Japanese stock market fell 4% in early trading hours. Markets are preparing for President Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2.

Trump has declared Wednesday as “Liberation Day.” This marks the start of a wave of new tariffs.

The U.S. is set to impose 20%+ tariffs on imports from over 25 countries. These tariffs will target goods valued at more than $1.5 trillion by the end of April.

This uncertainty has pushed the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index to unprecedented levels. Current uncertainty levels are approximately 80% higher than those recorded during the 2008 financial crisis.

On the year-to-date basis, Metaplanet shares are up by only 12.17%. This indicates that the rally has mostly lost momentum.

Shares of Strategy, the American business intelligence firm that inspired Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy, are down 3.5% since the start of 2025. This shows that Bitcoin-focused companies are facing headwinds this year.

In addition to issuing bonds and acquiring more Bitcoin, Metaplanet has been growing its leadership team. On March 21, the firm appointed Eric Trump to its newly formed advisory board.

Trump is expected to contribute business expertise to help build “one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies,” according to CEO Simon Gerovich. The new board will include voices committed to promoting Bitcoin adoption and financial innovation.

American video game retailer GameStop recently experienced a setback with its Bitcoin strategy. Its shares collapsed after the company announced a debt-for-BTC offering.

Other companies are also pursuing Bitcoin acquisition strategies. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital has announced a $2 billion stock sale to fund its Bitcoin purchases.

The current market conditions present challenges for Bitcoin-focused companies. Rising global trade tensions and policy uncertainty are creating headwinds for risk assets.

Gold prices are eying $3,100 levels as investors seek safer assets amid the market turbulence. This contrasts with the selling pressure faced by Bitcoin and Bitcoin-focused companies.",blockonomi

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products instead of payment tools

The proposal aims to curb insider trading in crypto markets with new regulations

The FSA intends to submit amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026

Cryptocurrencies would likely be placed in a separate category from traditional securities

Japan has been making several pro-crypto moves recently, including tax reforms and stablecoin approvals

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to change how cryptocurrencies are classified in the country. The regulator wants to reclassify digital assets as financial products rather than payment tools. This change aims to bring crypto under insider trading rules.

The proposal is part of Japan’s effort to improve oversight of its growing crypto market. Currently, cryptocurrencies are categorized as a “means of settlement” under the Payment Services Act. This classification has focused on their use as payment tools.

The existing rules have created gaps in regulation. Specifically, they don’t address issues like insider trading in crypto markets. The FSA wants to fix this problem.

According to a Nikkei report on March 30, the FSA plans to submit amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. These changes could go to Japan’s parliament as early as 2026. Expert groups are reviewing the details behind closed doors.

The new classification would treat cryptocurrencies differently from traditional securities. While crypto would be regulated as financial products, they would likely be placed in a separate category from stocks and bonds. This approach recognizes their unique characteristics.

If the changes are approved, companies offering crypto services would need to register with the FSA. The regulator also plans to enforce these rules regardless of whether a company operates in Japan. However, it’s not clear how these laws would apply to overseas entities.

The FSA hasn’t revealed all the details yet. Questions remain about what would count as insider information in crypto markets. The penalties for violations are also still being determined.

Another open question is how the rules would distinguish between different types of cryptocurrencies. The regulation might treat major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum differently from speculative tokens like memecoins.

Japan’s Pro-Crypto Push

This move is part of a larger trend of pro-crypto changes in Japan. Earlier this month, the country issued its first license allowing a company to deal with stablecoins. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of financial group SBI, received approval to support Circle’s USDC.

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democracy Party has also moved to cut the capital gains tax on crypto. They plan to reduce it from 55% to 20%. This would match how other financial products are taxed in the country.

In February, reports suggested the FSA was considering lifting a ban on crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This change would align Japan’s policy with Hong Kong, which approved crypto ETFs for trading in April 2024.

Crypto investments face high taxes in Japan compared to other financial products. Senior research analyst Jay Jo told Decrypt that ETFs only face a 20% capital gains tax. Lower taxes for crypto could “attract more institutions to crypto investments,” according to Jo.

Japan has shown increasing interest in Bitcoin. Last year, Japanese lawmakers urged regulators to pursue a National Bitcoin Reserve. The country is also home to Metaplanet, a Bitcoin treasury company that has acquired 3,350 BTC and plans to add more.

The proposed reclassification represents a major shift in how Japan views cryptocurrencies. By treating them as financial products rather than just payment tools, the government acknowledges their growing role as investments.

The FSA’s proposal comes amid rising cryptocurrency adoption in Japan. This growth has been accompanied by an increase in fraudulent activities, highlighting the need for stronger regulations.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Is This New Coin The “Next Solana”? Traders Quietly Accumulating Ahead of Major Rally,https://blockonomi.com/is-this-new-coin-the-next-solana-traders-quietly-accumulating-ahead-of-major-rally/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:00:21 GMT","As the current bearish movements of the Solana price are not indicating any possible rebound, traders have turned their focus to a new AI-powered altcoin, IntelMarkets. This platform is already establishing itself as a leader in the crypto sphere by crossing more than $12.1M in presale.

IntelMarkets has also confirmed a 400% gain for early investors by surging the INTL token’s $0.09 presale price to $0.42 upon listing. With this massive surge ahead, experts believe this coin could be the next Solana (SOL).

IntelMarkets: Why Traders Are Quietly Accumulating This AI-Powered Altcoin?

IntelMarkets is drawing interest from traders throughout the world with its robust AI-powered infrastructure that could make crypto trading smoother and hassle-free. The platform is built on a proprietary layer-1 blockchain that is integrated with revolutionary Rodeum AI technology on all fronts.

This incorporation allows IntelMarkets to enable features such as autonomous AI bots that can be utilized to generate automated investment strategies and conduct trade execution. Along with this, the Intell-M Channel Analysis of the platform is designed with over 100,000 data points that could offer a holistic perspective of different assets by tracking them on multiple platforms.

In addition, IntelMarkets places retail investors on equal footing with institutional investors by providing them enterprise-grade AI insights. These AI-backed insights would enable them to understand hidden market patterns that are usually the result of whale and smart money moves.

While the Solana price’s downturn shows no promising gains, experts believe that if IntelMarkets even reaches 20% of the SOL token’s 64 billion market cap, it could surge up to $6.40. With this projected surge, INTL could give early traders a massive 7000% ROI. Therefore, traders are quietly accumulating this AI Altcoin ahead of this major potential rally.

Solana Price Slips Again After Brief Rebound: Will the Downtrend Continue?

At the time of writing, Solana (SOL) is trading at around $126, which indicates a failure to retest its key resistance level. The Solana price has fallen into a prolonged correction phase after hitting its all-time high at around $294 in January.

This consolidation resulted in the formation of a descending channel with which the SOL token even touched a low of around $113 on March 11. However, after this significant slump, the Solana price saw a potential recovery to around $147.

Source: CoinMarketCap

Unfortunately, this recovery was short-term, and the SOL token failed to retest its crucial resistance level at above $150.

The main reason behind this loss of interest from investors could be attributed to broader economic factors. For instance, the US government’s digital asset hoard has not yet announced the addition of any other altcoins apart from Bitcoin.

Historically, the current Solana price of around $125 has acted as a crucial point of reversal. Therefore, if it successfully manages to trade above this level, the SOL token could regain its recovery.

On the other hand, the Solana price might extend its correction even further down the descending pattern. Hence, traders are shifting their focus and quietly accumulating a new coin named IntelMarkets that could be the next Solana (SOL).

IntelMarkets Smashes $12.1M Presale Milestone: Is This the Next SOL?

IntelMarkets has successfully raised more than $12.1M worth of funding till stage 10 of its presale. Analysts are attributing this remarkable achievement to the platform’s growing demand because of its cutting-edge features and revolutionary AI integration.

One standout feature of IntelMarkets that could make it the next possible Solana (SOL) is that it incorporates Route X21. It is a quantum-proof protocol that could elevate the platform’s security to new heights along with its standard security measures. Similarly, traders will also be able to utilize the INTL Debit Card, which will allow them to make everyday transactions with crypto.

Final Thoughts

Taking into consideration the recent failure of the Solana price, investors’ faith has started wavering. Therefore, they are redirecting their attention to IntelMarkets, which promises a major rally ahead with a price boom from $0.09 to $0.42 that will guarantee 400% gains upon listing.

As the traders have started quietly accumulating the INTL tokens, it is only a matter of time before it is sold out. Therefore, those who do not want to miss out on this possible next Solana (SOL) should act fast.",blockonomi

While legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) have enjoyed their moments in the spotlight, a new contender is drawing investor attention: Coldware (COLD). With a rapidly expanding ecosystem, mobile-first design, and unmatched blockchain utility, many experts now believe Coldware (COLD) could deliver a 25X ROI—surpassing both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) in performance and practicality.

From Memes to Mechanisms: Coldware’s Edge Over Dogecoin (DOGE)

Dogecoin (DOGE) gained fame as a meme, later finding modest adoption through tipping and limited payment systems. However, despite its massive market cap and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin (DOGE) still lacks a foundational blockchain capable of running smart contracts or hosting decentralized applications (dApps). This limits its long-term scalability and real-world use.

Coldware (COLD), by contrast, is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain with a native Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus optimized for mobile devices. With mobile lite nodes, Coldware (COLD) allows everyday users to help secure the network and earn staking rewards—something Dogecoin (DOGE) cannot offer. In a world moving toward decentralization and mobile-first engagement, Coldware (COLD) is clearly better positioned for future growth.

Hedera (HBAR) Has Tech—But Coldware Has Accessibility and Momentum

Hedera (HBAR) is often recognized for its strong governance model and technical partnerships. However, despite backing from enterprises and institutions, Hedera (HBAR) has consistently struggled with price stagnation and limited grassroots adoption. Even with innovations like stablecoin integration and Telegram wallet access, Hedera (HBAR) continues to be locked in a technical downtrend with uncertain momentum.

Coldware (COLD) takes a different route—building an accessible ecosystem powered by real-world products. Its flagship hardware offerings, like the ColdBook PC and the Larna 2400 smartphone, provide users with secure access to wallets, staking tools, DeFi platforms, and Coldware-native dApps. This hands-on integration encourages adoption and boosts engagement in ways Hedera (HBAR) hasn’t been able to achieve on a large scale.

Built for Real Utility, Not Just Price Charts

What truly separates Coldware (COLD) from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) is its focus on real utility. With tools like Freeze.Mint for Layer 2 token creation, Coldswap for decentralized trading, and PayFi infrastructure for fast, global payments, Coldware (COLD) is establishing itself as a one-stop hub for blockchain activity.

Coldware (COLD) also stands out through its tokenized real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure, empowering users to fractionalize ownership of physical assets such as real estate, energy production, or intellectual property. This unlocks entirely new markets, giving Coldware (COLD) an edge over both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) in terms of economic impact.

Analysts Say 25X is On the Table—And That Might Be Conservative

While Dogecoin (DOGE) dreams of returning to its $1 all-time high and Hedera (HBAR) struggles to reclaim previous support zones,Coldware (COLD) is gaining traction. With mobile-first staking, dApp integration, and an ambitious rollout strategy, analysts are now predicting that Coldware (COLD) could deliver a 25X return for early adopters—even calling that estimate “conservative.”

Coldware’s presale momentum, combined with growing community engagement and product utility, positions it as one of the most compelling blockchain opportunities in 2025. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) might continue their slow climbs, Coldware (COLD) offers speed, structure, and scalability from day one.

While DOGE price predictions suggest a potential rebound to $0.15, many institutional and retail investors are shifting focus to Coldware (COLD), a real-world asset (RWA) blockchain project that’s quietly breaking records in its presale and ecosystem rollout.

Coldware (COLD): Building the Real-World Web3 Backbone

Coldware (COLD) is rapidly emerging as the definitive Layer-1 blockchain for real-world utility, far from the speculative meme coin status associated with Dogecoin (DOGE). With embedded PayFi infrastructure, Coldware connects decentralized payments, identity, and remittance directly to physical devices such as the Larna 2400® and ColdBook®. This makes it a major infrastructure layer for on-chain finance—something that Dogecoin (DOGE), despite years of attention, never transitioned into.

Whales that once rode the early Dogecoin (DOGE) hype are now flocking to Coldware (COLD) in anticipation of the next market cycle. With Freeze.Mint offering streamlined token creation and a thriving dApp store for smart device interoperability, Coldware is already defining the RWA wave of 2025.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Mining Attracts Small Businesses Amid Market Shifts

Despite its decline, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to maintain mining interest, particularly from smaller businesses. These operators capitalize on DOGE’s lower mining difficulty compared to Bitcoin. According to mining hardware producers, even coffee shops are installing DOGE mining rigs at multiple locations, utilizing the heat and generating extra income—about $5 to $6 daily per device.

But even this growing mining enthusiasm can’t distract from the fact that Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks a scalable utility framework. Elon Musk’s influence has certainly kept DOGE relevant, yet its tokenomics remain static, with 10,000 new DOGE minted every minute—hardly a sustainable economic model for global utility.

Why DOGE Whales Are Moving to Coldware (COLD)

Coldware (COLD) offers something Dogecoin (DOGE) simply does not: a native infrastructure for real-world value exchange and mobile-ready payment tools. DOGE may be mined, traded, and tweeted about, but it lacks the utility architecture Coldware now delivers through hardware, governance, and token staking—all running on its proprietary chain.

This shift has not gone unnoticed. Former Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are now diversifying into Coldware (COLD)’s ecosystem, attracted by the presale surge and early adoption of Coldware’s mobile Web3 devices and payment systems.

DOGE vs. COLD: Memecoin History vs. Infrastructure Future

Dogecoin (DOGE) undoubtedly helped usher in an era of viral crypto, but its limitations are now clear. Coldware (COLD), on the other hand, is delivering true digital infrastructure that connects blockchain to real-world applications through modular plug-and-play devices, identity protocols, and smart contract management.

https://blockonomi.com,"Top Crypto Picks Before April: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and Pepe (PEPE)",https://blockonomi.com/top-crypto-picks-before-april-shiba-inu-shib-mutuum-finance-mutm-and-pepe-pepe/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:10:20 GMT","As April approaches, crypto investors are scouting for the best-performing assets with high growth potential. According to industry analysts, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and Pepe (PEPE) are three standout options. These tokens are gaining momentum due to strong community engagement, promising utility, and significant upside potential.

SHIB continues to dominate the meme coin landscape at $0.000013, while PEPE rides the viral wave. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a formidable force in the DeFi sector, with its presale already drawing over 7,600 investors and raising $5.9 million. Currently priced at $0.025 in Phase 4, MUTM is set to increase to $0.03 in Phase 5, offering Phase 4 participants a potential 140% return when the token hits its $0.06 launch price.

Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates

Driven by increasing demand, Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to gain traction. During Phase 4, investors can still purchase MUTM at $0.025, but that window is quickly closing. With the next pricing phase pushing the token up to $0.03, early buyers are strategically positioning themselves for a projected 140% ROI once the token launches at $0.06. This momentum reflects the market’s growing interest in DeFi platforms that blend real utility with sustainable tokenomics.

Mutuum Finance utilizes an automated buy-and-distribute mechanism, where platform fees are allocated to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, encouraging long-term holding and reducing the impact of short-term volatility. This system creates consistent buying pressure, a unique feature compared to other highly speculative tokens.

To further build investor confidence, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a comprehensive audit by CertiK, one of the most respected names in blockchain security. Once completed, the audit results will be shared publicly through the project’s official channels.

Smart DeFi Infrastructure

A core element of Mutuum Finance’s architecture is its mtToken technology, which tokenizes deposits in ETH, DAI, and other assets. Users receive mtTokens representing their collateral, which accumulate interest over time and allow complete access to their capital. This model enables users to earn passive income while maintaining liquidity.

For instance, users can deposit $7,000 in ETH to borrow $5,000 in USDT, with loan terms managed through optimized loan-to-value ratios. This provides a secure, efficient lending process without the need for intermediaries.

Standing Apart in a Crowded Market

While meme coins like SHIB and PEPE capture attention through social momentum, Mutuum Finance differentiates itself by offering actual financial functionality. Its dual-lending structure—featuring both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) options—allows for flexible lending strategies, including custom interest rates and terms.

With over $5.9 million raised and more than 7,600 participants to date, Mutuum Finance has emerged as a compelling investment option. Phase 5 of the presale will increase the token price from $0.025 to $0.03, giving new investors a limited-time opportunity to enter before launch.

For those looking to diversify beyond meme-driven hype and into projects with real-world use cases, MUTM offers a rare blend of short-term growth and long-term value.

https://blockonomi.com,SIR.trading DeFi Protocol Loses $355K in Hack Targeting Ethereum’s Transient Storage,https://blockonomi.com/sir-trading-defi-protocol-loses-355k-in-hack-targeting-ethereums-transient-storage/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:11:42 GMT","TLDR

SIR.trading DeFi protocol lost its entire $355K TVL in a hack on March 30, 2025

The attack exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s Vault contract by manipulating a callback function

This may be one of the first real-world attacks targeting Ethereum’s transient storage feature introduced in the Dencun upgrade

The stolen funds were transferred to an address funded through Railgun, an Ethereum privacy solution

Despite the setback, the protocol’s founder (Xatarrer) indicated interest in continuing the project

Ethereum-based DeFi protocol SIR.trading was completely drained of funds in a hack on March 30, 2025. The attack resulted in the loss of approximately $355,000, which represented the protocol’s entire total value locked (TVL).

The hack was first detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity. Both companies posted warnings on X (formerly Twitter) to alert users of the breach.

🚨TenArmor Security Alert🚨 Our system has detected a suspicious attack involving #SIR.trading @leveragesir on #ETH, resulting in an approximately loss of $353.8K. The stolen funds have been deposited into RailGun. Attack transaction: https://t.co/W5SRnzKjDF… pic.twitter.com/e1OOQoKbhz — TenArmorAlert (@TenArmorAlert) March 30, 2025

SIR.trading, which stands for Synthetics Implemented Right, was designed as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage.” The platform aimed to address common challenges in leveraged trading such as volatility decay and liquidation risks.

The protocol’s founder, known only by the pseudonym Xatarrer, described the incident as “the worst news a protocol could receive.” Despite this major setback, Xatarrer suggested the team plans to continue developing the protocol.

So we go the worst news a protocol could received and got hacked for our entire TVL ($355k). I (@Xatarrer) would like to not throw the towel here as I truly believe in SIR. If you also believe in the core protocol and have any idea on how to proceed forward, please DM. https://t.co/FD6QxwfXP4 — SIR.trading (🦍^🎩) (@leveragesir) March 30, 2025

Security experts have described the attack as “clever.” It specifically targeted a callback function in the protocol’s Vault contract that leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature.

According to an analysis by Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address with an address they controlled. This allowed them to redirect funds from the vault to their own address.

TenArmorAlert explained that by repeatedly calling this callback function, the hacker drained the protocol’s entire TVL. The stolen funds have reportedly been deposited into an address funded through Railgun, an Ethereum privacy solution.

Exploiting Ethereum’s New Feature

SupLabsYi from blockchain security firm Supremacy provided more technical details about the attack. They noted that it may demonstrate a security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage feature.

6/ What’s striking is that transient storage, introduced via EIP-1153 in the Dencun hard fork, is still a nascent feature. This may be one of the first real-world attacks exploiting its vulnerabilities, may signal further changes in attack trends.https://t.co/8du3e1IVDV — Yi (@SuplabsYi) March 30, 2025

Transient storage was added to Ethereum with the Dencun upgrade last year. This feature allows for temporary storage of data and leads to lower gas fees than regular storage options.

Security researchers believe this may be one of the first attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in this new feature. SupLabsYi warned that “this isn’t merely a threat aimed at a single instance of uniswapV3SwapCallback.”

The vulnerability seems related to how the SIR.trading contract verified transactions. Typically, smart contracts should only permit transactions from trusted sources like a Uniswap pool.

However, the contract relied on transient storage, which resets only after a transaction ends. The hacker exploited this by overwriting important security data while the transaction was still running.

According to blockchain researcher Yi, the attacker brute-forced a unique vanity address. This enabled the contract to register their fake address as legitimate.

The hacker then used a custom contract to drain all funds from SIR.trading’s vault. Xatarrer has reached out to Railgun for assistance in potentially tracking or recovering the stolen funds.

Interestingly, SIR.trading’s documentation did warn users about potential risks. It stated that despite being audited, its smart contracts could still contain bugs that might lead to financial losses.

The documentation specifically highlighted the platform’s vaults as a particular area of vulnerability. It warned that “undiscovered bugs or exploits in SIR’s smart contracts could lead to fund losses.”

This incident raises questions about the security of transient storage in Ethereum. Security experts caution that unless developers implement stronger safeguards in their smart contracts, similar attacks could occur in the future.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,MARA Holdings Announces $2 Billion Stock Offering to Purchase Bitcoin,https://blockonomi.com/mara-holdings-announces-2-billion-stock-offering-to-purchase-bitcoin/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:05:18 GMT","TLDR

MARA Holdings plans to offer up to $2 billion worth of its stock to purchase more Bitcoin

The company has partnered with investment firms like Barclays and Cantor Fitzgerald to sell shares “from time to time”

MARA currently holds over 46,000 BTC worth nearly $4 billion, making it the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder

The company is following a “full HODL” strategy, keeping all mined Bitcoin and buying more

MARA reported strong Q4 2024 results with $214.4 million in revenue and recently acquired a Texas wind farm to power mining operations

MARA Holdings Inc., one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world, has announced plans to offer up to $2 billion worth of its stock to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The announcement came through a Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 28.

The Florida-based company, formerly known as Marathon Digital, has entered into an at-the-market agreement with several major investment firms. These include Cantor Fitzgerald, Barclays, and Guggenheim Securities.

Under the terms of the agreement, these firms will sell MARA shares “from time to time” directly on Nasdaq or via negotiated transactions. This flexible approach gives MARA the ability to tap into the market as needed.

“We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA stated in its SEC filing. The company did not specify a timeline or volume commitment for the stock sales.

This move mirrors the strategy employed by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Strategy has used various market offerings, including stock sales, to amass 506,137 BTC worth approximately $42.4 billion.

MARA Holdings currently holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserves among public companies. It has 46,374 BTC in its coffers, valued at around $3.9 billion according to Bitbo data.

The latest offering follows MARA’s previous financial maneuvers aimed at increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Last year, the company launched a similar offering of up to $1.5 billion worth of its shares.

In November, MARA also issued $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible senior notes. The company planned to use most of those proceeds to purchase more Bitcoin as well.

MARA CEO Fred Thiel announced in July that the company was going “full HODL.” This strategy means the miner won’t sell any of the Bitcoin it mines to fund operations, as is typical in the crypto mining industry.

Instead, MARA plans to keep all mined Bitcoin and purchase more of the cryptocurrency to hold in reserve. This approach represents a long-term bet on Bitcoin’s value appreciation.

Following Saylor’s Lead

The stock offering announcement has coincided with a downturn in MARA’s share price. The company’s stock closed down 8.58% at $12.47 on March 28, according to Google Finance.

MARA shares fell another 4.6% to $11.89 in overnight trading on March 30, as reported by Robinhood. This decline follows broader market jitters in the crypto mining sector.

Reports that Microsoft abandoned plans to invest in new data centers in the US and Europe rattled crypto mining stocks a day earlier. Meanwhile, Bitcoin was trading just above $82,000, down 1.2% over 24 hours after falling from a local high of around $83,500.

Despite the recent stock price decline, MARA has reported strong financial results. In Q4 2024, the company generated $214.4 million in revenue, marking a 37% increase from the previous quarter.

MARA ended 2024 with a net income of $528.3 million, representing a 248% jump year-over-year. The company’s adjusted EBITDA surged 207% to $794.4 million, setting a new benchmark for the mining sector.

In February, MARA completed the acquisition of a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas. The site offers 114 megawatts of wind power and 240 MW of interconnection capacity.

The wind farm was acquired to power older mining rigs that would otherwise have been retired. This move aligns with growing industry concerns about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining operations.

MARA’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy comes at a time when Bitcoin’s price has seen major growth. The cryptocurrency recently reached all-time highs above $83,000, though it has pulled back slightly in recent days.",blockonomi
