                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI's GPUs are buckling under unprecedented demand for its new image generation feature, forcing the company to implement emergency limits as users create millions of anime-inspired illustrations. The image generator, which transforms text prompts or existing photos into detailed artwork, has sparked particular enthusiasm for Studio Ghibli-style transformations. Over the last few days, users have flooded social media with pastel-colored landscapes and whimsical character portraits reminiscent of films like "Spirited Away" and "My Neighbor Totoro." This is insane, our team needs sleep," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman whine-tweeted early today. can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep — Sam Altman (@sama) March 30, 2025 That came on the heels of his initial complaint Thursday—“our GPTs are melting”— after the new image-generating capabilities had rolled out and some genius discovered that you could take any photo and turn it into a cutesy Ghibli-style image. The viral phenomenon spread beyond tech enthusiasts to the White House, which published a Ghibli-style meme making fun of a Latin American woman arrested for drug trafficking. Finally, OpenAI shut off access to its image generator in some areas, while imposing rate limits of 3 generations per hour for others. That didn’t go over well with users who complained about arbitrary limits and even hallucinated restrictions. The situation seemed to get a bit more under control Monday with OpenAI announcing that free users—who previously had more freedom of generations with the previous DALL·E 3 image generator—would be limited to just three images per day, if and when the feature becomes publicly available. Ghibligeddon apparently drove more than 1 million people to sign up for ChatGPT in one hour Monday, though how many of those subscribed to the premium service was not disclosed. Search data shows that as soon as the new model was released last week, the term "ChatGPT" briefly overtook "Google" in Google Trends. GPT-4o's image generation differs fundamentally from previous AI art tools, using more computing power. That’s because most image generators use “diffusion models” that start with a bunch of random pixels, and change them until they form a real representation of an image. For images, this technique produces more accurate details and better text rendering. Each image request triggers complex mathematical operations across many GPU cores working in parallel, consuming power and generating heat that threatens hardware if run continuously at maximum capacity. The computing crunch comes at a challenging time for OpenAI financially. Despite Altman’s claims of the company “doing really great,” the AI unicorn reportedly loses billions annually, with projections suggesting these losses could reach $14 billion by 2026. And it’s unlikely that dealing with memes is the revolutionary use case that could make a multibillion dollar business profitable, but who are we to judge?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR) said Monday that the personal cryptocurrency dealings of President Donald Trump and his family have made drafting legislation for the novel sector “more complicated,” in a rare rebuke of the president’s personal activities by a key member of congressional Republican leadership. “They have made our work more complicated,” Hill told reporters Monday, in reference to those projects. Since returning to power, Trump and his inner circle have rapidly expanded their crypto portfolios at the same time that the president is determining policies with direct impact on those same assets and sectors. In recent months, Trump and business partners have launched a Solana meme coin and an Ethereum decentralized finance platform called World Liberty Financial, which recently announced its own stablecoin. Trump’s existing businesses have also aggressively expanded their exposure to crypto in the same period. Just this morning, the president’s son, Eric and Don Jr, inked a deal to launch their own Bitcoin mining venture. Further, White House officials are currently, at his direction, working with Republicans in Congress to help shape key pieces of legislation that will create, for the first time, an American crypto regulatory regime. But it appears patience among congressional Republicans over the scope of those lucrative schemes may be waning. The House Financial Services Committee is set to mark up its version of proposed stablecoin legislation, the STABLE Act, on Wednesday, and will soon consider a newer version of a market structure bill, according to comments made by Chair Hill Monday. A parallel stablecoin bill is also currently making its way through the Senate. Such bills, if passed into law, would for the first time offer a clear path to legal certainty for a variety of crypto projects and companies, based on their compliance with new rules currently being ironed out. Their passage is anticipated to bring with it a wave of investment and support for the crypto industry from traditional finance institutions that until now have been waiting on the sidelines. Though those bills possess bipartisan support, Trump’s personal business dealings have offered resistant Democrats a convenient means to protest their passage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of Bitcoin fell to a two-week low on Monday before recovering some losses, as other major cryptocurrencies also seesawed two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground. Bitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. After tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.) Ethereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month. The volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager noted in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.” Some analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that Bitcoin’s price has bottomed. Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently. Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently changing hands at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%. Bitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. "BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Android users beware: A newly discovered piece of malware is targeting smartphone crypto wallets. Uncovered by fraud prevention firm ThreatFabric, the “Crocodilus” mobile banking trojan employs tools including remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting through accessibility logging to trick crypto holders into handing over their wallet seed phrase. The malware “is masquerading as crypto-related apps and involves specific social engineering techniques to make victims reveal the secrets stored inside cryptocurrency wallet applications,” Aleksandar Eremin, head of mobile threat intelligence at ThreatFabric, told Decrypt. Crucially, this threat tricks Android users into providing the seed phrase for their own cryptocurrency wallet. ThreatFabric said Crocodilus is being distributed through a proprietary dropper that bypasses security protections on Android 13 or later. Once this dropper installs the malware, without triggering Play Protect, it requests Accessibility Service permissions. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet.” Crocodilus also works as a remote access trojan (RAT), meaning operators can navigate the user interface, swipe using gesture control and even take screenshots. The malware does all this discreetly by using a black screen overlay, so the phone owner can't actually see what actions are being carried out remotely. At time of publishing it appears that only users in Spain and Turkey have been affected by Crocodilus. According to ThreatFabric, users are tricked into downloading the droppers through malicious sites, social media, fake promotions, text messages and third-party app stores. Android users can mitigate against the risk by only using the Google Play Store to download apps, and not downloading APKs from other sites. Eremin told Decrypt that despite being a “newcomer to the mobile threat landscape,” Crocodilus’ “rich set of capabilities” could make it a competitor to established malware-as-a-service on underground markets.</p>

X2Y2 tokens were tied to this NFT vision, and as we close this chapter, that's likely to hit hard,” said pseudonymous X2Y2 founder TP in a statement. I'm immensely grateful to our amazing community who made this possible. The current price is more than 99% off its all-time high of $4.14 from February 2022. Once a prominent competitor to major NFT trading platforms like OpenSea and Blur, X2Y2 ranks fourth all-time for Ethereum NFT trading volume, facilitating more than $5.6 billion in transactions according to TokenTerminal. The marketplace, which routinely saw more than $100 million in weekly NFT trading volumes in 2022, has recently processed around $1 million worth of trades weekly. We fought tooth and nail to be #1, but after three years, it's clear it's time to move on,” wrote the firm’s founder. “The NFT chapter taught us a lot—most of all, that lasting value beats chasing trends. Despite closing its marketplace, the team is not leaving crypto entirely. Instead it will pivot its focus to the intersection of AI and crypto, primarily focused on “yields in a permissionless way, powered by AI.” This isn't just another project; it's our shot at creating real, long-term value in crypto, for the broader community we're proud to serve,” TP concluded. X2Y2 did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.</p>

Musk’s love affair with Vine started back in January when he said he was “looking into” bringing back the popular app, amid concerns that TikTok would be banned in the U.S.. Not long after, the co-founder of Vine, Rus Yusupov, launched a Solana meme coin hinting that the app’s return could possibly use the token, prompting it to quickly touch a $498 million market cap. On Friday, Dane Jacobson, an employee of xAI, the artificial intelligence arm of Musk’s X, said on X that the company now “owns” Vine. He asked his followers what should be done with the app. Musk responded “feel free to take that on,” with many taking this as the billionaire greenlighting the revival. Feel free to take that on — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 29, 2025 Vine Coin pumped 110% from Friday into Saturday to a market cap of $52 million, following the Musk interaction. Polymarket betters believe there is a 24% chance that X relaunches Vine before July, down from 58% at the end of January. Alongside the launch of Vine Coin, Yusupov created a website of the same name which includes a waitlist. This has spurred on rumors that the popular app will soon return— and might even incorporate the token. Musk has previously toyed with using cryptocurrencies in his business ventures, including accepting Dogecoin for Tesla vehicles and investing in crypto through his companies. More recently, it was reported that the billionaire was pondering the use of a public blockchain for the Department of Government Efficiency, although this hasn’t come to fruition yet. On its January launch, it spiked at a market cap of $248.5 million but has since fallen 94% to a $14.88 million market cap, according to DEX Screener.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The regulator, which now has a crypto task force led by longtime industry advocate Hester Peirce, is moving away from what Pierce and others have called “regulation by enforcement” to less hostile engagements with crypto. Here are the SEC's biggest pivots, reversals, and exits so far under Trump. The stay is in effect until April 14, at which point both parties will need to submit a status report. The exchange has dealt with alleged securities, money laundering, and sanctions compliance issues since at least 2023, which led to two separate settlements for $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. On February 17, the SEC voluntarily dropped an appeal in a case revolving around the regulator's previous attempts to extend securities laws to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and users. The appeal was made after a federal judge in Texas called the regulator's expanded definitions unlawful, citing that it was conflating DeFi traders with financial brokers. Leading American crypto exchange Coinbase had its lawsuit officially dismissed by the SEC in February. Prior to official approval, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said of the dismissal “there will be no settlement or compromise—a wrong will simply be made right." The SEC has ended its investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea, the firm said in February, dropping charges that alleged it operated as an unlicensed securities brokerage. “Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward—one that misinterprets the law and slows innovation.” “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed,” said Robinhood's Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer Dan Gallagher. The firm was notified of a potential enforcement action in May 2024 when it received a Wells notice from the Gary Gensler-led SEC. Like other leading crypto organizations, Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice in April 2024 which alleged it operated as an unregistered securities broker, exchange, and clearing agency, and that had enabled the sale of an unregistered security. With the investigation said to be over, all of the aforementioned claims have now been dropped, said its CEO Hayden Adams. A two-year investigation into Gemini Trust about the unregistered sale of securities ended last week without an enforcement action from the Commission. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss noted the milestone, but said that it “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” Winklevoss estimated that the regulator cost his firm “tens of millions in legal fees and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation." The joint filing indicates a resolution would be beneficial on account of “conserving judicial resources.” MetaMask and Linea parent company, Consensys, had its case officially dismissed on March 27, which focused on staking features within MetaMask. “We were committed to fighting this suit until the bitter end but welcome this outcome,” said Consensys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin on X when it was expected the Commission would drop the case. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That approval came on March 27, officially dropping the case. That suit was settled in February 2023, with Kraken agreeing to pay a $30 million fine. But the regulator sued the platform again in November 2023, alleging it was operating as an unregistered securities exchange, dealer, and broker. “This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward,” the company posted on X. “I can say personally how much of a weight off our shoulders this is for those who just want to build and always try to do the right thing,” CEO Rob Viglione said. “Horizen Labs could have gone offshore, like many did, but we chose to stay in the U.S. despite the war on crypto.” Market maker Cumberland’s case was officially dropped alongside a pair of other crypto cases on March 27. “As a firm deeply committed to the principles of integrity and transparency, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the SEC to help shape a future where technological advancements and regulatory clarity go hand-in-hand,” it posted on X when it first announced the joint filing to drop the case. The SEC and Department of Justice both agreed to drop cases against BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji, after the agencies alleged he defrauded investors, with the SEC claiming that he perpetrated a "multi-million-dollar fraudulent crypto asset scheme.” BitClout, a social network that tokenized Twitter (now X) accounts, was backed by notable crypto investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on March 19 that the SEC’s case against the firm is over, with a Ripple spokesperson telling Decrypt that the conclusion is still pending approval by SEC commissioners—similar to other recent case dismissals. “We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action or settlement,” said Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer of Crypto.com in a statement. The investigation centered on potential securities violations surrounding the sale of IMX tokens in 2021 in which Immutable raised at least $12.5 million. “That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action,” Immutable posted on X. “This is a huge win - not just for Web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights.” Haliey Welch, better known as the "Hawk Tuah" girl, told TMZ that the SEC’s investigation into her meme coin debacle is now over. In December the internet celebrity launched a Solana meme coin—HAWK—which went horribly wrong, leading to allegations of a rug pull as the token's price collapsed very quickly after launch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After scooping up around 22,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $87,000 per coin, the firm said it now holds 528,185 Bitcoin veiled at $35.6 billion, according to a press release. The Tysons, Virginia-based firm said that it had meanwhile raised $1.2 billion by selling common stock through an at-the-money program unveiled in October, and $1.85 million through the sale of “STRK” perpetual preferred stock, a product introduced in January. Strategy is authorized to sell $21 billion worth of the Nasdaq-listed product, which features an 8% cumulative dividend that’s payable in either cash or Class A shares. On-chain prediction market Myriad, a unit of Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, forecast a more than 92% probability that Strategy would purchase more Bitcoin during the week starting March 24. Strategy’s stock price fell more than 3% when markets opened on Monday, dropping below $274, according to Nasdaq, but the stock regained lost ground and was in positive territory more recently. The price of STRK also fell to $86.26 on Monday morning Eastern Time. Just over a week ago, the product, which began trading in late February, hit an all-time low of $82. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, have wavered amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. The average Bitcoin price that Strategy paid for its recent acquisition is higher than a week prior, when the company said it had bought $584 million worth of Bitcoin around $84,500 per coin. Strategy’s Bitcoin-buying activity has been heating up for the past three weeks, but it stopped stockpiling the assets for several weeks starting in February, according to Saylor Tracker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, Bitcoin has gained widespread recognition for its ability to preserve wealth, unlock liquidity, and provide a framework for risk-managed wealth growth. But how exactly can Bitcoin be leveraged to create value? This article explores the strategies for preserving bitcoin’s value, unlocking liquidity without selling, and growing wealth while managing risks, all while maximizing the asset’s potential for value creation. SALT Lending makes these strategies accessible with our bitcoin-backed loan platform—designed to help you preserve wealth and unlock liquidity without selling. The Bitcoin Advantage lies in its ability to serve as a store of value, source of liquidity, and financial hedge, all within a decentralized and secure framework. Unlike most traditional assets, bitcoin can easily be leveraged as collateral, allowing individuals to access liquidity without selling and forfeiting potential future gains. As bitcoin adoption grows, its role in wealth management, lending, and financial independence continues to expand, reinforcing its position as a cornerstone of the modern digital economy. To fully appreciate bitcoin’s potential, we must first understand what sets it apart as a financial asset. Bitcoin’s long-term value starts with understanding how core principles like scarcity, decentralization, and self-sovereignty ensures security while maximizing wealth preservation. This section outlines the foundation for how you can think about smart accumulation, secure storage, and long-term financial planning. Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition is underpinned by several fundamental principles. Let’s break down why these principles matter and how they play a crucial role in wealth creation, especially from a lending and borrowing standpoint: As of early 2025, over 19 million bitcoin have been mined, underscoring its scarcity. This finite supply contrasts with traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, potentially leading to inflation. As of early 2025, over 19 million bitcoin have been mined, underscoring its scarcity. This finite supply contrasts with traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, potentially leading to inflation. Security and Immutability: Bitcoin’s blockchain is secured by a vast network of miners who validate transactions, making it one of the most secure digital ledgers. Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and trust. Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and trust. Self-Sovereignty: Bitcoin allows individuals to hold and transfer value without intermediaries, granting users full control over their assets. This autonomy is particularly valuable in regions with unstable financial systems or restrictive capital controls. SALT Lending is all about keeping bitcoin safe and making borrowing simple. A well-planned approach to acquiring bitcoin can significantly impact long-term wealth preservation. Here’s how to accumulate bitcoin with confidence and efficiency: Purchasing additional bitcoin during market corrections can lower the average acquisition cost and capitalize on price rebounds. Historical data shows that bitcoin has experienced significant growth over extended periods, despite short-term volatility. It is important to understand security strategies and tools while managing your collateral for maximum wealth preservation. This section lays out key considerations when thinking about custody management and secure storage for bitcoin: For added protection, multi-signature wallets require multiple private keys to access funds. These services provide advanced security protocols to ensure the safety of large bitcoin holdings. High-net-worth individuals and businesses may opt for institutional custodial services that offer insured storage solutions. These services provide advanced security protocols to ensure the safety of large bitcoin holdings. While preserving bitcoin’s value is crucial, what if you need liquidity without selling? While bitcoin’s value proposition lies in its ability to preserve wealth, there may come a time when liquidity is needed for other investments or expenses. Instead of selling bitcoin, which could mean missing out on future gains, holders can access liquidity without parting with their BTC. One of the most effective ways to do this is through bitcoin-backed borrowing. Our lending platform allows you to access the value of your bitcoin without selling it—perfect for maintaining long-term upside while funding other opportunities. Bitcoin-backed loans allow bitcoin holders to unlock liquidity without selling their holdings. These loans use bitcoin as collateral, offering a number of key benefits: Capital Efficiency: By using bitcoin as collateral, investors can access fiat currency without having to liquidate their BTC. By using bitcoin as collateral, investors can access fiat currency without having to liquidate their BTC. No Credit Score Requirements: Traditional loans often depend on personal credit scores and financial history, but bitcoin-backed loans rely solely on the value of the collateral. Check out SALT’s bitcoin-backed loans and see how we make liquidity simple. By using bitcoin-backed loans instead, holders can access cash without triggering tax liabilities: Deferred Tax Liabilities: Since bitcoin is not sold in a loan arrangement, no capital gains taxes are incurred at the time of borrowing. This allows holders to defer taxes and retain the full value of their bitcoin investment. Since bitcoin is not sold in a loan arrangement, no capital gains taxes are incurred at the time of borrowing. This allows holders to defer taxes and retain the full value of their bitcoin investment. This creates an additional incentive to borrow against bitcoin rather than sell it, making the strategy even more tax-efficient. This creates an additional incentive to borrow against bitcoin rather than sell it, making the strategy even more tax-efficient. Portfolio Retention: By borrowing against bitcoin, investors retain their BTC holdings, ensuring that they continue to benefit from its appreciation without sacrificing exposure to future gains. Leverage Management: Align Borrowing to Risk Profile and Hedge Against Dips When borrowing against bitcoin, it’s important to manage leverage carefully. Here are some strategies to mitigate risks associated with borrowing: This reduces the risk of margin calls, especially in volatile market conditions. This reduces the risk of margin calls, especially in volatile market conditions. Hedging Strategies: Investors can use options or futures contracts to hedge against potential price declines, protecting themselves from significant downside risks while using their bitcoin as collateral. A long-term wealth strategy ensures that bitcoin’s value is maximized over the years while managing exposure to market fluctuations: As traditional retirement accounts face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin can offer an alternative that provides growth potential and independence. As traditional retirement accounts face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin can offer an alternative that provides growth potential and independence. Bitcoin wealth can be passed down to future generations through proper estate planning. Diversified Growth Strategies: While bitcoin can provide substantial upside, diversification remains key. Combining bitcoin with traditional assets such as real estate or stocks can help balance risk and stability while still benefiting from bitcoin’s growth potential. Compounding is one of the most powerful ways to grow wealth over time. Here’s how bitcoin holders can reinvest to optimize returns: These can provide an opportunity for holders to generate passive income by leveraging their Bitcoin holdings. Although bitcoin itself isn’t stakeable in the traditional sense, some platforms offer BTC-backed yield products. These can provide an opportunity for holders to generate passive income by leveraging their Bitcoin holdings. Reinvesting Loan Proceeds: Bitcoin-backed loans can be used to acquire additional income-generating assets. By reinvesting loan proceeds, holders can further compound their wealth over time. By reinvesting loan proceeds, holders can further compound their wealth over time. Compounding Growth Over Market Cycles: During bull markets, bitcoin’s price tends to appreciate rapidly. By reinvesting profits during these periods, holders can significantly increase their bitcoin holdings and overall wealth. Incorporating bitcoin into a well-diversified portfolio can help manage volatility while enabling long-term growth. A carefully structured mix of assets helps weather economic shifts while positioning for bitcoin’s growth potential. Alternative Asset Allocation: A balanced portfolio should include bitcoin alongside other assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This ensures that the portfolio can weather market volatility while benefiting from bitcoin’s potential growth.

This ensures that the portfolio can weather market volatility while benefiting from bitcoin’s potential growth. As you can see, bitcoin presents huge opportunities for value creation, wealth preservation, and financial flexibility. Whether through disciplined accumulation, tax-efficient borrowing, or reinvestment approaches, Bitcoin serves as a powerful tool for building and maintaining long-term wealth. As Bitcoin continues to reshape the financial ecosystem, those who understand and utilize its unique strengths can position themselves for sustained growth and financial independence. With the right approach, bitcoin holders can manage volatility, capitalize on opportunities, and secure their financial future. At SALT Lending, we specialize in helping individuals and businesses leverage bitcoin for long-term value creation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill S. 0451, which was introduced to the Rhode Island Senate last month, permits the state’s residents and businesses to make up to 10 payments in bitcoin valued at less than $1,000 per month (or sell the equivalent amount) without being subject to state capital gains taxes.

The bill is an amendment to existing state income tax laws, and the exact language in the proposed legislation is as follows:

“Any sale of [b]itcoin by an individual or business in Rhode Island shall be exempt from state taxation if the total value of sales is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per diem. The limit of the state tax exempt [b]itcoin transaction shall not exceed ten (10) sales per a thirty (30) day cycle.”

And the bill defines a “sale of [b]itcoin” as “any transaction in which [b]itcoin is sold or exchanged for another form of value, such as fiat currency or other physical or digital assets.”

The bill also clarifies that this exemption only applies at the state level and that it doesn’t affect federal tax obligations.

Under the bill, individuals and businesses who engage with these types of tax-exempt bitcoin transactions are responsible for keeping records of these transactions, including the total value of sales per day, and should be prepared to provide these records to the Rhode Island’s department of revenue for audit or compliance purposes.

In a slide deck prepared by the Rhode Island Blockchain Council that was shared with Bitcoin Magazine, Chris Perrotta, Chairman of the Council, wrote that the passing of Bill S. 0451 would help to reduce friction for digital asset payments.

He stated that “current tax implications of spending BTC hamper its utility for Rhode Island citizens and stifle economic activity.”

Perrotta also noted that the passing of this bill would stimulate blockchain-based economic activity in the state, making Rhode Island one of the states at the forefront of this technology.

What is more, he also proposed that small businesses accept bitcoin for products and services as a means to stimulate economic growth.

Thus far, no other U.S. states have introduced comparable bills.

At the federal level, the only bill that has proposed something similar is the Lummis-Gillibrand “Responsible Financial Innovation Act”, which provides a de minimus tax exemption on bitcoin transactions valued up to $200.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the current bearish movements of the Solana price are not indicating any possible rebound, traders have turned their focus to a new AI-powered altcoin, IntelMarkets. IntelMarkets has also confirmed a 400% gain for early investors by surging the INTL token’s $0.09 presale price to $0.42 upon listing. IntelMarkets: Why Traders Are Quietly Accumulating This AI-Powered Altcoin? IntelMarkets is drawing interest from traders throughout the world with its robust AI-powered infrastructure that could make crypto trading smoother and hassle-free. This incorporation allows IntelMarkets to enable features such as autonomous AI bots that can be utilized to generate automated investment strategies and conduct trade execution. Along with this, the Intell-M Channel Analysis of the platform is designed with over 100,000 data points that could offer a holistic perspective of different assets by tracking them on multiple platforms. These AI-backed insights would enable them to understand hidden market patterns that are usually the result of whale and smart money moves. While the Solana price’s downturn shows no promising gains, experts believe that if IntelMarkets even reaches 20% of the SOL token’s 64 billion market cap, it could surge up to $6.40. With this projected surge, INTL could give early traders a massive 7000% ROI. Solana Price Slips Again After Brief Rebound: Will the Downtrend Continue? The Solana price has fallen into a prolonged correction phase after hitting its all-time high at around $294 in January. This consolidation resulted in the formation of a descending channel with which the SOL token even touched a low of around $113 on March 11. However, after this significant slump, the Solana price saw a potential recovery to around $147. Unfortunately, this recovery was short-term, and the SOL token failed to retest its crucial resistance level at above $150. The main reason behind this loss of interest from investors could be attributed to broader economic factors. Therefore, if it successfully manages to trade above this level, the SOL token could regain its recovery. Hence, traders are shifting their focus and quietly accumulating a new coin named IntelMarkets that could be the next Solana (SOL). Analysts are attributing this remarkable achievement to the platform’s growing demand because of its cutting-edge features and revolutionary AI integration. Similarly, traders will also be able to utilize the INTL Debit Card, which will allow them to make everyday transactions with crypto. Therefore, they are redirecting their attention to IntelMarkets, which promises a major rally ahead with a price boom from $0.09 to $0.42 that will guarantee 400% gains upon listing. As the traders have started quietly accumulating the INTL tokens, it is only a matter of time before it is sold out. Therefore, those who do not want to miss out on this possible next Solana (SOL) should act fast.</p>

Born from MIT’s 2014 Bitcoin Project—which distributed Bitcoin to undergraduates to study adoption—the expo has evolved into a critical forum for sovereignty-focused dialogue. This year’s agenda of freedom tech focuses on physical liberation through technology. Speakers like Zimbabwean activist Evan Mawarire (#ThisFlag movement leader) and Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja will dissect Bitcoin’s role in resisting authoritarian control and enabling real-world escape from oppression. Corporate adoption takes center stage with Marathon Digital’s Paul Giordano and Bitcoin Core developers like Gloria Zhao. Get more technical in the afternoon with topics such as consensus cleanup, poisoning attacks, censorship resistance, Bitcoin Pipes, etc. Day 2: Shift to global impact with Mauricio Bartolomeo (exfiltration via Bitcoin) and panels featuring activists from Venezuela, Russia, and Togo. Other topics include future of freedom tech, quantum resistance, covenant soft fork, Tor project, etc. Running parallel (April 4–6), this $10,000-prize event challenges developers to build tools for privacy, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty14. Past projects have secured funding from industry leaders—proof of MIT’s “Mind and Hand” ethos in action4. Additionally, Anna Chekhovich from the HRF will run a workshop on Bitcoin self-custody 101. Tickets remain accessible, speakers present pro bono, and discussions tackle pressing questions: – How can Bitcoin enable physical escape from authoritarian regimes? – Can corporations adopt Bitcoin without compromising its ethos?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the crypto market gears up for its next bull cycle, analysts are shifting their focus toward projects with real-world use cases and sustainable models. While legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) have enjoyed their moments in the spotlight, a new contender is drawing investor attention: Coldware (COLD). Dogecoin (DOGE) gained fame as a meme, later finding modest adoption through tipping and limited payment systems. However, despite its massive market cap and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin (DOGE) still lacks a foundational blockchain capable of running smart contracts or hosting decentralized applications (dApps). With mobile lite nodes, Coldware (COLD) allows everyday users to help secure the network and earn staking rewards—something Dogecoin (DOGE) cannot offer. In a world moving toward decentralization and mobile-first engagement, Coldware (COLD) is clearly better positioned for future growth. Hedera (HBAR) is often recognized for its strong governance model and technical partnerships. Coldware (COLD) takes a different route—building an accessible ecosystem powered by real-world products. This hands-on integration encourages adoption and boosts engagement in ways Hedera (HBAR) hasn’t been able to achieve on a large scale. What truly separates Coldware (COLD) from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) is its focus on real utility. Coldware (COLD) also stands out through its tokenized real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure, empowering users to fractionalize ownership of physical assets such as real estate, energy production, or intellectual property. This unlocks entirely new markets, giving Coldware (COLD) an edge over both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) in terms of economic impact. Coldware’s presale momentum, combined with growing community engagement and product utility, positions it as one of the most compelling blockchain opportunities in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the crypto market continues to show signs of volatility, Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a crossroads. While DOGE price predictions suggest a potential rebound to $0.15, many institutional and retail investors are shifting focus to Coldware (COLD), a real-world asset (RWA) blockchain project that’s quietly breaking records in its presale and ecosystem rollout. This makes it a major infrastructure layer for on-chain finance—something that Dogecoin (DOGE), despite years of attention, never transitioned into. With Freeze.Mint offering streamlined token creation and a thriving dApp store for smart device interoperability, Coldware is already defining the RWA wave of 2025. Despite its decline, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to maintain mining interest, particularly from smaller businesses. These operators capitalize on DOGE’s lower mining difficulty compared to Bitcoin. But even this growing mining enthusiasm can’t distract from the fact that Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks a scalable utility framework. Coldware (COLD) offers something Dogecoin (DOGE) simply does not: a native infrastructure for real-world value exchange and mobile-ready payment tools. DOGE may be mined, traded, and tweeted about, but it lacks the utility architecture Coldware now delivers through hardware, governance, and token staking—all running on its proprietary chain. Former Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are now diversifying into Coldware (COLD)’s ecosystem, attracted by the presale surge and early adoption of Coldware’s mobile Web3 devices and payment systems. Dogecoin (DOGE) undoubtedly helped usher in an era of viral crypto, but its limitations are now clear. Coldware (COLD), on the other hand, is delivering true digital infrastructure that connects blockchain to real-world applications through modular plug-and-play devices, identity protocols, and smart contract management. DOGE whales are no longer simply looking for memes—they want real yield, scalable solutions, and meaningful integrations. With decentralized payment tools, real-time microtransaction capabilities, and hardware-integrated Web3 onboarding, Coldware (COLD) is now positioned as the utility token DOGE never became.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings is going all in on BTC again—this time with a $2 billion war chest. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, formerly Marathon Digital, revealed in a Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it entered into an at-the-market (ATM) agreement with major financial firms, including Barclays Capital, BMO Capital Markets, BTIG, and Cantor Fitzgerald. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $81,416.81, down about 2.4% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Analysts said investors have been reacting to heightened trader war tension and signs that inflation could keep inching higher. Yahoo Finance data shows MARA stock fell 8.58% on March 28 to $12.47 as crypto mining stocks broadly declined amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The strategy was made famous by Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has turned aggressive Bitcoin accumulation into a corporate identity. Strategy currently leads all public companies with 506,137 BTC on its balance sheet. MARA is next in line, with 46,374 BTC—worth nearly $3.8 billion at current prices, as per Bitcoin Treasuries data. Last July, MARA CEO Fred Thiel did say the company was “going full HODL,” committing to retain all mined BTC and even “periodically make strategic purchases on the open market.” The SEC filing comes just weeks after MARA reported record earnings for Q4 2024, with revenue climbing 37% year-over-year to $214.4 million and net income jumping 248% to $528.3 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As April approaches, crypto investors are scouting for the best-performing assets with high growth potential. These tokens are gaining momentum due to strong community engagement, promising utility, and significant upside potential. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a formidable force in the DeFi sector, with its presale already drawing over 7,600 investors and raising $5.9 million. Driven by increasing demand, Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to gain traction. During Phase 4, investors can still purchase MUTM at $0.025, but that window is quickly closing. This momentum reflects the market’s growing interest in DeFi platforms that blend real utility with sustainable tokenomics. Mutuum Finance utilizes an automated buy-and-distribute mechanism, where platform fees are allocated to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, encouraging long-term holding and reducing the impact of short-term volatility. This system creates consistent buying pressure, a unique feature compared to other highly speculative tokens. To further build investor confidence, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a comprehensive audit by CertiK, one of the most respected names in blockchain security. A core element of Mutuum Finance’s architecture is its mtToken technology, which tokenizes deposits in ETH, DAI, and other assets. This model enables users to earn passive income while maintaining liquidity. This provides a secure, efficient lending process without the need for intermediaries. While meme coins like SHIB and PEPE capture attention through social momentum, Mutuum Finance differentiates itself by offering actual financial functionality. With over $5.9 million raised and more than 7,600 participants to date, Mutuum Finance has emerged as a compelling investment option.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business intelligence company Strategy continued stacking sats by acquiring 22,048 bitcoin worth nearly $2 billion. According to a March 31 SEC filing, Strategy purchased the coins for $1.92 billion last week, or around $86,969 per bitcoin. This boosted the company’s total bitcoin treasury to 528,185 BTC acquired for $35.63 billion. The recent buys were funded mostly through issuing $1.2 billion of new MSTR common shares. By buying bitcoin funded via equity, Strategy converts its corporate treasury from dollars into hard assets. The company has pioneered using its balance sheet as a leveraged play on bitcoin’s rise. Strategy’s average purchase price per bitcoin has also steadily increased to $67,458. The company may soon be buying BTC below its cost basis if prices continue drifting lower. Regardless, Strategy remains ultra bullish on bitcoin over the long term. The company expects to benefit from bitcoin’s appreciation over decades against fiat currencies being devalued by inflation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Claims are valued at November 2022 prices, when Bitcoin was worth 80% less than today The company faces billions in disputed or fraudulent claims that may delay full distribution Despite controversy over valuation dates, creditors are expected to receive 118-119% of their claims in cash The company has amassed $11.4 billion in cash for distribution to those with claims exceeding $50,000. The exchange imploded after revelations that founder Sam Bankman-Fried had misused customer funds to prop up his hedge fund Alameda Research. FTX’s bankruptcy attorney Andrew Dietderich confirmed the payment timeline in court this week. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved FTX’s payout plan in October 2023, setting the stage for these repayments. CEO John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s dissolution, has led the asset recovery efforts. This successful asset recovery means FTX now has more money than its $11.2 billion in liabilities. The approved restructuring plan should allow creditors to receive 118-119% of their claim value in cash. However, many creditors remain unhappy with how their claims are being calculated. All cryptocurrency holdings are valued based on November 2022 prices, when Bitcoin traded between $16,000 and $21,000. Other cryptocurrencies have seen even more dramatic gains, with Solana up 650% and XRP rising 450% during the same period. “It will definitely give closure to many affected by this horrendous ordeal,” he said. Some creditors had hoped to receive payment in cryptocurrency rather than cash. A few have pursued litigation seeking crypto-denominated repayments, though their chances of success appear low after Judge Dorsey enforced cash settlements. Dietderich described facing “27 quintillion” total submissions, with billions deemed fraudulent or inflated. Russia, China, and Egypt are among the countries currently unable to receive payments. Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder, was convicted of fraud and received a 25-year prison sentence in March 2024. For the crypto industry, FTX’s repayment process represents a step toward rebuilding trust.</p>

The leading cryptocurrency has fallen to around $82,000, marking its seventh consecutive day of lower lows. The President has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Russian oil imports “at any moment.” This geopolitical tension comes at a time when Bitcoin was already showing weakness. The cryptocurrency has been losing ground throughout March, putting it on track for possibly its weakest first-quarter performance since 2018. Last week’s core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data showed a higher-than-expected increase in inflation. The bank cited a lower growth baseline, deteriorating household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating a willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies. The threat of wider tariffs is adding to market jitters. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows no crossover in sight, confirming bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) paints a similar picture of weakness. Crypto trader Arthur Hayes believes the Federal Reserve could trigger a Bitcoin price boom in April, but others are more cautious. Veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has predicted a steep drop to $65,635. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor recently posted his famous orange dots Bitcoin chart with the caption “Needs even more Orange,” indicating ongoing purchases by the company. Marathon Digital has launched a $2 billion stock sale to power new Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet and Strategy continue to bolster their holdings despite market uncertainty. This suggests that long-term holders are using the price dip as a buying opportunity. This reduction in exchange supply could eventually help stabilize prices if selling pressure subsides. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has clashed with President Trump over the pace of interest rate reductions. The last trading day of March will be crucial for Bitcoin. Traders are watching closely to see if the cryptocurrency can maintain support above $80,000 or if it will break down further as fears of “Trump tariffs” intensify.</p>

Currently trading at approximately $0.66, ADA has been testing the patience of investors as it hovers in a narrow range following a dip to $0.49 in early February. According to cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi, ADA experienced a steep correction in early August last year, followed by a lengthy consolidation period before eventually rallying. “Since the dip on August 5, it hasn’t recorded a new low – just as it hasn’t now, following the dip on February 3.” 💡 ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August–September 2024. Since the dip on August 5, it hasn't recorded a new low—just as it hasn't now, following the dip on February 3. If this pattern holds, May could bring a massive pump,… pic.twitter.com/bz5VlUEsKQ — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) March 30, 2025 This cyclical pattern has led some experts to predict a potential breakout in May. Transaction volume has remained steady while the number of transactions continues to climb, indicating growing adoption and increased network utility. Historically, rising network activity has been a precursor to positive price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 37.49, suggesting oversold conditions. This suggests that bullish traders have been caught off guard by recent declines. Technical analyst Mosesifunanya at CoinMarketCap advises caution, suggesting bearish entries below $0.6539 could target $0.6333, while bullish positions should only be considered after a confirmed break above $0.7030. Traders are closely monitoring this level for signs of a potential breakout or breakdown. Cardano’s all-time high stands at $3.10, making current prices a far cry from previous peaks. However, the ecosystem continues to show signs of development and adoption that could support future price appreciation. While such predictions may seem optimistic given current price levels, proponents point to the network’s fundamentals as justification. The coming weeks will be crucial for Cardano’s price action. If the historical pattern repeats, May could bring increased volatility and potential upside. However, traders should remain cautious as technical indicators have not yet confirmed a strong reversal. As of March 31, 2025, ADA is trading at $0.6581, down 3.53% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has declined over 20% to $517.32 million, reflecting the current consolidation phase as market participants await clearer directional signals.</p>

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading around $1,800. This failure triggered a series of declines that pushed the price below several important support zones. It then continued lower, breaking the $1,880 level which had previously served as a stable floor. A low formed at $1,767 before the price attempted to bounce back above $1,800. Despite this small recovery, ETH remains below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Technical analysis shows ETH is trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. This is often seen as a bearish signal by traders and market analysts. A connecting bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart. This adds another hurdle for bulls attempting to push the price higher. A break above $2,000 might trigger more gains, potentially reaching $2,050 or even $2,120. However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, another decline could follow. Below that, the major support is at $1,765, which was recently tested. A break under this level could send the price toward $1,720 or even lower to $1,680. The 125,603 $ETH($229M) held by these two whales on #Maker is at risk of liquidation! This pattern could signal a reversal if ETH bounces strongly from current levels. However, price action near the $1,762 support level indicates possible bullish interest forming. A potential Doji candle formation suggests indecision in the market. This could mark the beginning of a double-bottom reversal pattern. Adding pressure to the market, crypto whales face liquidation risks. Two large holders on Maker DAO control 125,603 ETH worth approximately $229 million. These positions face liquidation at price levels of $1,787 and $1,701. If triggered, these liquidations could accelerate ETH’s downward movement. Despite the current bearish outlook, some analysts remain optimistic. They point to ETH holding the lower boundary of a descending triangle pattern. A bounce from current levels could challenge resistance at $1,950 and $2,080. This suggests a potential bounce, but the market remains highly uncertain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP has fallen below $2.10, making it the worst-performing top 10 altcoin with a 14.5% weekly decline Price dropped despite positive news about Ripple’s SEC lawsuit resolution Large whale sell-offs of over 1.12B XRP (worth $2.3 billion) are intensifying the downward pressure XRP is approaching the critical $2.00 support level not seen since May 11 Technical indicators show bearish momentum with resistance at $2.15 and $2.20 The price decline comes as a surprise to many observers. This news briefly pushed XRP to $2.60 on March 19. XRP has lost about 20% of its value since that March peak. XRP’s 14.5% weekly decline stands out compared to other cryptocurrencies. The broader market correction has hurt all cryptocurrencies. Technical analysis shows XRP facing multiple resistance levels. There is a bearish trend line forming at $2.148 on hourly charts. A clear move above this level could send XRP toward $2.250 or even $2.30. If XRP breaks below this, it could continue falling toward the psychologically important $2.00 mark. XRP has not traded below this support since May 11. Breaking below could trigger a stronger sell-off toward $1.880. One key factor behind XRP’s decline appears to be whale activity. Large holders accumulated XRP after the U.S. elections as prices rose from $0.60 to $3.40 within months. They’ve sold off 1.12 billion XRP in just two days. This massive sell-off, worth over $2.3 billion, represents almost 2% of XRP’s total market cap. Retail interest in XRP has also decreased significantly. Google Trends data shows XRP search interest recently hit its lowest level of 2025. The general public seems uninterested despite Ripple’s legal victory. The cryptocurrency market faces additional pressure from global trade tensions. Earlier Monday, Japan’s Nikkei index dropped more than 4%. Looking forward, XRP supporters hope for a potential catalyst later this year. Possible XRP ETF approval could reignite momentum for the cryptocurrency. Until then, traders will be watching key technical levels closely. The $2.15 and $2.20 resistance zones are crucial for any bullish reversal.</p>

Traders are watching closely as token unlocks have historically led to price volatility in cryptocurrency markets. This indicates substantial future emissions are still expected for the cryptocurrency. The SUI blockchain has shown mixed signals in recent months. SUI’s stablecoin market has shown growth as well. Despite these positive indicators, SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has seen a drop. The contrast between rising trading volume and falling TVL suggests mixed sentiment among investors. Technical indicators present a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory. This suggests continued selling pressure on SUI in the short term. This could signal a potential short-term bounce in price after the unlock event. Some positive developments may help counter selling pressure. The SUI blockchain recently reached a milestone of over 100 million total accounts. This achievement points to growing adoption of the network despite market uncertainties. If buyers maintain support at $2.23, SUI could see sideways consolidation around the $2.37 level before potentially moving higher toward $2.64 in coming weeks. Past unlock events for cryptocurrencies have typically led to temporary price pullbacks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By 2030, about 25% of S&P 500 companies are predicted to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term asset MicroStrategy pioneered the Bitcoin treasury strategy in 2020, with its stock surging over 2,000% since then Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets is gaining attention as more public companies adopt this strategy. According to data from bitcointreasuries.net, 90 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This trend began when MicroStrategy first announced Bitcoin as its “primary treasury reserve asset” on August 20, 2020. Their CEO stated, “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.” However, GameStop’s stock has dropped more than 20% since this announcement. The main reasons companies cite for holding Bitcoin include hedging against inflation of fiat currencies (especially the US dollar) and treasury diversification for risk management. While gold must be physically stored and isn’t easily moved, Bitcoin is a digital commodity. They provided institutional investors with exposure to Bitcoin when many asset managers couldn’t directly own it. Currently, Tesla and Block are the only S&P 500-listed firms that hold Bitcoin. For the prediction of 25% adoption by S&P 500 companies to come true, at least 123 more S&P 500 firms would need to invest in Bitcoin by 2030. Some tech investors and executives have very optimistic price targets for Bitcoin. Elliot Chun, a partner at tech-focused financial advisory firm Architect Partners, believes treasury managers will feel pressured to try Bitcoin strategies. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk,” Chun added. He warns that companies implementing this strategy hoping to replicate MicroStrategy’s performance “are positioning for disappointment.” They offered Bitcoin exposure to institutional investors at a time when direct ownership wasn’t possible for many asset managers. That advantage diminished after January 10, 2024, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. These ETFs now provide an alternative way for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. Last month, Bitcoin Investor Week in NYC dedicated an entire day to educating publicly traded companies on this tactic. Last year, MicroStrategy hosted a full conference in Las Vegas focused on Bitcoin treasury strategies. This fund seeks to track companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. As more companies explore this option, the next few years will show whether Bitcoin becomes a standard component of corporate treasury strategies or remains limited to a small group of tech-forward companies.</p>

The cryptocurrency briefly touched $81,300 in early trading, marking a near two-week low. The Wall Street Journal reported these tariffs could reach 20% against individual nations. Trump’s tariff plans are set to be unveiled on April 2. The announcement is expected to cover key market sectors and has created uncertainty in global markets. This trade policy news has overshadowed positive sentiment from Trump’s earlier plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Markets tend to view such tariffs as potential destabilizers for global trade. This shows the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to broader economic concerns. Adding to market worries, Goldman Sachs recently increased its forecast for a US recession. About 4,000 Bitcoins worth approximately $332 million were transferred to the Kraken exchange, often a sign of upcoming sales. Bitcoin, along with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, appears to be approaching a “death cross” pattern that could signal further bearish momentum. Some analysts wonder if this could mark a market bottom before any potential recovery. Bitcoin’s price action continues to show strong correlation with traditional equity markets. The S&P 500 lost approximately $2 trillion in market value over three trading sessions last week. Some market commentators, including economist Peter Schiff, have criticized Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative during this downturn. Gold has reached new record highs above $3,090 while Bitcoin falls. One of the current bullish narratives is that #Bitcoin $BTC will rally as global liquidity grows. Over the past week, miners have sold more than 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $220 million. Recent US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data showed persistent inflation, raising concerns that monetary policy will remain tight. This outlook creates additional headwinds for risk assets like Bitcoin. As markets enter April, traders will be watching Trump’s tariff announcement closely.</p>

The naming choice was more about branding than cryptocurrency connections. Musk revealed he had initially planned to call it the “Government Efficiency Commission.” The similarity in names had fueled speculation about potential government adoption of Dogecoin. website briefly displayed the Dogecoin logo for a few hours after President Trump’s inauguration. 🚨 ELON MUSK: "There are no plans for the government to use dogecoin or anything. I was going to call it Government Efficiency Commission but that's a super boring name. Then the internet said it needs to be Department of Government Efficiency. It also sent Dogecoin prices up 14% to a $58 billion market cap in February. He has promoted the cryptocurrency through tweets and public statements, even defending its inflationary model as a feature that supports everyday transactions. In 2023, Musk faced a market manipulation lawsuit from the SEC over his Dogecoin-related activities. The initiative aims to cut government spending and streamline operations. Musk says the goal is to make government “15% more efficient.” Since its formal launch in January, the department claims to have saved an estimated $130 billion. One key focus was federal credit card usage, where they found the government had issued 4.6 million cards despite having only 2.3 to 2.4 million employees. Musk called this oversight “absurd” and pushed for immediate reductions. The department has also carried out mass layoffs and cut funding for various programs. Programs related to climate change, scientific research, and diversity initiatives have seen funding cuts. Musk’s exact role in the department remains somewhat unclear. The White House describes him as a senior advisor without policy authority, while President Trump has referred to him as the department’s leader. In a recent interview with Fox News, Musk stated he will step down from his position after achieving a $1 trillion reduction in the U.S. federal deficit. He expressed confidence that most of the work could be completed within 130 days. Several lawsuits are currently challenging D.O.G.E.’s authority to make such sweeping changes. Critics claim that federal contracts and programs have been cut without proper congressional approval. Musk has defended the team’s actions, stating all decisions were carefully considered. However, this was in line with broader market trends rather than a direct response to his statements. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1654, according to data from CoinGecko. Musk is not being paid for his work with the D.O.G.E.</p>

Trading at approximately $0.17, DOGE has experienced a 1.9% decline recently, leaving investors and traders wondering about its next move. On the weekly chart, DOGE has been moving in a broader downtrend. The price is hovering near a critical support level of $0.14, which has historically attracted strong buying interest. Technical analyst Moein Haddadian notes that DOGE has broken out of a descending trendline. This technical signal suggests that selling pressure may be weakening. For Dogecoin to establish a strong recovery, it must first surpass the $0.25 price point. However, a decline below $0.16 would be concerning for DOGE holders. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $0.21 as the primary resistance level. According to Martinez, closing above this resistance would confirm the start of a new bullish cycle for DOGE. Some analysts caution that DOGE could retest $0.10 if selling pressure intensifies. Historical data shows that Dogecoin tends to follow cyclical patterns. The hourly chart shows a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170. If DOGE fails to climb above $0.1770, it could start another decline. While short-term price action remains uncertain, some analysts maintain a bullish long-term outlook. Predictions suggest that if DOGE can establish sustained momentum, it could eventually target $1. However, market analyst Henry warns that Dogecoin remains at a crossroads. “Dogecoin has shown signs of strength, but unless it can sustain momentum above key resistance levels, we could see another leg down before a potential rally,” he noted. Traders should closely monitor the key support levels at $0.16, $0.15, and $0.14, as well as resistance levels at $0.18, $0.20, and $0.25 for clues about DOGE’s next directional move.</p>

The case centers on Cryptoland, a digital exchange that was shut down in 2021. Blockchain records show that just one day after Estavi’s arrest, six billion BRG tokens were moved from his crypto wallet. This transfer happened before the public was aware of any potential scandal. Both men were senior interrogators in the IRGC’s economic intelligence branch. A court-appointed expert confirmed that wallets controlled by Hajipour alone processed and sold over $21 million worth of BRG tokens. Before the token theft, his assets were valued at approximately $40,000. Within just four months, his fortune had exploded to over $14.2 million (600 billion rials). Hajipour spent his newly acquired wealth on gold, luxury real estate, and high-end vehicles. Court records detail these purchases as evidence of the sudden and unexplained increase in his personal wealth. This wealth disparity became a key point in the investigation. After his arrest, Hajipour was held in Ward 66, a special prison facility reserved for IRGC personnel. Ebadi.” His name has appeared in many major cases labeled as IRGC economic corruption investigations. Badi is reportedly the nephew of Ali Akbar Hosseini Mehrab, a former high-ranking IRGC official. This network of corruption reached deep into the IRGC intelligence organization. Three months after Hajipour’s arrest, there was a leadership change in the IRGC intelligence organization. Hossein Taeb was dismissed from his position as head and replaced by Mohammad Kazemi. Estavi, meanwhile, was sentenced to 15 years in prison, 75 lashes, fines, and a lifetime ban from public service. Despite a travel ban, Estavi managed to flee the country. Mizan news, a website controlled by Iran’s Judiciary department, reported that over 51,000 plaintiffs had filed complaints against Cryptoland. About half of these victims—whose losses amounted to $14 million—were repaid from Estavi’s account while he was in prison. Earlier in March 2025, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Behrouz Parsarad, an Iran-based operator of a darknet marketplace, for overseeing nearly $30 million in narcotics sales using cryptocurrency.</p>

The bonds will be redeemed at full face value on September 30, 2025. Bitcoin’s price slipped to an intraday low of $81,362 on Monday. The Japanese firm announced its latest purchase of 150 BTC on March 24. Metaplanet has spent approximately ¥42.22 billion ($270 million) on Bitcoin since formally adopting it as a core asset in 2024. The company has outpaced other Asian Bitcoin holders such as Chinese game developer Boyaa Interactive and mining firm Cango.

Since beginning its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, Metaplanet’s stock price has soared by over 3,000%. This indicates a positive market response to the company’s Bitcoin strategy. Despite these ambitious plans, Metaplanet’s stock price crashed more than 9% on Monday. This happened even as the company announced its new Bitcoin purchase plan. Markets are preparing for President Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2. The U.S. is set to impose 20%+ tariffs on imports from over 25 countries. These tariffs will target goods valued at more than $1.5 trillion by the end of April. Current uncertainty levels are approximately 80% higher than those recorded during the 2008 financial crisis. In addition to issuing bonds and acquiring more Bitcoin, Metaplanet has been growing its leadership team. On March 21, the firm appointed Eric Trump to its newly formed advisory board. The new board will include voices committed to promoting Bitcoin adoption and financial innovation. American video game retailer GameStop recently experienced a setback with its Bitcoin strategy. Its shares collapsed after the company announced a debt-for-BTC offering. Rising global trade tensions and policy uncertainty are creating headwinds for risk assets. Gold prices are eying $3,100 levels as investors seek safer assets amid the market turbulence. This contrasts with the selling pressure faced by Bitcoin and Bitcoin-focused companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proposal aims to curb insider trading in crypto markets with new regulations Cryptocurrencies would likely be placed in a separate category from traditional securities Japan has been making several pro-crypto moves recently, including tax reforms and stablecoin approvals Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to change how cryptocurrencies are classified in the country. The regulator wants to reclassify digital assets as financial products rather than payment tools. This change aims to bring crypto under insider trading rules. Currently, cryptocurrencies are categorized as a “means of settlement” under the Payment Services Act. This classification has focused on their use as payment tools. Specifically, they don’t address issues like insider trading in crypto markets. The new classification would treat cryptocurrencies differently from traditional securities. The regulator also plans to enforce these rules regardless of whether a company operates in Japan. However, it’s not clear how these laws would apply to overseas entities. Questions remain about what would count as insider information in crypto markets. Another open question is how the rules would distinguish between different types of cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, the country issued its first license allowing a company to deal with stablecoins. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democracy Party has also moved to cut the capital gains tax on crypto. This would match how other financial products are taxed in the country. In February, reports suggested the FSA was considering lifting a ban on crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This change would align Japan’s policy with Hong Kong, which approved crypto ETFs for trading in April 2024. Crypto investments face high taxes in Japan compared to other financial products. Senior research analyst Jay Jo told Decrypt that ETFs only face a 20% capital gains tax. Last year, Japanese lawmakers urged regulators to pursue a National Bitcoin Reserve. The proposed reclassification represents a major shift in how Japan views cryptocurrencies. The FSA’s proposal comes amid rising cryptocurrency adoption in Japan. This growth has been accompanied by an increase in fraudulent activities, highlighting the need for stronger regulations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SIR.trading DeFi protocol lost its entire $355K TVL in a hack on March 30, 2025 Ethereum-based DeFi protocol SIR.trading was completely drained of funds in a hack on March 30, 2025. The hack was first detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity. Both companies posted warnings on X (formerly Twitter) to alert users of the breach. 🚨TenArmor Security Alert🚨 Our system has detected a suspicious attack involving #SIR.trading @leveragesir on #ETH, resulting in an approximately loss of $353.8K. SIR.trading, which stands for Synthetics Implemented Right, was designed as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage.” The platform aimed to address common challenges in leveraged trading such as volatility decay and liquidation risks. So we go the worst news a protocol could received and got hacked for our entire TVL ($355k). If you also believe in the core protocol and have any idea on how to proceed forward, please DM. Security experts have described the attack as “clever.” It specifically targeted a callback function in the protocol’s Vault contract that leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature. According to an analysis by Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address with an address they controlled. SupLabsYi from blockchain security firm Supremacy provided more technical details about the attack. They noted that it may demonstrate a security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage feature. Transient storage was added to Ethereum with the Dencun upgrade last year. Typically, smart contracts should only permit transactions from trusted sources like a Uniswap pool. However, the contract relied on transient storage, which resets only after a transaction ends. According to blockchain researcher Yi, the attacker brute-forced a unique vanity address. This enabled the contract to register their fake address as legitimate. The hacker then used a custom contract to drain all funds from SIR.trading’s vault. Xatarrer has reached out to Railgun for assistance in potentially tracking or recovering the stolen funds. It warned that “undiscovered bugs or exploits in SIR’s smart contracts could lead to fund losses.” This incident raises questions about the security of transient storage in Ethereum.</p>

Under the terms of the agreement, these firms will sell MARA shares “from time to time” directly on Nasdaq or via negotiated transactions. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA stated in its SEC filing. Strategy has used various market offerings, including stock sales, to amass 506,137 BTC worth approximately $42.4 billion. MARA Holdings currently holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserves among public companies. It has 46,374 BTC in its coffers, valued at around $3.9 billion according to Bitbo data. The latest offering follows MARA’s previous financial maneuvers aimed at increasing its Bitcoin holdings. In November, MARA also issued $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible senior notes. This approach represents a long-term bet on Bitcoin’s value appreciation. The stock offering announcement has coincided with a downturn in MARA’s share price. The company’s stock closed down 8.58% at $12.47 on March 28, according to Google Finance. MARA shares fell another 4.6% to $11.89 in overnight trading on March 30, as reported by Robinhood. This decline follows broader market jitters in the crypto mining sector. Meanwhile, Bitcoin was trading just above $82,000, down 1.2% over 24 hours after falling from a local high of around $83,500. Despite the recent stock price decline, MARA has reported strong financial results. The wind farm was acquired to power older mining rigs that would otherwise have been retired. This move aligns with growing industry concerns about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining operations. The cryptocurrency recently reached all-time highs above $83,000, though it has pulled back slightly in recent days.</p>

The deal brings 61,000 mining machines from Hut 8 into American Bitcoin. The company also plans to build its own “bitcoin reserve” by retaining mined coins. Eric Trump, who will be American Bitcoin’s chief strategy officer, likened bitcoin’s hard asset properties to real estate. This could become a key advantage as mining gets more difficult over time. The Trump family has aggressively embraced bitcoin and crypto lately through various projects. American Bitcoin will remain separate from the Trump Organization empire. Bitcoin mining has faced environmental criticism for its massive energy use. But Eric Trump believes American Bitcoin’s access to low U.S. energy costs will give it an edge. By focusing on mining, American Bitcoin appears to be a more serious bitcoin bet compared to Trump’s meme coins and stablecoin talk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar, last Friday, leaving the immediate area devastated with at least 2,000 people dead and over 3,400 injured, with the number expected to rise as data from neighboring countries such as Thailand comes in. The 10-kilometer deep quake released energy comparable to hundreds of nuclear explosions, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Rescue efforts continue as hundreds remain missing, including about 80 people at a collapsed construction site in Bangkok. Damaged infrastructure has left many areas inaccessible. Hospitals report critical shortages of medical supplies amid overwhelming casualties. However, banking restrictions and damaged financial infrastructure could render traditional fund transfers problematic. In line with these efforts and in solidarity with those affected, Decrypt searched for some of the major humanitarian organizations that accept crypto for relief efforts. Here's a list of some organizations that currently receive crypto, and which ones they accept.

The far-fetched claim is rooted in what Good prognosticates as unvarnished reality: Bitcoin's encryption mechanisms are "getting really stale" and could be "completely obsolete within five years," creating a business conundrum for the miners behind it. His answer is Ambient, a blockchain with deep capabilities in the AI space – the "future economy," as Good puts it – that could become a "decentralized competitor to OpenAI." The network operates on a proof-of-work mechanism with familiar appeal to bitcoin miners, he said, making it an easy switch. "It's a useful proof of work network, which we don't think anyone has ever done well in crypto," Good said. Many crypto projects have attempted to fuse the two buzzy tech trends on the belief that blockchains and decentralized crowdsourcing can steer AI better toward delivering for humanity than singular, private corporations possibly could. But Good claims the market leader is woefully deficient because it doesn't actually run AI models on blockchain, despite its original intention to "be this global computer." Whether Bitcoin miners – let alone users – would actually embrace a radically new and different network likely hinges on Ambient's economic success. While Ambient's security rhymes with Bitcoin's, the network itself runs like Solana. Ambient raised $7.2 million in seed funding from a16z's crypto accelerator program as well as Delphi Digital, one of the VC world's hungriest funds for crypto-AI crossover tech. He thinks that's a big issue because it deprives users of understanding what the models are trained on and exposes them to getting hoodwinked with answers derived from inferior models. "Verified inference" by miners (the heart of their rewards mechanism) acts as a provenance fact-checker, ensuring that answers spat out by Ambient originate from the model people paid to use. "If you don't have verified inference, you're guaranteed to get rugged," Good said, adding a hyperbolic warning: "Nation state actors are going to poison your model and just do fun stuff, like we saw with Lazarus," North Korea's hackers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first quarter of 2025 tells a clear story about DeFi's evolution. While yields across major lending platforms have compressed significantly, innovation at the market's edges demonstrates DeFi's continued maturation and growth. DeFi yields have declined sharply across all major lending platforms: See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . This benchmark, a weighted average across four leading markets, approached 14% in late 2024. Aave's stablecoin yields on mainnet are around 3% for USDC and USDT, levels that would have been considered disappointing just months ago. This compression signals a market that’s cooled significantly from late-2024's exuberance, with subdued borrower demand across major platforms. Collectively, the largest vaults on Aave, Sky, Ethena, and Compound have nearly quadrupled in size over the past 12 months, expanding from about $4 billion to about $15 billion in supply-side deposits. Despite Spark's consecutive rate cuts, TVL has grown more than 3x from the start of 2025. As yields have fallen from nearly 15% to under 5%, capital has remained sticky. This seemingly contradictory behavior reflects increasing institutional comfort with DeFi protocols as legitimate financial infrastructure rather than speculative vehicles. The emergence of curation represents a significant shift in DeFi lending. These curators serve as a new breed of DeFi asset managers, evaluating markets, setting risk parameters, and optimizing capital allocations to deliver enhanced yields. Unlike traditional service providers who merely advise protocols, curators actively manage capital deployment strategies across various lending opportunities. On platforms like Morpho and Euler, curators handle risk management functions: selecting which assets can serve as collateral, setting appropriate loan-to-value ratios, choosing oracle price feeds, and implementing supply caps. They essentially build targeted lending strategies optimized for specific risk-reward profiles, sitting between passive lenders and sources of yield. The most successful curator strategies have maintained higher yields primarily by accepting higher-yielding collaterals at more aggressive LTV ratios, particularly leveraging Pendle LP tokens. This approach requires sophisticated risk management but delivers superior returns in the current compressed environment. Base Layer Optimizers : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency Strategy Providers: Specialized firms like MEV Capital, Steakhouse, and Gauntlet build on these platforms to deliver higher yields upwards of 12% on USDC and USDT (as of late March) This two-tier relationship creates a more dynamic market where strategy providers can rapidly iterate on yield opportunities without building core infrastructure. This restructured market means users now navigate a more complex landscape where the relationship between protocols and strategies determines yield potential. While blue-chip protocols offer simplicity and safety, the combination of optimizing protocols and specialized strategies provides yields comparable to what previously existed on platforms like Aave or Compound during higher rate environments. This persistence of Ethereum's yield advantage is notable in a market where incentive programs have often shifted yield-seeking capital to newer chains. Among mature chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism), yields remain depressed across the board. Newer chains with substantial incentive programs (like Berachain and Sonic) show elevated yields, but the sustainability of these rates remains questionable as incentives eventually taper. A significant development this quarter was Coinbase's introduction of Bitcoin-collateralized loans powered by Morpho on its Base network. Traditional FinTech companies will increasingly adopt this strategy, keeping familiar interfaces while leveraging DeFi's infrastructure. While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users. While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users. : The continued evolution of real-world asset integration could introduce new yield sources less correlated with crypto market cycles. : The scaling institutional comfort with DeFi infrastructure suggests growing capital flows that could alter lending dynamics. The protocols best positioned to thrive will be those that can operate efficiently across the risk spectrum, serving both conservative institutional capital and more aggressive yield-seekers, through increasingly sophisticated risk management and capital optimization strategies.</p>

Eric Trump, who will serve as American Bitcoin’s chief strategy officer, describes the initiative as aligned with the family’s focus on hard assets, likening digital currencies to real estate. He emphasized plans to build a “bitcoin reserve” and potentially take the company public. Although American Bitcoin is separate from the Trump Organization, it may eventually collaborate with World Liberty Financial—the DeFi project launched by the Trump brothers. Hut 8 will host the mining operations in its 11 U.S. data centers. CEO Asher Genoot said low energy costs and scalable infrastructure will give American Bitcoin a competitive edge. Despite criticism over bitcoin mining’s environmental impact, Eric Trump believes lower U.S. energy costs will help American miners outpace global competitors.

“As we near completion of our 50 EH/s mining expansion, our focus is shifting to the next phase of growth and delivering scalable infrastructure for AI and HPC," said co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts in a Monday business update.

Once completed at 52 EH/s, the mining expansion is expected to generate $528 million in annual cash flow, according to the company. Current installed capacity is 35 EH/s and completion is expected in the coming months.

IREN shares are lower by 2.1% premarket.</p>

It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink’s letter comes at a time of high market uncertainty and anxiety among investors about the economic state of the country amid policy changes set in place by U.S. President Donald Trump. Doubling down on his commitment and belief in digital assets, Fink said he believes that tokenized funds will be as well-known among investors as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), provided that the industry can create a better infrastructure for digital identities, which Fink believes to be a hurdle in getting institutional investors from fully embracing decentralized finance. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,” he wrote. “ If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. BlackRock, in January 2024, became one of the issuers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The asset manager has also issued a tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which is on track to cross $2 billion in assets by April, making it the largest tokenized fund currently on the market.</p>

While timing is not yet totally decided, sources say Circle will publicly file its prospectus in late April, meaning a potential IPO perhaps prior to June.

The company had previously filed confidential paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024.

Circle in 2021 had attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 2021, but that attempt was derailed first by an intransigent SEC and then by the crypto collapse of 2022. It ultimately pulled the SPAC deal by the end 2022.

According to people familiar with the matter that spoke with Fortune, Circle is seeking a $4 billion to $5 billion valuation.

CoinDesk reported in July that the company was valued at roughly $5 billion in private secondary markets.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 4%, taking it into correction territory after dropping more than 10% from its record high and European indexes including the FTSE 100, DAX, and CAC 40 opened in the red alongside falling U.S. stock futures.

The backdrop is President Donald Trump's new tariffs, set to be revealed to the world on April 2 in an event he has dubbed "Liberation Day." The president plans to impose levies and tariffs on any country deemed to have an unfair trading relationship with the U.S. "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," Trump said, according to the Financial Times. His words suggest that while the tariffs may initially apply broadly, he is open to making concessions for some countries, the FT said. Market uncertainty may persist with the U.S. jobs report due Friday. Economists forecast the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%, while nonfarm payrolls are projected at 128,000, down from 151,000 the previous month. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle, hovering just above $80,000. It's down more than 3% this month and 12% for the quarter, marking its worst performance since fourth-quarter 2022. The second-largest cryptocurrency has performed significantly worse than bitcoin this quarter, losing 46% in a slide that's the worst since 2018. As a result, the ether-to-bitcoin ratio has dropped to 0.02195, marking its lowest level since May 2020. At that time, bitcoin was trading below $10,000, while ether hovered just above $200.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Darknet markets are increasingly returning to bitcoin (BTC) as their primary cryptocurrency because of rising liquidity and accessibility challenges associated with privacy-focused coins like monero (XMR), according to Eric Jardine, cybercrime research lead at Chainalysis. "After major exchanges delisted XMR, we observed a significant increase in bitcoin inflows," Jardine said in an interview with CoinDesk. "Reduced accessibility is steering users back toward bitcoin." Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Many Western markets on the darknet — a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools — had either fully moved to monero or operated with it in parallel with bitcoin before the delistings. XMR dropped off after it was removed from major exchanges. Binance announced in February 2024 that it planned to de-list monero. "When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it," Binance said at the time. Jardine emphasized that illicit cryptocurrency transactions represent only a minor share of total crypto activity. "Typically, illicit transactions constitute at or below 1% of total crypto activities. Chainalysis data shows that about 0.14% of all transactions in crypto, some $50 billion, involve illicit activity, with a rise in stablecoins as an illicit payment mechanism. The stablecoin issuers are fighting back, with the Tron-led T3 Financial Crime Unit, a group comprising of Tron, USDT-issuer Tether and TRM Labs freezing over $100 million in illict funds. Jardine also noted that law-enforcement agencies prioritize darknet markets primarily based on their scale and involvement in the fentanyl trade. Its presence significantly escalates the likelihood of a darknet market attracting law enforcement attention, he said, because fighting the drug is a priority for international law enforcement. And, as a result, OFAC sanctioned a number of crypto wallets tied to its operator, Behrouz Parsarad: 44 BTC addresses and 5 XMR wallets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You’ve probably heard this at a dinner party: “If only we had bought Bitcoin ten years ago.” Now imagine that conversation echoing in the corridors of a central bank, where the stakes are a nation missing one of the most asymmetric financial opportunities of the century. For emerging economies — countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Thailand, or Vietnam — strategic exposure to cryptocurrencies is essential for future economic resilience. They collectively represent over 40% of the global population and approximately 25% of global GDP, yet they remain vulnerable to external economic shocks, including currency fluctuations, trade disruptions, and more. Today, their sovereign reserves remain heavily reliant on traditional assets like gold and foreign exchange. But those aren’t sufficient hedges in a rapidly digitizing world. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Cryptocurrencies have survived wars, regulatory crackdowns, and multiple financial crises. Over the last decade, bitcoin has appreciated nearly 200X, far outpacing tech giants like NVIDIA or Apple. The crypto space, no denying, has faced scams, rug pulls, and bad actors. This is common in virtually any financial system — think early stock markets or banking. But these risks don’t negate crypto’s core appeal — they demand careful governance. Ask any central banker, fund manager, or financial advisor: you don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and you certainly don’t bet the future of an economy on a single asset class. These assets tend to have little correlation with how other traditional assets perform, making bitcoin a strong hedge against economic turbulence. We’re seeing entire publicly listed companies built around bitcoin as a core asset. Take Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which started as a software firm and now holds over 506,137 BTC (approximately $42 billion as of writing). Countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Vietnam, India, and Thailand rank among the top 10 countries globally for cryptocurrency adoption already. Bitcoin isn’t the new digital gold — it serves a very different role. Central banks across the world have been buying gold at a record pace in recent years. But gold wasn’t always the safe bet we think it is today — back in the 1980s, its price crashed by 60% before bouncing back. Bitcoin brings new utility: it can be transferred anywhere in the world in minutes, divided into microscopic fractions, and secured with cryptographic protocols. Gold and Bitcoin share fundamental traits — they’re scarce, resilient, and hedge against uncertainty — but gold preserves value traditionally, while bitcoin expands possibilities digitally. Critics often dismiss crypto as mere speculation, but its utility is real. U.S. bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $12 billion in institutional inflows within months. Crypto enables faster, cheaper remittances, cutting global fees from 6.4% to under 1%, saving billions for developing economies. With over $100 billion locked in DeFi protocols, it’s clear that the future of finance is already being built on blockchain. Emerging economies should take a strategic, forward-looking step toward economic resilience. Track its performance, take cues from early movers like the U.S., El Salvador, and Strategy, and refine the approach as you go. Proactive regulatory frameworks are vital to foster innovation while ensuring stability. With the global crypto market nearing $3 trillion and institutional adoption accelerating, the question isn’t if this shift will happen—it’s who will lead it. Emerging economies can start building a strategic reserve today or hear in five years at another dinner party in five years, “If only we had bought bitcoin in 2025.” The time is now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite technological advances, this ideal remains elusive in today's fragmented digital economy. Our current commerce landscape is siloed across competing platforms, each creating its own walled garden. Amazon, eBay, and specialized marketplaces for luxury goods may have digitized commerce, but they've simply replaced physical barriers with digital ones. Algorithms deployed by these platforms are trained explicitly to maximize revenue by adjusting prices dynamically based on comprehensive market data, often keeping prices artificially elevated depending on the broader internet pricing environment. Such practices result in significant price disparities for identical assets across platforms. Inefficiencies persist because the costs of exploiting them—such as substantial platform fees, lengthy onboarding requirements, limited interoperability, and time delays in transactions—typically outweigh potential arbitrage profits. This results in market failures where platforms invariably exploit their position as intermediaries through high fees, manipulated search results, and proprietary ecosystems designed to lock in participants. The convergence of two powerful technologies is about to disrupt this status quo: AI agents and crypto protocols. AI agents can perform many platform functions — especially supply and demand aggregation — at a fraction of the cost. Unlike platforms, these agents work directly for users, fundamentally realigning incentives. Meanwhile, crypto protocols solve the fair — exchange problem through low-cost, trust-minimized transactions where users only need to trust audited, immutable code rather than corporate intermediaries. The combination creates what I call "decentralized commerce agents" — AI that can efficiently discover price differences across marketplaces while using crypto protocols to facilitate secure, low-cost exchange. This dramatically reduces the total cost of arbitrage, suddenly making previously non-viable price differences economically feasible to exploit. Here's where it gets interesting: by enabling these agents to retain profits from successful arbitrage operations, they can strategically redistribute gains to incentivize adoption of decentralized commerce protocols. Each cycle consolidates liquidity on decentralized protocols while reducing the viability of isolated, extractive platforms. For consumers, this means lower prices, better selection, and truly competitive markets free from platform manipulation. For businesses, it means direct access to customers without paying exorbitant platform taxes. For society, it means markets that more efficiently allocate resources based on actual supply and demand rather than platform algorithmic manipulation. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, while crypto protocols for decentralized commerce continue to mature. What's missing is the recognition of how powerful these technologies become when combined specifically to disrupt platform economics. Decentralized commerce agents represent not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental realignment of economic coordination. The question is whether we'll seize this opportunity to build a more efficient, accessible, and equitable commercial landscape for everyone.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arcium is expanding its infrastructure to support new blockchain architectures and traditional enterprises, making privacy-focused solutions more accessible across industries. Arcium’s encrypted infrastructure is designed for broad adoption, supporting both blockchain architectures and traditional enterprises. The Encrypted Ecosystem highlights this versatility, with over 25 projects exploring Arcium’s technology across eight key sectors: DeFi : Jupiter, DarkLake, JupNet, Ranger, Titan, Asgard, Tower, Orca, and Voltr While chain-agnostic by design, Arcium is launching first on Solana, bringing encrypted capabilities to the ecosystem. Yannik Schrade, CEO and Co-Founder of Arcium, said: “We have always believed in the transformative potential of what we have built with Arcium, and establishing the Encrypted Ecosystem cements that as truth. Revolutionary infrastructure lays the foundation, but its true impact is realized when builders bring it to life. Arcium’s encrypted infrastructure enables use cases that were historically impossible, unlocking a new design space for applications and innovative ways to utilize private data. For more information about the Encrypted Ecosystem, please visit Arcium’s blog post. With Arcium, the internet can use data to its full extent in an entirely encrypted state. Backed by investors such as Greenfield Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Heartcore Capital, Longhash VC, L2 Iterative Ventures and Anagram Arcium's goal is to allow the entire internet to run on encryption.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The surge in performance, according to internal data and third-party analytics, is linked to a successful Q1 strategy that included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF, and Big Candle Capital. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell assets at a set price — enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays, and directional speculation. That narrative hit the mainstream this month when reports emerged of Coinbase being in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the market’s dominant BTC and ETH options venue, for a rumored $4–5 billion. A forthcoming data table will show Coincall’s comparative market share and growth trajectory alongside the major players. As attention shifts from mature giants to agile challengers, Coincall has positioned itself at the center of that conversation. In January, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo — former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space — as Chief Operating Officer and minority shareholder. “We’re witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value,” Teo said. “Options are the next wave — they provide leverage, flexibility, and strategy. Our mission at Coincall is simple: make investing quick, intuitive, and safe — for everyone.” Coincall’s latest product innovation, Earn While You Trade (EWYT), is designed to eliminate the traditional tradeoff between yield farming and active trading. The feature allows users to generate passive yield while maintaining active market participation. For many traders, this represents a structural change in capital allocation approaches. According to PitchBook, $11.5 billion in venture capital was invested into crypto and blockchain startups in 2024 across 2,153 deals — a strong rebound after the prior bear cycle. “The next phase of crypto will be defined by real infrastructure,” said Teo. With deep liquidity, fast execution, and innovative features like Earn While You Trade, Coincall is building the future of digital asset derivatives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OKX chief legal officer Mauricio Beugelmans has left the cryptocurrency exchange, according to his Linkedin profile.

Beugelmans, who has been instrumental in shaping OKX’s global compliance policy, states on his profile that his tenure lasted three years and eight months at the exchange, from August 2021 to March 2025.

Just last month, OKX paid over $500 million in penalties and forfeited fees in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice which stated that the company had facilitated more than $5 billion in “suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds.”

A source familiar with the matter said Beugelmans’ exit was related to the recent DOJ settlement.

OKcoin, the American division of OKX, also received a subpoena issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Feb. 24 last year. The subpoena referred to “certain persons engaged in fraud and other unlawful conduct with respect to digital asset transactions.”

Neither OKX nor Beugelmans responded to requests for comment by press time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) withdrew two pieces of crypto-related staff guidance on Friday, further streamlining its approach to crypto regulation. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.” The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.” Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency. “They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil’s top financial policy body banned some pension funds from investing in cryptocurrencies because they are too risky. The National Monetary Council (CMN) forbade closed pension entities known as Entidades Fechadas de Previdência Complementar (EFPCs) from allocating any portion of their guarantee reserves into bitcoin (BTC) or other digital currencies. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . “The resolution also prohibits investments in virtual assets, considering their specific investment characteristics and associated risk,” a Ministry of Finance notice circulating among local news outlets reads. In contrast, last year British pension specialist Cartwright guided the country’s first pension fund to make a bitcoin allocation worth 3% of its assets. Several U.S. states have begun experimenting with crypto allocations for their pension systems, despite federal-level caution. Wisconsin’s state investment board, for example, revealed in February it had invested $340 million in bitcoin through BlackRock’s ETF (IBIT). The ruling does not appear to apply to open pension funds or individual retirement products sold by banks and insurers. These are regulated separately and may allow indirect investment through exchange-traded funds or tokenized asset platforms.</p>

Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . "AUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency taskforce has found that some crypto ATM providers may not have the right anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism (AML/CTF) checks in place," the financial intelligence agency said in a release on Monday. Crypto ATM providers need to register with the regulator, monitor transactions and complete know your customer checks to comply with the country's Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Act 2006. The nation has some 1,600 in use, up from just 23 in 2019, AUSTRAC said. A task force set up in December "identified worrying trends and indicators of suspicious activity, including transactions that may be linked to scams or fraud,” CEO Brendan Thomas said. The watchdog has been following in the footsteps of U.K. regulators in trying to clamp down on illegal crypto ATM activity. In the U.K. only approved crypto ATMS can operate, and none have been. The Financial Conduct Authority last month secured a four year sentence against Olumide Osunkoya, 46, for illegally operating a crypto ATM network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia-based bitcoin miner IREN is redirecting its growth plans away from BTC mining and towards its AI data centers and AI cloud services businesses.

“As we near completion of our 50 EH/s mining expansion, our focus is shifting to the next phase of growth and delivering scalable infrastructure for AI and HPC," said co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts in a Monday business update.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil’s top financial policy body banned some pension funds from investing in cryptocurrencies because they are too risky. The National Monetary Council (CMN) forbade closed pension entities known as Entidades Fechadas de Previdência Complementar (EFPCs) from allocating any portion of their guarantee reserves into bitcoin (BTC) or other digital currencies. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .

In contrast, last year British pension specialist Cartwright guided the country’s first pension fund to make a bitcoin allocation worth 3% of its assets. Several U.S. states have begun experimenting with crypto allocations for their pension systems, despite federal-level caution. Wisconsin’s state investment board, for example, revealed in February it had invested $340 million in bitcoin through BlackRock’s ETF (IBIT). The ruling does not appear to apply to open pension funds or individual retirement products sold by banks and insurers. These are regulated separately and may allow indirect investment through exchange-traded funds or tokenized asset platforms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) withdrew two pieces of crypto-related staff guidance on Friday, further streamlining its approach to crypto regulation. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.” The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.” Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency. “They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first quarter of 2025 tells a clear story about DeFi's evolution. While yields across major lending platforms have compressed significantly, innovation at the market's edges demonstrates DeFi's continued maturation and growth. DeFi yields have declined sharply across all major lending platforms: See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . This benchmark, a weighted average across four leading markets, approached 14% in late 2024. Aave's stablecoin yields on mainnet are around 3% for USDC and USDT, levels that would have been considered disappointing just months ago. This compression signals a market that’s cooled significantly from late-2024's exuberance, with subdued borrower demand across major platforms. Collectively, the largest vaults on Aave, Sky, Ethena, and Compound have nearly quadrupled in size over the past 12 months, expanding from about $4 billion to about $15 billion in supply-side deposits. Despite Spark's consecutive rate cuts, TVL has grown more than 3x from the start of 2025. As yields have fallen from nearly 15% to under 5%, capital has remained sticky. This seemingly contradictory behavior reflects increasing institutional comfort with DeFi protocols as legitimate financial infrastructure rather than speculative vehicles. The emergence of curation represents a significant shift in DeFi lending. These curators serve as a new breed of DeFi asset managers, evaluating markets, setting risk parameters, and optimizing capital allocations to deliver enhanced yields. Unlike traditional service providers who merely advise protocols, curators actively manage capital deployment strategies across various lending opportunities. On platforms like Morpho and Euler, curators handle risk management functions: selecting which assets can serve as collateral, setting appropriate loan-to-value ratios, choosing oracle price feeds, and implementing supply caps. They essentially build targeted lending strategies optimized for specific risk-reward profiles, sitting between passive lenders and sources of yield. The most successful curator strategies have maintained higher yields primarily by accepting higher-yielding collaterals at more aggressive LTV ratios, particularly leveraging Pendle LP tokens. This approach requires sophisticated risk management but delivers superior returns in the current compressed environment. Base Layer Optimizers : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency : Platforms like Morpho and Euler provide modular infrastructure enabling greater capital efficiency Strategy Providers: Specialized firms like MEV Capital, Steakhouse, and Gauntlet build on these platforms to deliver higher yields upwards of 12% on USDC and USDT (as of late March) This two-tier relationship creates a more dynamic market where strategy providers can rapidly iterate on yield opportunities without building core infrastructure. This restructured market means users now navigate a more complex landscape where the relationship between protocols and strategies determines yield potential. While blue-chip protocols offer simplicity and safety, the combination of optimizing protocols and specialized strategies provides yields comparable to what previously existed on platforms like Aave or Compound during higher rate environments. This persistence of Ethereum's yield advantage is notable in a market where incentive programs have often shifted yield-seeking capital to newer chains. Among mature chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism), yields remain depressed across the board. Newer chains with substantial incentive programs (like Berachain and Sonic) show elevated yields, but the sustainability of these rates remains questionable as incentives eventually taper. A significant development this quarter was Coinbase's introduction of Bitcoin-collateralized loans powered by Morpho on its Base network. Traditional FinTech companies will increasingly adopt this strategy, keeping familiar interfaces while leveraging DeFi's infrastructure. While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users. While still early, advances in on-chain automation suggest a future where customized risk-yield optimization becomes more accessible to retail users. : The continued evolution of real-world asset integration could introduce new yield sources less correlated with crypto market cycles. : The scaling institutional comfort with DeFi infrastructure suggests growing capital flows that could alter lending dynamics. The protocols best positioned to thrive will be those that can operate efficiently across the risk spectrum, serving both conservative institutional capital and more aggressive yield-seekers, through increasingly sophisticated risk management and capital optimization strategies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I could see us going back to a five handle by the end of the year,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. A "five handle," i.e. a price between $50,000 and $59,999, would be down substantially from the already shaky current $83,000 level and roughly a 50% decline from bitcoin's peak just above $109,000 just more than two months ago.

Thompson, who had been bearish from far higher levels, has repeatedly called the White House’s crypto announcements — be it the Sovereign Wealth Fund or Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, or anything in-between — "nothingburgers" and “sell the news” events. He has also argued that Strategy’s (MSTR) constant bitcoin buys aren’t necessarily bullish for the cryptocurrency, since they seem to be the only significant bid. First, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), in its efforts to reduce the U.S. deficit, is bent on cutting government spending — which has been one of the largest drivers of job growth in recent years. “People get caught up in the politics of it,” Thompson said. Elon Musk, the main force behind D.O.G.E, said last week that he was aiming to cut $1 trillion in government spending by the end of May; he also said he wanted to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, meaning almost $7 trillion. Migration is growth positive because it puts pressure on wages; if that labour pool dries up, workers will demand higher salaries, which some businesses won’t be able to afford. The Trump administration keeps changing up its tariff threats on a day-to-day basis, sometimes promising new ones, sometimes calling them off, creating doubt as to whether the majority of proposed tariffs will actually ever go into effect. But the important thing about tariffs is that they create uncertainty for businesses, which may elect to delay investment or hiring decisions until the tariff situation is resolved. Finally, the Federal Reserve doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to loosen financial conditions because inflation data hasn’t been great. The U.S. central bank cut interest by a full percentage point at the end of 2024, to 4.25%-4.5%, and even that wasn’t enough to push bitcoin above $110,000. “I think there's a lot more coordination going on between the Treasury and the Fed than people want to believe,” Thompson said. “People thought Trump and [Fed chair] Powell would be bickering, but they’re actually kind of on the same team right now. With such headwinds working against risk-on assets like stocks and bitcoin, the crypto sector is unlikely to have a good year, Thompson said. The fact that the White House doesn’t seem overly concerned about a potential recession is also a strong signal, he said. The direct result of their policies working is a lower stock market,” Thompson said. But how long is Trump likely to maintain course? Until it becomes too painful and even Trump’s political base tells him to cut it out, or until the beginning of 2026 — you can’t be pushing a country into a recession with midterm elections coming up. They’re trying to purposefully clear the brush so that it doesn't become a bigger problem. But sometimes controlled burns become forest fires,” Thompson said. “I think it's going to be a long kind of slog through the year as they try to enact these policies.”</p>
