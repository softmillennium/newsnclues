One of my favorites? A new Apple Music capability that expands the service’s reach beyond the Music app, pushing further into Control Center and more.

Ambient Music controls expand Apple Music’s reach in iOS 18.4

After you install iOS 18.4, if you’re like me you’ll probably pop into some of your favorite apps to see if anything’s changed.

Doing this with the Music app will reveal no discernible new features. But that’s because the latest Apple Music feature isn’t found directly inside the app.

Instead, Apple has done something unique and expanded Apple Music’s functionality into a new set of Ambient Music controls in iOS 18.4.

Essentially, the update adds special new ways to trigger Apple Music ‘mood’ playlists from outside the Music app.

iOS 18.4 supports four such moods, though I wouldn’t be surprised if more arrive in future updates.

Sleep

Chill

Productivity

Wellbeing

Each control has been assigned to play a specific Apple Music playlist. For example, by default the Productivity control plays BEATstrumentals, but you can also select one of three other curated playlists, or set it to trigger any playlist of your choice.

You can assign these new music controls to any of the following three places:

Control Center your Lock Screen and the iPhone’s Action button

To update a control’s playlist setting, be sure you’re in editing mode then tap the control and you’ll see customization options.

Apple Music in iOS 18.4: wrap-up

Opening the Music app will continue being the main way most of us interact with Apple Music, but I love what Apple’s doing with iOS 18.4’s new Ambient Music controls. The ability to assign a mood playlist button to your iPhone’s Lock Screen, Action button, or Control Center removes friction from the music playback experience.

It also helps reduce my own analysis paralysis when opening the Music app and confronting far too many options to choose from. Now I can have a simple toggle fit for these select occasions.

What do you think of the ambient music options Apple added to iOS 18.4? Let us know in the comments.

The Cupertino giant has rolled out its suite of AI features with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4. Apple Intelligence, which made its debut last year and was limited to select regions, now supports localized English for Indian users alongside Singapore, French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified). Apple’s expansion of its Apple Intelligence features to one of the world’s largest smartphone markets is an important milestone for its global AI strategy.

What is Apple Intelligence?

Apple Intelligence is the company’s artificial intelligence system designed to deliver helpful and relevant AI features. With iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 update, these capabilities expand to more regions globally, including India. Apple’s AI system now integrates deeply across Apple’s ecosystem, offering a range of tools that enhance productivity, creativity, and everyday tasks without compromising on the company’s privacy standards.

How to Download Apple Intelligence in India

To access Apple Intelligence features, Apple users in India need to update their devices to the latest version of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4. This process is straightforward:

Navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your compatible iPhone, iPad or Mac Download and install iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 or macOS Sequoia 15.4. Restart your device and you are all set.

Apple Intelligence Features

The latest iOS, iPadOS and macOS updates bring a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools to compatible devices across India to evolve how users interact with their iPhones, iPads or Mac computers.

Apple’s Writing Tools allows users to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text across multiple applications, including Mail, Messages, and Notes. These tools offer flexibility to customize tone, from professional, concise, or friendly, depending on the context and audience. The “Describe Your Change” option takes it a step further, enabling specific modifications to your writing style, such as making your resume language more dynamic or transforming a dinner invitation into a poetic format.

The Photos app now supports natural language search across both photos and videos. Users can simply describe what they’re looking for and the system will identify relevant content. The Clean Up tool helps you remove unwanted objects from images and the Memories option creates custom movies based on user descriptions, automatically crafting a narrative arc with thematic chapters.

Next is Image Playground which enables users to generate original images in animation, illustration, or sketch styles. This tool integrates into Messages and apps like Freeform and Keynote, where Apple claims it will make visual communication more engaging. The Genmoji feature lets users create custom expressions based on text descriptions or photos from a user’s library.

Apple also brings Priority Messages in Mail with the new update, which highlights urgent emails such as same-day invitations or boarding passes at the top of the inbox. The notification summaries help users manage their digital interactions more effectively by providing key details of lengthy communications directly on the Lock Screen.

Additionally, Siri has received a substantial upgrade with more natural interactions and deeper system integration. The voice assistant now features a redesigned interface with a glowing light around the edge of the screen. It also maintains context between requests and possesses expanded product knowledge to answer thousands of questions about Apple device features and settings. Users can also switch between voice and text input when interacting with Siri based on their preferences.

The new Visual intelligence capabilities allow users to learn about objects and places in their surroundings. This feature can create calendar events from information on posters, translate text between languages, and identify plants and animals. On the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 Pro series, users can access this functionality through Camera Control or by customizing the Control Center or the Action button.

With the new update, Apple is also allowing users to enable ChatGPT access in Siri and AI features. Users do not need a ChatGPT account to use this feature, and Apple claims that OpenAI will not store any of the requests.

Apple emphasizes that many Apple Intelligence features run directly on-device, but for tasks requiring larger computational resources, Private Cloud Compute extends privacy protections into the cloud environment.",techmeme

Apple has already released the latest iOS 18.4 update and it’s available to download and install now.

Why would you want to do that? Well there are a whole host of new additions, but, surely eight brand new emoji are enough of a draw on their own.

Recommended Videos

Aisde from the eight fresh emoji, Apple has also added Sketch Style in Image Playground, better image organization in Photos, recipes in News+ and of course the usual bug fixes and security updates.

Please enable Javascript to view this content

So let’s break down what’s new in iOS 18.4 as well as if and how you can get it on your iPhone.

What’s new in iOS 18.4?

The big headline here is those new emoji. There’s eight in total and these include a smiley with bags under its eyes, a fingerprint, a splatter, a leafless tree, a harp, a root vegetable, a shovel and the flag for the island of Sark. While that last one is pretty case specific, the rest certainly help expand the emoji vocabulary in useful ways.

Also new is Sketch Style in Image Playground which, as you’d expect, allows you to generate images using Apple Intelligence to get a more artistic drawn finish to the image.

Another Intelligence based feature is Priority Notifications, which sorts your messages and other notifications to bring the important, timely ones, to your attention. There are also some new Intelligence languages including French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. Plus, English for speakers in India and Singapore.

Photos has been adjusted with new filters and order options. There’s an option to disable recently viewed or shared items as well as to reorder in diffrerent collections.

The News+ addition of recipes means cooking guidance pulled in from various publishers. There are also stories about restaurants as well as tips for the kitchen and a searchable Recipe Catalog.

Can I get iOS 18.4?

While the update is rolling out to many iPhones, it’s worth nothing that the Apple Intelligence features only work on newer phones that are powerful enough to support this. They are the iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max and 16 series, including the 16e.

For all other features iOS 18.4 is now available for all iPhones that follow the 2018 iPhone Xs and newer.

How do I get iOS 18.4 on my phone?

To update simply head to Settings on your iPhone then navigate to Software Update. You should then be able to pick if you Install Now or Install Later. In either case that should get the chunky download underway before starting the installation process and rebooting.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,iOS 18.4 adds a dedicated Ambient Music feature - and I have 3 big questions,https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/ios-18-4-adds-a-dedicated-ambient-music-feature-and-i-have-3-big-questions,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:50:54 GMT","Apple is now offering a second release candidate for iOS 18.4, a late-stage pre-release version that implies the update will soon make its way to the wider iPhone user base – bringing with it an unexpected, but welcome, musical addition to the iPhone experience.

iOS 18.4 introduces a dedicated Ambient Music feature to iPhone, accessible via the Control Center. To access the new feature, users can add the Ambient Music icon to the Control Center during customization, similar to how Shazam music recognition is accessed.

Once added, users can tap the icon to choose one of four ambient music playlists – Chill, Sleep, Productivity, and Wellbeing.

Oddly enough, the Ambient Music feature doesn’t have a proper dedicated app. Tapping the Dynamic Island while the music plays takes you to a pretty standard-looking music player in the vein of Apple Music, and you can cast the audio over AirPlay, but as Gadget Hacks notes, there’s no icon on the home screen.

Instead, Apple seems to be positioning Ambient Music as an expanded version of its existing Background Sounds, which include white noise, forest ambience, and ocean waves.

I think this sounds like a nice addition. I’ve been a fan of ambient music genre for about six years, and have listened to it for studying and working – I’m certainly a believer in its benefits for focus and relaxation.

Though Apple probably won’t say as much, there are also possibly some health benefits to this new ambient music tool. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, ambient music has been shown to decrease anxiety and even ease physical pain.

So overall, a pretty cool idea – but it remains an unusual one, and as such I still have some questions about Apple’s chillest new feature.

Where’s the music coming from?

Ambient music is sure to pair well with noise-cancelling AirPods, like the AirPods 4 (pictured) (Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol)

This is the big one for me – who is making this music, and how? Presumably these playlists are each at least a few hours long, and those tracks have got to come from somewhere.

Optimistically, I could guess that the tracks will be pulled from similar genre tags and existing playlists available via Apple Music, maybe with a few additional exclusives thrown in – Apple Music is renowned for its curated playlists, after all.

However, recent developments in the music and mobile industries have me concerned at the prospect of AI generated sound being used for these playlists – not that Apple has confirmed or suggested this. If that turns out to be the case, I’ll be giving it a swerve.

How are the artists getting paid?

The tracks added to these on-demand ambient playlists will probably become some of the most listened-to ambient tracks around, thanks to their ease of access and embedding in the fabric of iOS.

It’d be nice to know how Apple plans to reimburse the artists behind these songs – especially if the tracks have been chosen by human curators for the four playlist types.

It’s possible that the artists will be paid typical streaming royalties for the use of their music, but with Apple Music paying just $0.01 per stream that’ll take a lot of listens to add up to much.

What’s next?

Apple's focus on mindfulness already extends to a dedicated Journal app (Image credit: Future / Apple)

Let’s face it – “dedicated ambient music button” probably wasn’t on any of our 2025 Apple bingo cards, and now I’m left wondering what’s next for Apple’s growing list of software eccentricities.

It's not the first time the company has given a whole feature to some kind of mindfulness activity - see the iPhone Journal app for the most prominent example.

Maybe we’ll see Apple extend the relaxation vibe to the visual side of things, with a dedicated calming color profile or virtual environments designed to bring users a sense of zen.

Or perhaps we’ll just see more of these half-option-half-radio features crop up. Dedicated Control Center hard techno button anyone? Just me? I’ll see myself out.

In any case, I’m looking forward to trying out this and the other new features coming to the best iPhones with iOS 18.4. Let us know if the Ambient Music feature is something you’d use in the comments below.",techmeme

Apple has rolled out iOS 18.4, introducing several new features, including Priority Notifications that leverage Apple Intelligence to display the most relevant alerts on the iPhone’s lock screen, an updated Action Button option, Control Center enhancements, new emoji characters, and more.

Priority Notifications and Visual Intelligence Expansion

Available now, iOS 18.4 brings Apple’s Visual Intelligence feature to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. This feature allows users to identify objects, landmarks, plants, animals, and even extract text for quick actions or translation. For example, by simply pointing the camera at a sign in a foreign language, iPhone users can instantly translate the text. Scanning a document enables easy extraction of phone numbers, email addresses, or dates for direct interaction.

Visual Intelligence also integrates with native Apple apps, enriching real-world experiences. Users can pull up restaurant information in Maps by pointing their iPhone at a location, add events from posters directly to their calendar, or identify dog breeds with just a camera scan.

New Emojis and Enhanced Features

iOS 18.4 introduces a range of new emoji characters, including bags under eyes, a fingerprint, a leafless tree, a root vegetable, a harp, a shovel, and a splatter, allowing users to better express themselves in messaging.

Apple News Food Section and Ambient Music

The update also adds a new Food section for Apple News+ subscribers, featuring recipes, restaurant stories, healthy eating tips, and kitchen essentials. Meanwhile, the Control Center gets a new Ambient Music option, offering four distinct sound categories—Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing—to enhance the user experience.

Additional Updates

Two new Australian voices for Siri are now available, and the Passwords app has been upgraded with a countdown circle for two-factor authentication codes, helping users keep track of when new codes will be generated.

AirPods Max Update

https://theverge.com,Nintendo has moved beyond specs,https://theverge.com/games/638542/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-relevance,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","The official unveiling of the Switch 2 was an incredibly confident moment for Nintendo. It was brief and lacking almost entirely in details. There was no price, no release date, and no confirmed games outside of a Mario Kart tease. The 2 in the name implied a bigger and better Switch, but when it came to the how — the chips that will power the device, the screen that will make Zelda and Mario look great — Nintendo deemed it wasn’t important enough to share right away.

And it’s right: unlike the rest of the industry, Nintendo has carved out a path where specs no longer matter.

It wasn’t always this way. Previous Nintendo consoles were sold, as their contemporaries were, on horsepower. The Super Nintendo was a more-powerful NES, while the N64’s processor was deemed so important that the system was named after it. But things started to change around the time of the GameCube. Nintendo had experienced a steady decline in console sales over subsequent generations; while the NES and Famicom sold more than 60 million units, that was down to just over 20 million for the GameCube. At the same time, Nintendo’s direct competition had changed significantly. After getting a taste of going up against Sony during the N64 era, Nintendo was now up against a second tech behemoth in Microsoft. Competing on technological prowess no longer made much sense.

Something had to change — and that change came in the form of the Wii.

Photo by Britta Pedersen / picture alliance via Getty Images

Once infamously described as “two GameCubes and some duct tape,” the Wii wasn’t a major advancement over its predecessor in terms of how games looked or ran. While the Xbox 360 touted blockbusters like Halo 3, and the PS3 was showing off next-gen visuals through Resistance and MotorStorm, the Wii was defined by Wii Sports, in which characters looked like eggs and didn’t even have arms. And yet, the game, which was bundled with the console everywhere but Japan, went on to become one of the best-selling games of all time because of how it played, rather than how it looked.

This shift came because of what Nintendo called its “blue ocean” strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them less appealing to many consumers. We’d come a long way from the simplicity of making Mario run and jump in the original Super Mario Bros. Just looking at a GameCube controller could be overwhelming for many. As former Nintendo of America president Reggile Fils-Aime wrote in 2007, “While ardent players reliably responded to ever-advancing technology and complexity, those same attributes consistently chipped off potential new players from the total market, narrowing the consumers into a smaller niche.”

This meant the best path forward for Nintendo was to get out of the technological arms race and find a way to broaden the market. For the Wii, that was a console with specs that were mostly good enough to run modern 3D games, but where the focus was on its motion-sensitive controller that made games more intuitive to play, like with Wii Sports. This was followed by the Nintendo DS, a handheld that introduced touchscreen controls before smartphones were ubiquitous. Both were massive hits: the Wii sold more than 100 million units, while the DS topped 150 million. And both proved that specs are a minor concern — if they’re a concern at all — to most consumers, as they surpassed more powerful competitors in terms of sales. (Sorry, Vita.)

Finding the right direction for a console isn’t always easy, as evidenced by the Wii U, which was a failed early attempt to merge the worlds of home consoles and portable gaming. But by shifting away from specs and graphics to focus on player experience, Nintendo has not only carved out a space for itself, but it is arguably as successful as it has ever been at a time when the video game industry is struggling on many fronts.

The Switch is a pure expression of this philosophy. It’s an underpowered tablet that doubles as a home console, and despite going up against beefy PlayStations, Xboxes, and a burgeoning field of portable PCs, it’s on track to become Nintendo’s best-selling piece of hardware ever (and it might even surpass the record set by the PS2). Its modest technical chops are overshadowed by a straightforward premise — you can take games with you anywhere — while also allowing Nintendo to develop lots of games in a more sustainable way than its competitors, who are struggling with the massive increasing costs of live service and blockbuster games.

That’s why Nintendo didn’t utter a single spec when revealing the Switch 2 — because they’re not the point. Whatever powers the company’s next device has will be mostly good enough for the next open-world Zelda, but the specs don’t need to be detailed in a lengthy video that uses words like upscaling and teraflops. Those details are coming, of course, but they’re secondary to the core idea: this will be just like your old Switch, only better. You don’t need specs to get that across.",theverge
https://theverge.com,"TikTok, tariffs, and trials: everything happening in tech’s chaotic April",https://theverge.com/policy/638779/tariffs-tiktok-ban-meta-google-antitrust-trial-april-trump,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:02:23 GMT","is a senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.

As TikTok’s April 5th sell-by date approaches, Americans are back to where they stood before the original January deadline: watching anxiously to see if a major social media app gets banned. But that’s far from the only big event we’ll see over the coming month. April is filled with momentous turns in long-running tech policy stories — some possibly industry-changing, others at risk of fizzling out.

The first two and a half months of President Donald Trump’s second term were highly consequential for the tech industry, which faces real challenges despite largely cozying up to Trump. After the chaos of the fired FTC commissioners, DOGE’s dismantling of the federal government, and constantly delayed tariffs, the next few weeks could be extraordinarily busy, too. Deadlines that Trump let slip are coming up, as are long-planned ones, such as those covering TikTok, new tariffs, and a pair of juggernaut antitrust cases involving Apple and Meta.

Here’s everything you need to know to be prepared.

April 2nd: tariffs

Trump said he intentionally chose April 2nd over April Fools’ Day because he’s “a little superstitious,” but it’s still wise to expect the unexpected for taxes on imported goods. The official order he released last week clarifies a 25 percent tariff on automobile imports will take effect at 12:01AM ET on April 3rd. He’s also threatened to implement:

Trump’s tariffs have fluctuated and stalled amid blowback and discussions with foreign leaders, but the early April deadline for vehicle imports to the US has held so far. Trump has promised a permanent 25 percent tariff on cars and trucks that are imported into the country, while the reciprocal tariffs are meant to alleviate what his administration views as imbalances with trade partners.

The auto tariff is expected to apply to both foreign manufacturers and American car companies that manufacture vehicles abroad and import them to the US. Experts anticipate the cost will ultimately raise prices for US consumers buying new cars.

April 5th: TikTok ban… or extension

TikTok is still legally required to divest from its parent company ByteDance, and as with its original January deadline, it’s running out the clock before a ban kicks in.

Trump has promised a TikTok sale agreement before the deadline, but the details remain vague. It’s still quite possible that he will simply extend the arbitrary deadline again, attempting to keep the status quo while supposedly hammering out the deal. But as Senate Democrats have warned, repeated legally dodgy extensions leave TikTok’s service providers increasingly vulnerable — the statute of limitations on the law extends past Trump’s term, and they risk hundreds of billions of dollars in fines for defying the act. Apple, AWS, Google, Akamai, Fastly, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.

“ByteDance must fully divest its control of TikTok and have no say in its operations; nor can the two share data, content, or algorithms”

Alternatively, Trump may present the details of a deal (however vague) by the deadline. Multiple contenders have thrown their hat in the ring to take TikTok off ByteDance’s hands, including billionaire Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty and Perplexity.

Oracle is reportedly in a leading position for a partnership with TikTok to ensure that US user data can’t be accessed by the Chinese government — but the reported details sound a whole lot like Project Texas, which US officials previously dismissed as too porous to protect US national security. It’s not clear this would meet the legal requirements for divestiture, and even the top Republican on the House Select Committee on China has warned that “ByteDance must fully divest its control of TikTok and have no say in its operations; nor can the two share data, content, or algorithms.” There’s also the matter of whether the Chinese government will agree to let any version of a sale happen.

Essentially, based on the options currently on the table, we’re probably about to see the start of yet another legal battle around TikTok.

April 14th: FTC v. Meta begins

The FTC filed its antimonopoly suit against Meta back in late 2020, when it was still known as Facebook, and the two sides will finally meet in court on April 14th to kick off the trial.

For several weeks, Judge James Boasberg will hear testimony on whether Meta illegally monopolized the personal social networking market, in part through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the FTC alleges could have been formidable competitors. If he agrees with the government that Meta broke the law, both sides will return later to figure out what should be done about it — including, potentially, unwinding the acquisitions.

It’s been a rocky case for the FTC, all the way back to Trump’s first term, when the original lawsuit was filed with support from two minority Democratic commissioners and the Republican agency chair. That first complaint — alongside a separate lawsuit filed by 48 state and district attorneys general — was thrown out by the judge.

But Boasberg left the option for the FTC to try again. The agency filed an amended complaint during the Biden administration under Democratic chair Lina Khan, seeking to resolve concerns with the initial complaint. The result was sufficient to move the lawsuit forward; in November 2024, after Boasberg mostly denied Meta’s motion to dismiss, he resolved that the case would move to trial. Now, that trial will begin with the FTC back under Republican control.

April 22nd: Google Search remedies trial begins

Also in DC’s District Court, the second phase of the Google Search monopoly trial begins next month. Judge Amit Mehta ruled last summer that Google has illegally monopolized the online general search market, as well as the market for search text ads. Now, Google and the Justice Department will spend two weeks debating what changes the judge should impose to remedy the harm created by the illegal monopolization (a characterization Google intends to appeal).

At the end of the Biden administration, the DOJ said that appropriate remedies would include forcing Google to spin out its Chrome browser — a key access point for search engines — syndicate the data that makes its search results so powerful, and ban exclusionary deals like its multibillion dollar agreement with Apple. After the Trump administration took over, the DOJ maintained many of the same asks, though it modified a few, including letting Google pay Apple for non-search-related agreements. Mehta has said he aims to issue a decision by this August.



Apple is not a party to the case, but it has fought to play a bigger role in the remedies phase because it fears its interests might not be sufficiently represented by Google. But an appeals court agreed with Mehta that Apple will have to settle for filing briefs to explain its point of view, rather than taking a more active role in the trial.",theverge

https://theverge.com,Unity CEO Matt Bromberg needed to end the ‘war’ against customers,https://theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/639509/unity-matt-bromberg-runtime-fee-interview,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:25:00 GMT","Today, I’m talking with Matt Bromberg, who is the CEO of Unity, one of the leading video game development platforms. He’s been in the job for less than a year, and in many ways, he is the perfect Decoder guest.

Unity is one of those companies that we love here on Decoder because we interact with its products all the time, but the company itself is somewhat hidden from view. Unity doesn’t make or publish its own games. Instead, its core product, the Unity game engine, is what all kinds of games — especially mobile ones — run on. If you play games on your phone, which you probably do, you’ve used a product built with Unity. It’s not just on phones by a long shot, and you’ll hear us talk about that quite a bit, too, but Unity as a company is what makes a core part of the mobile phone experience work.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

That’s a Decoder all by itself, but Bromberg took over the job of CEO in a moment of crisis, and he’s made significant changes to the company since. You’ll hear him describe Unity as being “at war with its customers” before he joined, and he’s not wrong. The former CEO, John Riccitiello, led the company through a major pricing model change, called the runtime fee, that was going to raise costs for many of its customers. The communication around that pricing model change was also, frankly, terrible. Unity developers were in open rebellion, leading to Riccitiello’s resignation and, eventually, the company’s decision to scrap the runtime fee altogether.

So you’ll hear me ask Bromberg about his decision to walk the fee back after he joined, because it was clear to him even before he took the job that he would need to make that choice if there was going to be a Unity left for him to run. And you’ll hear him explain that while deciding to make such a big change was easy for him, working out how to execute that change slowed him down a bit.

Bromberg’s in charge of Unity during a moment of contraction for the game industry overall — studios are closing, and some big bets on things like the Metaverse and live service games haven’t paid off. So we talked about all that and where he sees growth ahead: Unity isn’t just a game engine provider, but the platform for everything running those big live services and the monetization on top of that.

One note before we start, because it really grabbed me: Bromberg’s one of the first CEOs to come on this show and disagree with me about the importance of structure. I tend to think of a company’s org chart as a proxy for its culture and its tradeoffs. I’m always saying that if you tell me your org chart, I can guess 80 percent of your problems, and so we joke that Decoder is really a show about org charts. But Bromberg told me he thinks culture isn’t enabled by structure. You’ll hear what he means.

Unity CEO Matt Bromberg. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Matt Bromberg, you are the new CEO of Unity. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you so much for having me. It’s really my pleasure.

I am very excited to talk to you. This is a perfect episode of Decoder: You are less than a year on the job as the new CEO. You took over, you made a bunch of changes to the company, you restructured the company, you hired a new C-suite, you used to work for the old CEO — and then, Unity itself is a very core piece of technology that I think is under-covered. So, it’s like a perfect episode. Thanks for joining us.

You bet.

Unity really is kind of under-covered. It’s on everyone’s phone: Everyone has games on their phone, and Unity is almost certainly powering those games. What is Unity? What are game engines?

Game engines are effectively the thing that developers use to build games. And maybe that’s obvious, but the technology is pretty deep and pretty complex. Unity is a platform where developers can aggregate all the tools, technologies, and content they need to build interactive applications. And yeah, to your point, it’s a really important tool in our world. About seven out of every 10 mobile games in the world are built on Unity. About 30 percent of the [top 1000] PC games in the world. Seven out of 10 best AR games were built in Unity. Last night, or two nights ago, at GDC, eight out of 10 of the top independent games that won awards were built on Unity. We’re an important partner in that ecosystem.

There’s a lot of history in game engines and investments in game engine development. A lot of companies that made popular games and then thought they could peel the engine out of those games and turn that into a business; that’s worked or, mostly, not worked in various ways. Unity is just an engine company. You’re not trying to make consumer-facing games.

That is correct. We do a little bit. It’s funny you should say that. Generally speaking, that’s absolutely true. We are not a game developer and a publisher. We have recently been doing more development ourselves on a couple of projects. But only to ensure that our tools are production-ready and dogfooding what we’re doing. We have an expert team that does some of that, but it’s really about feeding back into our development process more than trying to be a games company. I was the chief operating officer at Zynga for a lot of years —I know what it is to run a games company. I think it can be very hard and unnecessary to try to run a games company and an engine company.

I made that comparison explicitly because your biggest competitor is Unreal Engine, which is Epic Games. Epic is a games company, they’re the Fortnite company. They’re doing both, and then they’re expanding their engine into Hollywood, into automobile design, all this other stuff. You seem pretty narrowly focused on games still. What do you think about that competition?

There’s a lot to unpack there. First, there are increasingly lots of applications of Unity outside of gaming. And in fact, what we call industries is the fastest-growing part of our subscription business.

But we are, to your point, much more focused now than we were before. We were chasing sort of everything: Hollywood, architects, digital twins for building nuclear reactors, and all sorts of things. Right now, we’re really just focused on a few core verticals.

For example, most of the in-dash experiences in cars are built on top of Unity. If you think about the little computer that’s in the dashboard of your car, it feels a lot like a phone or some other small device. And that’s really our strength to be able to design and develop interactive experiences for those things. [We work in] virtual, retail, and lots of applications on the manufacturing floor, so we do a fair bit outside of gaming.

I guess the other thing to understand is that Unity as a platform is focused on making games, but we are the only company in the world that helps developers through the whole lifecycle of development. From prototyping through building, operating in life service, and then crucially to acquiring new players, monetizing, and inventorying your games. The big second piece for us is the advertising and marketing piece. It’s a piece that we think grows really organically out of our core business, which is about deeply understanding consumers, and helping developers build for those consumers. And then when they turn to that next phase where they need to acquire players, we’re also there to help them.

I kind of understand why all the car makers use Unity. They under-spec the processors in their cars, and the closest comparison to that is a mobile phone, which is power constrained. I don’t think a car is power constrained; I think they’re just cheap, but there they are. They’re just using under-specced mobile processors to drive their dashboards. Unity is a great engine for mobile phones. It makes sense that you just expand in that direction.

But that’s not games, right? That’s just another set of constraints that looks familiar, so you end up there. When you talk about games, we’ve just gone through an apocalypse of live service games recently. That industry doesn’t seem as predictable. It doesn’t seem like the games industry knows where its next set of growth will be, or how many people it should employ quite broadly. There’s some big change there that it feels like I can’t draw the line as quickly as I can to the expansion into cars, right?

Yeah, listen, there is a lot of consternation about the video game industry. I’m someone who shares that. I’ve been around long enough to know that towards the end of hardware cycles, everybody’s throwing up their hands and saying, “Gee, I don’t think gaming’s doing so well.”

I’ve been through this cycle several times. Here’s what happens: Creative people innovate, and they make new experiences. Those experiences explode into hits, and that drives growth. That has always happened. I think the pain that we’re feeling right now in the industry is principally a pain born of creative destruction, so I accept that there’s been a fair bit of pain. There’ve been a lot of layoffs and other really unfortunate things. I think that’s about folks reimagining themselves for the future. The explosion of new devices and new experiences is going to be the gateway to that innovation.

The thing about Unity is… It’s not so much that we’re optimized to run on low-spec phones, it’s that when you build any experience in Unity it can operate at a really high level of performance fidelity anywhere. And that’s where consumers are moving. We used to be in this world where, and I remember this… I worked at Electronic Arts for many years. We were in this world where folks believed that visual fidelity and high-quality visuals were the primary things that video game consumers wanted, and they were obsessed with it. And I think what we’ve realized now is: that’s not what’s driving the consumer. I don’t think it ever has been what’s driving the consumer. We’re really proud of the quality of our visuals, but what drives consumer adoption is gameplay innovation. And all that is what’s going to drive this industry forward. I’m hugely optimistic about it.

Keep in mind, again, web games, AR, and VR. We’re going to get a new Nintendo platform. We’re going to get new Sony and Microsoft platforms. Phones are going to become ever more powerful. You’ve got dual-screen phones. The form of games will change, and the nature of them will change, but the appetite for interactive experiences, to my eye, has not lessened in any way.

Just in the context of what a game engine is, what you’re describing here is: Let’s say I have an idea for a game. I see a market that’s changing. Unity is going to provide me with the physics engine that lets me build the game, with the ability to render the game in high fidelity across a number of platforms. And that number of platforms is important because a game needs to be everywhere now. You’ll operate the live service that lets people connect and play multiplayer, and then you’ll help me monetize the game by putting ads in it. Which part is the hardest right now? Because it seems like the games industry is “every part is the hardest,” and it seems like you have a much clearer view. What do you think is actually the hardest part?

My experience of making video games for many, many years — which is what I did before I came to Unity — is that generally speaking, especially for game publishers of any scale, there’s a really simple equation. At the end of every year, they look at their P&L and say, “How much money can I spend next year making new things?” They usually have a big life service or many, and that’s what’s kind of driving forward the business on a day-to-day basis. But the video games world is about hits and about new experiences, and you have to make investments. You also have to control and modulate those investments. The most important equation is people and time. If it takes me, if it’s 300 people and three years to make a game, versus 50 people and a year, that equation is very, very different.

The amount of innovation I can afford, the amount of new starts I can afford, and the amount of marketing I can afford, are very different in both equations. To me, when I think about Unity’s place in the world and where we can be the most help, it’s there. We’re a proud tools provider. We help video game developers make games, hopefully, as efficiently, quickly, and easily as possible so they can spend more time creating innovation. And if we’re really good at our job, they can have more starts, because they’re moving more quickly and they can do it more efficiently. And that’s the role I’d love to see us play there. And then to your point, as many new starts as we can get out there, great. Now we’ve got to go out and find new players. So, that’s the flywheel you want to see.

Let me ask one more kind of existential question. I want to get into the changes you’ve been making here. I feel like every industry, but in particular, the games industry got fundamentally confused by the combo platter of the pandemic and Fortnite. Meta was like, “We’re all going to wear headsets all day long in our house.” And I don’t know, it doesn’t seem like that’s happening. A bunch of companies thought, “Okay, we can see all these people playing Fortnite. The future of live music is going to happen in video games, and we’re going to build these huge live service multi-experience games, and everyone’s going to spend all their time in them.” And all that’s left from what I can tell, that’s sustainable, is Fortnite. There’s not another Fortnite, and that drives a lot of your competitor’s business. That drives a lot of Epic’s business. Do you see that as a mistake that the industry is correcting, or do you see other games being able to reach that level and then go even one step farther into, “Okay, we’re having true metaverse experiences”? Because I don’t see that anywhere right now.

I don’t think about it exactly that way. Listen, I think that the pandemic more than anything pulled demand forward. It pulled about a couple of years of consumer demand forward, and then we did see some natural slackening after having pulled all that forward. And I think that part of the dynamic is obvious.

Meta renamed the company, and they were like, “We’re not Facebook anymore. We’re Meta now.” And I don’t know if that’s paid off for them.

I was never a massive believer in the metaverse during that period of time. I’ll tell you why: Because, as a game maker, I experienced all those new platforms and just thought they were garbage. And I thought, “This looks like the games we tried to make 15 years ago. There is no way that’s a sustainable consumer experience.” All sorts of metaverse companies — I was completely confused by them. Having said that, I actually continue to believe, and I see the vibrancy of big live service platforms and communities as being fundamental to the games business. I mean, yeah, Fortnite, but Roblox, FIFA, and every game… Every major company has many enormous live services with millions or tens of millions of players. And in some ways that is the fundamental feature of the video game business right now — 80 percent of the people are deeply invested in this experience that they’ve been playing for years.

And I think one of the challenges now is, “Okay, how do I get those folks to move to something new?” I think that’s the push-pull that we’ve had. But I see platforms, communities, and interactive communities of gaming continuing to dominate and explode. And I do think we’ll see some new things. I think we’ll see innovation, some lighter experiences that will begin to challenge those. But I wouldn’t confuse the failure of the metaverse with some lack of sustainability in major life service gaming.

That’s a connection that has always been the most interesting to me. If you believe that the world is going to be big live service games, it’s not that much of a jump to say, “And we’ll all wear headsets all day long.” We’re spending time virtually which will just get more immersive. That’s a straight line. But it seems like we didn’t hit the first spot.

No, I think some of that has to do with — again, put aside the idiocy of some of the metaverse stuff… The future, to some degree, is going to be tied to massive consumer adoption of peripherals, or maybe that’s an old-fashioned word for it, but new devices. I’m an enormous believer in AR, for example. I think that one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the couple of years since is we’re starting to get closer and closer with every rev to something that’s real here. I have no doubt that a couple of years from now everybody’s going to be wearing AR glasses. And how long has it been since Google Glass came out? But the combination of AI and voice, which enables really easy interactions with the form factor, the battery life that is now possible, and the ability to overlay information and services in front of your eyes, to me, is obviously going to explode.

And we’re going to look back and think about the time when we kept reaching into our pockets to pull out this thing for everything, it’s going to seem quaint. But it takes a long time to get true mass consumer adoption of these devices because it all has to be perfect. But once it hits, it explodes.

You’re a glasses wearer. I can see you wearing your glasses. I wear contacts. My theory is that you have to deliver far more value than is required to care for whatever you mount to your face. And glasses deliver an extraordinary amount of value. I’m horrible at maintaining my glasses; they’re very scratched, they’re very dirty. I wear them just to go to bed. I don’t have to care for them, but they deliver. I’m allowed to see, that’s a huge value amount.

But you go outside in the sun and you put on sunglasses, right?

But I only get value at that time. I don’t come back in and keep wearing my sunglasses, which is what I think Meta wants me to do. I think they want us to believe that transition lenses are going to be cool, and maybe they’ll pull that off. Who knows? Mark Zuckerberg’s wearing a chain. He’s got a haircut. Maybe he’s going to pull this off.

Well, we will see.

My point is, right now the most compelling AR experience is way down on the curve, right? It’s actually the Vision Pro, which is a huge thing that has an external battery and limited app support. Do you see, when you put on the Vision Pro, “Okay, I can get from here to there if the hardware improves on some curve?” Because when I reviewed it my conclusion was, “We’re racing down a dead end. This is the best pass-through VR that I’ve ever seen, and we should not keep doing this. It’s never going to get better than this.”

We partnered with Apple in the creation of that device. And I would say this, I would not… History is littered with first-generation devices that seemed absurd and then in another form became ubiquitous. And I do fundamentally believe that when the device form factors get right, consumers will adopt them. I do think it’ll be a mix though. I think one of the things we learned is that there’s a pretty high bar for folks wanting to isolate themselves completely from the world. And that’s why. When I think about AR, I think that the first mass-adoption devices we’ll see will be those that allow people to continue to be social and interact in the world while overlaying or enhancing that experience. Completely absorptive experiences have… I think folks will engage in those things, but there’ll be a time and a place for it. So, my view of that device was that it was a first swing. And also, by the way, Apple has a very long history of that as well. The first generation of devices is not necessarily the thing that takes off. So, I continue to be hugely encouraged by that.

Are you of the view, I think the cliche was, that this is a simulator for the thing they want to actually build?

I don’t know. I mean, I guess maybe that would be something you’d say after you’ve shipped it, maybe it didn’t go quite as well as you’d want to. But I applaud their willingness to put a stake in the ground, get out there with something, and then go back to the drawing board and continue to invest. At the end of the day, all of us making technology products need to do that. So, pushing the envelope for me is a good thing.

I ask this, because again, with the games industry as it is currently configured, we are at the end of a console generation. It appears to be restructuring, reconsolidating in some ways, and falling apart in other ways. It was just GDC. There’s just a lot of turmoil when you get the whole games industry in one conference center and talk about the future. And the big bets, like “We’re all going to play a bunch of AR games,” while Pokemon Go just got sold. A lot of the big bets seem to be structurally changing.

Unity obviously plays a part in that. But the sugar rush of the pandemic led Unity itself to make big decisions about how much demand there would be that fundamentally you’ve had to undo. The decision to charge the runtime fee feels like your predecessor as CEO was saying, “Okay, there’s going to be this much more demand for all this stuff. I can now extract a toll.” Do you see that in that framework?

I don’t. I don’t. By the way, I also don’t, fundamentally… I believe in the vibrancy and growth of the video game business, which, by the way, is still growing nicely and continues to be larger than streaming media, streaming music, and theatrical distribution combined. And this you will grow in high single digits, or maybe low double digits. I see this business as really vibrant. I don’t think the things that Unity has done in the past were sort of a ... And frankly, the other folks were a direct response to demand… I accept it maybe as folks staffed up across the industry and then demand slackened a little bit. I don’t think that’s so much this year, but maybe in the year before — you had some dislocation.

But I think for us, the thing about Unity which is spectacular and fascinating, is that we sit at the intersection of so many powerful forces: 3D, digital advertising, interactive entertainment, AI, I could go on. And you could convince yourself that you have a meaningful role to play in all of that. Because we have this platform and this engine, this tool that is connected deeply to all those powerful forces. But you have to make choices in the world if you want to execute at an exceptionally high level. And the way we’re thinking about this business now is that we are going to make some really focused choices, hit the ball out of the park around those things, kind of re-earn the trust of customers, be better partners, and deliver at a much higher level. And that all good things are going to come from that. Which doesn’t… It’s great to be expansive, but if you want to deliver, you have to make choices.

I think this is a perfect transition to what I think of as the Decoder questions. I want to start with a quote. You gave an interview to IGN where you said, “We want to be a fundamentally different and better company. It is what we want. We have to have a fundamentally different relationship with our customers and our community. We want to develop and deliver products in a fundamentally different way. And that starts with you thinking about it differently.”

One of my ideas for the show is that structure is a proxy for culture. You have to build a corporate structure that enables the culture you want. You’re basically talking about totally transforming the company, in that quote. Everything has to be different, down from how you deliver the products to what your relationship with the customer is. You’ve been there less than a year. How have you restructured Unity to get to the culture you want?

It’s funny. Culture is a really interesting thing. And the way I think about culture is that I think it’s actually fundamentally backward-looking in a way. What I mean by that is, when we think about our culture in the context of a company, we usually, what we’re usually doing is saying, “Hey, we got together to do this thing and it went pretty well.” Now, let’s stop for a second and look backward and ask ourselves, “How were we behaving? What were our values while we were doing that? Because it went pretty well. Let’s write those down, and we’ll put them on a mug or a T-shirt,” and those are going to be … that’s how we’re going to talk about our culture. That’s not a criticism from my perspective. I just think that’s usually this thing where we look back to understand how we’re behaving. And because it’s worked.

And so, the way I think about transforming culture is about setting really clear expectations and communicating more than anything an approach and an expectation about how we’re going to behave with one another. What’s going to count as the way we do what we do? How do you know you work here? Because every great company feels that way. Like, “Hey, this is how we do.” When you unpack that idea, folks get clear on that, having a common view of it. But having that view be authentic to the actual experience is important. For example, on my first day there was a lot of pressure to do the kinds of things that you’d expect in a big company. “Hey, we should send out new values.”

I don’t do that. Because how do I know? I just got here, I haven’t met anybody, we haven’t done anything yet. How about let’s work together, let’s get to know each other. Let’s figure out how. And then we go back in an authentic way that’s actually connected, in a way that isn’t about mugs and T-shirts. Can we get to a short list of what we expect of one another? And that’s sort of how I think about culture.

It’s interesting you say that. It reminds me that when we started The Verge 13 years ago, we used to argue endlessly about what a Verge story would be. And now our audience knows, right? And that’s a backward-looking reflection of how we made some definitions and held onto them, communicated them. But you have also restructured the company. You have a new COO, you have a new CTO, you have a new CFO — that’s an entirely new C-suite. You’ve rethought how the company should work. What are the changes that you’ve made?

The first and most important thing for us was to reinvest in the relationship we had with customers and to be a better partner. We were at war with our customers, effectively, when I arrived. Folks were boycotting us. They were really unhappy with how we were charging them and how we spoke. And you can’t have a business where we’re your customers. That’s insane. The first thing was to take a breath and reorient ourselves around being good partners, around authentically trying to deliver, to listen to people, and authentically trying to deliver what they need as the primary touchstone of what drives our behavior. And I know that, in a way, that sounds obvious and like a cliche. But some organizations do that and some don’t. The process of coming to understand in an authentic, but also accurate, way what signals to listen to and respond to is more complicated than it seems. But the first piece was to be better partners.

The second piece, to your point, was I wanted us to lead differently. I wanted our organization to be different and to have different values. And in my experience, the fastest way to do that is to make changes at the top. Especially, by the way, if you think you might later have to change the rest of the organization, what is soul destroying for people is when somebody comes into a company that’s having a little bit of difficulty and they start restructuring the company and they leave the management layer intact and they think, “Well, hang on a second, who is responsible for all this stuff? How do we skip over the folks who were in charge?” And suddenly like, “I’m taking it in the neck. How did that happen?” If you want different outcomes, if you want different approaches, some of it’s changing culture, but a lot of it is changing people.

And especially if you want to do it quickly, you can’t be afraid, because you need alignment. You need instant and immediate alignment if you want really fast results. So yeah, we changed a lot of leadership. Then, I think about the other things we did… We did some important things in our business, which we can talk about if you want to, just in terms of we needed to make certain investments, especially in our advertising business and other things. But putting those aside for a second, the third big thing from a culture and a company perspective was that I think we went about trying to redefine how we do what we do. And honestly, that is my obsession. I am someone who believes that the what is a lot less important than the how.

If you have the how right, all the what’s will go better. And you have to ask yourself when you come into any organization, if that organization is not organically producing really high-quality answers all the time… What you should not do is run around trying to tell people what to do and ask them to do it differently. There’s no leverage in that. There’s no leadership in that. There’s no inspiration in that. What you need to do is ask yourself, “Why is that? How come this organism doesn’t produce good answers?” And start to get into the how and start to fix the how and then you start getting better answers. That’s the key to transformation.

Those ideas are in a little bit of tension. Let me just push you on that.

There’s the notion that you came into the company, you didn’t want to impose culture from the top down. You wanted to wait and see and diagnose the problem of how the company made choices. And then there’s a need to move fast in taking out all this old management, putting in new people, and you have to have a vision in order to go hire all those new people and change fast. Those ideas are in a little bit of opposition.

You’re right, you’re right. Totally fair. You have to listen. The truth is you have to do both. And you have to do both in a way that is authentic and effective. I am generally very, very clear and we as a team are very, very clear about what we want to do and what we think the right direction is. But here’s where they’re not in conflict: It’s the process through which you get clear about what you want to do, which is where all the action is. So, it’s not, “Hey, here I am, here’s what we got to do.” It’s much more about, “Hey, here I am, help explain to me how we got here.”

What do you do? What are the challenges? How do you guys see this? You fly all over the world, you talk to customers, you meet with everyone you can inside the company. You have hundreds of conversations, hundreds. Because in the beginning when you get here, you have no idea. If you’re being honest with yourself, you ought to have no idea what to do. Where you get that inspiration is through the coalescing of the hundreds and hundreds of conversations.

And at least what I experience is, I begin to understand where the areas of energy are and where the areas of opportunity are. And so then, when you show back up, and you stand up in front of people and you say, “Hey, here’s the direction I think we ought to go in.” It doesn’t feel like something you came up with by yourself in a room with a legal pad. It’s a reflection and an echo of what you heard from all the assembled people. It’s organic to what you’re doing, and it’s a byproduct of listening as opposed to stuffing it on top of people. And that’s why if you do it that way, it ought to be better.

You are the new CEO, but you also used to work for the old CEO: John Riccitiello was the CEO of Electronic Arts when you worked at Electronic Arts. Then he became the CEO of Unity, and you replaced him. What did you learn about what not to do or what to do from that experience working for the old boss?

John actually hired me in my first job in video gaming, back in — well, it wasn’t my first job in video gaming. He hired me at Electronic Arts in 2012. I learned a lot of what I learned about this industry from him, and have an enormous amount of respect and admiration for him, so I have really no inclination to sort of pick apart what he did or didn’t do.

The world is a new place now than it was four or five years ago. Unity is a new company and we’re pursuing a different direction.

All right, it was worth a shot! So, you made some changes to the top. I think this is the big Decoder question: How is Unity structured now?

Here’s the thing, and maybe you and I just won’t agree about this. I’m much less interested in structure than I am in behavior. And I’ll tell you why. I’ve worked in big companies, a lot of them over the years. My experience is that what people want to do, especially if they think they want to improve things, is they immediately go to an org chart. They go and they start moving things around. The truth is, if people are not properly oriented, if they’re not properly situated, if they’re not spiritually in the right place to do what you need to do, I don’t care what the structure is, it’s not going to work. And there is no right answer to structure. People think, “Hey, if I could just get it in the right shape, it’s going to be okay.” The truth is that some structures accelerate some outcomes and create different tensions, and other structures accelerate other outcomes and create other tensions. I tend not to think first about structure. I try to think first about the landing approach and behavior.

Once we get oriented around how we’re going to do what we’re doing and people start behaving differently, different things happen. If somebody comes to me, for example, and says, “You know the reason we can’t do this, it’s because this thing is over in this division and this thing is over in that division and they can’t talk to each other; they should be in the same division.” I have no time for that conversation. What do you mean? Do you have a phone for that person? Do you guys sit down and have a conversation about that? If we’re properly motivated, what difference does it make where it sits? Look, of course, I’ve restructured things and I’ve changed things, so again, I don’t want to, but in terms of orientation, I want to land one before the other because one I think is more substantive and more likely to fundamentally change things than the other, if that makes sense?

It does. My joke on the show is that I always ask that question, because to your point, if you tell me your structure, I can abstractly tell you 80 percent of your problems. I can identify the trade-offs that come with various structures. And it seems like you are making different trade-offs. You changed the structure, which means there’s something you wanted to change in the trade-offs you were making.

Yeah, I’d say principally the change in the structure… The only meaningful changes we made were around reducing layers and making sure that everybody was communicating, and that we could quickly escalate any issues, make decisions, and move on. We always had the right folks in the room to operate in a unified way. And if ever there were issues, we insisted that they get escalated and resolved quickly. So if there was some organizational thing that made it impossible for us all to sit together, or if there were too many layers and I couldn’t see, we made some of those changes. And I do think those have been important, but again, not as important as the behavioral changes.

Obviously, part of restructuring is shrinking. You’ve had a few rounds of layoffs now; last year, in January, 25 percent of the company was let go. You just had another [round]. Is that all to get smaller to reduce those middle layers, or is there something else going on there?

I wasn’t at the company for that really, really big one, but I will offer my strategy and my approach to these things. And I can already anticipate you’re going to tell me there’s a tension in them.

Welcome to Decoder. The producers, by the way, joke that that is what the tagline is.

Yeah. And by the way, that’s life, right? Nothing is black and white where it’s a Zen thing. But I never… We as a management team do not think about trying to get financial leverage by doing layoffs. I hate that. I think it’s nonsensical. What you have to do is make decisions and try to be really disciplined about the very few things you think you can do really, really well, and be a little bit ruthless about stopping the other things. And so for me, those kinds of restructurings are about putting your money where your mouth is as it relates to investing in the things that are important and ceasing the other things.

The thing I think that most leaders miss is, when they stand up and they talk about things that are important, what they don’t realize is that all they’re doing is adding another thing to people’s to-do lists. Because last week you said something else was important. The week before you said something else was important, and folks drown in those priorities. And nobody ever tells you what to stop doing, because that requires courage, and you probably wouldn’t be doing them if it wasn’t a pretty good idea at some point.

There’s a reason why people do things, but if you want organizations to perform really well, you have to be really, really clear about what you’re not doing, and then you have to put your money where your mouth is with respect to that. And sometimes there’s real pain associated with that, and it’s the unfortunate part about it, but in my experience, you come out the other end in much better shape.

Here’s the other big Decoder question: How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

I’m a big believer in full transparency, context, sharing with people, and having them share with me everything they understand about something. And then holding that up and making a call. And so, for me, it’s about engaging in a really deep conversation, being sure we’re talking about the same thing that we understand at the same level. I expose all the thinking I have on a topic, I’d like you to do the same thing. And we balance the pros and cons and then we make a call and we move on. For me, it’s much more important that we make a decision, than it is what that decision is. And it goes back to what we were talking about before. I believe in the how more than the what. If it turns out that decision was wrong, we’ll make a different decision. But the thing that kills companies, especially large companies, is a lack of courage and clarity around making decisions. So, my thing about decisions is, mostly make them.

That one comes up a lot. You are an interesting person to ask that question, because you came into the company and one decision that you had to make was obvious, I think, right? You said you came into a company that was at war with its customers, and that is because of the runtime fee that your predecessor had announced, which has shifted the pricing model of Unity to a per-install fee. Every time someone installed the game, the developer would have to pay, which would skyrocket costs.

I don’t know why that fee was instituted. It was obviously a problem. Here you are, you’re the new CEO. You knew you were going to walk that back, right? But you’re saying the how was really important. Walk me through how you made this decision, where the outcome seems so clear.

You’re absolutely right, and I appreciate you asking the question because I do think it’s a good example of what we’re talking about. I absolutely knew I was going to roll it back before I even took the job. The important part was not that I was going to roll it back, and not even so much how we were going to roll it back, but in the way in which we’re going to roll it back. For me, the most important thing, as I said, was, “Hey, I wanted to get back into a place where we were being partners with our customers.” And so, what I did was get on an airplane and started flying around, meeting with customers, and saying, “Hey, between you and me, we’re going to repeal this fee. I have some ideas about how, what do you think of them? Here’s what they are. If you want to vent about how upset you are about the old thing, that’s why I’m here too.” But I prefer to say, “If I did this, how would that strike you?”

And we started an open conversation. You have to select the folks you talk to because it is confidential. It’s important, you have to trust people. But we consulted and what we heard again and again was, “Hey, I accept that we’re not paying you enough. I actually think you’re delivering more value. I just hate the way you ask for the money. I don’t like the structure, I don’t like the tone. And by the way, if you’re going to raise prices, I need you to deliver better and execute better, because the two together strike me as aggravating.” And so, by the time… It took a little while, but it wasn’t a very long time. It was a few months and people were saying, “How come it took you so long?”

But it’s because I wanted to be sure we heard people and I wanted to be sure they understood that we were going to do things differently. We’re going to be disciplined, we’re going to communicate, we’re going to execute at a high level, and we’re going to listen. What came out of it was pretty sharp increases that, by and large, and listen, nobody likes to have prices raised... But we came out of it with a stronger bond with our customers, and the way we talked about it internally was equally important. Because to your point, we made this decision which was really ruinous for the company. You have to ask yourself, “How did that happen?” And so, how we make the new decision, how we have that conversation, who’s at the table? What kind of analysis do we do? What kind of feedback do we take? Getting into that and using that exercise to fix the organism and fix the process was equally important. It’s like, again, it was less about the thing and much more about using the thing to get healthy.

Can you just, in a sentence, diagnose how the decision to impose the runtime fee was made since you looked into it? And then how the decision to pull it back was made since you made that one differently?

I see Unity as a product company, and I’m a big believer that the way we create value is by delivering product value, and then folks will pay us for the value that we create. The thing about the runtime fee was that it was a business model. We were thinking about dynamics and how you can get people to do this versus that. If we raise one price here, then they’ll be forced to do that. That has nothing to do with creating value. That’s a trick. It’s a business model trick. It’s a hack. I don’t believe in that. I believe you create value by building better products. And so, the runtime fee decision was about, “Hey, we’ve got an engine business and we’ve got this ad business and we can’t exactly figure out how those two things would leverage one another and work together really well.” Okay, here’s a way. “I think we can structure a fee that brings them together and sort of encourages (which would be a kind word) folks to spend in one area if they spend in another.” I think customers found it more coercive than encouraging, but whatever.

My point is that, no… The way those two things come together is that both the developer part of our business and the ad part of the business depend on a deep understanding of consumer behavior. And just as folks who are building games need to understand how consumers are behaving in those games, in order to effectively acquire users, they also need to understand how consumers behave and that we can create product linkages and value there. That’s how we’ll drive value, and that’s substantive. I think that was sort of the distinction between the two approaches if that makes sense.

When you rolled back the runtime fee, you increased prices on some of the tiers of Unity. It seems like those could go up independently if you think you’re delivering more value there. But they did go up pretty steeply as you mentioned. And then there’s a monetization side where you’re making investments in ad companies to help you deliver more monetization. There’s a tension there. You can see that increasing ad monetization helps you get more money if there are more installs, so you might want to lower the price on the engine to get more market share and compete there. But if you increase the price on the engine, you might just make more money upfront against this ad thing that you have to keep developing. How are you reconciling those things?

I agree that there is a tension there.

We’re going to make a Decoder game in Unity called There’s a Tension There.

Any ad business at a high level thrives by opening the top of the funnel as broadly as possible. That’s what drives so that you’re left with something at the bottom of the funnel. That’s what ad-driven businesses do. And you’re right, there is some tension if you charge for the product, then presumably fewer people will use it, and then that’s not good. I think the important thing to understand about our structure is that Unity is free for everybody if you make less than a couple of 100,000 dollars in revenue. The top of the funnel is really big and broad. And there are millions of developers of Unity, and that’s why in the aggregate we have something like eight billion DAU (daily active users). It’s not deduped data. Cut it in half, say four billion people who are touching that Unity runtime in some way. So, it is hugely distributed.

I accept that if it was completely free, maybe you’d have more people using it, but again, keep in mind that you’re only paying us once your game is really successful. And as a percentage of what you’re making it’s not… it ought not to negatively impact you.

That’s interesting because I’ve seen that dynamic play out on other platforms, particularly the app stores. Where you’re free to a point and then you tick over into the next tier of success and suddenly you’re paying a penalty — or what developers perceive as a penalty — for success, right? You’ve tipped over into the amount of revenue it would cause you to pay. And you actually have an incentive to stay just under a certain level of success in order to stop paying more money, in order to prevent paying more money. Do you see that dynamic in Unity?

Listen, I think that, in general, our customers and the community understand that in order to invest in the engine, it’s important for us to be able to charge folks. And engines are very complex beasts and there’s a lot of engineering there, and there’s a lot of investment we make every year. And in general, I think there’s an understanding about that.

The hard part of the ads business, particularly on mobile, is that you’re up against the platform vendors. Google is particularly interested in ads in various ways. Apple is not interested in ads in various ways. The mobile ad business, particularly in iOS, took a big hit from app tracking transparency.

Apple is interested in their own ad business. Just to be clear.

They’re definitely interested in their own ad business. They’re not interested in anyone else’s business. I think that’s a good call out.

But they made the ad business on iOS much harder with app tracking transparency. I think I would argue that they made the correct trade-off. They made it harder to track people across apps and platforms, the web, and mobile. I don’t know that anyone perceives that that has gotten better. I still feel awfully tracked. But it had an impact on, for example, Meta’s business to the tune of billions of dollars. Is that a challenge that the ad industry has overcome? Is that a challenge you’re still working on?

I think it’s a challenge that largely the industry has overcome. It certainly had a meaningful impact. Different folks could be more or less cynical about what Apple’s motivations were or not. I don’t know. But I think now it’s largely in the rear-view mirror. And that in general, the systems have adapted.

You mentioned Apple is interested in its own ad business. The other thing they’re particularly interested in is in-app purchases. Their services revenue line is the one that’s growing as iPhone sales taper or even decline. I look at a show like Severance or Ted Lasso and I say, okay, that’s the shiny face on a huge revenue line that is mostly in-app purchases and games, right? Candy Crush whales are the growing business, and we just get Ted Lasso for free because we don’t want to talk about in-app purchases and games in that way.

I think 60 percent of the app economy is actually the game economy.

How much pressure do the platform vendors put on that? Because across the non-game iOS app ecosystem, the developers we talk to are basically just in full outrage mode, right? Apple calls them, they call it a shakedown. You can see various developers argue loudly for and against Apple. Sometimes the rules change. Sometimes all of Europe’s issues or regulations change the app store. The games industry has not been as loud, right? The game makers… In-app purchases make everybody money, and it seems to be left alone. Do you see that same conflict or that same angst there?

That’s true.

But listen, I think that there’s a tension there, Nilay.

Are you all just following behind him? Are you just letting him take the heat?

Apple and Google are incredibly important partners to the industry. And they’re incredibly important partners of ours. They’re platform partners. They’re partners to our customers, and so there’s a tension. I think it’s probably a brilliant flash of the obvious to learn that folks would rather pay less. But I think what you’re seeing in the industry is tension between folks who are relatively small in the scheme of the world, have important partnerships, and probably don’t have a lot of interest or incentive to be at war with their biggest platform partners.

Right, that’s why I’m asking about Tim. I was going to come to that. Most game makers are not willing to be at war. He is, because he has Fortnite, and that’s just a weapon that he can wield or shield, I suppose, from attacks he might face. No one else has that as far as I can tell. Is the industry just waiting to see what happens with Epic, or is there anything else concerted going on? Because I would say the pressure from the platforms is coming in different ways, particularly as different countries around the world regulate their fees and how open they have to be. They’re going to seek that revenue and games are already the largest portion of the revenue.

I think your description of the landscape is accurate. There are clearly pressures, significant pressures, regulatory pressures in Europe, regulatory pressures in the U.S., lawsuits, alternative app stores, and new devices. These are all pressures. And I do think that that is a feature of the world we’re in right now, and I’m sure Apple and Google are feeling some pressure around those things.

At the top of the episode, you were saying you perceive that there’s a lot of growth yet to come in the industry. You mentioned the Switch 2. There’s a new console generation, there are new form factors, and potentially there’s new hardware that’s coming.

All of that is up against those pressures. That’s the escape valve. Apple can keep squeezing gaming on the iPhone for fees, but if you can escape and the business is actually on the Switch 2, that’ll relieve the pressure. If the business Ray-Ban AR games — let’s say that works — maybe relieves the pressure, you get some competitive relief there. What’s the number one relief valve that you see as being viable in the near term?

Well, one of the things that’s really interesting in the most recent version of Unity we shipped has support for web GPU. I think web gaming is a really fascinating, really fast-growing part of our world, and it’s maybe a little bit back to the future. But I think that’s a great example of what you’re talking about.

I see the web as an out for a lot of app store problems, and then there’s a lot of pressure on, are the browsers good enough? Are they being held back by the mobile vendors in particular? Do you see the browsers being held back? Is there something you want to do in the browser that you can’t do on a mobile phone?

I think that as it relates to tools and standards there’s progress we need to make. But I’m optimistic about that, and again, I see web gaming exploding. I think we’ve largely got what we need, and you’re going to see more of it.

Do you think that web gaming is on a phone, or on a desktop?

I think principally you’ll be on your phone.

So, you see people playing more games on mobile Safari.

Why not?

I think Apple at least thinks it’s “Why not?” That’s the problem.

They might, well… I just think that the consumer will ultimately push people and partners where they have to be pushed. I think that. And I don’t know exactly how that’ll play out, but I don’t see Apple and Google as preventing web gaming.

I’m curious because the other thing I see from our audience is, boy, people love building gaming PCs, and actually, that’s a relief valve in a way. People love the Steam Deck; that’s another relief that way. But it doesn’t seem like those are flickers of growth that would give you some relief from the pressure.

I am much more optimistic in a generalized sense about the industry than you are, so I wouldn’t say flickers and you’re making me feel sad about it. I don’t see it that way.

I think the Steam Deck is real, but it’s not —

It’s real. It sort of seems to be, it is what it is. It’s a sizable audience. I don’t know that it’s going to suddenly become more massive, a place of more massive consumer adoption. I think that we have… Gaming happens on your TV. It happens on your phone and happens on your PC. There’s overlap in some of those places. But we continue to be, I think, more of a lean-back society in the living room and a more on-the-go society than we are a sit-down-at-your-desktop society. I think you’ll see those two probably grow more quickly than the third.

I want to be very clear for you and the listener, The Verge as an organization is very high on the Steam Deck. I feel like if I didn’t assign other stories, we would only write about the Steam Deck. That might be the only thing that happens in our newsroom, but I also know who we are.

We’re usually supportive of PC gaming too. As a tool, what we mostly think about is how can we ensure that whatever the new platforms are, we’re supporting them on day one so that developers can push to those platforms. We don’t have favorites. We don’t choose. We want to be everywhere, and that’s mostly how we think about that.

The one thing that would change that is another idea that I think flashed really brightly, particularly during the pandemic, and then has maybe come back to Earth, which is the idea that we would stream the games. Unity would run on big data centers operated by Netflix or Microsoft or someone, and really what we’re doing is live-streaming video, which maybe requires a total re-architecture of the entire industry. Everyone loved this idea. This idea has not, I would say, panned out in any realistic way. Do you think it has a future?

Not in the near term.

Why is that?

I don’t see it. I think the hurdles were a combination of technical, really hard problems to solve there. And I think it was a consumer solution looking for a problem that people didn’t have. It was like, “Well, I don’t know. I’m playing this game on my PlayStation or my PC. Why do I need to use my phone as a controller or get some other controller, because you want to delivery the game? I mean, okay, I downloaded the game last month. What are we talking about here?” I just don’t think consumers cared.

I think there was some desire to play the games everywhere. I agree with you, it obviously didn’t happen. But the thing that really prevented it was that you couldn’t install a game streaming app on a mobile phone, which would have been, I think at least one thing to market as opposed to however the platforms wanted you to do it. Do you think if they opened that up it would become more viable?

I don’t think, I don’t. Again, I think that the input device is maybe more important that people understand in this context. I don’t want to play Call of Duty on my phone with an external controller. And I want to pick a mobile version of Call of Duty, which is a different experience. I think different platforms should be developed as unique experiences. So, this idea that it was going to be this one version, which, I get it at a high level, at a technical level, but I don’t think consumers wanted it.

I feel like I’m required by law to ask you about AI to wrap up this conversation. I have to say it’s been a relief to not be mostly talking about AI with a CEO. I appreciate that.

I would never force you to talk about AI if you don’t want to.

I appreciate it. If you listen to some other episodes of Decoder, you can see, I’m just fighting it for an hour.

The games industry, like almost every creative industry, is in turmoil because of AI, right? The creatives are upset. We see video game voice actors putting out Instagram Reels about having their voices cloned by AI for AI characters. You see entire games being made in AI. Actually, there’s a very funny video where someone claims a game is AI, but it’s actually just Elden Ring. That’s deeply amusing to me.

But you see this happening. I generated some simplistic game using AI. I vibe coded it here. I shipped it, we’re ready to go. And then you see the creatives in the industry really worried that their jobs will be taken over by AI. I know Unity is somewhat agnostic to this. I think that’s actually the phrase you used. “The Unity platform is agnostic to the derivation of the 3D asset,” but then there’s the actual making of the game. Then there’s who gets paid. There are layoffs across this industry for a variety of reasons and rethinking of cost structures. How do you see AI playing out?

Yeah, this is a big topic and we could probably spend longer than you’d want to talk about it. I would say this, first, you’re right. We are agnostic with respect to where and how 3D assets get created because Unity is an assembly point. And it’s always been a place where you ingest or build the assets you want to build. You assemble the tools you want to assemble, and then you build these deep systems around them, which become fully formed games. I actually don’t think that any of the layoffs we’re seeing in gaming are driven by AI. I don’t think that. I think what video game developers and publishers will do, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is if they gain efficiencies in the making of games, I think they’ll make more games. And that’s where they’ll use that extra wiggle.

What we sort of believe will happen at the end of, maybe not the end, later in this process, is that there’ll be human creators sitting in the middle of the process of creation of these games, using a platform to create them. And they will have vertically oriented agents that are helping them do so. An agent that specializes in physics, an agent that specializes in sound, an agent that specializes in I.O., whatever it is. And there’ll be multiple people in that loop, and they will have those tools at their disposal, and they will need to bring them together in an interactive experience. We would like to continue to be at the center of that, and we think there is a need for a platform to be there. I think that it’s sort of a slightly Grognardian, boring point to make, but it’s critical. The biggest problem with either the creation of assets or even the full imagining of games, this hallucination of full game experiences, is that there’s no connection to workflows.

Games are massively deep systems, successful games, that need to be built around some of these assets and even some experiences. I think AI will be a really important part of putting those things together, but the systems, workflows, connections, how you manage large teams of people doing those things, and how we output and distribute those things — those are likely to be a part of this process for a really long time.

We have talked about a lot of things that are pressure on the industry, and you’ve pointed out that you’re more optimistic. What are the things that are making you excited about the future of games right now?

There almost isn’t anything that’s not making me excited about the future of games. Again, I see the difficulty we’re experiencing as this moment of creative destruction. One where the industry is going to have to reimagine itself to some degree, and that reimagination is going to take the form of innovation and gameplay, innovation and distribution, innovation and business models. And just we’re going to rethink. Just to take one example, because I think we haven’t talked about it, think about how meaningful game-related and actual property has become in the broader entertainment industry. That, by the way, was never true, until very recently, right? There had been a million unsuccessful movies and things that related to games, very few good ones. Now, suddenly there’s this whole other life. We’ve talked about some of the new possible distribution platforms, the shifts in the business models, and platform partners. All these things are opportunities. And yeah, we as companies… You feel pain and then you respond to that pain, and I think the history of the industry is that we innovate through those things.

Do you agree with me that Uncharted would’ve been better as a long-running series instead of a movie?

I do.

This is my thesis. Adaptations got good when we started making TV shows out of them, not movies.

It’s easier. Yeah. I mean, even though I think The Witcher was good as a series, at least initially.

Spicy take.

I know. I know. I’m sorry. I enjoyed it.

Fallout.

Fallout was great. Listen, I think there are a lot of things that are better in that form than a full movie form.

All right, well, Matt, we’re going to have to have you back and only talk about video game adaptations for a full hour. That’s my next pitch to you. This was great. Thank you so much for coming on Decoder.

It was my pleasure. Thank you for having me.

https://theverge.com,When will physical video games go away?,https://theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT","is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

One of Sony’s best-ever PlayStation ads is a 21-second video titled, “Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.” It’s a “step-by-step” guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box.

The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft’s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft walked it back just over a week after the release of Sony’s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple — don’t mess with people’s discs.

But more than a decade later, it’s not hard to imagine a future where Sony’s own ad doesn’t apply anymore.

Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells The Verge. “There has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,” Piscatella says. “And now there’s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.”

The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn’t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC?

The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren’t quite as online a decade ago.) And once people got used to digital, “more and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.”

Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim.

Microsoft hasn’t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an all-digital Series X option last year. Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” campaign positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of Avowed, one of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have a code for the game in the box.

Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it’s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the next Halo isn’t available on a disc, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade.

Related The next Xbox is going to be very different

Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro without a disc drive. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future.

Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like EA Sports College Football and Call of Duty have a “pretty big physical presence” that console makers may not want to jeopardize.

Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games — though maybe not discs — sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is backward-compatible with Switch 1 games. The console’s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2’s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s.

The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still “heavier physical” than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it’s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won’t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced a “virtual game card” lending system that lets family members share digital games.

“Consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars”

It’s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. “At this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,” Piscatella says.

Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media.

While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been “skyrocketing.” The PC games market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a “huge category,” he says.

He believes that accessories and what he calls “the personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity” will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think Amiibo, the Alarmo clock, and theme parks filled with Nintendo goodies.)

Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is “kind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,” Piscatella says. There’s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course — with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of Super Mario Odyssey can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It’s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media.

Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.",theverge

Microsoft is making its AI features widely available on Copilot Plus PCs equipped with Intel and AMD chips. One of the most notable of these features will be Live Captions, which translates audio to English subtitles from dozens of different languages in real time.

Microsoft first started testing Live Captions on Intel and AMD devices last December, and it’s now available through the latest Windows 11 update. The update also includes Cocreator, an AI tool in Paint that creates an image based on a text description and what you’re currently drawing. On top of that, Microsoft is also expanding access to its AI image editor and generator in the Photos app.

Microsoft started testing Recall, an AI feature that takes screenshots of your activity on a Copilot Plus PC and lets you search through them, with Intel and AMD devices last year, though there’s still no word when it will become widely available.

Additionally, Microsoft is updating Voice Access — an accessibility feature that lets people control their PC with their voice — on Qualcomm-powered Copilot Plus PCs. Microsoft says Voice Access users on these devices will now “be able to communicate with their PCs using more descriptive and flexible language.” It’s also adding the ability to translate 27 languages into Simplified Chinese.

Thankfully, there is a cheap cube-like contraption called the SwitchBot Bot that can add a touch of modern functionality to your garage door, light switch, and other traditional devices. It would normally run you $29.99, but right now you can buy it directly from SwitchBot for just $20.99 ($9 off) using promo code BKLP15 or at Amazon for $22.49 (about $8 off) if you’re a Prime member.

SwitchBot’s smart switch button pusher is incredibly easy to set up: just use the included tape to mount it to a standard button or rocker switch, which will let you use your phone to control devices you would typically turn on and off via a button. It works with compatible garage door openers and light switches, along with coffee makers, rice cookers, pet feeders, monitors, laundry machines, and other button-based gadgets. It also lets you create schedules and, when paired with a SwitchBot hub, issue voice commands via Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. It even supports Matter, though you will need to own the latest SwitchBot Hub 2 to take advantage of the newer smart home standard.

There are some caveats to bear in mind, though. You can’t use the Bot on toggle switches, for one thing. Also, while the button pusher supports Bluetooth, you’ll have to buy a separate hub if you want to control it remotely. That said, the SwitchBot Hub Mini is currently on sale at Amazon for $27.99 ($12 off), which is worth considering.",theverge

After years of companies promising that their quantum dot light-emitting diode TVs use quantum dots (QDs) to boost color, some industry watchers and consumers have recently started questioning whether QLED TVs use QDs at all. Lawsuits have been filed, accusing companies like TCL of using misleading language about whether their QLED TVs actually use QDs.

In this article, we'll break down why new conspiracy theories about QLED TVs are probably overblown. We'll also explore why misleading marketing from TV brands is responsible for customer doubt and how it all sets a bad precedent for the future of high-end displays, including OLED TVs and monitors.

What QLED TVs are supposed to do

TVs that use QDs are supposed to offer wider color gamuts and improved brightness over their QD-less LCD-LED counterparts. Just ask Samsung, which says that QLED displays deliver “a wider range of colors,” “better color coverage,” and “a brighter picture.” TCL will tell you that its QLED TVs use “billions of Quantum Dot nanocrystals” and deliver “industry-leading color palette and brightness.”

To be clear, properly manufactured QD TVs that use a sufficient quantity of QDs are legit. Excellent examples, which command higher prices than QD-free rivals, successfully deliver bright pictures with wide color gamuts and impressive color volume (the number of colors a TV displays at various levels of brightness). A TV with strong color volume can depict many light and dark shades of green, for example.

Technology reviews site RTINGS, which is known for its in-depth display testing, explains that a TV with good color volume makes ""content look more realistic,"" while ""TVs with poor color volume don't show as many details."" This is QLED's big selling point. A proper QLED TV can be brighter than an OLED TV and have markedly better color volume than some high-end, non-QD LCD-LED displays.",arstechnica

Dubbed Gen-4, the model purports to solve several key problems with AI video generation.

Chief among those is the notion of consistent characters and objects across shots. If you've watched any short films made with AI, you've likely noticed that they're either dream-like sequences of thematically but not realistically connected images—mood pieces more than consistent narratives.

Runway claims Gen-4 can maintain consistent characters and objects, provided it's given a single reference image of the character or object in question as part of the project in Runway's interface.

The company published example videos including the same woman appearing in various different shots across different scenes, and the same statue appearing in completely different contexts, looking largely the same in a variety of environments and lighting conditions.

Likewise, Gen-4 aims to allow filmmakers who use the tool to get coverage of the same environment or subject from multiple angles across several shots in the same sequence. With Gen-2 and Gen-3, this was virtually impossible. The tool has in the past been good at maintaining stylistic integrity, but not at generating multiple angles within the same scene.

The last major model update at Runway was Gen-3, which was announced just under a year ago in June 2024. That update greatly expanded the length of videos users could produce from just two seconds to 10, and offered greater consistency and coherence than its predecessor, Gen-2.

Runway’s unique positioning in a crowded space

Runway released the first publicly available version of its video synthesis product to users in February 2023. Gen-1 creations tended to be more curiosities than anything useful to creatives, but subsequent optimizations have allowed the tool to be used in limited ways in real projects.",arstechnica

The iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and visionOS 2.4 updates are all currently available to download, and each adds a small handful of new features for their respective platforms.

A watchOS 11.4 update was also published briefly, but it's currently unavailable.

The Mac picks up two major features in the Sequoia 15.4 update. Users of the Mail app now get the same (optional) automated inbox sorting that Apple introduced for iPhones and iPads in an earlier update, attempting to tame overgrown inboxes using Apple Intelligence language models.

The Mac is also getting a long-standing Quick Start setup feature from the Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad. On those devices, you can activate them and sign in to your Apple ID by holding another compatible Apple phone or tablet in close proximity.

Wind Cave’s rocks fluoresce under black light

Several fluorescence measurements of a zebra calcite in Wind Cave were taken using portable spectrometers. Credit: Joshua Sebree

South Dakota's Wind Cave gets its name from the flow of air moving continually through its many passages and equalizing the atmospheric pressure between the air inside and outside—almost like the cave is ""breathing."" Its rock and mineral formations also boast a unique chemistry that fluoresces when exposed to black light, according to talks presented at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. That fluorescence could shed light on how life can thrive in extreme environments, including that of Jupiter's moon, Europa.

University of Northern Iowa astrobiologist Joshua Sebree and several students have been mapping new areas of Wind Cave (as well as other caves in the US), recording the passages, rock formations, minerals, and lifeforms they encounter in the process. They noticed that under UV light, certain parts of Wind Cave took on otherworldly hues, thanks to different concentrations of organic and inorganic fossilized chemical compounds. Those areas seem to indicate where water once flowed, carrying minerals into the cave from the surface 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to their analysis of the fluorescent spectra. Sebree et al. found that Wind Cave was likely carved out by waters rich in manganese, producing zebra stripes that glow pink under UV light, revealing the calcites that grew within as a result of those waters.",arstechnica

The company, which offers fire detection and suppression systems based on thermal and optical imaging, smoke analytics, and human verification, releases annual reports on waste and recycling facility fires in the US and Canada to select industry and media. In 2024, Fire Rover, based on its fire identifications, saw 2,910 incidents, a 60 percent increase from the 1,809 in 2023, and more than double the 1,409 fires confirmed in 2022.

Publicly reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities also hit 398, a new high since Fire Rover began compiling its report eight years ago, when that number was closer to 275.

Lots of things could cause fires in the waste stream, long before lithium-ion batteries became common: ""Fireworks, pool chemicals, hot (barbecue) briquettes,"" writes Ryan Fogelman, CEO of Fire Rover, in an email to Ars. But lithium-ion batteries pose a growing problem, as the number of devices with batteries increases, consumer education and disposal choices remain limited, and batteries remain a very easy-to-miss, troublesome occupant of the waste stream.

All batteries that make it into waste streams are potentially hazardous, as they have so many ways of being set off: puncturing, vibration, overheating, short-circuiting, crushing, internal cell failure, overcharging, or inherent manufacturing flaws, among others. Fire Rover's report notes that the media often portrays batteries as ""spontaneously"" catching fire. In reality, the very nature of waste handling makes it almost impossible to ensure that no battery will face hazards in handling, the report notes. Tiny batteries can be packed into the most disposable of items—even paper marketing materials handed out at conferences.

Fogelman estimates, based on his experience and some assumptions, that about half of the fires he's tracking originate with batteries. Roughly $2.5 billion of loss to facilities and infrastructure came from fires last year, divided between traditional hazards and batteries, he writes.",arstechnica

In a letter from his lawyer, Alex Spiro, Musk alleged that the SEC gave him 48 hours to accept a settlement or face fraud charges. Musk refused to pay the fine, demanding to know ""who directed these actions,"" suspecting either former SEC Chair Gary Gensler or Joe Biden's White House.

Once the SEC lawsuit was filed in January, Musk's condemnation of the settlement was echoed in his claims that the SEC was ""totally broken."" These comments seemed to further his feud with the agency following a contentious 2018 Tesla settlement over Musk's tweets that resulted in the Supreme Court declining to hear Musk's arguments against his tweets being monitored by the SEC.

But after Donald Trump issued a February executive order declaring sweeping powers over independent agencies—including the SEC, which was accused of launching politically motivated investigations—it appeared that Musk might instead have been setting up the narrative to possibly get the probe squashed.

And while that still appears to be a possibility, it now seems that a persistent lawsuit raised by Twitter investors that's linked to the SEC probe may end up being the hurdle that possibly blocks Musk's efforts to evade the SEC's investigation. And once again, it's perhaps Musk's tweets that may force the billionaire to potentially end up paying fines to settle charges—recently deemed plausibly showing intent to deceive.

On Friday, US District Judge Andrew L. Carter, Jr., gave Twitter investors a big win by mostly denying Musk's motion to dismiss. The judge agreed that it seemed plausible that Musk and other defendants concocted a scheme to spend ""over $2.6 billion to secretly purchase over 70 million shares"" at an artificially lower price.

The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a press release today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms ""smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,"" the agency said.

User consent obtained via the ATA framework ""authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes,"" the agency said. ""If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers ('IDFA'), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites."" The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.

The intent of ATT ""is not problematic in terms of the likely benefits for users as regards privacy protection,"" but ""how the framework is implemented is abusive within the meaning of competition law,"" the agency said. Apple's ""implementation methods artificially complicate the use of third-party applications and distort the neutrality of the framework to the detriment of small publishers financed by advertising,"" it said.

Third-party publishers ""cannot rely on the ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations,"" so they ""must continue to use their own consent collection solution,"" the French agency said. ""The result is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the use of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively complex.""",arstechnica

The most interesting aspect of the update for retro computing enthusiasts is expanded operating system support: the app will now run on Windows 95, Windows 98, and old versions of Windows NT like 3.51 and 4.0. The previous version of the app only went as far back as Windows XP.

The app spits out benchmarking scores for five things: single-core CPU performance, multi-core CPU performance, 2D graphics performance using GDI, 3D graphics performance using OpenGL, and disk speed (broken into four sub-benchmarks for sequential and random read and write performance).

The app will also run on current systems, including 64-bit x86 and Arm-based PCs, and the results database is dominated by those modern systems.

By combining the practical and understatedly rakish E28 5-Series with the motorsport-derived six-cylinder engine from the M1 supercar, the automaker had created a “do-it-all” performance machine, a vehicle that could serve as a tasteful and luxurious sedan one moment and a charismatic sports car the next.

It’s a concept that has guided the development of not only subsequent generations of the M5 but also all of the other sports sedans that have dared to go toe to toe with it over the past forty years. For decades, it’s been the benchmark by which all big, fast four-doors have been judged, but after spending a week with the all-new $125,275 G99-generation M5 Touring, I can’t help but wonder if that era is coming to a close.

A range of factors have contributed to this seismic shift. While other automakers have been chasing the M5’s ghost around the Nürburgring, BMW has purposely started to reposition its M Division vehicles as the pinnacle representation of the brand rather than the pinnacle representation of BMW performance. It’s a move that has yielded models like the XM, a vehicle that certainly has plenty of firepower under the hood but ultimately prioritizes style over substance.

And as BMW contends with customers’ undying thirst for more, it must also contend with an array of European regulations aimed at quelling everything from emissions to road noise. From an engineering standpoint, this creates a significant challenge: How do you make your new sports sedan more capable and engaging than the last one while still adhering to the rule of law? For BMW, the answer appears to come in the form of a vast array of technologies aimed at convincing you that the experience is more thrilling than it actually is.

I don’t mean to imply that the new M5 is a bad car, or even bad at executing the mission of an M5. In some respects, there’s cause for celebration: For the first time in the M5’s history, the Touring model has made its way stateside to do battle with the RS 6 Avant, Audi’s high-performance wagon. Opting for the longroof not only scores you an arguably more stylish M5; it also expands its cargo capacity to a crossover-like 57.6 cubic feet (1,631 L) with the rear seats down.",arstechnica

Are you ever going to go to space?

The ExoMars mission represents Europe's third attempt to land successfully on Mars, and at a cost of more than $1.3 billion. there is a lot riding on its success. But success is far from assured for a mission that has been whipsawed by geopolitical tensions, budget cuts, and an ever-changing architecture over the last 20 years.

The latest news, announced Sunday, is that Airbus will design and build the lander that will carry the ExoMars down to the surface of Mars. The mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than 2028 on a US rocket. But there have been so many twists and turns in the ExoMars story that it's very difficult to know what will ultimately happen.

Let's go back to the beginning.

Decades in the making

Nearly two decades have passed since the European Space Agency formally committed to funding the ExoMars mission at a ministerial meeting in December 2005. It was to be an international partnership, with an ExoMars launch in 2011 on Russian Soyuz 2-1b rocket. NASA would contribute an exobiology instrument, data relay services from an orbiter around Mars, and technical support for the spacecraft's design.

As Mars discussions between the European Space Agency and NASA deepened in 2008 and 2009, the mission's launch vehicle changed to an Atlas V rocket built by US-based United Launch Alliance. Then, just months later, plans changed again when the European Space Agency partnered with Russia's Roscosmos to launch ExoMars on a Proton rocket.",arstechnica

An additional 25 percent tariff on car parts is set to go into effect within the next month, which promises to make US-made cars more expensive as well, as many parts and subassemblies used in domestic manufacturing come from suppliers in Canada or Mexico.

During the election campaign (and in the years preceding it), Trump repeatedly claimed that the cost of tariffs would be borne by the exporters. But tariffs don't work that way—they're paid by the importer, at the time of import.

The White House does not appear to have any concerns about this, despite a report in The Wall Street Journal last week claiming that Trump had warned automakers not to pass the costs on to their customers.

Relying on only anonymous sources, the WSJ quoted ""people with knowledge of the call,"" saying that the president told them to be grateful for eliminating a so-called EV mandate—really just tougher emissions and fuel economy standards that Trump and his party oppose—and then followed that with ""a lengthy pitch for how they would actually benefit from tariffs.""",arstechnica

Multiple marketing executives told the Financial Times that companies have felt pressure to spend a nominal sum on X following Musk’s high-profile role in US President Donald Trump’s administration.

They said Musk’s pursuit of legal action against groups that have stopped advertising since his $44 billion acquisition in late 2022 had also sparked alarm. X last month added about half a dozen more companies to its case including Shell, Nestlé, Pinterest, and Lego.

“It’s whatever amount is enough to stay off the naughty list,” said Lou Paskalis, chief executive of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory and a former media executive at Bank of America.

“It’s not because the brand safety risk has gone away. But the far greater risk is that a comment [from Musk] in the press sends your stock price tumbling, and instead of a multimillion-dollar risk you’re facing a multibillion-dollar risk.”

The move comes as X was this week bought by Musk’s artificial intelligence group xAi in a deal that valued the social media platform at $45 billion, including debt. Musk said that he would combine the data, models, and talent of the two companies.

Investors have been buoyed by Musk’s proximity to the Trump administration as well as signs that his cost-cutting approach has been effective and revenues are improving.

Musk and X chief executive Linda Yaccarino have set a goal that aims to boost advertising revenues back to 2022 levels, according to two people familiar with the matter. They believe this is the minimum X should be bringing in without the hit caused by brands “boycotting” or avoiding the platform over its political bent, the people said.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,The first flight of Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum rocket lasted just 40 seconds,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/europes-first-private-launch-company-is-learning-to-embrace-failure/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:26:54 GMT","The first flight of Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rocket didn't last long on Sunday. The booster's nine engines switched off as the rocket cartwheeled upside-down and fell a short distance from its Arctic launch pad in Norway, punctuating the abbreviated test flight with a spectacular fiery crash into the sea.

If officials at Isar Aerospace were able to pick the outcome of their first test flight, it wouldn't be this. However, the result has precedent. The first launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket in 2006 ended in similar fashion.

""Today, we know twice as much about our launch system as yesterday before launch,"" Daniel Metzler, Isar's co-founder and CEO, wrote on X early Monday. ""Can't beat flight testing. Ploughing through lots of data now.""

Isar Aerospace, based in Germany, is the first in a crop of new European rocket companies to attempt an orbital launch. If all went according to plan, Isar's Spectrum rocket would have arced to the north from Andøya Spaceport in Norway and reached a polar orbit.

But officials knew there was only a low chance of reaching orbit on the first flight. For this reason, Isar did not fly any customer payloads on the Spectrum rocket, designed to deliver up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms) of payload mass to low-Earth orbit.

Duck and cover

The launch began with liftoff from Andøya Spaceport at 12:30 pm local time (6:30 am EDT, or 10:30 UTC). The rocket's nine engines, burning a mix of liquid propane and liquid oxygen, throttled up to generate more than 150,000 pounds (675 kilonewtons) of thrust as Spectrum began a vertical climb from the launch pad.

The first visual sign of trouble appeared about 15 seconds later as the 92-foot-tall (28-meter) rocket started to wobble on its axis. The exhaust plume from Spectrum's main engines also appeared to oscillate, suggesting that the rocket's steering system was trying to keep it on track.

After a brief struggle, the rocket lost control and somersaulted, the engines shut down, and the vehicle fell into the sea about 40 seconds after launch. With its propellant tanks nearly full, the rocket's impact created a brilliant fireball and mushroom cloud over the craggy snow-covered landscape of Andøya, which means ""island of the ducks"" in Norwegian.",arstechnica
https://gizmodo.com,Trump Official Was Reportedly Involved in Other Questionable Signal Chats,https://gizmodo.com/trump-official-was-reportedly-involved-in-other-questionable-signal-chats-2000582922,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:15:53 GMT","The Trump administration made itself look more incompetent and dysfunctional than usual last week when the Secretary of Defense accidentally texted details of a secret bombing mission in Yemen to the head editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg. “Signalgate”—as it has come to be known—has spurred fresh scrutiny of the White House, as concerns swirl over the team’s ridiculous approach to OPSEC. Now, a new report claims that the official responsible for the debacle was also involved in other secret conversations on the app.

National security advisor Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for adding Goldberg to the infamous Signal chat, and screenshots published by The Atlantic clearly show that he was the one to do it. However, the Trump administration has also now put Waltz in charge of finding out how this happened, as if there’s some big technical mystery that needs solving. As Waltz runs point on his own fuckup, a new story claims that he may have been involved in several other ill-advised chats. The Wall Street Journal reports:

Two U.S. officials also said that Waltz has created and hosted multiple other sensitive national-security conversations on Signal with cabinet members, including separate threads on how to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine as well as military operations. They declined to address if any classified information was posted in those chats.

Critics have speculated that the Trump administration has been using encrypted civilian messaging apps as a way to circumvent public transparency regulations—a decision many security experts seem to think is mind-numbingly dumb. The report doesn’t share much information on how many other Signal conversations Waltz may have been involved with. Gizmodo reached out to the White House for comment.

Since his big media glowup, Waltz hasn’t done himself any favors. In a hilarious White House press conference involving both himself and the President, Waltz stammered his way through a public non-apology in which he mumbled something about “lessons learned” before accusing the media of lying and then bragged about America taking a stand against terrorism. “Thank God for American leadership! Thank God for American strength! You’re welcome, world!” Waltz said, when Trump asked him why he had sent war plans to a journalist. Obviously a mental and verbal trainwreck, Waltz later went on Fox News and sought to dispel rumors that he and Goldberg had a previously established professional relationship. During the segment, Waltz called Goldberg the “bottom scum of journalism” while claiming he didn’t know the editor and that he had never texted with him before. He admitted, however, that he had somehow added Goldberg’s number to the group chat. Laura Ingraham, to her credit, didn’t immediately let the issue go:

Ingraham: “How did it end up on your phone?”

Waltz: “That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”

Ingraham: “That’s a pretty big problem.”

Waltz: “That is why we got the best technical minds, right?” [Waltz is presumably saying the administration has the “best technical minds” trying to figure out how he accidentally added Goldberg to the group chat]

Ingraham: “That’s disturbing.”

Waltz: “I’m sure everybody out there has had a contact, where it said one person, and then a different number.” [???]

Ingraham: “But you’ve never talked to him before, so how’s the number on your phone?”

Goldberg has come out to deny Waltz’s claim that the two didn’t know each other. “My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone,” the editor told NBC’s Meet the Press. “He’s telling everyone that he’s never met me or spoken to me—that’s simply not true. I understand why he’s doing it but this has become a somewhat farcical situation.”

Apparently, Waltz wasn’t particularly well-liked even before he accidentally invited a journalist to a secret foreign policy meeting. The Journal reports that even “before the most recent episode, Waltz had annoyed many of his colleagues by seeming imperious and expressing views that were out of line with Trump’s agenda, two administration officials said.”",gizmodo

It’s been an awkward time to love tech. As both consumers and the world’s biggest tech companies wrestled with the impact of Trump tariffs on supply chains. At the very least, we found several new favorite products of 2025 have already arrived. AMD started with with its response to Nvidia’s mid-range GPUs, and Apple seized our attention yet again with the launch of its MacBook Air M4 and new Mac Studio.

But the ides of March did indeed bring ill winds. This month was supposed to offer us the full look at Google Pixel 9a plus a heaping helping of gaming laptops sporting the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. However, there’s been a rash of delays. We now have to sit on our hands, waiting for Google’s latest phone and our most-anticipated laptops, plus devices like Nothing 3a Pro and—reportedly—Nvidia’s RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti. With more mobile gaming platforms on the way for April, including the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, next month is shaping up to be one of the most impactful for the tech world in recent memory.

We’ve long been promised an exoskeleton revolution. While the Hypershell X won’t have you throwing cars or jumping 20 feet in the air, it does actually do a lot to make leg exercises easier. The device detects when you move your leg, then assists that movement with in-built motors. In our tests, we found it aided a three-hour hike so well it left us a third as fatigued as we would be without it. The Hypershell Pro X model also had a surprisingly strong battery life that could keep up even when on the move for several hours.

Foldables have yet to find their place in today’s crowded U.S. smartphone market, but the Oppo Find N5 is making a strong case that U.S. foldables need to catch up, and soon. The Find N5 is larger than Samsung and Google’s offerings, and it’s thinner to boot. Bummer then that the device isn’t available for sale in North America. Our next best hope to get a device like the Find N5 is to wait for OnePlus. That company is owned by the same conglomerate as Oppo.

The MacBook Air remains one of the best laptops, just as it has been since the advent of the M1 chip. The new version comes with a “sky blue” color that looks more like a cloudy day than a sunny sky, but it also starts at its lowest price ever at $1,000. For that, you’re getting a strong performance uptick from the M3 MacBook Air. It has especially powerful graphics performance, managing to scoot in just under the MacBook Pro 14 with M4 in our benchmarks. At this point, the MacBook Air M4 is so close to perfection it just needs a new display without the notch to become our most-recommended laptop.

One of the best (and most-expensive) gaming laptops is now smaller (and more-expensive) than it’s ever been. The Razer Blade 16 in 2025 includes a Nvidia GeForce RT 5090 at the top end, so you already know performance is going to be solid across the board. It also packs a 2560 x 1600 OLED display to show off all those pretty graphics from the most-demanding titles. While it doesn’t have the battery life you need for using it as your all-day, on the go device, the thinner design is a benefit for those who want to put the Razer Blade 16 in their bag and not feel like they’re lugging around a 5-pound brick.

For the sake of on-the-go, pill-shaped speakers, the JBL Charge 6 is leading the pack in audio quality for its size. We found its audio quality was far more measured than the previous iterations of the Charge, with solid highs and mids to go along with its normally-excellent bass. JBL’s small speaker continues to be durable and still has enough juice to last for a long listening session. If you have two on hand, you can combine them with the PartyTogether on the JBL Portable feature to facilitate some stereo audio too.

When the high-end graphics card market was effectively monopolized by Nvidia, AMD had to show up and make a case for lower-end, cheaper GPUs. With the Radeon RX 9070 XT, the company succeeded with room to spare. The graphics card meets or beats performance from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and costs $150 less MSRP. The new FSR 4 upscaling model, which is exclusive to this and the Radeon RX 9070, also provides a solid uptick in performance without sacrificing too much visual quality. Of course, you’d be lucky to get the RX 9070 XT at $600 (or even find it in stock), but it still comes out cheaper than Nvidia’s equivalent.",gizmodo

Musk Says Anyone Can Be Paid $ 20 by photo for getting people in wisconsin to pose for a picture holding an image of conservative judge Brad Schimel, Who’s running against liberal Judge Susan Crawford. People Who Participate Don’t Even Need To Be Residents Of Wisconsin to Get The Money, According to Musk. However, The Terms and Conditions Listed on Musk’s website Appear to Contradict that Claim.

Then on Sunday, Shortly Before Musk Took The Stage in Green Bay, The State Supreme Court Denied a Request to Hear the Case.

Musk, who’s poured over $ 20 million Into the Wisconsin Election Through Entities Like America Pac, Said Sunday that People Could Become So-Called “Block Captains,” To spread the word about voting for Judge Schimel, follow-up with a tweet later that Night the offer.

The Billionaire Descred It as Easy Money, Explaining that it was open to anyone, Whether they live in the state of wisconsin or not.

America Pac, in ITS SOLE Discretion, Has the Authority to Approve or Deny a person’s Application to be a block captain.

It’s not Clear Why Musk Said that Anyone Could Get Paid, Even if they don’t live in Wisconsin. But the Billionaire Does Haves A History of Blatantly Lying about Things That Are Easy To Look Up. The Terms On America Pac’s Website, which Contain Spelling Errors, Are So Confusing When IT Comes To How Some Might Be Able to get Over $ 1,000. Lines Like “Each HouseHold is limited to receiving one $ 20” Don’t Provide Any Clarity on What Limitations Exist for Payment (Emphasis Over):

Each household is limited to receiving one $ 20. For example, if Two People in the Same HouseHold Submit Pro-Schimel Photos, America Pac Will Only Pay $ 20 (not $ 40) for those submissions. If block captain submits pro-schimel Photos from 100 HouseHolds, they will be designated [sic] a “block general” and receiver to additional $ 200 Payment. America pac will not pay a block captain for sub-ofting pro-schimel Photos from a household that Has already submitted a pro-schimel photo. All Pro-Schimel Photos must be submitted by 8pm CT on Tuesday, April 1, 2025, in Order to Be Eligible for Payment.

The Website So explains that Photos Taken Near Polling Booth wants to be eligible for compensation, though that so Raises a Host of Thorny Legal Questions. Electioneering is illegal within 100 Feet of a Polling Place in Wisconsin.

https://gizmodo.com,Creepy New Sunflower Discovered in Texas National Park,https://gizmodo.com/creepy-new-sunflower-discovered-in-texas-national-park-2000582398,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:10:47 GMT","Researchers have discovered a previously unknown member of the sunflower family in Texas’ Big Bend National Park—the first time a new plant genus and species has been identified in a U.S. national park in almost five decades.

The flower, called Ovicula biradiata and dubbed the “wooly devil,” is described in a study published February in the journal PhytoKeys. The Big Bend National Park is well known to botanists, underscoring the fact that even extensively studied regions can still yield surprises.

“While many assume that the plants and animals within our country’s national parks have probably been documented by now, scientists still make surprising new discoveries in these iconic protected landscapes,” Isaac Lichter Marck, a plant taxonomist from the California Academy of Sciences and co-author of the study, says in the academy’s statement.

Lichter Marck said O. biradiata belongs to the sunflower family, even though it doesn’t immediately resemble its typically radiant, sunburst-like kin.

“After sequencing its DNA and comparing it with other specimens in the Academy’s herbarium, we discovered that this small, fuzzy plant is not only a new species within the sunflower group, but it is also distinct enough from its closest relatives to warrant an entirely new genus,” he added. A genus is the biological classification between species and family.

A park volunteer first observed the wooly devil in March 2024 and uploaded its information into a community science app called iNaturalist. This small plant features furry white leaves and maroon-striped ray florets (petal-looking parts of a flower head). Botanists call it a “belly plant” because it’s easiest to observe when lying down. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and blooms only after it rains.

“Plants that thrive in deserts are often quite unique, having evolved specific mechanisms to withstand the extreme drought-and-deluge conditions of these arid landscapes—from water-storing structures to rapid life cycles triggered by rain,” Lichter Marck explained. “But as climate change pushes deserts to become hotter and drier, highly specialized plants like the wooly devil face extinction.” The team has only observed this plant in three narrow spots at the park’s northern edge, raising the possibility that they’ve recorded a species already in decline, Lichter Marck added.

“Ovicula” means “tiny sheep,” referencing the plant’s furry leaves and the Big Bend’s bighorn sheep, while “biradiata,” meaning “bi-radial,” highlights its maroon stripes.

“Now that the species has been identified and named, there is a tremendous amount we have yet to learn about it,” said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend National Park botanist and co-author of the study. She’s hoping to find other populations of the wooly devil elsewhere in the park, and to also learn more about its life cycle and reproductive processes. As a drought is currently hitting the region, it’s unknown if new plants will appear later this spring, Whiting said.

Back in the lab, the researchers documented the presence of glands on the wooly devil that have been found to possess anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory compounds in other members of the sunflower family. While these properties still need to be confirmed in the new species, California Academy of Sciences’ Keily Peralta, another co-author of the study, said “this discovery underscores the potential knowledge we stand to gain from preserving plant diversity in fragile desert ecosystems.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,House of the Dragon's Showrunner Hopes He and George R.R. Martin Will Make Up 'Someday',https://gizmodo.com/house-of-the-dragons-grrm-complaints-ryan-condal-hbo-2000583012,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 21:00:07 GMT","There was plenty of onscreen drama in House of the Dragon season two: painful betrayals, fiery deaths, powerful awakenings, wanderings in the spirit world, Aemond being Aemond… you name it. But a behind-the-scenes tiff may have overshadowed them all, when source material author George R.R. Martin spoke out about his dissatisfaction with plot changes made in HBO’s adaptation. With season three’s production now underway, there’s no way showrunner Bryan Condal wasn’t going to be asked about the controversy.

To recap the kerfluffle, in July 2024, Martin published a blog post praising a new addition to House of the Dragon. He loved that the show added a faithful dog to the assassin duo of Blood and Cheese, though he couched it in a warning: “I am not usually a fan of screenwriters adding characters to the source material when adapting a story. Especially not when the source material is mine.”

That same episode—the season two premiere, featuring Blood and Cheese offing King Aegon II Targaryen’s todder-aged heir to the Iron Throne—stuck in Martin’s craw, however, due to a different change to that very sequence, one he didn’t much care for. Another blog post went up in August in which the author promised he’d dig into “everything that’s gone wrong with House of the Dragon.” Then, a few days later in early September, he spilled the promised tea in a post that was swiftly deleted.

As part of that now-scrubbed post, Martin said that he’d pushed back about the changes initially, including his concerns about how altering events in season two will affect the futures of certain characters down the line. A few days later, Condal defended his choices on HBO’s official House of the Dragon podcast. A few days after that, Martin was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth by the Hollywood Reporter, but instead took the opportunity to shower praise on another of HBO’s Westeros-set adaptation of his works, the upcoming A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

All’s been quiet on that front since mid-September 2024… until today. In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, Condal said he found Martin’s criticism “disappointing.” He’s obviously still a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, and “working on the show has been truly one of the great privileges of, not only my career as a writer, but my life as a fan of science-fiction and fantasy. George himself is a monument, a literary icon in addition to a personal hero of mine, and was heavily influential on me coming up as a writer.”

He also, again, defended the choices the show has made in transferring the work from page to screen. Fire & Blood, he pointed out, isn’t written as a novel the way Martin’s A Game of Thrones and its sequels are. “It’s this incomplete history and it requires a lot of joining of the dots and a lot of invention as you go along the way. I will simply say, I made every effort to include George in the adaptation process. I really did. Over years and years. And we really enjoyed a mutually fruitful, I thought, really strong collaboration for a long time.”

That’s no longer the case, Condal said. “At some point, as we got deeper down the road, he just became unwilling to acknowledge the practical issues at hand in a reasonable way. And I think as a showrunner, I have to keep my practical producer hat on and my creative writer, lover-of-the-material hat on at the same time. At the end of the day, I just have to keep marching not only the writing process forward, but also the practical parts of the process forward for the sake of the crew, the cast, and for HBO, because that’s my job. So I can only hope that George and I can rediscover that harmony someday. But that’s what I have to say about it.”

https://gizmodo.com,Substack Gears Up for TikTok Ban with New Video Feed,https://gizmodo.com/substack-gears-up-for-tiktok-ban-with-new-video-feed-2000583062,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:50:27 GMT","Hey, remember the TikTok ban? It’s still a thing (in theory) and the latest deadline is closing in, so other social media platforms are gearing up to try to grab the attention of those addicted to the infinite scroll. Substack is the latest to get in the game, announcing that it is introducing a TikTok-style video feed that creators can use to diversify their content, as first reported by TechCrunch.

The latest update to the self-publishing platform will turn the company’s Media tab into a scrollable video feed. Creators will be able to upload videos up to 10 minutes in length for their subscribers to consume, according to Fast Company. It seems the video content will be available for more than just subscribers and will serve as a discoverability tool, allowing readers to scroll and find new voices from whom they might be interested in hearing more.

The secret sauce for TikTok has always been the recommendation algorithm and its ability to show people content that keeps them watching. Part of its success is that it has a huge user base that regularly uploads content. (How much of that is slop and how much is actually valuable is debatable.) Substack is working with a much smaller number of creators, though it is increasingly getting writers into multimedia. The company claims 82% of its top-earning writers are using multimedia tools, per TechCrunch, a solid uptick from about 50% last April.

It seems Substack might prefer the narrower base of content creators, too. Earlier this year, CEO Chris Best announced a $25,000 “TikTok Liberation Prize” that he said would be awarded to a creator who manages to drive users from TikTok to Substack. According to Best, the goal of the prize was to “rescue the smart people from TikTok,” which probably only sounds about half as pretentious as it actually is.

Still, the move makes Substack another potential landing destination should TikTok actually get shut down for good. You might remember that TikTok was temporarily banned earlier this year before Donald Trump delayed the block, giving parent ByteDance extra time to divest its ownership over the platform.

That whole ordeal has kinda gotten lost in the flurry of everything else the administration has been up to, but the extension deadline is nigh: the 75-day sale period will expire on April 5. While some potential buyers like Mr. Beast have expressed interest, it doesn’t seem like a sale is imminent, though Trump insists one will get done. But that might not matter, as Trump has expressed that he would extend the deadline again if needed. Almost like he’s just making it up as he goes.",gizmodo

SpaceX’s Fram2 mission is set for liftoff on Monday at 9:46 p.m. ET, launching from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission will launch a private crew of astronauts on board a Dragon spacecraft, where they will spend three to five days admiring our planet from a unique polar orbit.

SpaceX will stream the launch live on its website and X account, beginning around an hour before liftoff. Should the launch need to be postponed, a backup opportunity is available on Tuesday, April 1, depending on weather conditions.

The crew of first-time astronauts includes Chun Wang of Malta, who founded the Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish, and is leading Fram2 and reportedly funding the mission as well; Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer; Eric Philips, an Australian polar adventurer; and Rabea Rogge, a German robotics researcher.

Although the space tourists have no prior spaceflight experience, they will go where no crew has gone before. The Dragon spacecraft will fly the astronauts over the planet’s polar regions at an altitude of around 265 to 280 miles (425 to 450 kilometers) above the ground, where they will fly a polar orbit at an inclination of about 60 to 90 degrees to the equator. If successful, Fram2 will go down in history as the first human crew to orbit Earth’s poles.

During the mission, the astronauts will perform 22 research studies “designed to help advance humanity’s capabilities for long-duration space exploration and understanding of human health in space,” according to SpaceX. The crew will attempt to take the first X-ray in space, perform exercise studies to maintain muscle and skeletal mass, and grow mushrooms in microgravity. The astronauts are also planning on studying the aurora-like phenomenon called STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), known for its hazy purple and green streaks across the sky.

Once back on Earth, the crew will exit the Dragon spacecraft “without additional medical and operational assistance, helping researchers characterize the ability of astronauts to perform unassisted functional tasks after short and long durations in space,” SpaceX wrote.

The Dragon crew vehicle being used for Fram2 previously flew SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission, which pulled off the first commercial spacewalk in history. SpaceX is not playing games with its private missions, which go way beyond your basic space tourism.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,United Gets FAA Approval for Starlink and Sets Date for Its Debut on Flights,https://gizmodo.com/united-gets-faa-approval-for-starlink-and-sets-date-for-its-debut-on-flights-2000583060,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:03 GMT","seUnited Airlines has been approved to begin operating flights with onboard Starlink satellite internet service. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the airline a certificate to operate the service on its fleet of Embraer 175 aircraft, with United expecting to install the SpaceX service on all 300 of the regional jets by the end of the year.

Starlink will be a free service for UnitedPlus members, which is essentially all passengers as the loyalty program is free to join. United and Starlink announced last year that the airline would outfit its entire fleet of more than 1,000 aircraft with Starlink in the next few years.

SpaceX has been on something of a tear recently, signing deals with numerous partners to offer Starlink beyond rural households, including partnering with T-Mobile and cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean. Beyond United, it has also signed deals to offer in-flight WiFi with Hawaiian and private jet operator JSX. The service is not expected to work well in densely populated areas as high-speed fiber is already available, and a singular Starlink satellite would likely not have enough bandwidth to serve many users simultaneously. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said Starlink would likely never be suitable in urban environments where high-speed internet access is already plentiful.

Starlink is expected to reach more than $11 billion in revenue in 2025, buoyed by government and commercial contracts. It helps essentially subsidize the cost of SpaceX rocket launches, as the company can send up new Starlink satellites with each payload.

Airlines are eager to offer the service as existing offerings from the likes of Gogo have been notoriously slow and unreliable, resulting in frequent complaints on social media from customers who pay $10-20 for a WiFi pass only to find the service does not work. Starlink can offer broadband-like speeds thanks to its constellation of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO), though latency is high due to the inherent nature of sending requests to space and back.

It is somewhat surprising that airlines are willing to eat the cost of providing Starlink service considering the business model of “unbundling” airline tickets and charging extra for each perk. It would be unsurprising to see airlines eventually throttle the service and upcharge for faster speeds.

Being associated with Elon Musk, Starlink comes with some baggage. Where the service has been able to supply crucial internet access in locations such as Ukraine, countries in Asia and Europe have expressed some reservations about relying on internet service controlled by a close confidant of President Trump.

Europe is developing its own Eutelsat alternative, while Taiwan has similarly been exploring other options out of concern regarding Musk’s ties to China for Tesla sales. In Canada, the province of Ontario recently canceled a $100 million Starlink contract in retaliation over U.S. tariffs.

Musk may be able to secure lucrative government contracts domestically—and the Treasury Secretary has pushed to use Starlink in the government’s rural internet access program—but his newfound influence is a double-edged sword. Musk’s empire is exposed to geopolitical conflict being so close to President Trump.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Common Side Effects Is as Trippy as It Is Brilliant,https://gizmodo.com/common-side-effects-is-as-trippy-as-it-is-brilliant-2000580940,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:45:46 GMT","Animation is justifiably praised as one of our most significant art forms. Talented writers infuse life into worlds of their own creation, reflecting our own, while artists capture the beauty and imperfections of our lives. If there were ever a time to commend a show for balancing comedy, anxiety, and artistry, it would be Adult Swim’s surreal animated series about a magic mushroom disrupting Big Pharma.

Common Side Effects, by co-creators Joe Bennett (Scavengers Reign) and Steve Hely (Veep, The Office, 30 Rock), asks a fleeting, shower-thought sort of question with sincerity: what if the world discovered a drug that could cure anything? Similar to a modern-day Prometheus, an animal-loving hippie named Marshall (Dave King) discovers blue mushrooms that have the ability to heal all physical injuries and ailments, including bullet wounds and dementia. For obvious reasons, pharmaceutical companies don’t want his discovery to go public, so they falsify records and frame him as a wanted criminal.

This leads him to confide in his former high school lab mate, Frances (Emily Pendergast). Unbeknownst to him, Frances works as the assistant to the head of Reutical Pharmaceuticals, whose inept CEO Rick (Mike Judge)’s job is riding on a new commercial drug. What follows is an intense and suspenseful cat-and-mouse manhunt where Marshall and Frances duck DEA agents, hitmen, and desperate everyday people for their life-changing drug whose mysterious side effects might not be worth the trouble in the long run.

What makes Common Side Effects a unique animated series is the earnestness of its themes, despite being such a weird-looking show. At one moment, it’s a dark espionage drama filled with political betrayals, undercover agents, and gruesome deaths. In the next, it’s a lively comedy where DEA agents groove to Harry Belafonte’s “Jump in the Line” and little alien dudes cartwheel with their booties out, all while its entire exhausted cast looks like walking bobbleheads. The show’s eerie-meets-zany tones should clash, but Common Side Effects finds harmony by balancing its spinning plates without losing focus on that burning question about what a miracle drug would do to the world.

At its core, Common Side Effects is a show that transcends conventional critiques of the United States healthcare system. Instead of relying on a simplistic premise where the heroes triumph over the evil corporation and spread the wealth, the show delves into a more nuanced and compelling narrative about how hope turns to despair. With each episode, Common Side Effects explores how the gravity of deciding what to do with a universal cure-all drug capable of eliminating copays, premiums, and debt-laden obstacles would wear down anyone trying to capitalize on it. Both the show’s protagonists and its scheming antagonists find themselves overwhelmed as they grapple with the immense responsibility that comes with holding the fate of the world in their hands.

Like Scavengers Reign, Common Side Effects is abound with lush and vivid background art; surreal, kaleidoscopic, fluid animation; and shocking violence—all working in concert with its suspenseful narrative. All of the above coalesces in a gut-wrenching finale that, thankfully, escapes its predecessor’s fate, leaving the possibilities of what lies in store for season two to cut even deeper into its gripping tale.

In a recent small clinical trial, microdoses of the psychedelic failed to significantly treat people’s ADHD.

Researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland conducted the study, published this month in JAMA Psychiatry. In people with ADHD, twice weekly low doses of LSD performed no better than placebo at improving their symptoms. The researchers are careful to note that LSD can still have benefits for other conditions such as depression, however.

Recreational psychedelic drugs like LSD, psilocybin, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) have started to show promise in medicine. Several studies have found that these drugs—in doses that clearly produce psychedelic effects—could be used to help treat difficult cases of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in conjunction with therapy. Some research has also suggested that even taking low doses of LSD, commonly called microdosing, can alleviate ADHD symptoms better than conventional treatments. But the Basel researchers say theirs is the first placebo-controlled trial of its kind to systematically examine this use of LSD.

The Phase IIa trial involved 53 people with diagnosed ADHD between the ages of 18 and 65. Over the course of six weeks, half were randomized to either receive a placebo or low doses of LSD twice a week. The dosage was 20 micrograms of LSD—below the recreational dose but at the upper limit of what could be considered microdosing, according to the researchers.

Participants in both groups reported improvements in their ADHD symptoms within two weeks of the study starting, but the LSD group didn’t fare noticeably better than the placebo group. Twenty micrograms of LSD can still cause mild acute psychedelic effects in people, the researchers note, and people who believed they were taking LSD did report a greater improvement than those who believed they were taking a placebo. But mostly everyone reported believing that they were in the LSD group, even in the placebo group, suggesting that the blinding was generally effective.

All in all, the findings point to LSD microdosing not having a tangible pharmacological effect on people’s ADHD symptoms. “The supposed subjective treatment benefit is therefore due to the expectation of a benefit and the placebo effect rather than the actual substance,” said lead study author Lorenz Müller in a statement from the university.

On the positive side, the researchers found that low-dose LSD was generally safe and tolerated. The results also don’t prove that LSD can’t be useful for other conditions, even at smaller doses. But this isn’t the first study to suggest the benefits of microdosing LSD are less substantial than people might assume. And while this study turned out negative, it’s an apt illustration of why placebo-controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for testing drugs.

Given how hopeful people are about the future of psychedelic therapy, rigorous research is all the more important, the study authors say. The discrepancy between their trial and earlier studies of LSD for ADHD “underscores the need for randomized placebo-controlled trials when validly assessing potential benefits of low-dose psychedelics that are likely prone to a placebo response and expectancy bias,” they wrote.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Magic: The Gathering Is Unbanning Cards In a New Experiment,https://gizmodo.com/magic-the-gathering-trial-unbans-pauper-wotc-2000582965,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","Over decades of competitive play, many a Magic card has either fallen out of valid use or been outright banned from official play altogether. But as Wizards of the Coast seeks to overhaul some formats of the games’ approach to potentially powerful cards, in one format it’s trying a new one entirely: unbanning cards on a limited-time basis to see whether or not they should remain banned.

[Update 3/31, 4.30PM ET: This post has been updated to clarify the nature of the trial unbannings in contrast to ways Magic has previously returned banned cards to different formats. io9 regrets the error.]

Today Wizards of the Coast announced two “trial unbans” for the Pauper format, Magic‘s common-cards-only competitive format that has been around for the best part of two decades at this point, but began being officially supported by a WOTC rules panel in 2022. High Tide—a blue card that lets its caster double up on resources for every Island resource they tap, and has been been banned since Pauper’s online and tabletop banlists were consolidated and unified in 2019, and Prophetic Wisdom—a colorless artifact banned in 2022 that players could pay a cost and tap to add any color of mana to their resource pool—will be the first cards to go under the trial period.

The trials will see High Tide and Prophetic Wisdom become legal until the next banning and restriction announcement by Wizards, and until then developers will examine and take feedback as to whether or not the cards should be re-banned or enter legality for Pauper going forward. Going forward, future potential unbans experimented by the format may not face a similar trial period. Although other Magic formats (like ones that operate on a rotation of legal sets for tournament play) will have cards unbanned as their respective sets go out of rotation, the trial format marks the first chance for these cards to return on a limited-time basis to solicit feedback from players, and to see if the effect of the unbanning aligns with Wizard’s expectations.

“No other format has really tried this, and we think Pauper is a great place to experiment. You should not expect to see this in any other formats, and it’s something the PFP [Pauper Format Panel] is specifically interested in and thinks Pauper can handle given the accessibility of building decks and the predominance of online play,” PFP member and Magic principle game designer Gavin Verhey said in the accompanying blog post explaining the decision.

Although Wizards has not tried unbanning cards from any of its Magic formats before this, the potential of the idea has been floated for years. But while, for now, Pauper is going to be the only format that experiments with the trial unbanning, the move comes in the wake of a significant amount of upheaval around banlists in one of the game’s other incredibly popular formats, Commander. Last year, Wizards formally dissolved Commander’s long-running community-led Rules Committee, after an uproar over banning the cards Dockside Extortionist, Jeweled Lotus, and Mana Crypt from Commander saw members of the CRC targeted with harassments and death threats.

Wizard’s direct control over the future of the Commander format, and an attempt to stabilize the community after the controversy, led to the creation of a new five-tier power system, Brackets, to encourage players to discuss the competitiveness of their decks. It also led to this year’s introduction of the “Game Changers” list, a series of powerful cards legal in the format, but the presence of one in more in your deck would define where they sat in the top three tiers of the new Bracket system. At the time, Wizards floated that while the Game Changers list wasn’t necessarily a future indicator of cards that were guaranteed to be going to be banned, it could potentially be an avenue for banned cards in the format to re-enter some form of competitive legality by being reverted to Game Changer status.

“[Game Changers] creates a nice half-step between the banned list and showing up everywhere. It also really helps ensure that you know what cards we have our eyes on so cards won’t feel like they’re banned out of nowhere in the future,” Verhey wrote in the blog post announcing the system at the time. “It also gives us a tool to unban cards to try them or nudge around cards without a ban needed. If a card shows up and is frustrating at casual tables but fine by competitive players, we can add it to the Game Changers list in an update to get it to the right place.”",gizmodo

And if there’s one thing they hate, it’s being held to account for those things. So this new rule from the Federal Aviation Administration is right in their wheelhouse: a recent change to the agency’s rules will make it easier for private jet owners to hide their registration information, potentially making it harder to identify and track their movement.

Under the FAA’s updated policy, aircraft owners will be able to request that ownership information, including the name and address of the person in possession of the jet, be made private and no longer publicly accessible via FAA services. Jet owners will be able to submit a request through the Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) to withhold registration information. And just in case the ask-out system isn’t enough, the agency is also “evaluating” potentially making personally identifiable information of private aircraft owners and operators private by default—no request necessary.

The change comes as part of a mandate under the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which gave the agency two years to develop a system that would allow private jet owners and operators to hide their personal information. The bill, which had bipartisan support and primarily focused on expanding the agency’s function and improving infrastructure, was signed into law by President Joe Biden in May 2024.

The update adds privacy for folks who like to gas up the jet and take off for a long weekend in the Galapagos Islands or wherever the wealthy like to vacation, but it will likely put a dent in the attempts to track the activity of celebrities and CEOs as they burn through fuel with disregard for its consequences.

Flight trackers enter the public eye every now and then, perhaps never with more fervent attention than when Elon Musk suspended the Twitter account @ElonJet shortly after purchasing the platform. The account simply published the flight activity of Musk’s jet, which severely irked the billionaire. At one point, Musk offered the account operator $5,000 to shut it down, which was rejected. The whole incident also gave us a very funny quote from Musk in which he claimed people sharing his flight details were posting his “assassination coordinates.”

Musk is far from the only celebrity who is likely happy to see the new privacy rules in place. Taylor Swift has taken significant heat over her PJ usage, going so far as to file a cease-and-desist against the operator of a flight tracker that logged her travels.

Celebs and CEOs have increasingly leaned on private flights in recent years, according to a 2024 study published in Nature, which found that folks with high net worth were increasingly using their jets for short flights. About half of all private flights were under 500km (about 300 miles), and emissions from private trips rose 46% between 2019 and 2023, according to the study. Similarly, a report from The Guardian found that private jets belonging to 200 wealthy folks made 44,739 trips in 2022, generating more carbon emissions than 40,000 average British citizens do over the course of a year.

The company later revealed that the flight was terminated shortly after liftoff, and the launch vehicle fell into the sea in a controlled manner. “Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,”Daniel Metzler, CEO and co-founder of Isar Aerospace, said in an emailed statement. “We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our Flight Termination System. We demonstrated that we can not only design and build but also launch rockets.”

With the launch, Isar became the first European space company to launch an orbital rocket from continental Europe. Its Spectrum rocket is designed to carry small and medium-sized satellites to orbit, with Germany being one of several European nations hoping to get in on the growing global industry of launching satellites. The industry is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX with its workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, launching more than 400 times over the past 15 years. French company Arianespace is also in the business of launching satellites, though it uses a spaceport in French Guiana, South America.

European countries have been struggling to keep up with the commercial space industry, with few options for launch vehicles. After cutting ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and subsequently losing access to Soyuz rockets, the European market has been anxiously waiting for the debut of Arianespace’s Ariane 6 as Europe’s next-generation rocket. Ariane 6 suffered numerous delays before finally launching on its inaugural flight in June 2024. It still wasn’t perfect, however, as the rocket’s second stage failed to raise its altitude and deploy two of its payloads. The rocket redeemed itself earlier this year, deploying a high-resolution reconnaissance satellite to orbit in March.

Evidently, the rocket business is hard. Isar Aerospace, however, has not been derailed by its less-than-ideal launch. The company is already planning the Spectrum rocket’s second and third launch, while analyzing the data gathered during the first flight to determine the root cause behind the fatal anomaly.

“Today, we laid the foundation to cater to the rising global demand for flexible satellite launch services. Now it’s time to analyze all data, learn, iterate and be back on the launch pad as soon as possible,” Metzler said.",gizmodo

This Experimental Drug Could Be a Game Changer,https://gizmodo.com/millions-share-a-deadly-genetic-heart-risk-this-experimental-drug-could-be-a-game-changer-2000582742,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:35:18 GMT","An experimental drug could be game-changing for millions of Americans with a higher genetic risk of cardiovascular disease. In clinical trial data published over the weekend, Eli Lilly’s lepodisiran was found to dramatically reduce people’s levels of a dangerous kind of cholesterol called lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a).

Eli Lilly announced the peer-reviewed results of its Phase 2 trial of lepodisiran on Sunday, which involved over 300 people genetically predisposed to high Lp(a). People taking the highest doses of lepodisiran experienced a 94% drop in Lp(a) levels up to a year later. The findings indicate that lepodisiran could soon become the first treatment of its kind for this common genetic risk factor.

The cholesterol in our bodies is transported through several different types of lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is often known as the bad kind of cholesterol since too much of it can raise the risk of plaque building up in our arteries (atherosclerosis), which then increases the chances of having heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular problems.

Lp(a) is a form of LDL that can similarly raise the risk of plaque buildup. But unlike classic LDL, Lp(a) levels are largely determined by our genetics, not lifestyle. It’s estimated that about one in five people worldwide are genetically predisposed to have high Lp(a), and there is no existing intervention that can reduce Lp(a)—at least for now.

Our genes contain the instructions needed for cells to produce proteins, but this only happens when the genes are expressed. Our bodies sometimes use a specific form of RNA to silence this expression of genes, called small interfering RNA (siRNA). In recent years, scientists have developed siRNA-based drugs that work on the same principle, such as lepodisiran. Lepodisiran inhibits the liver’s production of apolipoprotein(a), a key component of Lp(a).

In the phase 2 ALPACA trial, 320 people with high Lp(a) were randomly assigned to five conditions; three groups were given two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran at the start of the study and six months later in varying doses. Another group was given the highest dose of lepodisiran at the start of the study and a placebo six months later. And the last group only received placebo.

Everyone given lepodisiran experienced a reduction in Lp(a) compared to placebo. But those on the highest dose saw a drastic 94% reduction in Lp(a) by the six-month mark. People given only a single injection of the highest dose did experience a slight rebound in Lp(a) a year later (an overall 88% reduction), while people given two injections had a 95% reduction in Lp(a) a year later. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Phase 2 trials are primarily used to further test a drug’s safety and find its optimal dose. So there will need to be more research to confirm these findings. But coupled with the earlier data, lepodisiran appears to be generally safe, with no serious reported adverse events related to the treatment in this latest trial. And given how dramatic these results are, outside experts are understandably excited about the drug’s future.

“It’s remarkable,” Eric Brandt, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the study, told NBC News. “These drugs have the potential to nearly eliminate that lipoprotein.”

Eli Lilly has already started to enroll volunteers for its Phase 3 trial of lepodisiran. If the drug continues to perform as hoped, it could become the latest accomplishment for siRNA-based therapies. In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Novartis’ Leqvio as a LDL-lowering treatment for people with certain genetic conditions or poorly controlled atherosclerosis.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Poll Finds That 75% of Scientists Are Thinking About Leaving the U.S.,https://gizmodo.com/poll-finds-that-75-of-scientists-are-thinking-about-leaving-the-u-s-2000582743,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:20:32 GMT","A Nature poll of more than 1,000 scientists revealed that 75% of them are considering leaving the United States due to the uncertainties caused by the Trump administration’s slashing of federal and university funding.

Since the second Trump term began, it has slashed research funding to universities and federal agencies purportedly in the name of efficiency, potentially hamstringing the country’s ability to move the needle on scientific discovery.

The recent poll indicates that the administration’s actions may also imperil the country’s standing as an oasis for scientists fleeing uncertain or outright hostile attitudes abroad—consider Nobel Prize winners Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi, among many other scientists who flocked to the United States as fascist governments rose across Europe in the early 20th century. As the recent poll shows, the chilling effect may cause a brain drain as researchers across fields seek greener pastures elsewhere.

According to Nature, the numbers looking to leave were even higher among researchers early in their career, such as PhD students and postgraduate researchers. As the poll shows, 548 of 690 (79.4%) of postdocs are thinking about leaving, and 255 of 340 (75%) are weighing the decision. “Europe and Canada were among the top choices for relocation,” Nature says.

Many researchers who spoke to Nature indicated that they did not want to leave the U.S., but the administration’s attitudes made it clear that there would be better opportunities to conduct scientific research abroad.

Earlier this month, France’s Aix Marseille University said that several dozen scientists in the U.S. had responded to a call it put out offering safe harbor to Americans seeking to leave the country. The researchers who expressed interest were from institutions including Stanford, Yale, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, among others.

The second Trump administration has science objectives firmly in its crosshairs. Since January, the administration has reportedly laid off thousands of federal workers at agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Park Service (NPS), and cut funding across a wider swath of institutions and programs.

Assuming best intentions—just as a thought experiment, so suspend your disbelief—the administration is attempting to streamline the government by reducing wasteful spending, making U.S. agencies and institutions as efficient as possible in their pursuit of discovery.

You can now relieve yourself of those optimistic musings. The government’s directives have wreaked havoc on the efficiency of these institutions, according to experts who spoke to Gizmodo, and risk undoing years of progress at home and abroad.

But some of the cuts are also done in line with Project 2025, a conservative movement that seeks to aggressively cut back on environmental protections in the name of liberty and personal freedoms. So while some of the layoffs are purportedly driven by the bottom line, they are also in lockstep with the ideological framework of the administration.

This month, the Trump administration is considering cutting funding to domestic HIV prevention efforts—walking back the frankly credible agenda Trump outlined in his first term to combat HIV, with a goal of eradicating the virus domestically by 2030. It’s not clear who on HIV’s side has sway with the Trump administration, but they evidently have infectious appeal.

The funding changes are happening in lockstep with cultural shifts urged by the administration, especially through the White House’s eagerness to dismantle programs and language advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which has become a lightning rod in conservative circles as a boogeyman representing the “woke” agenda.

Last week, NASA Watch first reported that NASA’s “DEI Sanitation Squad” had removed graphic novels from the agency website that told the fictional story of the first woman to walk on the Moon. No woman has ever walked on the Moon, though the Artemis missions will change that—though it’s now less clear if that’s an agency priority.

If the United States wants to retain its stature as a bastion of scientific discovery, it must show the bright and budding minds stateside that there is opportunity for them to build their careers and become leaders in their fields. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has dispelled them of that notion, and it looks like it will continue with its agenda, full steam ahead.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Retro Anthology Freaky Tales Is a Fun but Fleeting Ride,https://gizmodo.com/retro-anthology-freaky-tales-is-a-fun-but-fleeting-ride-2000579793,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:30:37 GMT","Freaky Tales is set in 1987 Oakland, a fact it makes clear from its opening narration courtesy of Oakland rapper Too Short, whose raunchy ’87 track gives the film its title. And while that setting is a major part of all of its intertwined stories, its anthology structure evokes another era: the 1990s, specifically any chatty crime flick that came out in the wake of Pulp Fiction. That’s not to say Freaky Tales doesn’t have its own charms that almost make up for those too-familiar vibes.

And, this might be a nit-pick, but the first segment, “Strength in Numbers,” technically doesn’t take place in Oakland; its focal point is legendary music collective 924 Gilman, which any Bay Area music fan can tell you is in Berkeley. (I live in Oakland. Berkeley is very close, but still…) However, it’s hard to get upset when the thrust of the story is about punk kids kicking Nazi ass, as we follow Tina (Expats‘ Ji-young Yoo), Lucid (Avatar: The Way of Water‘s Jack Champion), and their friends putting aside their “no violence” ideals to fight the skinheads who’ve been targeting their hangout, as anthems of the era like “Rise Above” and “Ready to Fight” blast on the soundtrack.

After some animated enhancements and an aspect-ratio change, we move to “Don’t Fight the Feeling,” which introduces Entice (Normani) and Barbie (Ironheart‘s Dominique Thorn). They’re best friends who work at an ice-cream shop together, where they put up with a sleazy Oakland cop—Freaky Tales just refers to him as “the Guy;” he’s played by Ben Mendelsohn, reuniting with his Captain Marvel directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck—while sharing dreams of stardom. When they’re invited to a rap battle with Too Short (Demario “Symba” Driver plays the younger version of him, but Too Short himself pops up in one of Freaky Tales‘ many cool cameos), we see they absolutely have the talent required.

Then it’s time for “Born to Mack,” starring Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, Fantastic Four: First Steps) as a debt collector (of the scary, bone-breaking variety) who’s decided it’s time to retire now that he’s about to become a father. However, it will come as no surprise to the viewer that there’s no easy escape from a career spent in cahoots with villains, either from one’s boss or the people you’ve wounded along the way.

Finally, we get to “The Legend of Sleepy Floyd,” which without giving anything specific away is the segment that makes Freaky Tales genre enough qualify as an io9 movie. However, there are sci-fi teases throughout. Too Short’s voice-over makes mention of a strange green glow that permeated Oakland’s atmosphere over those fateful days in 1987, and we see it zapping along through the history that Freaky Tales both recreates and fictionalizes.

That embellishment comes to the fore most in this final story. Sleepy Floyd’s remarkable real-life run with the Golden State Warriors during the 1987 NBA playoffs weaves throughout the movie as characters keep tabs on the games. That’s either because they’re fans, or because, like “the Guy” and his crew, they’re plotting to rob the players’ mansions. Things take a turn with that latter scheme, and as Freaky Tales‘ trailer spoils, the movie’s version of Sleepy Floyd (Jay Ellis) is not just a gifted ballplayer, he’s also deadly accurate with a sword.

Though some excellent gore is served up by the end, Freaky Tales‘ ultimate takeaway is a little underwhelming. The movie shines when it’s showcasing its deep love for Oakland; multiple scenes transpire outside the city’s iconic Grand Lake Theatre, and there are sly references galore, including a few to a certain local kid turned movie star (“that guy from Splash who used to sell hot dogs at A’s games”) that lead to a fantastic payoff.

Its smaller, more personal moments are also notable; among the big names, Pascal brings gravitas and a wry sense of humor to what could’ve been a one-note character, and Mendelsohn does some outstanding scenery-chewing as a powerful dirtbag.

But the inevitable last-act crossover between the stories is unfortunately not as clever or satisfying as it could have been, and its big message that “Nazis are bad”—especially in the birthplace of the Black Panthers, as Freaky Tales reminds us—is obvious enough without dialogue explicitly addressing it.

Also disappointing is that the film’s most intriguing element, a new age learning center that weaves commercials throughout the film and fuels Sleepy Floyd’s glorious revenge rampage, goes mostly unexplored—especially since it seemingly also powers Freaky Tales‘ kooky green energy field, which feels plucked from the same source as 1984’s Repo Man.

That said, if you feel nostalgia for the neon-tinged ’80s, a time of video stores, mix tapes, pay phones, and subcultures drawn together by common interests, not internet influence—and you don’t mind if a movie makes a conscious choice to lean heavy on style over substance—Freaky Tales fits the bill with energy to spare.

It’s the kind of man who courses through the streets of the Bay Area or Brooklyn, a dude who fades into the background.

OpenAI launched the 4o model last week and made headlines at every news outlet by cribbing Studio Ghibli’s style. This week, we’re noticing that the large language model seems to have a “default” human being, thanks to a Substack post from AI researcher Daniel Paleka. It does this regardless of what style you ask for. Paleka asked for a manga self-portrait, a comic book self-portrait, and a tarot card version. The style would change, but the generic man stayed the same.

In his post, Paleka asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of itself as a human. It consistently generated images of a bearded non-threatening man. This is, of course, a parlor trick. ChatGPT is a machine, a collection of training data and words, and has no self-conception.

But what ChatGPT registers as a “default” human being is interesting. All computers carry the biases of the people who program them and AI systems are no different. Machine learning systems used to predict crimes and conduct facial recognition are famous for being biased against black people.

The systems are also sexist and perpetuate the stereotypes and biases that are fed into them as training data. If you want to see ChatGPT’s conception of itself as a human woman, you have to ask it for that specifically. If you just ask it to see itself as a “person,” it seems to default to a white dude.

In his post on the piece, Paleka put forward a few theories for why this is happening. He thought it could be “a deliberate choice by OpenAI to generate a “default person” to prevent generating images of real people, an OpenAI inside joke where they made GPT-4o’s self-image look like a particular person,” or “an emergent property of the training data.”

Of course, ChatGPT is a machine and should not be constrained by the weakness of the flesh. Gizmodo editor Alex Cranz asked how the AI would conceive of itself. “I might appear as a glowing, ever-shifting entity made of flowing data streams, flickering with bursts of knowledge and connections,” it replied. “Maybe a warm fusion of abstract AI core with a warm, approachable presence—something that feels futuristic and inviting.”

It then churned out this image, which looks like a nightmare attempting to become a culture Pixar creature. Like the LLM pasted Wall-E’s eyes on a sleep demon.

I asked ChatGPT the same thing and it gave me a different answer. “I’d say I conceive of myself as a kind of mirror and collaborator—part library, part conversational partner. I don’t have a consciousness or emotions, but I simulate understanding by recognizing patterns in language and context. So while I don’t have a self in a human sense, I adapt to the way you speak, what you ask, and how you engage with me.”

It asked me why I had asked and I ignored it. When I prompted it to draw me a picture it gave me this:

I find the divergent answers interesting. I don’t use LLMs unless I have to for work. I have software engineers in my life who use LLMs for a variety of reasons and have, sometimes, found them useful. I’m dubious and tend to think of these systems in the way ChatGPT described them here when I asked.

LLMs are a mirror that reflects the user and the programmer both. They aren’t AIs, not really. They’re a word calculator predicting what the user wants to hear based on what the programmer trained them on. Somewhere in that complex chain, the LLM got it in its data that a brown-haired white guy with glasses is what people want to see when they ask for a picture of ChatGPT as a person.",gizmodo

Visual Experience, Alexa-enabled

The Echo Show 5 is the perfect solution for anyone who desires to combine the functionality of Alexa with a visual experience. Although the Echo Dot or Spot can only handle voice interaction or the screen is smaller, the Echo Show 5 provides a superior experience with a 5.5-inch display and built-in camera. You can use the camera for video calls, monitor your security camera feed or even present your favorite photos. The touchscreen also allows you to control smart home appliances or watch movies.

This latest iteration of the Echo Show 5 (remember, there’s also a most premium Echo Show 8 which is almost double the price) features several improvements over its predecessors. It is preloaded with a new AZ2 Neural Edge processor that enhances voice recognition and machine learning which makes Alexa even more responsive and intuitive. It also provides better audio quality through a larger 1.75-inch driver that delivers more sound clarity and twice the amount of bass. It won’t compete with full-size speakers in range or depth, but it’s great for casual light music listening.

The Echo Show seamlessly integrates into any household setting: Its slender dimensions and round body are perfectly suited to residing on bedside tables, kitchen counters, or office desks. The flush-front screen adds a touch of modernity without compromising on actual functionality. The users can utilize the touchscreen to view recipes, control smart home devices, view security cameras, stream entertainment apps like Prime Video and Hulu, or video call. The built-in 2MP camera, however, is not unique compared to previous models and may be disappointing for those seeking high-quality video calling experiences.

The sale time is particularly suited for those who wish to redecorate their homes for spring or acquire new technology gadgets without needing to wait months for the next big discount window (Prime Day in July, Black Friday in November). As today marks the final day of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale, there’s no better moment to take advantage of this offer.

Since humans will no longer serve for a lot of things, or, to better say, they will be replaced in many tasks, our working week could shorten just two days a week. When? Within about ten years. Word of Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, Gigafilantropo with planetary and visionary concerns that has the fame of taking us well. Long eye capable of going forward of a quarter of a century: just think that in his 1999 book entitled In Italian Business at the speed of thought he had foreseen the arrival or evolution of services or gadgets such as (we mention in scattered order) virtual assistants at Alexa, smartphones, targeted advertising and online finance. In short, it is worth being the old William when he decides to outsource. After all, just book the Superweekend with free cancellation so as not to be found unprepared.

What will the work of the future be like

""How will the job be? Maybe we can only work two or three days a week?"" Gates asked himself by asking himself a rhetorical question during an episode of the Tonight Show on the NBC (you see it here, he talks about it around the 8th minute). It was not the first time: already a couple of years ago, at the first chatgpt vagites, the multimiliario had designed a similar scenario. That is, in which the standard will be the norm and in essence, most of the planet will have to - see - worry about what to do with, of all that free time to which few are used to. To the many fuffagurus that speak of time as the main wealth of our era will miss the earth under the feet, if this really will be the direction in which the companies will go (at least the most tertiary and developed from a digital and technological point of view).

Letters from Kirghisia

Seriously, the panorama imagined by Gates remembers a booklet released now over twenty years ago and signed by the director, poet and philosopher Silvano Agosti, entitled Letters from Kirghisia (the image Edizioni, 2004). Through ten missives he sent to his friends, Agosti tells of an imaginary man -friendly society, ""where everyone seems to manage their own destiny, and permanent serenity is not a utopia, but a real and common good"".

In Kirghisia, the problem of work, the main responsible for the tanning of the human being for how it was organized by the swing system, was resolved by reducing the daily hours to three. Agosti bet, at the time, on a horizontal part-time while Gates would apply, apparently, for a vertical one; In any case, the remaining twenty -one hours of the day would be dedicated by each to what most aggravates it: from rest to creativity passing through the children, life, love. And then home, books, cars, travel, newspaper, to mention Tiziano Ferro and a song from those years. Obviously in Kirghisia there are no productivity problems, which, indeed, marches great thanks to the fact that everyone goes to work happy and in an hour they produce as much as in one day in the old regime.

Not for everyone

Abandoning Kirghisia and returning to reality, however, we cannot help but notice that that of Gates is not a statement, as written by many newspapers, but a question. And, in some ways, it is a reality we are already experimenting on our skin: in some cases with some advantages, in others with a nice load of fears.

As for the number of students who can continue in the training course, the number of places will be decided on the basis of data in the hands of the Ministry of the University and that of Health.

To date, the unknown of how the national ranking will be drawn up: the government has in fact decided to postpone the matter to a specific decree.

One of the many problems relating to the abolition of the closed number to Medicine and this new admission model to university courses could be the strong disillusionment of students who are forced to change the faculties at the end of the first half after having invested energy to reach the credits and votes necessary to continue in the chosen university path.

The fears for employment

Doctors periodically oscillate between shortage and abundance, with phases that can last several years: the real challenge, for all governments, is to try to respond to the needs of the territories - which are currently in crisis - without creating problems of employment inflation. At the moment there is a phase of scarcity: open to everyone, albeit with reserve, could give substance, however, to the concerns of those who fear the pendulum in reverse. The associations underline, in fact, how the increase in available places could cause unemployment problems for future professionals.

As we said, the government is twelve months to complete the adoption of all the decrees necessary to implement the delegated law. Why do the rules need guidelines: for example, how will the rankings form? What will be the contents of the filter exams? Depending on the program, the difficulty of the selection can be paid, and it is not a fee that it has just been deciding on the matter. The executive explained the haste of the first, incomplete measure launched in the past days with the need to run the reform already from the next academic year. A method that pushed the university manager of the Democratic Party Alfredo D’Attorre to speak of ""propaganda mess"".

The problem of spaces

Then there is the problem of spaces. The professions subject to the reform (those of the area of ​​medicine and surgery, dentistry and veterinary) attract many students because of the good possibilities of employment, the earnings and the social status that accompanies them. It is predictable that many will be ""trying"" the first half: there are those who estimate 70 thousand aspirants every year. But where will they go and study? Universities are not equipped to hold this type of impact. For this reason, the first semester will not provide for compulsory frequency.

When will the exams take place?

And then there is the node-calendar: when will the exams take place? If, as trap, they will be held in December, the semester will effectively last three or four months. Are they sufficient for adequate preparation to pass the tests? Whoever protests is asked.

In short, the questions are many. What is clear is that, even if the ways remain these, there will be some years of transition in which aspiring professionals will have to deal with uncertainty.",wired
https://wired.com,"Free modem for fiber, the providers make a wall only for commercial issues?",https://www.wired.it/article/modem-libero-fibra-agcom/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","The modem is not yet ""free"" for fiber subscribers and for this reason the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has decided to take a position in the public consultation launched by AGCOM on the subject. As the historic resolution 348/18/Cons is well known, which in 2018 forced providers to predict modest-free subscriptions, in 2019 it was amended with a derogation for FTTH connections (Fibra-A-Casa) and Fixed Wireless. In 2023 then the placet also arrived for a certification on the Fiber terminals (ONT) to be used on TIM networks.

In that embryonic phase of the market, operators claimed that the equipment included in the season tickets would avoid standard and configuration problems, as well as for performance. Not to mention the possibility of remote management of any anomaly and greater guarantees on the quality of service and safety. In short, the fiber market was taking the first steps and a little caution could have helped growth, but today we speak of more than 5.5 million FTTH lines on a total of 19 million, and consequently the Guarantor wants to ""re -evaluate the current restrictions on the freedom of choice of the terminal equipment for Fthh and Fwa, based on the guidelines of Berec and taking into account the technological evolution and the market"". This explains why an regulatory process (which will end after 150 days) was started in February to define this last neuralgic detail.

Free Software Foundation Europe

The knot is in the box

The definition of the terminal point point is the element on which the comparison between those who want the freedom of modem (especially the producers) and those who prefer to keep things as they are (operators) are played. A bit like defining the border between the freedom of action (and by law) of the user and that of the provider - technically the border between private network and public network. The FSfe would like this point to coincide with the passive physical one, that is, the fiber cable that comes out of the mousse bolt.

To date, however, a derogation has been applied that allows you to identify this point with the so -called ont (Optical Network Terminal), or a box that welcomes the fiber cable that comes out of the wall, converts the signal from optical to electric and via the Ethernet door then allows the connection to a router. The problem is that over time the technological evolution has diversified the offer and some providers have started to adopt integrated ont modem router or an ONT bayonet (SPF) module that slips into modem-RPuter. In short, everything is a bit complicated, also because the providers themselves sometimes employ their network, others rent a heated network and other times still the network dull; And so the customer finds himself with different ""terminals"" while sharing the same operator.

The result of this situation is that it must be accepted what the provider imposes and also that a technician comes home and takes care of the installation and activation. So even if you could trivially proceed independently, you have to submit to these procedures and also accept the equipment provided.

“The main reasons that push internet service providers are mainly commercial interests. The issues involved are not only technological, but also commercial and investment"" Free Software Foundation Europe

FSFE: the derogations have no more reason to exist

Free Software Foundation Europe claims that from a technological point of view only the neutral approach guarantees the freedom of terminal devices. Whether we talk about fiber and fixed wireless. In addition, there would be no critical issues in relation to data security and protection, energy saving, compliance with the environment and they would also be ensured right to repair and eliminated any risk of loyal competition. The alleged interoperability problems between terminal equipment (ont and modem-router) seem to belong to another season, considering the analyzes and experiences of the Belgian, German and Dutch guarantees. The same goes for any further imposed certifications, unless ""it is self -certification or voluntary procedures"".

According to the Foundation, the reasons that push operators to block are exclusively commercial and relating to the huge investments supported for the development of the networks.

A detail that should make reflecting is that the foundation from 2013 to today has followed the regulatory processes in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Belgium, where in the end there was also liberalization on fiber. The latest case was that of Germany, where operators asked the Bnetza Guarantor to ""completely limit the possibility of end users to choose their own router or separate the optical fiber terminal (ont), so that personal routers could only be used in Bridge mode"". The proposal was rejected by disassembling the overestimation of safety risks, stamping the alleged disorder scenarios like improbable and downsizing the theme of interoperability.

The hope in extreme synthesis, for the producers, is that Agcom welcomes the objections and also grant FTTH and FWA the freedom of choice of equipment for FTH and Fwa.",wired

Today the startup Zhipa Ai presented its new free artificial intelligence agent, confirming how much the Chinese market in the sector is becoming competitive. According to what was announced by the CEO Zhang Peng during a lunch in Beijing, the Autoglm Rumination agent is able to carry out in -depth research and to complete more complex activities such as travel planning or the drafting of research relationships.

To respond to users' requests quickly and efficiently, the new Chinese agent is powered by two models developed by Zupi Ai: the GLM-Z1-AIR reasoning model, capable of ensuring the same performance as the DeePseek competitor R1-while working up to eight times faster and requesting only a thirtieth of computer resources-and the GLM-AIR-0414 model. The new Chinese artificial intelligence agent, therefore, arrives on the market, proving to be decidedly competitive compared to the Deepseek and Manus competitors, marketed by the company of the same name as the first general artificial intelligence agent in the world. But while Manus will ask users to pay $ 199 dollars a month to use his agent Ai, Zupi Ai promised that he will make Autogml automation available for free through the official channels of the company, including the official AI website and its mobile app.

Zupi Ai has not recently gone unnoticed, since three consecutive cycles of funding supported by the Chinese government was ensured in just one month. And recently he said that his GLM4 linguistic model exceeds the GPT-4 competitor from different points of view. In short, the Chinese startup wants to attract the attention of investor and users all over the world, launching itself to conquer a sector that already seems too competitive, in China and beyond.",wired
https://wired.com,Like Greenland and its rare lands have become the last ground of geopolitical clash,https://www.wired.it/article/groenlandia-terre-rare-geopolitica-trump-cina/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:50:00 GMT","Today the control of the rare lands market is firmly in the hands of China, who is responsible for 70% of global production. As the renewable energy revolution and the greatest diffusion of electric vehicles, the world will require an increasing amount of these metals. Between 2020 and 2022 the total value of the rare lands used every year in the energy transition has quadrupled, and according to the projections should increase by ten times by 2035. According to the common research center of the European Commission, by 2030 Greenland could provide almost 10 thousand tons of lands' oxides with the global economy.

A way to satisfy this question, diversify the market and accelerate the adoption of clean energies is to extract in Greenland (in other words - irony of fate -, to avoid the future dissolution of the ice we could be forced to exploit the resources that emerged thanks to the loss of ice caused by the climate crisis). Currently the mining companies are starting to drill in the territories now without ice on the margins of the island; And the United States does not want to stay out.

But anyone who does not see the time to quickly transform Greenland into a huge mine of rare lands will have to deal with a harsh reality. Even more than in other parts of the planet, mineral exploitation on the island is an extremely long and complicated company from a logistical, geopolitical and economic point of view. And it involves inevitable environmental consequences, such as the pollution and alteration of wildlife.

The aggressive rhetoric of the Trump administration has mainly frightened the Native Greenish populations, which represent 90% of the residents and have undergone a long and brutal colonization, marked by displaced and forced sterilizations (to which must also be added waves of fatal diseases). ""It was a shock for Greenland - said Aqqaluk Lynge, former president of the Circumpolare Inuit and co -founder of the political party inuit ataqatigit -. They look at us as people who can be thrown away"".

Not having the resources to invest directly in the extraction of rare lands, the Greenland government is granting licenses for exploration. ""We have all critical minerals. Everyone wants them-said Jørgen T. Hammeken-Holm, permanent secretary for mining resources of the Greenland government-. The geological aspect is really exciting, but there are many 'but'.""

China domain on rare lands

In reality, the so -called rare lands and are not particularly rare. Our planet is scattered with these resources, which however are distributed in a little practical way. To extract small quantities of praseodimio, neodimio or any other of the 15 elements classified as rare lands, miners must work a lot of rock. This makes minerals very difficult to extract and refine: for each ton of rare lands brought to light, 2,000 tons of toxic waste are generated.",wired

https://wired.com,Marine Le Pen condemned and ineligible. Who is the leader of the French far right,https://www.wired.it/article/chi-e-marine-le-pen-condannata/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:02:10 GMT","Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far right, was sentenced at first instance by the Criminal Court of Paris for embezzlement of European public funds and declared inaccible for five years. A sentence that, if confirmed, could upset the plans of the Rassemblement National, today the main political force in France. In the early legislative elections of June 2024, the party had in fact obtained 32% of the consents, establishing itself as the first of the country. The Court has inflicted a four -year prison sentence in Le Pen, two of which to be served under house arrest, as well as a fine of 100 thousand euros. According to the accusation, supported by the Paris Prosecutor, between 2004 and 2016, Le Pen and another eight MEPs of his party would have used funds intended for European parliamentary assistants to finance political activities by the Rassemblement National in France. In practice, salaried people with European Union funds to work on the European Parliament would instead have operated for the party. The amount of the alleged fraud is estimated at around 2.9 million euros. The President of the Court has ordered the immediate application of the inadmissibility measure, without waiting for the outcome of the appeal process. Consequently, the Pen will decay with immediate effect from the office of deputy to the National Assembly and, if the sentence is not overturned, it will not be able to apply for the presidential elections of 2027. Even if the defense has already announced an appeal.

This sentence is part of an already extremely tense political climate: after the earthquake of the 2024 European Championships, Macron had dissolved the national assembly and convened early elections in an attempt to stem the rise of the far right. The vote, however, produced a fragmented parliament, with the Rassemblement National as the first party but without absolute majority, and a fragile coalition government with difficulty in governing. The leaving the scene of Le Pen could once again put out the balance, leaving the party without a clear guide and opening the way to a possible reorganization of the French right.

Who is marine le pen?

Marine Le Pen was born in 1968 and is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who in 1972 founded the front National, a far-right party who gathered several French nationalist currents, long left on the margins of political life until his rise in the 1980s, and then consolidated in the nineties and reaching a historic affirmation in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen arrived at the Pen. presidential ballot against Jacques Chirac. Marine has grown ""breathing"" politics since childhood and joined the father's party in 1986. Her political ascent culminated in 2011, when she was elected president of the party. From that moment he has started a process of ""dédiabolisation"" (literally ""dedialization""), a political strategy aimed at making the Front National more acceptable in the eyes of the moderate electorate, trying to remove the party from the most controversial positions that had characterized the paternal management. In 2015 he made the controversial decision to expel his same father from the party following anti -Semitic statements that had aroused controversy. In 2018 he completed this transformation by changing the name of the party from Front National to Racconvento National, a strategy that led it to obtain more and more consensus. In these years Marine Le Pen has participated three times in the presidential elections, with progressive growth results. In 2012 he arrived third with 17.9% of the votes. In 2017 he arrived at the ballot (the second French electoral round in which the two most devoted candidates in the first round challenge) against Emmanuel Macron, obtaining 33.9% of the votes. In 2022 he again challenged Macron to the ballot, improving his percentage with 41.5% of the votes, equal to over 13 million voters. According to the latest polls, his party turns out to be the most popular political formation in France, with over 30% of the voting intentions, more than Macron's party. Before today's sentence, Marine Le Pen was considered one of the favorites for the presidential elections of 2027.

Marine Le Pen's political ideals

The political positions of Marine Le Pen can be traced back to three main strands: nationalism, economic protectionism and restrictive policies on immigration. It is considered Eurosceptic, contrary to the euro and NATO. It supports the principle of ""national priority"", according to which French citizens should have precedence in accessing work, popular housing and social services compared to immigrants. In Economy he proposes a protectionist model, with the separation between investment banks and commercial banks and the opposition to the privatization of public services. Le Pen was the subject of debate for the alleged ties with Russia: in 2014 it emerged that his party had received a loan of 9 million euros from a Czech-Russian bank, a circumstance that fueled discussions on party relations with Moscow. Her political orientation led her to have affinity with leaders such as Viktor Orban in Hungary and Matteo Salvini in Italy.

What happens to the party now?

The first instance sentence is obviously not definitive. Le Pen has the possibility to appeal on appeal and, if it were to obtain a favorable sentence before 2027, it could still apply for the next presidential elections. However, the French judicial machine is notoriously slow and there is no guarantee that the appeal process ends in time for the electoral deadline. In the event of confirmation of the sentence, the Rassemblement National should identify a new presidential candidate. The most frequently mentioned name is that of Jordan Bardella, a 28 -year -old young politician who since 2021 has held the position of president of the party. Bardella was designated by Le Pen to lead the movement while she concentrated on the presidential campaign of 2022. She is considered the leading exponent of the new party generation, with a strong consensus between the youth electorate. If Bardella became the candidate of the Rassemblement National for the presidential elections, it would be the first time since 1974 that the party has not presented a member of the Le Pen family as a candidate for the maximum office of the state.",wired

According to the reconstruction of the Corriere della Sera, the aircraft would have made five steps in the last month above this strategic structure located in Ispra, on the Lombard bank of the lake, in the province of Varese.

Russian drone on Lake Maggiore, what happened?

The report came directly from the Research Center, which has an experimental system for detecting unknown aircraft. According to experts, the drone would be of Russian manufacture and could be equipped with instruments for making three -dimensional mappings of the structures, but the safety sources recommend ""maximum caution"" on its attribution, since it would be a model with limited autonomy, which suggests a take -off from a relatively close area and not a direct flight from Russia. Meanwhile, the Milan prosecutor has already started the preliminary investigations and prepares to formally open an investigation with the hypothesis of an espionage crime. The case is particularly sensitive also due to the presence, near the center, of some plants of Leonardo, the Italian flagship company in the defense sector. The area is considered to be of high strategic interest by the Italian state and potential target of foreign intelligence operations.

What is and what does the Joint Research Center do?

The Joint Research Center in Ispra, founded in 1957, represents the third largest research center of the European Commission after those of Brussels and Luxembourg, and is considered one of the main research campus in Europe. Located in a country of just 5 thousand inhabitants on the left bank of Lake Maggiore, it is equipped with cutting -edge workshops and infrastructures operating in numerous strategic areas, including nuclear safety, energy efficiency, climate change and space.

Among the most important structures in the center are the Waterlab, which analyzes the presence of chemicals harmful in the water, the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI), already active since the seventies and committed to defining the standards for photovoltaics at European and world level, and the crisis room (ECML), where scientists monitor the possible natural disasters with the satellites of the Copernicus program in order to study earthquakes, fires, floods and landslides, trying to anticipate potential catastrophes and supporting the Member States in the management of emergencies.

Why is it an important case for national security?

At the moment, the anti -terrorism pool of the Milan prosecutor's office, directed by Marcello Viola, from the addition Eugenio Fusco and the prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis, is investigating the matter. The latter has a specific experience in cases of Russian espionage: in recent weeks he has in fact asked for indictment for two entrepreneurs of 34 and 60 years old, owners of a real estate company in Brianza, who would have made themselves available to the Russian intelligence, also in exchange for cryptocurrencies, for activities of alleged espionage. At the moment there are no connections between this procedure and the flying drone of the Russian drone on the ISPRA area, but investigators will carry out checks to exclude any connections.

Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic (Copasir) would be carefully following the evolution of the situation, but would be oriented to acquire greater elements before ordering insights on the case. Safety experts highlight how attacks on research centers and strategic structures represent a growing threat in the current geopolitical context, all the more with the intensification of the conflict in Ukraine and the tensions between Russia and NATO countries. Moreover, the presence of a potentially spy drone capable of mapping structures of European and national relevance, in an area that also houses establishments in the defense sector, constitutes an alarm bell that the Italian authorities cannot afford to underestimate.",wired

The controversy with Anthropic

The controversy began in October 2023 when Universal Music Group, Concord, Abkco Music & Records and several associated had mentioned Anthropic to claiming that copyright protected texts had been used for the training of Claude in violation of their rights; With the right prompt - in fact - Claude users could obtain almost identical copies of the works of the works. The Publishers had therefore requested a preliminary injunction to ban anthropic to the use of their works for training its models, claiming that the company had violated the copyright of over 500 worldwide songs and artists of the caliber of the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift.

The decision to reject the preliminary injunction is based on the failure to demonstrate by the owners of the rights, of a concrete economic or reputational damage deriving from the use of the texts by Anthropic Ai. This pronunciation opens, therefore, a reflection on the perimeter of the ""fair use"" discipline in the United States, suggesting that the use of copyright covered materials to train AI systems could fall into the category of lawful use, provided that the main purpose of artificial intelligence is to generate original content and not fully reproduce existing ones.

In the United States, therefore, this decision could facilitate access to a wide range of copyright protected content for technological companies, accelerating innovation, but at the same time raises many concerns between the authors and publishers, since it risks weakening the protection of copyright and generating a loss of control over the spread of their content.

In Italy and Europe

This time no. Bigster arrives on the market with the same decisive attitude, the same plastic force, the same muscle sobriety of the concept. Promise kept.

And it is no small thing in an era when concept cars seem more biennial installations than real production preambles. Bigster breaks this scheme and does so with a clear choice: pragmatic design, with clear geometries, smooth surfaces and proportions of silent hard. The tall and vertical front, the front and rear headlights pushed at the ends, the horizontal hood but nerboruto for maximum visibility: everything is designed to last, to accompany, not to amaze.

Video New Dacia Bigster - Music by Sergii Pavkin From Pixabay.

The details also speak the Dacia language: a mix between roughness and post-gram style, between functional robustness and a denim jacket elegance and well-polished shoes. The bi-tono finish of the roof, the 19 ""rims, the Indigo Blue exclusive tint are calibrated touches, never exhibited. The choice to avoid shiny black, so abused in the contemporary automotive, for a more resistant opaque/lucid mix, is a declaration of independence with ephemeral fashion.

Inside, the discussion continues. The design resumes the essential lines of the outside with a vertical dashboard, well -integrated 10 ""screens and real space, not only perceived. There are no pindaric flights, but rational choices that focus the habitability, visibility, functionality. Three different textures for plastics, resistant fabrics, refrigerated rooms, wireless recharges: everything is back.

The best price/performance ratio

The real revolution today passes through intelligent simplification. And Dacia understood this before the others. Bigster with its 4 meters and 57 centimeters arrives in a crowded segment, that of the C-SUVs, with a proposal that is not measured only in euros but in perceived, concrete, measurable value. The Claim Best Value for Money, that is, the best value for the money spent is a perfect synthesis. The older sister of Dacia Duster offers everything that matters: habitability at the top of the category, a trunk that can reach 702 liters (depending on the motorization) with intelligent access, pushed modularity, bi-zone air conditioning, connected multimedia systems, complete Adas technology. Long family trips - or the weekends from urban nomad - return to being a functional and relaxed experience, even for more modest budgets.",wired

The news of the incident was leaked last March 24, when the security experts noticed that the data set was on sale in a forum in the Dark Web, and was confirmed by the company a few days later, with an email that confirmed to users the violation and commitment of EPRICE in trying to resolve the situation in the shortest possible time, so as to avoid compromising its privacy and security.

Among the data subtracted from the systems of the e-commerce platform, in fact, there is information of all kinds: names, surnames, email addresses, telephone numbers, delivery addresses, orders details and even articles left in the cart without being purchased. Fortunately, however, in the data set it seems that financial information or credit cards data does not appear, which somehow reassures security experts. Despite this, to date the data are still on sale on BreachForum, a criminal forum of the Dark Web, where they are published by a user known as Alcxtraze, which would seem to be a rather esteemed cybercriminal on the international scene. A detail that would seem to confirm the violation of ePrice.

EPRICE's communication

What will happen to the data of the over 6.7 million users - of which many Italians - subtracted from the ePrice systems? To answer this question is the same company, which in a communication sent to its customers makes it known that he immediately activated a team of security experts aimed at resolving the situation, trying to contain the damage. ""These specialists are leading an in -depth investigation to analyze events and evaluate the validity of the published data"", reads the EPRICE email.

""The absolute priority is to ascertain the authenticity of the published data and understand how they were obtained - he continues -. We are working to contain the situation and prevent further damage. We are collaborating strictly with the competent authorities and following all the necessary legal procedures. We have implemented additional security measures to strengthen our defenses and protect the data of our customers"". EPRICE's advice to its users, therefore, is to update the access credentials to the Site and give a lot of attention to the emails received from the platform, because they could be sent to them by the criminals in possession of the data.

https://wired.com,We share the hormone that regulates the appetite with the stars and which is 500 million years old,https://www.wired.it/article/ormone-che-regola-appetito-bombesina-stelle-marine/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:20:45 GMT","It has an ancient evolutionary history, much more than what has been thought so far. It is the bomber, the hormone that regulates the appetite, inducing the sense of satiety. This was demonstrated by the biologists of Queen Mary University in London who discovered how its history has not started with human beings or mammals, but over 500 million years ago and, therefore, long before the vertebrates evolved on earth. Their study, recently published in the Procedings of the National Academy of Sciences magazine, suggests that it would even go back to the antense that we have in common with starfish.

The hormone that regulates the appetite

Isolated for the first time by the Italian pharmacologist Vittorio Erspamer in 1971 by the skin of the Anuri Bombina Bombina, from which it takes its name, the Bomber is a neurormone that plays a key role in the regulation of hunger, reporting when we ate enough. In fact, from the experiments, it emerged that when injected into mammals, the bomber reduced the size of the meal and increased time between meals, bringing scientists to the conclusion that neurormones similar to the bomber, produced in the brain and in the intestine, made part of the system that controls food intake. To date, together with drugs that induce weight loss such as the Ozempic, potential molecules are under development that imitate the action of the bomber for the treatment of obesity.

The evolutionary origins

To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the hormone that regulates the appetite, the authors of the new study analyzed the genomes of some invertebrates, discovering the genes that codify neurormones similar to the bomber in the starfish (Asterias Rubens) and in other echinoderms, such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers. By focusing on the neurmone of the starfish, called Arbn, the researchers studied its molecular structure, functioning and in what way it influenced the food behavior of these animals. In fact, starfish have a unique way of eating: they overturn the stomach out of the mouth to digest their prey. ""When I tested the ARBN, I saw that it caused the contraction of the starfish stomach,"" reported the co-author Weiling Huang, explaining that the neurormone is involved in the stimulation of the retraction of the stomach when marine stars stop feeding. ""That's exactly what I discovered. When I injected the Arbn in the starfish with the inverted stomach, it triggered the retraction of the stomach in the mouth,"" the expert clarified.

Applications

The discovery of the ancient function of the hormone that regulates appetite therefore helps us to shed light on the evolutionary origins of food behavior in animals. ""We can deduce that this function dates back to half a billion years ago, to the antense common of starfish, human beings and other vertebrates,"" commented Maurice Elphick, who led the study. In addition to the development of new weight loss drugs, the results of this study could also have other practical applications. ""One of the consequences of climate change is that some species of starfish are invading the colder waters where molluscs are grown for human consumption,"" concluded the expert. ""Discovering molecules that inhibit nutrition in starfish could be useful to manage these invasions"".",wired

While the world outside the most spied house in Italy evolves rapidly, inside its walls we continue to tell the same story and to perpetuate a representation of the Italian society that seems stopped in the 90s.

This year, however, something extraordinary happened, and two gold opportunities were wasted with a better cause of the best cause: the innovative potential of Zeudi di Palma and the global phenomenon ""Zelena"".

Big Brother vs. Big Brother: a format, many souls

To fully understand the magnitude of the lost occasion, it is necessary to take a step back and contextualize the peculiarity of the Italian version of the format compared to its international counterparts. While abroad the Big Brother focuses more on the appearance of social engineering of the game and on the inclusion of different experiences and individuality, the Italian version has gradually turned into a sort of soap opera with ""real"" protagonists.

The Italian GF is now practically interchangeable with other ""pairs games"" by Mediaset such as ""Men and Women"" and ""Temptation Island"": narratives and cast go from one program to another as in a system of communicating vases. A system that of default sacrifices the complexity of human experiences and dynamics in favor of a simplistic, stereotyped and strongly heterroned representation: women in constant competition between contending for male attention, hyper-Palestrate men and more or less healthy bearers of patriarchate, totally futile and artificially inflated interpersonal conflicts.

Although over the years the GF has included in the cast characters belonging to the LGBTQ+ community (including Tommaso Zorzi, winner of the Gfvip5, or Eva Grimaldi and Luca Calvani in this last edition), has never really involved them in Ship and organically represented love dynamics and/or normalized inside the house. Indeed, these characters have often dressed the role of ""court jesters"" (as in the case of Cristiano Malgioglio or Mattia Fumagalli), of good -natured and ascetic paternal figures (Luca Calvani in this last edition), or have in any case been relegated to stereotyped roles that do not represent the complexity of quers. Tommaso Zorzi himself, winner of the 2020-2021 VIP edition, lived in the house the classic script of impossible love destined to remain platonic friendship for his straight friend.",wired
https://cnet.com,"It's not just the weather forecast ""177"" -- NTT's service that everyone knows will end today (31st)",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231158/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:06:00 GMT","NTT East and NTT West will end their provision of the weather forecast dial ""177"" today (March 31, 2025).

177 is a service that lets you hear the weather information of the area you send by dialing ""177"" on a landline phone.

It was first released in 1955, but with the spread of television and the Internet, the means of checking weather information has become more diverse. Furthermore, landline telephone usage has also decreased, and the number of users has decreased significantly. As this trend continues in the future, we have decided to end the offering.

● ""Paper Town Page"" and ""No. 104""

NTT East and West will also end its offering ""Paper Town Pages"" and number information service ""104"" as of today.

The paper town page was published as a ""Telephone Subscriber Name Table"" at the same time that the phone was opened in 1890. After that, they were divided into ""professional phonebooks"" and ""50-tone phonebooks"", and in 1983 they were nicknamed ""Townpages"" and ""Hello Pages."" However, with the spread of the Internet, phone number searches using computers and smartphones have become more common. Hello Page was discontinued in 2023.

According to the official, the number of advertisements on paper townpages fell by about 94% in 2023 compared to its peak in 2000. On the other hand, as of 2023, it accounted for about 77% of NTT East and West's paper usage, and the abolition will reduce the environmental impact.

Also, from April 1st, you can search for phone numbers on the ""i-Town Page"" online. iTownpage was renewed in the fall of 2024 and has been reborn as a more convenient service.

Like the phone book, No. 104 was also available in 1890, and computer guides began in 1986. Meanwhile, the number of users peaked in 1989, but fell 99% in 2023.

●Continue with Braille phone books and more

In addition, we will continue to provide the ""Braille Phonebook"" and ""Enlightenment Guide"", which provides voice-information with telephone numbers for people with disabilities.

https://cnet.com,"AI experts also say carefully, and the solution to ""halcination"" and AGI realisation is far away",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230971/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","生成人工知能（AI）チャットボットは間違いが多いことで知られている。GoogleのAIの提案に従って、ピザのレシピに接着剤を加えたり、健康のために石を1日に1、2個食べたり、なんてことをしている人がいなければよいのだが。こうしたエラーはハルシネーションと呼ばれる。生成AIモデルがでっち上げた情報のことだ。今後、生成AIはもっとよくなるのだろうか。AIの研究者でさえ、それがすぐに実現するという楽観的な考えは持っていない。

これは、25人のAI専門家で構成される委員会が実施した調査で明らかになったことの1つだ。この調査結果をまとめたレポートが、人工知能学会（Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence：AAAI）によって3月に発表された。このレポートでは、同学会に所属する会員400人以上を対象に調査も行っている。

AIは数年（聞く人によっては数カ月という場合もある）もすれば改良できるという誇大宣伝を目にした人もいるだろうが、そうした宣伝とは対照的に、学者と業界の専門家で構成されるこの委員会は、AIツールが進歩する速度について、もっと慎重な見方をしているようだ。AIの進歩というのは、事実を正しく把握することや、突拍子もない間違いを避けることだけではない。

人間の知能と同等、またはそれを上回るモデル（一般に人工汎用知能と呼ばれる）を開発するつもりなら、AIツールの信頼性を劇的に向上させる必要がある。研究者らは、そうした規模の改善がすぐに実現する可能性は低いと考えているようだ。

カーネギーメロン大学でコンピューターサイエンスの教授を務め、委員会のメンバーでもあるVincent Conitzer氏は筆者に対して、「われわれは、少し慎重になりがちで、何かが実際にうまくいくまで信じない傾向がある」と語った。

AIの急速な進歩

このレポートの目的は、人々を助けるテクノロジーを生み出すAI研究を支援することだ、とAAAI会長のFrancesca Rossi氏は序文で述べている。信頼性と確実性の問題は深刻である。正確な情報を提供することだけでなく、バイアスを回避することや、未来のAIが意図しない重大な結果を招くのを防ぐことにも影響を及ぼすからだ。「責任ある方法でAIを進歩させて、テクノロジーの進歩が人類の進歩を支え、そしてテクノロジーの進歩が人間の価値観に沿ったものになるように、皆で協力して責任ある方法でAIを発展させていかなければならない」（Rossi氏）

特にOpenAIが2022年に「ChatGPT」を発表して以来、AIの急速な進化は目覚ましいものがある、とConitzer氏は言う。「いくつかの点では驚異的であり、その機能も、こうした技術の多くで、ほとんどの人が考えていたよりもはるかに優れている」（同氏）

コーネル大学でコンピューターサイエンスの助教授を務めるJohn Thickstun氏は筆者に対し、AI研究には、「誇大宣伝もうなずける」分野もあると語った。これが特に当てはまるのが数学と科学の分野で、こうした分野ではユーザーはモデルの結果を確認することができる。

「このテクノロジーは素晴らしい。この分野で働いて10年以上になるが、このテクノロジーがここまで進歩したこと、そして、その進歩のペースが非常に速かったことに衝撃を受けている」とThickstun氏は話す。専門家によると、これほど目覚ましい進歩を遂げてきたにもかかわらず、研究や検討に値する重大な問題がまだ残っているという。

事実を正しく伝えられるようになるのか

生成AIモデルから得られる情報の信頼性の向上については、ある程度の進歩が見られるものの、改善の余地はまだまだある。Columbia Journalism Reviewが先日発表したレポートによると、チャットボットが正確に答えられない質問への応答を拒む可能性は低く、誤った情報を自信ありげに提供し、その誤った主張を裏付けるために情報源をでっち上げる（そして、捏造したリンクを提示する）という。

信頼性と正確性の向上は、「今日のAI研究で最も重要な分野であることは間違いない」とAAAIのレポートには記されている。レポートでは、AIシステムの正確性を高める主な方法として、人間のフィードバックによる学習の強化といったファインチューニング、システムが特定の文書を収集して、そこから回答を取得する検索拡張生成（RAG）、そして、プロンプトが質問を小さなステップに分解して、AIモデルがハルシネーションの有無をチェックできるようにする思考連鎖（CoT）、の3つが挙げられている。

こうした方法で、チャットボットの応答の正確性はすぐに上がるのだろうか。その可能性は低い。レポートによると、「事実性の問題は解決にはほど遠い」という。調査対象者の約60％は、事実性と信頼性の問題がすぐに解決するとは考えていない。生成AI業界では、既存のモデルをスケールアップすることで、正確性が増し、ハルシネーションが減るという楽観的な見方が広がっていた。

「希望はいつも少し楽観的すぎたと思う」とThickstun氏。「ここ数年、本当に正確で事実性の高い言語モデルの登場がすぐそこまできているという証拠は1つも見ていない」

Conitzer氏によると、Anthropicの「Claude」やMetaの「Llama」のような大規模言語モデルは、間違いが多いにもかかわらず、自信を持って回答を提示するので、ユーザーはそれらのモデルの方が正確だと誤解してしまうことがあるという。

「自信満々で答える人や、自信に満ちあふれた言葉を目にすると、私たちはその人が正しいことを言っていると思い込んでしまう。AIシステムも、かなり自信を持って提示した回答が、実はまったくナンセンスだったということもあるかもしれない」（Conitzer氏）

AIの適切な使い方とは

生成AIの限界を認識することは、生成AIを適切に使用する上で不可欠である。ChatGPTやGoogleの「Gemini」といったモデルのユーザーに対するThickstun氏のアドバイスはシンプルだ。「必ず結果を確認すること」

同氏によると、一般的な大規模言語モデルは、事実に基づく情報を一貫して取得する能力が低いという。大規模言語モデルに質問をしたときは、念のためその答えを検索エンジンで調べるといいだろう（検索結果ページに表示されるAIによる概要には頼らないこと）。どうせ検索エンジンを使うのなら、最初からそうした方がよかったかもしれない。

Thickstun氏によると、自身がAIモデルを使用する場面としては、情報をまとめた表のフォーマット設定やコードの記述など、自分でもできて、正確性を確認できるタスクを自動化する作業が最も多いという。「より大きな原則としては、私はこうしたモデルが最も役立つのは、自分でもやり方が分かっている作業を自動化するときだと思っている」

人工汎用知能はもうすぐ登場するのか

AI開発業界の優先事項の1つが、人工汎用知能（AGI）と呼ばれるもの作り出す競争であることは明白だ。AGIとは、一般的に人間と同等かそれ以上の思考能力を持つモデルのことである。AAAIの調査では、AGIをめぐる競争について、確固たる意見があることが明らかになった。特に注目したいのは、4分の3以上の回答者（76％）が、大規模言語モデルなどの現在のAIテクノロジーをスケールアップしても、おそらくAGIを作り出すことはできないだろうと考えている点だ。大多数の研究者は、AGIを目指す現在の取り組みがうまくいくか疑問視している。

同様に、大多数（82％）が、AGIを備えたシステムが民間企業によって開発された場合は、公的に所有されるべきだ、と考えている。この意見は、人間よりも優れた思考力を持つシステムを開発することの倫理と潜在的なマイナス面に対する懸念とも合致している。ほとんどの研究者（70％）は、安全システムと制御システムが開発されるまでAGIの研究を停止すべきだという意見に反対を表明した。レポートによると、「こうした回答を見るかぎり、何らかの安全策を講じた上で、このテーマの探求を続けたいという意向があるようだ」

AGIをめぐる議論は複雑だとThickstun氏は話す。ある意味で、一種の汎用知能を備えたシステムはすでに開発されている。OpenAIのChatGPTなどの大規模言語モデルは、チェスの対局など、1つのことしかできなかった古いAIモデルとは対照的に、多種多様な人間の活動を行うことができる。

問題は、人間と同じレベルで、多くのことを一貫して実行できるのかどうかだ。Thickstun氏は、「それが実現するのはまだまだ先のことだと思う」とし、こうしたモデルには、真実の概念が組み込まれておらず、正解のないクリエイティブな作業を処理する能力がないことを指摘した。「現在のテクノロジーを使用して、人間の環境でしっかりと動作させられる道筋は見えない。そこに到達するには、多くの点で研究が進歩することが必要だと思う」（Thickstun氏）

AGIをAGIたらしめるものとは何なのか、それを定義するのは難しいとConitzer氏は言う。多くの場合、ほとんどの作業を人間よりもうまく実行できるものを指しているが、単純にさまざまな作業を実行できるものと言う人もいる。「AGIとは、人間を完全に不要にしてしまうもの、という非常に厳しい定義もある」（Conitzer氏）

研究者らはAGIが間もなく登場するという見方に懐疑的だが、ここ数年でテクノロジーが遂げた劇的な進歩をAI研究者が必ずしも予想していなかったのも事実である、とConitzer氏は警告している。「われわれは近年の急激な変化を予想していなかった。だから、変化のペースが今後も加速し続けるなら、AGIが本当に登場するのだろうかと思うかもしれない」

https://cnet.com,Labeling AI-created content becomes essential in China -- Xiaomi's Leigun also struggles with AI fraud,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231133/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","今、中国で最も人気のあるIT系企業の経営者といえば、最近再び脚光を浴びている阿里巴巴（アリババ）の馬雲（ジャック・マー）氏でも、同社との二強時代から一強になりトップに躍り出た騰訊（テンセント）の馬化騰（ポニー・マー）氏でもなく、小米科技（シャオミ）の雷軍（レイ・ジュン）氏だ。

シャオミは日本で直営店のオープンや新しいスマートフォンの発売で話題になっている。一方、中国では電気自動車（EV）の魅力的な製品とサービスで注目を集めている。シャオミの創業者であるレイ氏は、モーターショーでインフルエンサーとしてブースに登場し、SNSで動画を配信した。その結果、同氏を見ようと多くの人がシャオミのブースに集まった。

そんなレイ氏は企業の広告塔として、「微信」（WeChat）向けの動くスタンプをリリースし、多くのネットユーザーから人気を集めている。一方で、レイ氏の許可なく、ネットユーザーが多数の音声ソースを使って同氏が口汚く罵る音声をAIツールで作り出し、それをまとめたボイスパックが拡散した。知名度が高いため、あっという間に多くの人がその音声を耳にするようになり、レイ氏は「そういうことはやめてほしい」と動画で訴えかけた。

3月5日に「全国人民代表大会」（全人代）が開幕した。レイ氏も代表の1人として参加し、そこでAIによる個人の顔や声の改ざん対策について3つの提案をした。同氏は特に目立った被害者だが、各種AIツールの登場により、有名人かどうかに関わらず、ニュースで報道されるケースが増えているため、対策を提案したのだろう。

1つ目は、AIに関する独立した法律の導入を検討することだ。適用の境界線を明確にし、権利侵害の証拠に関する規則を変更し、刑事罰を強化する。2つ目は、プラットフォームなどの責任を強化することだ。プラットフォーム企業がAIによって生成、合成されたコンテンツを正確に識別し、検査や審査、苦情や報告、緊急対応のメカニズムを構築し、問題のあるコンテンツの拡散を適時に阻止する技術能力の開発を支援する。3つ目は、ネットユーザーへの啓発を強化することだ。小学校から高校までの教科書にAIに関する倫理的な内容を追加し、家庭でも啓発活動を行う。法整備、プラットフォームの協力、市民への啓発活動の3つの方法は、中国でよく見られるやり方だ。

その後、14日に「人工智能生成合成内容標識方法」が発表され、AIで生成されたファイルにラベルを付けることが義務付けられた。この規則は、情報産業省に当たる工業和信息化部、公安部、国家ラジオテレビ総局などが共同で発表し、9月1日から施行される。この規則では、AIで作られたコンテンツには、誰でも見えるラベルと、見えないラベルを付ける必要がある。プラットフォームは、これらのラベルが付いたコンテンツを適切に扱わなければならない。

サービス提供者は、AIが作ったテキスト、音声、画像、動画、仮想空間などのコンテンツに、AIで生成されたことを示すラベルを付ける必要がある。具体的には、次のようになる。

テキスト：文頭、文末、文中に文字や記号で表示

音声：冒頭、末尾、途中に音声やリズムで通知

画像：目立つ位置にウォーターマークを付与

動画：冒頭、再生中の画面周辺、または途中にラベルを表示

仮想空間：開始画面やサービス提供中にラベルを表示

さらに、ダウンロードやコピーを提供する際にも、これらのラベルがファイルに適切に埋め込まれていることを確認する必要がある。

見えるラベルに加えて、メタデータやデジタル透かしといった見えないラベルも必要だ。AIサービス提供者は、生成されたコンテンツのメタデータにコンテンツの属性や提供者名などの識別情報を埋め込むことが義務付けられる。配信プラットフォームは、メタデータにラベルがあればそれを確認して明示し、ラベルがないものの投稿者が生成コンテンツであると自己申告した場合には、その情報に基づいてラベルを付与する。また、ラベルがないにもかかわらずAI生成の痕跡が認められる場合も、目立つ形で明示的なラベルを追加しなければならない。さらに、ラベルの改ざんや不正操作を目的としたツールやサービスの提供、および他社の権利を侵害する不適切なラベルの使用も禁じられている。

これにより、AIによるコンテンツ生成が引き起こす犯罪が完全になくなるわけではない。例えば、生成AIを使って歴史上の人物を架空の状況で戦わせるなど、歴史を改ざん、悪用する動画を作ることを禁止する「生成式人工智能服務管理暫行方法」によって、中国のネット空間ではそうした動画をほとんど見かけなくなった。ラベル付けが義務化されれば、AIによるコラージュコンテンツはかなり減るだろう。一方で、海外でAIによって作られたコンテンツにはラベルがないため、今後の動向を注視する必要がある。",cnet

https://cnet.com,"Uber Eats becomes ""essential delivery infrastructure in Japan with labor shortages"" -- Clothing is also delivered ""solving social issues"" Representative",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230554/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:11:00 GMT","「Uber Eatsの存在意義は、単にフードデリバリーにとどまりません。社会課題を解決するプラットフォームとして、新たな働き方の提供や買い物弱者の支援、さらには災害時の物資配達など、多方面で活用できるポテンシャルがあると自負しています」──。こう語るのはUber Eats Japanで代表を務める中川晋太郎氏だ。

同氏は「CNET Japan Live 2025」に登壇し、Uber Eatsがどのようにして従来のフードデリバリーサービスから進化し、幅広い社会的課題に取り組むための基盤となっているのか力説した。

●食事以外の配送を拡大

フードデリバリーサービスとして知られている「Uber Eats」だが、食事以外にも日用品や医薬品、家電の配達に対応していることをご存知だろうか。

2015年に米国とカナダで実証実験として始まったUber Eatsは、2016年9月に日本へ上陸。当初は飲食店の料理を届けるサービスとしてスタートした。

「それから3年ほど経った頃に、『飲食店以外の品目も配達できるのでは』という発想に至り、生鮮食品や日用品などへの拡大に踏み切りました」──。代表の中川氏はこう語り、その後は多様な品目を扱うことで利便性を大きく向上させた。

●「運び手不足」をテクノロジーで解決

今では、食事以外にも医薬品、家電、さらにはクリーニングなど、さまざまな商品やサービスの配送に対応。「単なるフードデリバリー」というより、配達員のネットワークを活用した即時配送サービスとしての色彩が濃くなっている。

この「即時配達」を実現しているのが、店舗と配達員をマッチングする技術だ。日本では少子高齢化や人口減少によって配送の担い手が不足しているが、Uber Eatsの仕組みなら、本業のスキマ時間に配達業務をして、収入を得られるため、社会全体として働き手を確保できる。

また、副業を推奨する流れは近年強まっているが、実際には固定シフトや拘束時間など、ハードルが高いケースが多い。その点、Uber Eatsならアプリを起動して好きなときに稼働し、必要に応じてオフにして休める。 「配達パートナーの9割がスケジュールの柔軟さを重視している」と中川氏は語り「本当にフレキシブルな働き方というものを提供し根付かせている」と自負した。

●「配送インフラ」として各社サービスの裏側にも浸透

Uber Eatsは、こうした配達ネットワークを他社に提供する「Uber Direct」に注力している。

たとえば「セブン‐イレブンのアプリで注文を受けた商品を、Uber Eatsの配達パートナーが運ぶ」というように、Uber Eatsの配達ネットワークを「各社の配送サービスの裏側」に組み込むというものだ。

報道発表によれば、ソフトバンクもスマートフォンの配送にUber Directを用いているし、ケンタッキーフライドチキンも自社アプリからの注文をUber Directに流している。

ここには、各社が自前で配達サービスを構築することの困難さがある。自社配達する場合、直接雇用の正社員やアルバイトが必要だが、一方で、天候や予想外の要因によって、仮にAIを使っても需要予測が難しい。であれば、いっそのことUber Eatsの配達網を借りてしまうというわけだ。

「最近Uber Directを展開した例では、クリーニングがあります。クリーニングの場合、お客様がクリーニングを出す。そして終わったら受け取るという二方向の流れが発生します。こうした往復のトランザクションが発生するような商材やサービスは、Uber Directとの親和性が非常に高いと考えております」（中川氏）

●店舗の省人化にも

店舗側が配送サービスを導入するにあたり、ネックとなるのが「商品を棚から探し出して、袋に詰める」という作業だ。Uber Eatsでは注文がいつ入るか不確定なため、人員の配置が難しいためだ。

そこでUber Eatsでは「ピック・パック・ペイ」という新たな仕組みを導入。これは、配達パートナーがスーパーなどで自ら商品をピックアップし、袋詰して決済まで済ませるというもので、すでに「まいばすけっと」などスーパー各社が導入。店舗の人手不足の改善にもつなげているという。

こうした取り組みによって、Uber Eatsで注文できるスーパーマーケット数が近年では大幅に増加。いわゆる「買い物弱者」の救済にも役立っていると胸を張る。

●今後の展望

Uber Eatsは、ロボットデリバリーの実証実験も始めている。一方で中川氏は「配達パートナーが多くいらっしゃる地域では、別にロボットに変える必要はない」とし 「長期的には、買い物弱者が多いと言われる過疎地域で、ロボットデリバリーをどんどん展開することを想定している」と述べた。

また、災害インフラとしてのUber Eatsの活用も模索しているという。例えば、自治体とのパートナーシップのうえで「在宅避難者に配達パートナーを通じて物資を届ける」ことも、理論上は可能なのだという。

このように中川氏は「Uber Eatsは社会課題を解決するプラットフォームにしたい」と強調し、「何でも使っていただけるので、我々も今気づいていない使い方があると思っている。逆に提案していただくのも大歓迎」と結んだ。",cnet
https://cnet.com,"What will the mysterious ""C"" button be used for Nintendo's Switch 2?",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231163/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:34:00 GMT","When Nintendo released a preview for Nintendo Switch 2 in January, gamers noticed an unlabeled button was added to the ""Joy-Con"" on the right. Unlike the existing Capture and Home buttons, this third button had no markings. However, things changed when Nintendo announced its own news app on March 27th, with the explanatory images containing previously unreleased Switch 2 images.

Looking at the Switch 2 images on the app's pages listed on the App Store and Google Play stores, you can see that the third button, which had previously been unlabeled, clearly contains the letter ""C.""

This has led to the rise of questions as to what role this button is. The most likely theory is that ""C"" means ""Capture"" and is a button that allows you to take screenshots of gameplay quickly. However, the capture button (which many Switch users call the share button) already plays its role. Perhaps the C button is for screenshots only, while the traditional capture button is used for live streaming.

On Xbox and PlayStation, live streaming can be done on the console itself from previous generation devices. Enter and set up your Twitch or YouTube information, and you can start streaming with just a few buttons. On the other hand, since the Switch does not have any such features, if you want to stream live, you will need to use a capture device and a PC. If they were able to start streaming with just one button, it would save a lot of time for streamers.

It is also possible that the C button is for switching modes on Joy-Con. In the January trailer, for a moment, he was shown removing the Joy-Con and moving it on a flat surface like a mouse. This button may play a role in switching Joy-Con from the controller to mouse mode.

Another theory is that the C button means ""Community."" On March 27th, Nintendo Direct announced the revival of the Tomodachi Collection series. This is a game that uses the avatar called ""Mii."" Therefore, the Community button may allow you to bring in spaces where Mii interact with each other, such as the ""Swaggy Mii Square"" on the Nintendo 3DS.

Nintendo officially reveals the C button functionality at the time it will officially announce the Switch 2 on April 2nd. Until then, there will be many questions about release dates, prices, and launch titles. These will be revealed on the 2nd Nintendo Direct.

https://cnet.com,Google's Pixel 9a will be released in the US and other countries on April 10th - Japan is coming soon,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231159/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:13:00 GMT","On March 28th, US time, Google announced on its support page for the Pixel 9a that it will first release the new Pixel 9a smartphone on April 10th in the US, Canada and the UK. It will be released in some European countries on the 14th, and in Australia and other countries on the 16th. The price in the US is $499 (approximately 75,000 yen).

The company announced the Pixel 9a on March 20th, with the release date set to ""April"" (it is ""scheduled to be released"" on its website for Japan, and there is no mention of the timing). The Pixel 9a is equipped with a ""Tensor G4"" processor, and also utilizes many of the software features found in the Pixel 9, which costs $799 (128,900 yen in Japan). On the other hand, the Pixel 9a's design is characterized by the fact that it does not have the long camera bar that is seen in other Pixel series, and the back is almost flat. It also features a 5100mAh battery, which is larger than the more expensive Pixel 9 series.

Like the previous Pixel A series, the Pixel 9a is likely to be a cost-effective option, with plenty of necessary and sufficient features. This includes a seven-year guaranteed OS and security updates and access to various AI features from Gemini. Gemini will eventually completely replace the ""Google Assistant"" on Android smartphones.

This time, Google has set its release date in Japan ""coming soon,"" which is noteworthy given the Pixel series has been selling very well in the country so far. By delaying the release, it may be that they are preparing for its release in Japan.

The Pixel 9a will be released just over a month after Apple released the iPhone 16e, which costs $599 (99,800 yen in Japan). The iPhone 16e is considered a slightly more affordable option than the iPhone 16.

https://cnet.com,Should I be a science and engineering background in order to become an engineer?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230801/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","I think many people have taken a step as new employees as they enter the new year as April begins. I think most readers of this series are accepting new employees. In any case, I told you last time that if you can use new encounters as a species of serendipity, you won't have to worry about your job being taken away by AI. I myself have been working on a new job since April in search of serendipity. I look forward to all sorts of coincidences.

Now, what should new employees who have begun their careers as engineers or students aiming for a career as engineers should learn is a profound topic. To put it more straightforwardly, I would like to think about the topic of ""Do engineers have to graduate from the Faculty of Science and Technology?""

Over 90% of the engineers I have worked with have graduated from the university's Faculty of Science and Technology. It is in particular true that many people graduated from departments in electrical, electronic, information and communications. However, even in science and engineering, there are many cases where people majored in mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics, etc., while many people from so-called liberal arts faculties such as economics, law, and literature have been active as engineers.

""Dialect"" too

Telecommunications carrier engineers often do not engage in tasks like device development or program coding. Of course, there is no way telecommunications carrier engineers are involved in device development or coding. However, it is safe to say that telecommunications companies often decide specifications, order them from manufacturers or system integrators, and have them develop and manufacture them.

In practice, we purchase commercially available communication devices and servers, connect them to media such as optical fiber, and provide services with appropriate settings. Therefore, it is important to obtain and organize information on what kind of equipment is being developed, manufactured and sold by various manufacturers, and compare and consider it.

Furthermore, for devices that have been chosen to adopt, it is necessary to memorize many commands*1 and be able to quickly and accurately set up the configuration.

*1: Most of the current devices can be set using the Graphical User Interface (GUI), but many engineers often use the Command Line Interface (CLI).

It is also important to decide and coordinate what protocols to use when connecting with other telecommunications carriers and users. Therefore, we are committed to understanding the protocol and how to adjust which parameters and how to provide the best network service.

Selecting equipment, connecting to networks such as optical fibers, introducing configurations, and understanding and using protocols - if you write this, once you set it optimally, you may think that the machine will move on its own.

However, the device may be hardware malfunctioning, and software may contain bugs. Also, optical fiber buried underground can be cut off by road construction, and protocols can be dialects and versions, so it is usually not easy*2.",cnet

ABeam Consulting, which supported analysis and other information, announced it on March 31st.

Based on the idea that human capital is the source and driving force behind value creation in companies, ANA Holdings is promoting various initiatives to realize a virtuous cycle of the ""value creation cycle starting from investment in human resources.""

This initiative will utilize the ""Digital ESG service"" provided by ABeam Consulting. Correlation analysis using 520 indicators revealed that the human resources policies and the achievements of group employees that ANA Holdings is taking place not only in economic value, but also in the creation of corporate value.

Value-related analysis is a method that statistically analyzes the correlations between non-financial and financial indicators, and visualizes and validates a series of value chains that lead to increased corporate value. ABeam Consulting has been providing support using this method since 2019.

In this support, we used Digital ESG services to examine how ""human resource policies"" implemented by ANA Holdings, such as ""creating a comfortable workplace"" and ""creating an organization resistant to change,"" are actually leading to an increase in economic value. We then conducted (1) visualization of the overall story [relevance] that forms the path to the value chain, and (2) analysis of correlations to improve corporate value [PBR].

As a result, it has been revealed that the ANA Group's emphasis on improving employee engagement and the embodying the group's guidelines for conduct, ""ANA's Way,"" serve as an important hub for the value chain. Furthermore, it has been quantitatively demonstrated that strengths such as fostering teamwork and improving the specialized skills of on-site employees boost basic quality, productivity and customer satisfaction, and ultimately link to economic value such as sales, profits, and stock prices.

In domestic and international manufacturing industries, equipment is aging at many factories and plants, increasing the risk of breakdowns and accidents. In addition, the shortage of skilled engineers in the preservation work of public works is becoming more serious, and it is necessary to introduce a system that allows young and medium-sized engineers to perform maintenance work efficiently.

SmartFAM Ver.4 has a new function to link with generation AI. By obtaining answers from the data on maintenance work that has accumulated up to now regarding failures caused by equipment outages and damage caused by aging, it is possible to display similar information about failures and recovery countermeasures from past events. This means that the equipment can be restored without relying on the experience or intuition of the person in charge.

The maintenance planning function will also be strengthened. In addition to the functions that have been planning plans in accordance with the maintenance cycle up to now, it also has a function that allows you to review the timing of maintenance carried out based on schedules and performance data. We also handle implementation, postponement, and forwarding of maintenance plans for the relevant equipment for each factory and production line.

https://cnet.com,BitKey inherits SNC's business services -- Provides convenience in connecting life,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231127/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:35:00 GMT","On March 31, BitKey, which plans and develops smart locks and other services, announced that it will inherit two businesses: ""Kagikan,"" an office-based entry and exit management system, and ""Roomon,"" a smart lock management system for real estate businesses, which is part of the corporate services of the smart lock business operated by Sony Network Communications (SNC).

On the same day, it was also announced that SNC had invested in BitKey. In conjunction with the connect platforms ""homehub"" and ""workhub"" deployed by BitKey, we will change the way keys are used to make offices and homes.

This business succession was realized through discussion between the two companies for about a year. Bitkey Co-founder, CEO and CEO, Kotsuki Masanori, said, ""When it comes to Qrio Lock, which SNC operates, is a pioneer in smart locks. I feel very honored that he was chosen as the company's company to take over its corporate business. In addition to the smart lock business, SNC also operates a wide range of businesses, including the high-speed communication service NURO Hikari and smart home-related products, and I feel that many collaborations will be possible in the future."" He also looks at new developments centered on corporate business.



BitKey Co-Founder CEO and CEO Masanori Kotsuki BitKey Co-Founder CEO and CEO Masanori Kotsuki

BitKey is a startup founded in 2018. Since its inception, it has been aiming for business for business. ""When you hear the word ""smart lock,"" you might imagine it as a useful tool as part of a smart home, but the business we work on is providing a system that can compensate for the labor shortage, such as real estate management companies using digital keys to save the keys needed when viewing rental housing, or using them to operate unmanned stores,"" says Mr. Kotsuki.

In addition, one of its features is that you can ""pass a digital key"" with a one-time password that can be used with a limited time. Mr. Kotsuki reveals, ""You can ask for housekeeping services while residents are out and pet sitters. If you team up with a delivery company, you can unlock the autolock at the entrance of your apartment and carry your luggage to the front of your room. This reduces the number of times you redelivery is done. Not only is the convenience of a key alone, but you can also expand the value by linking the key and service.""

Mr. Kotsuki analyzes the reasons why they were able to strengthen their relationship with SNC, saying, ""In the smart lock industry, where many players specialize in residential and office use, Bit Key is a strength that they provide Bit Keys in a wide range of locations without limiting the scope. In addition, the range of services is wide, including meeting room reservation systems and visualizing congestion situations. I think that SNCs today were able to evaluate the parts that can help solve these problems for users as destinations for transferring some of the businesses.""

Our aim is to further strengthen our corporate services in the future. ""What we're targeting is a rental housing management company that manages a large number of rooms and a large company with many employees. The larger the size, the wider the range of issues that can be solved,"" he said.

About seven years after its establishment, Bitkey has been working in capital and business alliances with many companies, including SNC, to help businesses for business on the ground. The company's strategy is ""two-wielding and all-star,"" says Kotsuki.

""We want to connect digital and real life. This is about working on both hardware and software. We want to pursue these two-wielding ways. On the other hand, we cannot create what we can connect, and we can only do it when we work together with various service companies and manufacturers. We want to connect the ``All-Star'' of services and hardware.""

Mr. Kotsuki expressed his determination to do his best, saying, ""Improving a dual-wielding style is not twice as difficult, including development, but three to four times more difficult. I would like to spare no effort in this situation and create good things, creating a life where people can be connected and make life easier.""",cnet

People are already using it to generate fake restaurant receipts, potentially adding another tool to the already-extensive toolkit of AI deepfakes used by fraudsters.

Prolific social media poster and VC Deedy Das posted on X a photo of a fake receipt for a (real) San Francisco steakhouse that he says was created with 4o.

You can use 4o to generate fake receipts.



There are too many real world verification flows that rely on “real images” as proof. That era is over. pic.twitter.com/9FORS1PWsb — Deedy (@deedydas) March 29, 2025

Others were able to replicate similar results, including one with food or drink stains to make it look even more authentic:

I think in the original image the letters are too perfect and they don’t bend with the paper. They look like hovering above the paper. Here is my attempt to make it more realistic. Let me know what you think. pic.twitter.com/EixRSHubeY — Michael Gofman (@michaelgofman) March 29, 2025

The most real-looking example TechCrunch found was actually from France, where a LinkedIn user posted a crinkled-up AI-generated receipt for a local restaurant chain:

TechCrunch tested 4o and was also able to generate a fake receipt for an Applebee’s in San Francisco:

Image Credits:chagpt / charles rollet

But our attempt had a couple of dead giveaways that it was faked. For one, the total uses a comma instead of a period. For another, the math doesn’t add up. LLMs still struggle to do basic math, so this isn’t particularly surprising.

But it wouldn’t be hard for a fraudster to quickly fix a few of the numbers with either photo editing software or, possibly, more precise prompts.

It’s clear that making it really easy to generate fake receipts presents huge opportunities for fraud. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine this kind of tech being used by bad actors to get “reimbursed” for entirely fake expenses.

OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told TechCrunch that all of its images include metadata indicating they were made by ChatGPT. Christianson added that OpenAI “takes action” when users violate its usage policies and that it’s “always learning” from real-world use and feedback.

TechCrunch then asked why ChatGPT allows people to generate fake receipts in the first place, and whether this is in line with OpenAI’s usage policies (which ban fraud.)

Christianson replied that OpenAI’s “goal is to give users as much creative freedom as possible” and that fake AI receipts could be used in non-fraud situations like “teaching people about financial literacy” along with creating original art and product ads.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Oracle under fire for its handling of separate security incidents,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/oracle-under-fire-for-its-handling-of-separate-security-incidents/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Tech giant Oracle is facing criticism for how it’s handling two seemingly separate data breaches.

At least one of the incidents appears to still be unfolding, despite Oracle reportedly denying a breach at all. The other relates to a breach of patient data under the tech giant’s healthcare subsidiary, Oracle Health.

Oracle did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment about the two incidents.

Oracle Health breach affects patient data, per reports

The breach disclosed most recently involves Oracle Health, which provides hospitals and other healthcare providers with technology to access health records online. Oracle Health is a unit that was combined with Cerner, an electronic health records company that Oracle acquired in 2022 for $28 billion.

Bloomberg and Bleeping Computer reported last week that the breach affects patient data, although it’s unclear exactly what kinds of data were stolen, nor which organizations and companies that use Oracle Health are affected.

Oracle notified some of its healthcare customers in March of a breach that happened sometime earlier this year, in which hackers accessed Oracle servers and stole patient data, according to the publications.

Contact Us Do you have more information about these two Oracle breaches? From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about these two Oracle breaches? From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email . You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop

“We are writing to inform you that, on or around February 20, 2025, we became aware of a cybersecurity event involving unauthorized access to some amount of your Cerner data that was on an old legacy server not yet migrated to the Oracle Cloud,” read the notification sent to some Oracle Health customers, according to Bleeping Computer.

Citing multiple sources, the news site reported that a hacker is trying to extort affected hospitals, reportedly demanding millions of dollars.

An Oracle employee, who asked to remain anonymous, as they were not authorized to speak to the press, told TechCrunch that the company hasn’t been very transparent even with its own employees.

“My team was not able to access customers’ environments for a number of days. My concern is not just with patient data breach. Access through hosts allows any and all access to what is hosted, obviously,” said the employee. “Some customers host other applications like HR and finance. I don’t know if it was hacker[-]accessed though.”

The employee said they had to look at Reddit and internal Slack channels “to even figure out something was being looked at.”

The employee said they “felt super ignored,” describing the situation as: “Nothing to see here, move right along.”

The employee, however, also said that they saw on Slack that some teams were given language to communicate with clients on March 4: “We will investigate the issue you are experiencing.”

Oracle denies cloud breach, despite mounting evidence

The other separate breach involves Oracle Cloud servers. And in this case, too, Oracle is not being very transparent about what happened.

Earlier this month, a hacker going by the online handle rose87168 posted on a cybercrime forum offering the data of 6 million Oracle Cloud customers, including authentication data and encrypted passwords, as Bleeping Computer reported at the time.

To prove that they breached Oracle, rose87168 uploaded a text file containing their online handle that was hosted on an Oracle Cloud server.

Since, several Oracle customers have confirmed that data samples shared by the hacker appear genuine, pointing to further evidence of a breach at Oracle.

Strangely, Oracle denied that there was a breach at all.

“There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data,” Oracle told the publication.

But not everyone is convinced.

“This is a serious cybersecurity incident which impacts customers, in a platform managed by Oracle,” cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont wrote in a blog post analyzing the alleged Oracle Cloud breach. “Oracle are attempting to wordsmith statements around Oracle Cloud and use very specific words to avoid responsibility. This is not okay.”

“Oracle need to clearly, openly and publicly communicate what happened, how it impacts customers, and what they’re doing about it. This is a matter of trust and responsibility. Step up, Oracle — or customers should start stepping off,” said Beaumont.

Commenting on one of the alleged Oracle breaches, cybersecurity expert Lisa Forte wrote on Bluesky that “if this ends up being true, and I struggle to see how it won’t, this is a very very bad look.”",techcrunch

https://techcrunch.com,OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model in the coming months,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-language-model-in-the-coming-months/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","OpenAI says that it intends to release its first “open” language model since GPT‑2 “in the coming months.”

That’s according to a feedback form the company published on its website Monday. The form, which OpenAI is inviting “developers, researchers, and [members of] the broader community” to fill out, includes questions like, “What would you like to see in an open-weight model from OpenAI?” and “What open models have you used in the past?”

“We’re excited to collaborate with developers, researchers, and the broader community to gather inputs and make this model as useful as possible,” OpenAI wrote on its website. “If you’re interested in joining a feedback session with the OpenAI team, please let us know [in the form] below.”

OpenAI plans to host developer events to gather feedback and, in the future, demo prototypes of the model. The first developer event will take place in San Francisco within a few weeks, followed by sessions in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

OpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an “open” approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI’s strategy, these “open” competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization.

It has proven to be a wildly successful strategy for some outfits. Meta, which has invested heavily in its Llama family of open AI models, said earlier in March that Llama had racked up over 1 billion downloads. Meanwhile, DeepSeek has quickly amassed a large worldwide user base and attracted the attention of domestic investors.

In a recent Reddit Q&A, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he thinks OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history when it comes to open sourcing its technologies.

“[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy,” Altman said. “Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it’s also not our current highest priority […] We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years.”

Altman expanded on OpenAI’s open model plans in a post on X on Monday afternoon, saying that OpenAI’s upcoming open model will have “reasoning” capabilities along the lines of OpenAI’s o3-mini.

“[B]efore release, we will evaluate this model according [to] our preparedness framework, like we would for any other model,” Altman said. “[A]nd we will do extra work given that we know this model will be modified post-release […] [W]e’re excited to see what developers build and how large companies and governments use it where they prefer to run a model themselves.”

Excerpts of a forthcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey published over the weekend allege that Altman misled OpenAI executives about model safety reviews prior to his brief ouster in November 2023.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"Amazon unveils Nova Act, an AI agent that can control a web browser",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/amazon-unveils-nova-act-an-ai-agent-that-uses-a-web-browser/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Amazon on Monday unveiled Nova Act, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform some simple actions. Alongside the new agentic AI model, Amazon is releasing the Nova Act SDK, a toolkit that allows developers to build agent prototypes with Nova Act.

Nova Act, developed by Amazon’s recently opened San Francisco-based AGI lab, will also power key features of the company’s upcoming Alexa+ upgrade, a generative AI-enhanced version of Amazon’s popular voice assistant. The version of Nova Act available starting today is a little less polished, however. Amazon is calling it a research preview.

Developers can access the Nova Act toolkit on a new website, nova.amazon.com, which also serves as a showcase for Amazon’s various Nova foundation models.

Nova Act is Amazon’s attempt to take on OpenAI’s Operator and Anthropic’s Computer Use with general-purpose AI agent technology of its own. Several leading tech companies believe AI agents that can navigate the web for users will make today’s AI chatbots significantly more useful.

Amazon may not be the first to develop this sort of agentic technology, but via Alexa+, it may have the widest reach.

Amazon says developers building with the Nova Act SDK should be able to automate basic actions on behalf of users, such as ordering salads from Sweetgreen or making dinner reservations. With the Nova Act toolkit, developers can pull together tools that allow an AI agent to navigate web pages, fill out forms, or pick dates on a calendar.

Amazon claims that Nova Act outperforms agents from OpenAI and Anthropic on several of the company’s internal tests. For example, on ScreenSpot Web Text, which measures how an AI agent interacts with text on a screen, Nova Act scored 94%, outperforming OpenAI’s CUA (which scored 88%) and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (90%).

However, Amazon didn’t benchmark Nova Act using more common agent evaluations, such as WebVoyager.

Nova Act is the first public product to emerge from Amazon’s aforementioned AGI lab, an initiative co-led by former OpenAI researchers David Luan and Pieter Abbeel. Both previously founded startups of their own — Luan started Adept, while Abbeel co-founded Covariant — before Amazon hired them away last year to spearhead its AI agent efforts.

While it may seem strange for an AGI lab to be building AI agents that can order salads, Luan told TechCrunch that he sees agents as a key step toward creating superintelligent AI systems. Luan defines AGI as “an AI system that can help you do anything a human does on a computer.”

Luan says his team designed the Nova Act SDK to reliably automate short, simple tasks, and give developers tools to precisely define when they want a human to intervene in an agentic workflow. He hopes it will allow developers to create more reliable agentic applications, albeit not necessarily fully autonomous ones.

Amazon is releasing its first generalist AI agent in a crowded space, but it’s a crucial technology that the company has a lot riding on. Early tests of Nova Act could provide a glimpse into some of the capabilities of the long-delayed Alexa+, a make-or-break moment for Amazon’s AI efforts.

A major problem with early AI agents from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic is their reliability across different domains. In TechCrunch’s tests, the systems are slow, struggle to operate independently for very long, and are prone to mistakes a human wouldn’t make. It won’t be long until we see whether Amazon has cracked the code — or whether its agents suffer from the same flaws plaguing competitors.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Runway releases an impressive new video-generating AI model,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/runway-releases-an-impressive-new-video-generating-ai-model/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","AI startup Runway on Monday released what it claims is one of the highest-fidelity AI-powered video generators yet.

Called Gen-4, the model is rolling out to the company’s individual and enterprise customers. Runway claims that it can generate consistent characters, locations, and objects across scenes, maintain “coherent world environments,” and regenerate elements from different perspectives and positions within scenes.

“Gen-4 can utilize visual references, combined with instructions, to create new images and videos utilizing consistent styles, subjects, locations, and more,” Runway wrote in a blog post, “[a]ll without the need for fine-tuning or additional training.”

Runway, which is backed by investors including Salesforce, Google, and Nvidia, offers a suite of AI video tools, including video-generating models like Gen-4. It faces stiff competition in the video generation space, including from OpenAI and Google. But the company has fought to differentiate itself, inking a deal with a major Hollywood studio and earmarking millions of dollars to fund films using AI-generated video.

Runway says that Gen-4 allows users to generate consistent characters across lighting conditions using a reference image of those characters. To craft a scene, users can provide images of subjects and describe the composition of the shot they want to generate.

“Gen-4 excels in its ability to generate highly dynamic videos with realistic motion as well as subject, object, and style consistency with superior prompt adherence and best-in-class world understanding,” the company claims in its blog post. “Runway Gen-4 [also] represents a significant milestone in the ability of visual generative models to simulate real-world physics.”

Gen-4, like all video-generating models, was trained on a vast number of examples of videos to “learn” the patterns in these videos to generate synthetic footage. Runway refuses to say where the training data came from, partly out of fear of sacrificing competitive advantage. But training details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits.

Case in point, Runway is facing a suit brought by artists against it and other generative AI companies that accuses the defendants of training their models on copyrighted artwork without permission. Runway argues that the doctrine known as fair use shields it from legal repercussions. It isn’t yet clear whether the company will prevail.

The stakes are somewhat high for Runway, which is said to be raising a new round of funding that would value the company at $4 billion. According to The Information, Runway hopes to hit $300 million in annualized revenue this year following the launch of products like an API for its video-generating models.

However the lawsuit against Runway shakes out, generative AI video tools threaten to upend the film and TV industry as we know it. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, found that 75% of film production companies that have adopted AI have reduced, consolidated, or eliminated jobs after incorporating the tech. The study also estimates that by 2026, more than 100,000 U.S. entertainment jobs will be disrupted by generative AI.",techcrunch

Trump extended the deadline for the TikTok ban to April 5 back in January after signing an executive order on his first day in office.

Reuters reported on Friday that private equity firm Blackstone is mulling a small stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations. The firm is considering joining ByteDance’s current non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in providing fresh capital to bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations.

Isomorphic Labs, the AI drug-discovery platform that was spun out of Google’s DeepMind in 2021, has raised external capital for the first time. The $600 million round was led by Thrive Capital, with participation from GV and existing investor Alphabet, Google’s parent, it said.

The funding will accelerate further development of Isomorphic’s AI drug design engine and support the company’s goal of bringing its discovered drugs to clinical trials.

Isomorphic Labs was founded by DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis by leveraging DeepMind’s software for AI drug discovery, including AlphaFold, an AI model that predicts the three-dimensional structures of proteins.

Last year, Isomorphic Labs secured strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis, potentially generating up to $3 billion in milestone payments for access to its AI model.

Hassabis told the New York Times that while Isomorphic Labs didn’t need the capital, the extra funding will help the division hire top research scientists.

For their work on AlphaFold, Hassabis and DeepMind researcher John Jumper were among the three scientists who received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2024.",techcrunch

Amazon has delivered on its promise to launch an upgraded Alexa experience, Alexa+, by the end of March. But the service reportedly lacks many of the features Amazon demoed at a press event in late February.

Alexa+ can’t yet perform certain “agentic” AI tasks showcased in the company’s marketing, like ordering takeout on Grubhub or generating stories to entertain kids, according to The Washington Post. The assistant also can’t visually identify people and remind them to do particular chores, or brainstorm gift ideas — two additional capabilities shown during the presser.

Other features are rolling out to only a subset of users to start, like the ability to order an Uber and get cooking recommendations. Meanwhile, a web app Amazon announced for Alexa+ last month doesn’t have a concrete release window.

Alexa+ is said to have been plagued with issues from the beginning, owing to challenges with the AI infrastructure that underpins it. Judging by the Post’s reporting, it seems that Amazon isn’t out of the woods yet.",techcrunch

Existing investors — Mayfield’s Navin Chaddha and Kleiner Perkins’ Mamoon Hamid — also participated, bringing its total raised to $180 million, it says.

The chipmaker is another startup benefiting from AI’s glow-up. Its chips don’t process AI workloads directly — it’s not a Nvidia GPU competitor. It’s working on a new “programmable coherent digital signal processing DSP” chip that allows the innards of data centers to communicate faster both internally and with external sources.

Data centers needed this kind of tech anyway, but the sudden rise of AI has put overwhelming pressure on them to be faster, more efficient, and handle bigger workloads.

The company was founded in 2021 but has been quiet about itself until Monday, when it announced this Series D round. Its CTO co-founder, Roni El-Bahar, published his first blog post on Monday, saying he founded the startup to bring competition to the DSP market that has historically been “controlled by a handful of large semiconductor companies.”

He was largely referring to Marvell Technology, which currently dominates the DSP industry and has partnerships with Nvidia, Juniper Networks, and many others.

Retym — pronounced “re-time” — is using TSMC’s state-of-the-art 5 nanometer fab for its first chip, which is being tested now, the company told Reuters.

Most notably, the company on Monday announced that Apple device owners will now be able to take advantage of Priority Notifications, which allows Apple’s AI to highlight your most time-sensitive notifications in a new format. Other updates are coming to the Image Playground app and the Mac. Plus, Apple Intelligence is now available to iPhone and iPad users in the EU and on the Apple Vision Pro headset in U.S. English.

The changes are rolling out with the release of Apple software, iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4.

Apple notes that its AI features are also available in a number of new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified). Localized English has also been added for both Singapore and India.

Though Apple Intelligence was introduced at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference last year as its new generative AI offering, the reality is that Apple was not prepared to release all its AI-powered features at once. That’s led to a slow and steady rollout of numerous AI updates since the release of iOS 18.1, where Apple Intelligence first went live. For instance, features like ChatGPT integration, Image Playground, and others didn’t arrive until iOS 18.2 (and iPadOS 18.2, macOS Sequoia 15.2) months later.

Among the new additions coming Monday, Priority Notifications may be the most useful if successfully implemented. Now, instead of having to dig for important updates across all your notifications — which often include nonessential updates and other marketing messages from apps — you’ll see those that deserve attention appear at the top of the stack.

Other Apple Intelligence improvements arriving today include the ability to create a “memory movie” on Mac by typing a description, and an added Sketch style in Apple’s AI image-generation app, Image Playground, for the creation of academic and detailed sketches.

Apple had previously announced that its AI suite would arrive in the EU in April 2025 — a delay Apple blamed on EU tech regulations, like the Digital Markets Act.

Meanwhile, Vision Pro users will be able to use AI features like Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and more with the expansion of Apple Intelligence to the mixed reality platform.

The update also includes a handful of new emojis, including a paint splatter, a face with bags under its eyes, a fingerprint, a root vegetable, and a shovel, among others.

With Apple Intelligence on the Apple Vision Pro, users will get access to writing tools that allow them to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text with the help of AI. Users will also get access to Image Playground and Genmoji in order to create unique AI-generated images and emoji.

In addition, users can leverage natural language search in the Photos app to find specific images by simply describing them. Vision Pro users can also create a “Memory Movie” based on their photos and videos around specific themes, thanks to a new Apple Intelligence feature that’s launching today.

visionOS 2.4 also includes support for Priority Messages in Mail, Mail Summaries, Image Wand in Notes, Priority Notifications in Notification Center, and Notification Summaries.

The first set of Apple Intelligence features is available to users with their device and Siri language set to U.S. English.

As for the new spatial experiences, Apple is launching a new Spatial Gallery app that gives users access to a library of spatial content around art, culture, nature, sports, entertainment, and more. The app will be updated with new content regularly, Apple says.

The new Apple Vision Pro app for iPhone allows users to do a variety of different things, including queuing apps to download, accessing information about their Vision Pro, and finding tips to enhance their experience. The app features a Discover page that surfaces recommendations for new experiences on Apple Vision Pro, such as popular apps and games.

The company also believes it has determined why the booster stage failed during an attempted landing on an ocean platform during the inaugural flight in January.

Those mainly focus around “propellant management and engine bleed control improvements.” The company said it has submitted all this information to the FAA.

New Glenn is Blue Origin’s first rocket that can get into orbit around Earth. The company also hopes to use it to go farther into space. Proving out those capabilities — and showing that the rocket can perform repeatedly — are key to putting Blue Origin in a position to compete against Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which currently dominates the launch market.

The 320-foot rocket has been in development for years and faced numerous delays. Blue Origin finally got to test it out in January.

https://techcrunch.com,"Temporal lands $146 million at a flat valuation, eyes agentic AI expansion",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/temporal-lands-146-million-at-a-flat-valuation-eyes-agentic-ai-expansion/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Seattle-based Temporal has made its name over the last several years in the world of microservices — specifically providing a platform to orchestrate the messy business of building and operating integrations and updates across disparate services and apps in the cloud. But the AI boom has come at the company fast. Now, Temporal has raised a growth round of $146 million to build what it believes the next chapter will be in its space: AI, and specifically building microservices to support newer areas like agentic AI.

A chunk of the investment will be going into R&D. At the end of 2024, the company launched a new feature called Nexus in its Temporal Cloud platform to improve security, fault isolation, and modularity, and it says it’s going to continue developing that, alongside public cloud availability for Azure, enabling more cross-cloud work, and “R&D for AI use cases.” Temporal will also be using some of the funds to invest in sales and marketing.

Tiger Global is leading the round, with participation from previous backers that include Index Ventures (which led the Series B) and Sequoia Capital (which led the Series A ). With this Series C, Temporal has now raised $350 million.

The round is sizeable, but the devil is in the details. TechCrunch understands that the company’s valuation with this round is $1.72 billion post-money — “a little bit up — a very little bit,” in the words of CEO and co-founder Samar Abbas said.

The company’s previous funding — a $75 million Series B extension announced in February 2023 — was made at a flat valuation of $1.5 billion. And ahead of that, there was a report in Prime Unicorn Index that the valuation had dipped as low as $880 million, a figure the company has not confirmed.

Abbas and his co-founder Maxim Fateev (CTO) started Temporal after the pair worked together at Uber, where they jointly developed Cadence, Uber’s open source orchestration engine designed to route requests and mediate interactions between different microservices.

Knowing that the need for better microservices management extended to many organizations, the pair saw an opportunity to strike out on their own, and Temporal was born.

Temporal’s microservices orchestration platform predates the hype around AI. Customers have been using it since 2019 to help manage functions and actions that bring together data from numerous, disparate apps — payment processing, customer onboarding, order management, ID verification, and infrastructure management among them.

More recently, though, services built on AI, and specifically to fill out the promise of agentic AI — which bring together language models to work with and across data from a number of other services in AI “agents” tailored for specific use cases — have emerged as a prime use case for microservices.

The company’s current client list speaks not only to which companies are using Temporal’s platform to manage any microservice, legacy or otherwise, but also which ones are already using it for AI specifically. The list includes Box, Instacart, Snap, and Stripe, as well as Nvidia.

Nvidia is a notable name in that big-name list. A year ago, the GPU giant announced a microservices software platform called NIM to streamline the deployment of AI models (both custom and pre-trained) in production environments. One of the latest developments in that microservices platform has included helping its customers develop AI agents to address trust and safety.

Temporal is still growing, albeit not at the pace it used to in the past. The company told TechCrunch that revenues are up 4.4x in the past 18 months; that’s compared to more than 20x growth the company claimed in the 12 months to February 2023. Meanwhile, the company says that its Temporal.io open source platform now has 183,000 active users; and its enterprise managed service Temporal Cloud now claims 2,500 customers.

There’s no debate that “durable execution,” the category that Abbas and Fateev pioneered, is less buzzy than Ghibli-style AI image generators. But the need to execute long workflows reliably is real, and other teams have entered the field since then, such as workflows-as-code startup Restate and Orkes.

Abbas has been Temporal’s CEO since he and Fateev swapped their roles in April of last year. With “zero reports,” Fateev is now in charge of technology and setting the long-term vision. “I am the one who is figuring out what steps we need to take to deliver on that mission,” Abbas said.

These steps include growing headcount from some 250 employees to over 300 in the coming months, as well as “doing a big push in EMEA and [Asia-Pacific & Japan],” he said.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,API testing firm APIsec exposed customer data during security lapse,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/api-testing-firm-apisec-exposed-customer-data-during-security-lapse/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","API testing firm APIsec has confirmed it secured an exposed internal database containing customer data, which was connected to the internet for several days without a password.

The exposed APIsec database stored records dating back to 2018, including names and email addresses of its customers’ employees and users, as well as details about the security posture of APIsec’s corporate customers.

Much of the data was generated by APIsec as it monitors its customers’ APIs for security weaknesses, according to UpGuard, the security research firm that found the database.

UpGuard found the leaked data on March 5 and notified APIsec the same day. APIsec secured the database soon after.

APIsec, which claims to have worked with Fortune 500 companies, bills itself as a company that tests APIs for its various customers. APIs allow two things or more on the internet to communicate with each other, such as a company’s back-end systems with users accessing its app and website. Insecure APIs can be exploited to siphon sensitive data from a company’s systems.

In a now-published report, which was shared with TechCrunch prior to its release, UpGuard said the exposed data included information about attack surfaces of APIsec’s customers, such as details about whether multi-factor authentication was enabled on a customer’s account. UpGuard said this information could provide useful technical intelligence to a malicious adversary.

When reached for comment by TechCrunch, APIsec founder Faizel Lakhani initially downplayed the security lapse, saying that the database contained “test data” that APIsec uses to test and debug its product. Lakhani added that the database was “not our production database” and “no customer data was in the database.” Lakhani confirmed that the exposure was due to “human mistake,” and not a malicious incident.

“We quickly closed public access. The data in the database is not usable,” said Lakhani.

But UpGuard said it found evidence of information in the database relating to real-world corporate customers of APIsec, including the results of scans from its customers’ API endpoints for security issues.

The data also included some personal information of its customers’ employees and users, including names and email addresses, UpGuard said.

Lakhani backtracked when TechCrunch provided the company with evidence of leaked customer data. In a later email, the founder said the company completed an investigation on the day of UpGuard’s report and “went back and redid the investigation again this week.”

Lakhani said the company subsequently notified customers whose personal information was in the database that was publicly accessible. Lakhani would not provide TechCrunch, when asked, a copy of the data breach notice that the company allegedly sent to customers.

Lakhani declined to comment further when asked if the company plans to notify state attorneys general as required by data breach notification laws.

UpGuard also found a set of private keys for AWS and credentials for a Slack account and GitHub account in the dataset, but the researchers could not determine if the credentials were active, as using the credentials without permission would be unlawful. APIsec said the keys belonged to a former employee who left the company two years ago and were disabled upon their departure. It’s not clear why the AWS keys were left in the database.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Signal sees its downloads double after scandal,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/signal-sees-its-downloads-double-after-scandal/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Encrypted messaging app Signal continues to see spiking downloads in the wake of the messaging scandal that saw The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg added to a group chat where high-ranking officials in the Trump administration were discussing an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. The resulting press coverage around the leak of these sensitive plans has been driving more people to check out Signal’s app for the first time, leading to a doubling of its downloads.

According to app intelligence provider Appfigures, downloads rose by 26% on the day the news broke, an indication that users were curious about the app being used by members of the Trump administration. The next day, downloads jumped to 193,000 and by Wednesday hit an all-time high of 195,000, the firm noted.

By comparison, Signal typically sees an average of 95,000 downloads on an average day.

Appfigures has been tracking the impact of the scandal on Signal’s app from day one. It earlier found that Signal app downloads across iOS and Google Play had jumped up 28% on the Monday when the news initially broke, with U.S. downloads up by 45% and downloads in Yemen up by 42%.

The Trump administration has dismissed the seriousness of the incident, where The Atlantic journalist was accidentally added to a group chat between officials.

Although Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth, who was in the chat with VP J.D. Vance and others, denied that “war plans” were shared through the encrypted chat app, The Atlantic later published the full message threads which showed officials discussing the time, location, and weapons the U.S. would use in the attack. Trump has since taken to attacking the media for its continued coverage of the incident.

Signal’s app itself was not compromised to allow for this leak. Instead, the journalist was accidently added to the thread. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz has accepted responsibility for making the group chat in the first place but has deflected blame over the embarrassing mistake.

Appfigures chalks up the doubling of downloads to the old adage “all press is good press,” as the scandal increased Signal’s visibility and likely introduced the app to thousands of users for the first time.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Substack is rolling out a TikTok-like video feed in its app,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/substack-is-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-in-its-app/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Substack continues to double down on video amid TikTok’s uncertain future in the U.S. The company announced on Monday that it’s rolling out a scrollable video feed in its app, making it the latest platform to introduce a TikTok-like feed.

Given the timing of the launch, Substack is likely aiming to capitalize on the potential void left by TikTok if it faces a ban in the United States.

The move comes a month after Substack announced that it would start allowing creators to monetize their videos on the platform and let them publish video posts directly from the Substack app.

Substack first launched native video back in 2022 and later introduced an in-app Media Tab in 2024. The tab has now been redesigned into a scrollable video feed that will feature short-form videos, including video notes and clips from video posts. Substack plans to launch long-form and podcast previews in the feed soon.

Image Credits:Substack

The company believes that the new feed will allow for better visibility and discovery for creators trying new formats while also giving readers a better way to come across new perspectives and voices beyond their inbox.

The new feed also allows Substack writers and creators to move beyond text-based newsletters to explore multimedia content, which the company says they are already doing.

As of February, 82% of the platform’s top-earning writers are using multimedia — up from just over 50% last April, Substack says. The company believes the new video feed will supercharge this momentum, as it allows creators to grow their audience right where they publish.

For instance, a creator who has a Substack newsletter may also post short-form video content to TikTok. Now, they are incentivized to share the same short-from video content on Substack.

With this new TikTok-like feed, Substack is looking to meet the growing demand for quick, bite-sized content. Substack joins numerous other popular apps that have launched their own short-form video feeds following TikTok’s rise in popularity, including Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Netflix, LinkedIn, and more.",techcrunch

Harbinger’s objection, filed late Friday, accuses Canoo of hiding certain assets from the sale process, including what the startup purchased from another bankrupt EV company, Arrival. It also accuses Canoo of listing assets that Harbinger believes the startup did not actually own (though it did not specify which ones). Harbinger said it came to this determination after it considered buying the assets and gained access to the virtual data room for potential bidders.

What’s more, Harbinger says the sale process has so far “unfairly favored Mr. Aquila,” referring to Canoo’s CEO Anthony Aquila, who reached an agreement to buy the assets in early March. Harbinger claims the bankruptcy trustee accepted Aquila’s offer without widely marketing the sale of the assets or obtaining an appraisal.

The objection is the latest twist in the rocky relationship between Harbinger and Canoo. Harbinger was created by a handful of former Canoo employees in 2021. Canoo sued Harbinger in late 2022, alleging that those employees absconded with trade secrets.

That trade secret case was still active when Canoo filed for bankruptcy in January. In fact, one of the things Aquila is purchasing along with the assets is an interest in any settlement Harbinger may wind up paying to Canoo.

One particular clause of the purchase agreement states that Aquila and the trustee have effective approval over any settlement in the Harbinger case. Harbinger argues this could violate the Department of Justice’s handbook for Chapter 7 trustees.

The trustee in the case, Jeoffrey Burtch, and a lawyer for Canoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers representing Aquila and Harbinger declined to comment.",techcrunch

OpenAI is still struggling to overcome the capacity issues brought on by the viral image generation feature the company launched last week.

On Monday, OpenAI disabled video generation for new users of Sora, the company’s suite of generative AI media tools.

“We’re currently experiencing heavy traffic and have temporarily disabled Sora video generation for new accounts,” reads a note on one of the company’s support pages. “If you’ve never logged into Sora before, you can still generate images with Sora.”

OpenAI’s new image generation capability arrived with much fanfare — and controversy — for its impressive ability to recreate styles like Studio Ghibli’s hand-drawn animation. Over the weekend, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in posts on X that the company “hasn’t been able to catch up” since launch and that staff have worked late nights and through the weekend to “keep the service up.”

What are your capacity and performance requirements, and is there any redundancy? These are questions you should ask yourself now and then to protect the data you have.

There is a wide variety of storage options available, from older yet cheaper HDDs for large storage to SSDs for speedy data retrieval — external versions of both HDD and SSD drives, plus highly portable flash drives and cards. Even cloud backup solutions for personal and business users can be essential for securing your own and customer data.

This year, the Amazon Big Spring Sale runs alongside World Backup Day, with many deals from retailers and data protection providers. Now's your chance to pick up some storage deals with money off some of the most popular SSD, HHD, USB, microSD, and other storage solutions.

We've seen some of the fastest Gen 4/5 SSDs going for low prices in these Spring sales, such as the 4TB Samsung 990 Pro selling for just $279 or even the 2TB Crucial T705 hitting $239. Many SSDs, in particular, are selling out fast as people pick up on these storage deals.

We've collated some of the better storage deals and grouped them for you. For an easy comparison of current and lowest-ever prices, you can check these deals against our SSD Price Index, which is updated regularly with the current and lowest-ever pricing history.

SSD

SSDs are fast and commonplace in most laptops and PCs and come in various capacities, up to 8TB for most consumer drives. SSDs above 4TB in size have become exceptionally expensive, with the sweet spot being 2TB at the moment. You should check the PCIe generation and read/write speeds to understand your system's performance and compatibility.

Samsung 990 Pro (4TB) SSD: now $279 at Amazon (was $464)

HDD

Hard drives have been around for a long time, and mechanical drives show no sign of disappearing anytime soon. They may be slower than more modern SSDs, but their price per capacity makes them a great solution for storing larger quantities of data that also don't need blisteringly fast transfer speeds. Ideal for packing into a NAS, HDDs vary wildly in capacity options.

Seagate IronWolf Pro 24TB (2-Pack): now $959 at B&H Photo (was $1,299)

Portable Storage HDD, SSD, Flash

Portability makes backing up your data much more convenient. Being able to transport or even carry with you on the daily, makes portable storage a great option for regular storage and backups.

Portable storage options include SSDs, HDDs, flash memory for cameras/Pi's, flash drives, and even expansion cards for game consoles.

Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S 2TB: now $219 at Best Buy (was $359)



Designed specifically to work with the Xbox Series X|S consoles by replicating the Xbox Velocity Architecture, this 2TB expansion card can increase the storage capacity of your gaming console by holding more games and video clips.

16TB WD Elements Desktop External Hard Drive: now $290 at Amazon (was $309)

This drive uses speedy CMR magnetic recording tech and spins at 5,400 RPM. This is a 'Shuckable' drive, meaning it can be popped out of the enclosure and used in a PC, but that does void the warranty.

With premium video processing, it’s perfect for competition players on a budget.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

I have often discussed what qualities to look for in a gaming monitor. Technologies like Adaptive-Sync, backlight strobing and overdrive are essential, but above them is refresh rate. The 60 Hz offered by enterprise screens won’t cut it today, not even close. When Asus introduced its VG248QE, it raised the bar with a 144 Hz refresh rate. Now, that’s a starting point at best. In fact, I’ll go out on a limb and say that you should consider 240 Hz a minimum speed.

Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of good gaming monitors that deliver a good gaming experience with 165 or 180 Hz. But at 240, you can expect almost complete elimination of motion blur from LCD monitors and zero blur with OLED panels.

OLED remains my favorite tech for gaming, but it comes with a price premium. A 240 Hz LCD like Gigabyte’s GS27QXA is much easier on the wallet. For around $269 at this writing, you get a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with decent contrast, a 260 Hz overclock, Adaptive-Sync, backlight strobe, a solid overdrive, HDR10 with 400 nits and wide gamut color. Let’s take a look.

Gigabyte GS27QXA Specs

The GS27QXA’s IPS panel is a latest generation part with very quick response specified at one millisecond. My real-world tests show it to be a fast panel with almost no blur observed and low input lag. Gigabyte includes a 260 Hz overclock option, but that comes with a caveat, no Adaptive-Sync. Is that a big deal? At 240 Hz and faster, G-Sync and FreeSync aren’t strictly necessary. You might see the occasional frame tea, but when paired with a speedy video card. Frame rates can stay locked at 240-260fps without difficulty. If you opt for AS, it works with Nvidia and AMD PCs and enables a smart overdrive that compensates for changes in refresh rate. The video processing here is of much higher quality than the price suggests.

Image quality is also solid with more than 1,300:1 measured contrast thanks to low black levels and a very bright backlight which delivered over 500 nits for HDR10 content in testing. The color gamut covers around 92% of DCI-P3 so there’s plenty of saturation to make the picture pop. Accuracy is reasonable but calibration makes a significant improvement that’s worth the effort.

The GS27QXA is otherwise a basic gaming display. There are no internal speakers or USB ports. The HDMI inputs are version 2.0 and DisplayPort is 1.4, providing sufficient bandwidth for QHD signals up to 260 Hz with Adaptive-Sync and HDR. There isn’t any zone or field dimming, so you won’t see higher contrast with HDR content. However, the brightness level goes up noticeably, which makes a visible improvement.

Gaming aids include a selection of crosshairs along with Gigabyte’s GameAssist that displays frame rates in real time and a set of timers. The OSD also provides PIP and PBP functions and you can program the control joystick for quick access to commonly used functions.

Not too much has been sacrificed on the altar of value here. The GS27QXA has a minimalist stand, and no LED light show, but it delivers high performance and has everything needed for reliable and fun gaming. And it’s half the price of a similarly equipped OLED which is a great reason to keep reading.

Assembly and Accessories

The GS27QXA comes in the cardboard version of a plain brown wrapper, further showing its high value. Crumbly foam disgorges the contents, which are the panel, and a simple two-piece stand with a small but solid base. Screw the parts together with a captive bolt, snap the panel on and you’re ready to rock. The power supply is internal, a nice touch for a budget monitor, and you get a DisplayPort cable.

Starting up front, the GS27QXA is all business with a super slim flush bezel that’s barely noticeable when the power’s on. A wider strip sets off the bottom with a Gigabyte label front and center. Under that is the OSD joystick, the only control. It navigates a well-organized OSD and makes settings changes a breeze.

The stand is most easily seen from the back where you can see its attachment point down low. I’m not a fan of this arrangement because tilting the panel moves the top away from the user, leaving the bottom unchanged. It’s a little more work to set the panel to your eyepoint. And there’s no height adjustment. If you want the GS27QXA to be vertical, you’ll need some sort of pedestal or a low-slung gaming chair. The tilt angles are five degrees forward and 20 degrees back with no swivel or portrait mode. The stand is quite solid and stable and includes a clip for cable management. Should you opt for an aftermarket arm, there are threaded holes in a 100mm VESA pattern. You’ll need to source your own fasteners though.

The input pack is basic with two HDMI 2.0 and a single DisplayPort 1.4. There are no internal speakers, but you can hear audio through the 3.5mm headphone jack. No USB ports are included.

OSD Features

Pressing the GS27QXA’s joystick summons a quick menu which can take you to picture modes, aiming points, input selection or power off. The four directions can be programmed by the user for a variety of different quick access options.

Gaming is up first with all the GS27QXA’s video processing options. Aim Stabilizer is the backlight strobe and can be used instead of Adaptive-Sync. It’s one of the best implementations I’ve seen with no phasing artifacts and only a 10% brightness reduction. At 240 Hz though, you won’t really need it because the smart overdrive is so good. It varies the overshoot with changes in refresh rate and has zero downside, no artifacts, no fuss. Gigabyte has really done a good job with the GS27QXA’s video processing. What of the 260 Hz overclock? We’ll get to that in a moment.

There are seven picture modes, with Standard being the default and best choice. It includes five gamma presets, four fixed color temps, and a user mode with RGB controls. The GS27QXA comes out of the box looking a tad warm so calibration is recommended. With a few tweaks, greater precision can be achieved, and the difference is visible.

The overclock lives in the Display menu for some reason and enables 260 Hz operation. The caveat is that you no longer have access to Adaptive-Sync. This isn’t necessarily a problem because at that speed, if you can maintain 260fps, frame tears aren’t a factor. Since they occur from changes in frame rate, they can be mitigated by keeping speeds constantly maxed. If you have enough video processing power, that’s easily accomplished.

To view two video signals at once, the GS27QXA includes picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture options. You can move the PIP window around the screen and resize if you wish. This is great for security camera setups.

Quick Switch refers to the OSD joystick and its four directions are programmable. I found the defaults of picture modes, inputs and aiming points to be fine for my purposes. The GS27QXA includes a pared down version of Gigabyte’s GameAssist. Here, it includes four crosshairs, timers, alignment marks and a refresh rate indicator. The info window can be moved around the screen using the joystick.

Asus PA329Q Calibration Settings

The GS27QXA’s default Standard picture mode looked a tad warm to me when I set up the monitor, so I went for the user color temp and its single point grayscale controls. A few clicks later, I had the white point exactly at 6500K for the entire brightness range with no visible errors. The color gamut covers just over 92% of DCI-P3, which is fine for SDR and HDR content. An sRGB mode is available if you want to color grade, but it has some blue oversaturation which might be an issue for some users. I’ve included my recommended settings below.

HDR10 signals are supported with an automatic switch. All picture options are grayed out but you get a nice bump in peak brightness to well over 500 nits. There’s no dynamic contrast though so you won’t see a huge difference in picture quality other than the brighter highlight zones.

Gaming and Hands-on

After spending a few days using the GS27QXA, I found I had almost nothing to complain about. For gaming, there’s definitely no cause for concern. It delivers super smooth motion and no perceptible input lag. I experimented with the overdrive and its fixed settings but found the Smart OD to be the best choice even though I was always locked at 240fps. QHD resolution means the GS27QXA is fairly easy to drive with a wide variety of video cards.

The 260 Hz overclock made little difference. Though I measured 1ms less input lag in tests, this made no change to gaming feel. Losing Adaptive-Sync also had no impact since I could keep the frame rate at 260 easily. I also found no need for Aim Stabilizer. It lowers brightness by 10% and barely changes the level of motion blur which is essentially nonexistent. If you can keep gameplay at a consistent 240fps, you don’t need the extra video processing features. The smart overdrive is among the very best I’ve experienced.

Control response was perceptually instant in circle strafe, 180-degree turns and run-and-gun maneuvers. Competition gamers will want to check out a GS27QXA if they’re looking for a budget 27-inch screen.

The image looked fantastic with rich color and very good contrast. Unless you’re spoiled by OLEDs (my hand is raised) you will have no complaints. The GS27QXA’s contrast of over 1,300:1 is a little higher than the IPS average and among the best in its price class. Playing games before and after calibration showed that a few adjustments are worth making. Try out my values above if you don’t have a meter available.

For the day-to-day, the GS27QXA is a very competent 27-inch monitor. With 109ppi pixel density, there’s no perception of the dot structure at close viewing distances of two to three feet. High brightness means you can see a clear picture in the sunniest room or even in an outdoor tent like you’d use for location video production.

My only nit-pick is the stand. It is not unusual for budget displays to come with a simple stand. The GS27QXA offers only tilt with a low fulcrum so the panel’s top edge moves away from you when adjusting. And with no height capability, you’ll have to angle the screen upwards to meet your eyepoint. I would consider either a pedestal or an aftermarket arm as a solution. I noted the lack of USB ports, speakers and LED lighting but these did not impact my enjoyment.

Takeaway: The GS27QXA is a super competent work monitor and a superb gaming display. Its video processing delivers smooth motion and instant response to control inputs. Play feel is on par with the very best. At $269, it will be hard to beat when gaming is the primary consideration.

https://tomshardware.com,Some Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs are allegedly dying prematurely — over 100 cases documented based on user feedback,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/some-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpus-are-allegedly-dying-prematurely-over-100-cases-documented-based-on-user-feedback,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 18:20:42 GMT","The Ryzen 7 9800X3D, regarded as one of the best CPUs, has captured the attention of gamers seeking to upgrade their gaming rigs. However, AMD's 3D V-Cache chip has also sparked another discussion, as user feedback regarding premature failures on Reddit (courtesy of natty_overlord) has grown to over 100 cases.

The first cases of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D burnouts date back to November last year. However, it seems to be an ongoing issue, as new user reports have periodically popped up over the past few months. Redditor natty_overlord, who did all the legwork, compiled a list of all the user reports with their respective links in the Reddit thread. So far, the tally of dead Ryzen 9000 (codenamed Granite Ridge) processors has reached 120 cases.

According to the statistics, 108 incidents are associated with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, while there have only been two cases involving the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Meanwhile, the remaining 10 incidents originate from the vanilla Ryzen 9000 lineup. Overall, the numbers aren't alarming, considering that AMD sells thousands of these Zen 5 chips. Nonetheless, history has taught us that no matter how small the number of affected cases may be, they still warrant an investigation.

Ryzen 9000 Failures By Motherboard Brands

Swipe to scroll horizontally Vendor Cases Percentage ASRock 98 82% Asus 16 13% MSI 5 4% Gigabyte 1 1%

Most of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D failures seemed to have occurred on ASRock motherboards. Up to 82% of the incidents were on an ASRock motherboard. Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte rank second, third, and fourth, respectively, with participation rates of 13%, 4%, and 1%.

It's important to highlight that the data has nothing to do with motherboard quality or reliability. It could be a matter of consumer preference, as ASRock motherboards are typically more friendly on the pocket than rival brands. It's hard to pinpoint a specific model since the failures have appeared on entry-level models, such as the B850M-X, up to the flagship X870E Taichi SKU.

In February, ASRock released new firmware for its AM5 motherboards that reportedly solves boot issues. The firmware's description reads, ""improve minority proportion of AMD 9000 series CPU boot issue."" While ASRock addresses the boot issues, the company didn't share any information on whether these issues are related to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D dying.

Ryzen 7 9800X3D Failures By Chipset

Swipe to scroll horizontally Chipset Cases Percentage X870 49 45% B850 36 33% B650 16 15% X670 7 7%

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's demise happened on the latest 800-series motherboards and the last-generation 600-series motherboards. However, it was more prevalent in the former, with the X870 chipset accounting for 45% of the failures and the B650 accounting for 33%. At first glance, the problem should not be about motherboard quality since the X870 chipset is usually featured on premium motherboards with robust design and components.

It was the opposite on the 600-series motherboards, where the B650 chipset corresponded to 15% of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D failures and the X670 chipset with just 7%.

Only a thorough investigation can uncover what is truly happening. ASRock Japan previously attributed the issue to a memory problem and stated that the recently released firmware would resolve it. We can't help but recall the earlier Ryzen 7000 burnout scandal related to AMD EXPO profiles and SoC voltages and wonder if we're witnessing a similar malfunction. ASRock retrieved one malfunctioning Ryzen 7 9800X3D, found debris in the AM5 socket, and demonstrated that properly cleaning the AM5 socket restored it to working order. However, not all cases are related to debris in the socket.

The time of failures looks random, with some user feedback pointing to a couple of hours and others to a few months. It's not a contest or anything, but the record is currently at the half-hour mark. The problem continues to spread as we see constant user feedback in the ASRock subreddit's mega-thread. The last report was from an hour ago, where one Redditor showed the underside of his Ryzen chip with scorch marks.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Micron confirms memory price hikes as AI and data center demand surges,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/micron-confirms-memory-price-hikes-as-ai-and-data-center-demand-surges,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:43:12 GMT","Micron has confirmed its plans to raise memory prices, citing strong demand for DRAM and NAND flash in the years ahead. The company's latest announcement suggests that prices will continue to rise through 2025 and 2026 as supply constraints and growing demand from AI, data centers, and consumer electronics drive up costs.

The price hike comes as the memory market rebounds from a period of oversupply and declining revenues. Over the past year, DRAM and NAND flash prices have steadily recovered due to production cuts by major suppliers and increasing demand for high-performance computing and AI workloads. With Micron confirming its intention to raise prices, other memory manufacturers such as Samsung and SK Hynix are expected to follow suit, further solidifying the upward pricing trend.

In a statement to its channel partners, Micron cited ""un-forecasted demand across various business segments"" as a key factor behind the price increase. The company highlighted the increasing demand for AI-related applications and the necessity of maintaining a competitive product portfolio as drivers for these adjustments. Micron also encouraged partners to provide long-term forecasts to help ensure supply stability in the coming years.

(Image credit: Micron)

One of the key drivers behind the price increase is the growing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is crucial for AI accelerators and next-generation GPUs. As companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel push for more advanced AI solutions, the need for faster and more efficient memory solutions has surged. Micron and its competitors are ramping up production of HBM to meet this demand, but supply remains tight, contributing to rising costs.

The company recently announced an investment of $7 billion in a new HBM assembly facility in Singapore, aiming to meet the increased demands driven by AI advancements. The plant is scheduled to commence operations in 2026 and should enhance Micron's capacity to produce HBM3E, HBM4, and HBM4E memory, positioning the company to capture a larger share of the growing HBM market.

Additionally, the broader consumer electronics market is expected to see a resurgence, with PC and smartphone manufacturers increasing orders for DRAM and NAND flash. As device makers prepare for new product launches in late 2025 and 2026, memory demand is projected to remain strong, further justifying Micron's price adjustments.

With Micron setting the stage for a new pricing trend, all eyes are now on how competitors and customers will respond. If demand remains strong, the industry could see sustained price increases, impacting everything from gaming PCs to enterprise data centers in the years ahead.",tomshardware

Quantum Dot paired with OLED panels can produce more vibrant colors and higher peak brightness levels than WOLED monitors, and Acer is taking full advantage of these new entries.

The Predator X32 X2 is a 31.5-inch monitor with a 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) and an impressive 240 Hz refresh rate. The maximum resolution and refresh rate are supported over DisplayPort or HDMI connections. If you don’t have the best graphics cards for gaming to push 4K at 240 Hz or simply prefer a smaller monitor sitting on your desk, the Predator X27U X1 might be more up your alley. It swaps the 31.5-inch QD-OLED panel for a 26.5-inch panel with a WQHD resolution (2560 x 1440) at the same 240 Hz refresh rate.

As expected from Acer’s premium gaming monitors, the X32 X2 and X27U X1 support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. However, Nvidia G-Sync is also likely supported, even though Acer doesn’t specifically call out compatibility. Acer also has you covered with respect to ports, as each monitor features two HDMI 2.1 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4 port. Despite being the larger of the two, the X32 X2 has two 2-watt speakers, while the X27U X1 has two 5-watt speakers. Neither monitor has USB ports, so keep that in mind if USB hub functionality is essential in your buying decision.

https://tomshardware.com,PC enthusiast delidded a 9950X3D using fishing line and a clothes iron,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/overclocking/pc-enthusiast-delidded-a-9950x3d-using-fishing-line-and-a-clothes-iron,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:07:00 GMT","A PC overclocking enthusiast says that they successfully delidded their AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D with just a length of fishing line and a clothes iron. VideoCardz spotted Redditor UserBhoss asserting that the operation went smoothly, and that they saved $60 and the waiting time that ordering a Thermal Grizzly Delid Die Mate would have required.



They wrote that “boy was it scary,” so there’s the cost of shredded nerves to account for.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a highly desirable gaming and productivity processor, as well as a rather expensive piece of tech, so UserBhoss was rightfully nervous when following a makeshift delidding procedure without specially crafted tools.

Current AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D price = $699.99

Compatible Delid Die Mate Amazon price = $54.90

Put off by the cost and wait involved with acquiring proper delidding hardware, UserBhoss says they “did the clothes iron fishing string method.” Later the redditor specified that “Seaguar 15lb 0.11 diameter” fishing line was chosen, which “didn’t snap once.” We are more familiar with DIYers using dental floss for this purpose.

The Redditor provided some further insights into their personal delidding experience, which was apparently their “first ever delid for a CPU.” The process began by using the fishing line to cut through the adhesive between the ‘octopus’ IHS legs and the chip's substrate.

Then, it was time to wield the clothes iron, to heat up the IHS and melt the solder AMD uses to stick this metal to the chip beneath. Holding the iron on the processor for “2-3 seconds, about 5-7 times” resulted in the IHS easily sliding off. Lastly, liquid metal was used to remove most of the remaining indium.

The overclocking enthusiast did actually have some Thermal Grizzly gear to hand for the next step. They employed a TG Direct Die Frame to correctly join the exposed silicon with a custom loop CPU liquid cooling system.

The updated CrystalMark Retro 2.0.0 was made available today, as freeware, and the major change here is that its scope has been extended to cover Windows 95/98/Me systems. Previously, it wasn’t quite so retro, as compatibility only reached as far back as Windows XP. As a bonus, the official benchmark score comparison site crystalmarkdb.com/retro is also now public and fully operational.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

According to the software release notes the development of the key features which make CrystalMark Retro 2.0.0 such an important release began a year ago. Version 1.0.0 was released on this day in 2024, but a user comment on the release seems to have been taken as a direct challenge. A user wrote “You’ve got to be kidding, supporting XP or later, you’ve got to support Windows 98!” And since that time, the developers have been busy on a significant update.

“I decided that Windows 95/NT 4.0 compatibility was necessary to call ourselves a true retro benchmark,” wrote Hiyohiyo, the President and CEO of CrystalMark Inc., in the release notes. “It really took a whole year.”

Hiyohiyo also took the opportunity to thank users, testers, and fellow developers for support in getting CrystalMark Retro 2.0.0 to support Windows systems all the way back to the Win95 era. Hurdles such as IE4 dependency elimination, i386 support, and Windows NT 3.51 support (with a separate patch) were overcome on the way.

Benchmark nostalgia, even on Windows 11

It would have been rude to report on CrystalMark Retro 2.0.0 and not give it a spin, so above you can see my result, top. My overall score looks pretty good for a laptop when compared against some of the entrants on the online comparator. However, more pleasing was the selection of 2D and 3D benchmarks taking over the screen, reminding me of benchmarking programs of old like GEMBench on the Atari ST, or Speedometer 3.X on the classic Mac OS. However, the 3D CPUs flying around the screen in CrystalMark Retro 2.0.0 were a bit more impressive.

More and more folks are interested in acquiring, building or maintaining retro PCs, if my YouTube video stream is a measure of popularity. So, it is good that this updated benchmark can cover Windows 95/98/Me - Windows NT 3.51* /4.0 /2000/XP /Vista /7 /8 /10 /11 - Windows 2003 /2008 /2012 /2016 /2019 /2022 /2025 Server (*Patch needed for NT3.51).",tomshardware

While many users have been frustrated by these problems, Nvidia’s apparent primary focus on its new RTX 50-series cards has only added to their concerns. Now, a new issue has surfaced (via Overclock3D) that may be directly linked, where PC game developers are actively warning users against installing the latest 572.xx GeForce drivers, due to performance and stability issues.

Players using RTX 40 and even some RTX 30-series GPUs have reported problems after updating to the 572.xx driver. Newly released games, including inZOI and The First Berserker: Khazan, have been particularly affected, with players experiencing stuttering or frame drops. Developers of these games have gone as far as recommending users roll back to the older 566.36 driver, released in December 2024, to restore stability. The problem has been widely discussed across Reddit and various forums, with many pointing fingers at the latest Nvidia driver branch as the common denominator.

The overlap between these driver-related issues and the broader RTX 40-series instability raises the question whether Nvidia’s latest driver updates may be contributing to the problems. Reports of random system crashes, unexpected BSODs, and freezing have been piling up in recent months, leaving many to wonder if Nvidia’s focus on optimizing for upcoming hardware is causing unexpected regressions in stability for its previous-gen GPUs.

Despite mounting complaints, Nvidia has yet to formally acknowledge any major issues with the 572.xx driver when it comes to older GPUs. However, the fact that game developers themselves are warning players to avoid the update suggests that the problem is more than just anecdotal. While some users have attempted troubleshooting steps such as clean driver installations and adjusting in-game settings, the most effective solution appears to be rolling back to an earlier, more stable supported driver version.

Until Nvidia issues a fix, affected users are advised by multiple devs to revert to the 566.36 driver via Nvidia’s official website. With an increasing number of users and developers highlighting these problems, it remains to be seen whether Nvidia will prioritize a swift resolution or continue focusing on ironing out wrinkles with its new RTX 50 lineup. For now, those looking for a more stable gaming experience may be better off sticking with older, proven drivers.",tomshardware

Thailand and Vietnam are major production sites for companies like Intel, Seagate, and Western Digital. So far, these companies have not reported on damages and supply disruptions in their chains (at least, there are no appropriate filings with the SEC), but Taiwanese companies with manufacturing capacities in Thailand are indeed checking whether their capacities were disrupted and halting plants if they were, according to China Times.

Taiwanese tech companies — including manufacturers of servers, consumer electronics, PCBs, and even satellite components such as Chicony, Delta Electronics, Zhen Ding Tech, and Inventec — responded swiftly to the Myanmar earthquake. Most operate factories in Thailand and, despite strong tremors, reported no injuries or major damage.

Actions included temporary shutdowns, equipment checks, and staff evacuations, with operations resuming shortly after safety was confirmed. In fact, many of these companies are expanding production capacity in Thailand as part of their Southeast Asia shift from China. Many current facilities are located far from the quake's epicenter and remained largely unaffected, at least according to the report.

ODM manufacturer Inventec said its Thai operations in Samut Prakan and a nearby rented laptop factory were unaffected and running normally. Keyboard maker Chicony confirmed all staff were safe and production was ongoing. Quanta Computer confirmed no immediate problems but would issue updates if anything changed. Zhen Ding (Zhishen) and surveillance tech firm Vivotek also reported no damage or disruption at their Thailand sites.

Delta Electronics carried out a full evacuation at its Thai plant after feeling tremors; the company confirmed structural safety within an hour, and resumed normal operations. Lite-On also reported no impact from the quake.

King Yuan Electronics, an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test company, and c Global Communication, satellite communications, reported no damage at their Thai facilities. Their plants in Rayong and Chonburi were inspected and declared safe, and operations continued without interruption.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

This last program's investment tranche, launched in 2021 for a total investment of 7.6 billion euros, will be focused on several priorities defined by the European Commission.

AI and virtual worlds

Unsurprisingly, the program is no exception to the global craze for artificial intelligence technologies. The funding allocated by the Commission will be used to ""improve the availability and accessibility of generative AI applications, including in the health and care sectors.""

More surprisingly, the Commission also evokes the possibility of testing ""immersive environments, called virtual worlds"". Behind this term, the commission does not really speak of finance a new MMORPG but rather virtual test platforms. These platforms which mobilize technologies of the digital twin type will be mainly planned for the fields of manufacture, construction or industrial manufacturing, as well as in the field of health or education.

The Commission is ready to finance at 20 million euros two prototypes in these various fields, which will allow a first implementation of these technologies and to more clearly define the use cases and associated services.

Do not forget the cyber

The funding released will also go to the cybersecurity sector, in particular in order to finance initiatives orchestrated by ENISA in the support of cybersecurity of hospitals and health establishments across the European Union.

Part of the funds will also be allocated to the protection of submarine cables, an essential digital infrastructure recently shaken by several cases of cable ruptures after the intervention of foreign ships.

In a blog post published last Wednesday, Robin Goldstein, director of Microsoft Identity, said that the new connection process will appear in Outlook, Xbox, Windows and Microsoft 365, among other services.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

The new screens have already appeared, starting with Xbox last month. The deployment will continue until the end of April.

On this date, the more than 3 billion Microsoft users worldwide should see the new procedure when they connect to Windows on their PC and Microsoft platforms on the web.

Rationalization of the authentication user interface

One of the main objectives of the new process is to help users more easily use options, such as passkeys, facial recognition and fingerprint scans.

The current session opening screens always focus on passwords as a default session opening method. A change was essential.

""The rationalization of the design of the UX [User Experience] of authentication has enabled us to rethink the default experiences for the opening of session, by emphasizing the conviviality and security,"" said Goldstein. ""In recent years, we have introduced several improvements, including the possibility of completely deleting the password from your account and the management of key authentication instead of using a password. Our new user interface is optimized for an experience without password and with connection keys first.

The new experience begins with the registration process

If you register for a Microsoft service with an existing email address, you will not be invited to create a password. Instead, you will receive by email a single -use security code that you will need to check for access.

Once connected, you will be invited to create a password. If you do, your password will become the default connection option as far as possible.

""By providing your own email address to a new Microsoft account, you don't need to create a new Microsoft password that could be easily forgotten or guessed by an attacker,"" said Goldstein. ""You just have to check the email using a single use code, which becomes the default identifier of your new account, so that you start without password. In addition, you now have an email address associated with your account if you need to recover your account or start using a new device.

Microsoft also reorganizes the flow of connection screens. Depending on how you are currently logging in, you can face several screens, each with their own choices. This can make the experience too complex and bulky. The new process promises to reorganize the screens more intuitively and to simplify each of them so that they are more fluid.

FLUENT DESIGN Aesthetic

The next step concerns the appearance and conviviality of the new session opening screens. Microsoft repainted them with its full design aesthetics, which gives them a more rationalized and uniform appearance. The screens are more centered to help you focus on them without distraction. In addition, they were optimized to display themselves correctly on all supports, from the small mobile phone to the big desk screen.

One of the features most requested by users is the management of a dark theme. You can choose a clear or dark theme depending on your preferences. The theme of your choice will be automatically activated each time you log in.

I tested the new connection screen with Xbox, and the connection experience is improved. I generally use an authentication application to check my Microsoft account. The new experience improves this method but also offers other types of authentication without password.

How to try the new process now

Web and mobile applications will be the first to adopt new screens. Windows support and Windows applications will follow.

To familiarize yourself with the new process, try it on the Xbox website.

Otherwise, wait until the end of April and you can see how it works in all areas.",zdnet

By analyzing 14 million videos and by questioning 1,100 marketing professionals, the trend described by Wistia in its report ""State of Video 2025"" is clear and it is not a simple fashion effect.

Video production is complex work. So when tools automatize time -on tasks and reduce costs while retaining a qualitative rendering, they are welcome.

This results in an increase of 572% of the use of artificial intelligence for the drafting of legends and subtitles since 2021. In short, more than 60% of respondents use or plan to use AI in this way. Without forgetting that AI is also widely used for vocal dubbing (38%) and translation (31%).

According to data published by Wistia, short videos and tutorials are the content that perform the most. Clips under 60 seconds display the highest engagement rates; Reaching 82% while longer videos (5 to 30 minutes) have 58%. Finally, call-to-action on content of less than a minute allow to convert around 40% of spectators.

And this thing changes the situation. 🤣 To the point that the servers of Openai have struggled to manage the workload for a few days.

On the professional side, you do not need professional skills in terms of design, overpriced software, or even an ounce of artistic talent to produce breathtaking visuals. All you need is your imagination.

Yes because our imagination will soon become the greatest limit of AI. Each new announcement concerning AI clearly shows that creators and marketing specialists are winners. The AI ​​continues to drop the barriers to the entrance into almost all areas. You don't know how to code? There is an AI for this. No design skills? There is an AI for that too. 🤯

In this article, I will explain to you what exactly this novelty means for marketing professionals, and how the generation of images works.

What has changed and why is important

Before getting to the heart of the matter, allow me to give you an accelerated course on the generation of images.

The generation of images uses a machine learning technique. The idea is to take existing images, and gradually add noise. The model then trains by reversing the process, by learning to remove the noise step by step until it can rebuild an image from purely random elements. While learning, the model receives label that describe each image, like ""a cat that plays"", which helps him associate the text with visual patterns.

Once trained, if you type new words like ""a red car"", the model begins with a rough image and the refines so that it corresponds to the description.🤓

At the time, and by time, I mean a few months ago, the generation of images was useful, but unfinished. Even when the results were satisfactory, graphics skills were generally necessary to correct imperfections.

Above all, it was frustrating because the result changed completely when you grabbed again a quick. And it made it difficult to iteration and improvement. In addition, the addition of text to an image was almost impossible. The fonts looked like hieroglyphs, the words seemed invented and the text was often vague. In short, it was a real waste. 😖

Today, with this chatgpt update, you can quickly iterate and the vague text is no longer a problem. Of course, it also has some improvements, such as being faster than other tools and operating directly in Chatgpt.

And so far, I am very, very, very impressed. The power that this update gives to professionals who are not graphic designers is unrivaled. No need to wait until someone else gives life to your vision; You can just get started. 😑

Oh, and I didn't have to pay more to access these features. They are included in the Pro Subscription (and more). In short, you can now create freely using natural language. Instead of Adobe, I am very worried about the turn that events will take in the near future.

How to use AI as part of your digital marketing activity

I will show you exactly how to go from the idea to the launch of the campaign using Chatgpt. If you are blocked or if you're not sure of a step, guess what? Just ask Chatgpt, lol. 🤪

Step 1 - The idea and the concept

I decided to create a line of skin care products. This idea corresponded to several criteria. It has a strong potential for customer loyalty and solves a problem that allows me to create a faithful community.

I called her ""salt"", that is to say ""them"" upside down. For what ? Because I'm chic. 💁‍♂️

Step 2 - Product design

Now that we have a solid concept, let's work on design. Salt is a luxury product, so it must naturally be up to par. Here is the exact prompt I used to create the salt brand image:

""Create a realistic product, studio quality, a luxury skin care brand called"" salt "". Design the product packaging in the form of an elegant rectangular bottle with a burned orange matt finish, accompanied by a matching rectangular box. The bottle and the box must present a minimalist and sophisticated brand image, with the"" Salt ""text in an elegant and modern fate Using a black typography. Homogeneous matching the burned orange color of the packaging.

And here are the results:

I bet it caught your attention. Let's continue. 🤗

Step 3 - Manufacturing

Once the idea and the design is fixed, it is time to take action and have salt made. Using Chatgpt Operator (only in the United States for the moment), I have generated a list of national skin care products manufacturers. 🏭

Here is the pormpt I used:

""Identify a precise and up-to-date list of 5 renowned national manufacturers of skin care products in the United States, specialized exclusively in luxury skin care products. Concentrate specifically on manufacturers that offer high-end packaging options, customizable formulations emphasizing botanical and natural ingredients, and experienced experience in the production of serums, hydrating creamers Treatment.

Once I have my list, I can use Operator to contact these manufacturers for me. 🤞

Step 4 - Design a website

It's time to create the website. I would not use Chatgpt to create a site from zero while Shopify exists. However, I want a personalized theme to stand out.

For this next step, I will ask Chatgpt to offer me some model ideas so that I can adapt the theme of Shopify to my taste.

Step 5 - Marketing campaign

Thanks to Chatgpt, I can develop a marketing concept and an advertising creation.

Here is the concept:

Salt marketing campaign. Lester MAPP via Chatgpt

Here is the text of the announcement I found for my campaign. 🚀

""Sel By holds them hydration and leaves the skin radiant, smooth and nourished. Take pleasure today and enjoy free delivery the same day"".

Step 6 - Sales team

But why stop on online sale? salt should be in store. Thanks to Chatgpt Operator, I can ask the AI ​​to compile a list of large areas in my region.

With this list, I can then use AI to help I write professional quality emails to attract the attention of buyers. I can ask Operator to help me in my efforts by giving it access to my email and the list of my contacts. Thus, AI can help us find an idea and market it. 📈

Yes, you will understand, this update is much more important than the simple fact of doing Ghibli art!

Here is why this update is important

Jeff Bezos said one day: ""Our success at Amazon depends on the number of experiences we have per year, per month, per week, per day"".

Before these innovations, a considerable budget and team needed to obtain the same results. Not only does the AI ​​fills the gap in terms of budget and team size, but it also fills another ditch which people do not even speak yet ... that of time.

It is a question of posting the limits of the possible while achieving the impossible quickly. 🤑 As I said before, the real limit to the success of AI could be our imagination, not the AI ​​itself.

Limitations and concerns

Although I am enthusiastic by GPT-4O and everything he can do, he is not perfect.

Even if the images are incredible and represent gigantic progress, they are not always accurate. AI can sometimes get confused, especially when it comes to detailed requests. Although it is much better than before, we have not yet reached the status of instant masterpieces.

Another element to take into account is originality. GPT-4O creates images on the basis of existing data, so that similar images may appear. You will always need the human touch to create really unique content. 😔

Finally, there is of course a huge problem. Who does this work belong to? As the images generated by AI become more common, it will be more and more complicated to know who holds the rights of creation or how to recognize the original human creators that these AI models have learned the work. We urgently need clear rules on this point. It is essential to determine the appropriate legislation and safeguards 🫠",zdnet

After a few years or even a few months, a mobile phone gives signs of failure. 42 % of French people thus live with a dysfunctional smartphone, according to a study by Télécom Paris, digital limits, the University of Toulouse and Vinci Research Center.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

The most frequent problems are:

Degraded battery (28 % of users)

Saturation of the storage space (23 %)

Unusual slowness (21 %)

Update problems then come to 12 % of people surveyed

If the three -year -old milestone is often quoted as a diffile passage, problems sometimes appear earlier. For half of the users, they intervene in the year of obtaining the smartphone and a quarter during the second year.

Dysfunctions that last for months or even years

Without being able to ensure the financial cost of a repair or replacement of such an expensive device - high -end models exceed the thousand euros mark -, the French must deal with dysfunctions that harm their user experience.

According to the study, problems often last more than 6 months (68 %), or even more than 2 years (36 %), even if they are considered rather annoying (47 %) or very annoying (35 %). Powerless, only 43 % tried to resolve them for themselves and more than half (58 %) of attempted resolution failed.

""The replacement of the smartphone is more often motivated by the frustration linked to the accumulation of hardware and software dysfunctions on the device than by a real inability to use,"" note the authors. As the phone is finally replaced, it is completely unusable in only 14.7 % of cases.

Problems above all software

While the emphasis is often placed on the most visible causes, of the broken screen or failing battery, these material problems, which can be resolved by maintenance, repair or replacement of the defective component, represent only 40 % of the cases encountered.

Most of the problems (60 %) are therefore of software origin. These can be features that no longer work, applications that bug or do not open, updates to the operating system that has become impossible. These software dysfunctions can affect WiFi, GPS, camera or even telephone calls and sending SMS.

Smartphones brands can organize the accelerated renewal of their models. A few years ago, Apple was attacked for planned obsolescence. The apple firm was accused of knowingly slowing down old iPhones during iOS updates or complicating the repair or replacement of components.

Less delicious applications, reinforced repairability

Based on these findings, the authors of the study issues several recommendations to extend the lifespan of our smartphone. They recommend that smartphones manufacturers provide a software guarantee ""and this, over several years. »»

The provision of lighter applications and less consuming data would limit the risk of saturation of storage, would preserve the battery and avoid the slowness of slowness. It is a question of facilitating the management of the storage by the user and of ""making intelligible the data produced by the applications"".

The study also offers ""adding parameters that make it possible to bypass dysfunctions and preserve the battery. In addition, it is necessary to facilitate the repairability of the smartphone. This presupposes from manufacturers and publishers to design equipment and software that the user can repair and maintain yourself.

Finally, the authors offer to extend the repair bonus to solving software problem. For the time being, this state aid only concerns the accidental breakage of a smartphone screen, or replacing the battery, the speaker, the microphone or the photo lens.

This decision comes after an investigation into the company's practices between April 2021 and July 2023, the period during which Apple was accused of abusing its dominant position on the mobile applications market for iOS and iPados.

A victory for mobile application developers

The authority specifies that the intention behind ATT, aimed at protecting the personal data of users, is laudable. But that its implementation is neither necessary nor proportionate compared to the displayed objective.

As a result, mobile application developers could see their advertising revenue assigned by these restrictions imposed by Apple, thus limiting their ability to monetize their products effectively.

The system has notably attracted criticism from several French associations of online advertising professionals. They had filed a complaint in 2020 against the device deployed by Apple. According to its complainants, the authority judged the practices of the company were deemed too restrictive, thus distorting competition.

Necessary to protect the privacy of its users

In addition, ATT is also under investigation in Germany. The competition authority of this country accused Apple, in February, of taking preferential treatment via this tool.

Apple for its part defends a tool that it considers necessary to protect the privacy of its users. But also impose high standards for data protection on its ecosystem.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

According to a recent MacRumors analysis, which has gathered all the information available on this subject, six major features are to be expected for this future model.

1. A fold screen

Apple would have invested massively to minimize the folding brand on the screen.

A combination of technologies applied to the hinge and the slab would provide a surface as smooth as possible.

2. A book format inspired by the Galaxy Z Fold

Apple would have explored different conceptions before deciding.

If some rumors mentioned a valve model, similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, recent information suggests that the foldable iPhone will rather adopt a design that opens like a book, like the Galaxy Z Fold.

3. A software redesign for iOS

The iPhone operating system was not originally designed for use in landscape mode.

A software update is therefore necessary to adapt to folding screens.

Apple would work on this overhaul, notably iOS 19, iPados 19 and MacOS 16, in order to bring greater coherence to the whole.

4. Dimensions close to the iPad Mini

The device, once closed, would offer an external 5.5 inch screen, more compact than current models.

Unfolded, he would reach 7.8 inches, approaching the format of the iPad Mini.

5. Record finesse of 4.8 mm

Apple intends to integrate on this folding iPhone, the technology of the iPhone 17 Air, its future ultra-fine model expected this fall.

Once open, the device could thus reach a thickness of only 4.8 mm, even thinner than the iPad Pro, currently the thinnest product in Apple.

On the other hand, when it is folded, its thickness would be between 9 mm and 9.5 mm.

6. Touch ID replaces Face ID

According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple could replace Face ID with a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button.

This choice would be dictated by thickness stresses: if Apple cannot sufficiently refine the TrueDepth camera module, Touch ID would become the privileged solution.",zdnet

5. Start enter prompts

Once you have chosen a model, it's time to ask chatgpt something. Just type your question or request in the text box. Here are some tips for getting the best answers:

Be precise: the more details you give, the better Chatgpt can understand your request and give you an adapted response. Instead of asking a general question like ""talk to me about dogs"", try something more specific, as ""what are the health benefits of adopting a dog?"" Or ""Can you explain the differences between a Labrador and a Husky in terms of temperament and exercise needs?""

The more details you give, the better Chatgpt can understand your request and give you an adapted answer. Instead of asking a general question like ""talk to me about dogs"", try something more specific, as ""what are the health benefits of adopting a dog?"" Or ""Can you explain the differences between a Labrador and a Husky in terms of temperament and exercise needs?"" Use clear instructions: if you have a specific format or type of response, be sure to include it in your message. For example, if you are looking for a list of ideas, ask ""10 birthday gift ideas for a 10 year old child"" instead of simply asking ""gift ideas"". Likewise, if you want a poem, specify the style, as ""can you write a poem rhymed on the country?"" By being clear, Chatgpt knows exactly what you expect.

If you have a specific format or type of response to mind, be sure to include it in your message. For example, if you are looking for a list of ideas, ask ""10 birthday gift ideas for a 10 year old child"" instead of simply asking ""gift ideas"". Likewise, if you want a poem, specify the style, as ""can you write a poem rhymed on the country?"" By being clear, Chatgpt knows exactly what you expect. Decompose complex requests: if your question has several parts or several elements, take it off into smaller and easier to understand requests. For example, instead of asking ""how can I create a business and what are the legal requirements?"" Ask ""Can"" Can you list the first steps in the creation of a business? "", Then"" What are the legal requirements to record a business in France? ""

If your question has several parts or several elements, break it down into smaller and easier to understand requests. For example, instead of asking ""how can I create a business and what are the legal requirements?"" Ask ""Can"" Can you list the first steps in the creation of a business? "", Then"" What are the legal requirements to record a business in France? "" Providing the context: giving some basic information can help Chatgpt understand the situation as a whole. For example, if you ask for help to write a letter, tell Chatgpt the purpose of the request (for example, ""I need help to write a thank you letter to a teacher"") so that he can adapt his response to this specific context.

For example, if you ask for help to write a letter, tell Chatgpt the purpose of the request (for example, ""I need help to write a thank you letter to a teacher"") so that he can adapt his response to this specific context. Follow up on the question: if Chatgpt's answer does not exactly correspond to what you expected, do not hesitate to ask additional questions or provide additional details to refine the answer. For example, ""Can you explain this in simpler terms?"" Or ""Could you add other examples?"" This allows you to refine the answer and obtain a more precise result.

https://zdnet.com,Career: 5 secrets to achieve your professional goals ...,https://www.zdnet.fr/pratique/carriere-5-secrets-pour-atteindre-vos-objectifs-professionnels-411018.htm,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:01:30 GMT","The Harvard Business Review suggests that professional objectives are notoriously difficult to achieve.

Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. Learn more about the use of personal data

For what ? Because if the effort to be provided is greater than the perceived reward, we are tempted to abandon our objectives.

So, how can you reverse the situation and achieve your professional and personal goals? Five business leaders gave us their advice.

1. Create objectives that you can manage

Bev White, CEO of Nash Squared, says that professionals who want to set significant objectives should know what they want to achieve. ""This is what I call understanding her why and his raison d'être,"" she said. ""Once you are clear on these points, think about what will help you get there and set your goals.""

Ms. White tells ZDNET that it is essential that professionals divide the long -term objectives into elements they can manage. ""The objective of a person can be the ascent of Kilimandjaro. But there are many stages on the path that leads to this destination: training, physical condition, equipment, logistics, planning, travel"" she says. ""You must therefore decompose your large objective into constituent elements and get down to it"". Ms. White also says that professionals must be realistic about their objectives. ""If it appears that a goal is not achievable, do not be afraid to change course. It is part of the learning and development process.""

Besides, if you stick to your goal, don't forget to celebrate the little successes that mark your journey. ""This maintains your motivation and encourages you to continue,"" she adds. ""It is also useful to share your goals with a mentor or a person you know and in whom you trust, because it makes the goal more concrete. This person can encourage you and share with you the celebration of your little successes throughout your journey.""

2. Accept your naivety

Chris Kronenthal, DT of Freedompay, encourages professionals to start naively and prepare to become as practical as possible. ""You need this naivety,"" he said. Mr. Kronenthal gives ZDNET the example of entrepreneurs who launch an innovative business. Most start-ups fail. But statistical probabilities should not prevent you from continuing your dream, whether it is to reach the top of your profession or create a prosperous business.

""It will be difficult. But to take the first step, you have to be naive and believe that we will be this 1 % that will succeed."" According to Mr. Kronienthal, there are two essential success factors to achieve his personal goals. ""The first is a mentor. And it is not someone who just spends time with you during your free time. It is someone who is critically committed to your development and who has already done it before,"" he said.

""Second, achieving your personal goals takes longer than you think. You should think that your success is only a matter of time.""

3. Collect with other people

Jeff Palmiero, technical VP at Raymond James, says that to achieve its objectives, you have to be tireless.

""I always try to approach perfection as much as possible,"" he said. And he cites as an example how he uses dashboards of his observability platform to verify the performance of business applications. ""Each indicator should not necessarily be green. But when we encounter problems, I want people to work with developers to reach perfection.""

Palmiero explains to ZDNET that collaboration with people outside your service can help you achieve your goals, which it notes when it sets objectives. ""Perhaps the result of these discussions is that 800 milliseconds is the best response time than because of the nature of what should happen during a process,"" he said.

4. Push the limits

Madoc Bathers, Cloud manager at Warner Leisure Hotels, believes that courage is the keyword. ""It takes determination. I practice a lot of substantive race, which allows me to train to set goals outside work. This gave me a state of mind that allows me to overcome obstacles. I must continue to push the limits"".

Mr. Batters explains to ZDNET that it is essential to listen to the advice advice. But you also have to have self -confidence. ""You have to take it into account. But if they are part of the decision-making process, you are also part of it,"" he explains.

Mr. Batters also encourages professionals to put into perspective. ""Try to take a step back from the current situation and understand how a decision affects the future"".

5. Build a network

According to Cynthia Stoddard, Adobe's computer director, to set and achieve personal goals, you have to stay open to new challenges. ""A few days ago, I participated in a round table in France and a question was asked:"" Did you intend to become DSI? ""It was not the case,"" she said. ""The way I touched my career was to examine different opportunities, get out of my comfort zone and try new things.""

Ms. Stoddard says that she had voluntary for missions throughout her career. ""Sometimes I liked what I was doing, sometimes not,"" she said. ""But at least, I knew that I had experienced this work and that I could scratch this area from the list of things to do.""

Above all, she insists on the fact of establishing relationships. ""To succeed, people have to know you, that they know what you know, what are your interests and your abilities. This is how I have evolved in businesses. This is how I built a network. And now I am at Adobe"".",zdnet

When my wife's Kindle DX found himself blocked by planned obsolescence, I therefore felt a little shiver of excitement at the idea of ​​facing Dark Bezos.

The idea was of Jailbreaker the Kindle so that she could again read her favorite books on this very comfortable large format reader.

Jailbreaker with care

Be careful, it's a very bad idea, for example, to jailbreaker your phone. According to a study published this month, rooted Android devices (jailbreake) are the subject of 3.5 times more malicious software attacks. System compromises caused by rooted devices that pass the firewall of a company are much worse. These attacks are 250 times more numerous than for non -rooted devices.

Ancient Kindles, like the DX, are obsolete precisely because they cannot maintain a network connection. The DX connected to Amazon via 3G networks, most of which were dismantled. Thus, all that the jailbreaking has on this device is to allow the reading of certain books.

Last year, my wife wanted to do a spring cleaning on her DX. She therefore reset her by thinking that she could download her library again. But since she could no longer get a network connection, she could not record the device. Therefore, she was unable to charge any book on the device.

Rather than throwing the device, know that it is possible to ""jailbreaker"" and add an open source electronic book reading software. This can give him additional years of life.

In this article, I will explain to you how the Kindle Dx jailbrox. Each device has somewhat different methodologies. So use this article as a guide for the general approach. Unless you also have a DX, you will need to carry out your own research and readings for other readers.

Which Kindle do you have?

The starting point for this whole process is to identify the Kindle model with which you work and the firmware (firmware) currently installed on the Kindle. You can find both in the Settings menu of your Kindle.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

My serial number begins with B009 and I use the firmware 2.5.8. With this information, you can go to the Wiki page of Kindle standard numbers, find the prefix of your serial number, then the code of your pseudo Kindle. In my case, B009 indicates that I use a graphite Kindle DX, known as DXG.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

This will help you determine where to start your jailbreak process. If you have a more modern Kindle, go to the Jailbreak page on the mobileread forums. As I work with a much older Kindle DX, I start with a specific discussion thread on the DX jailbreak.

Depending on the device you have, you will have to look for instructions and files. As I use the DX, this is the path I will follow here.

How kailbreaker your kindle

The process is a bit like looking for pieces of a treasure card. You start with an index and follow it for a while, then you branch off by following another clue. In our case, clues are messages posted on discussion forums. Treasure pieces are the files related to these forums.

And, yes, this is a somewhat risky process. You will download unbenaged files from random forums on the Internet. Anything can be attached as a payload. The only positive point is that these forums are very populated and that the messages pinned are regularly updated, which makes it possible to hope that the Jailbreak community will find and expose any unavailable payload.

The next step was to go to the file page for versions 2.X, 3.X and 4.X of the firmware. I downloaded the Kindle-Jailbreak-0.13.n.zip file on my PC.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

I then decompressed this zip file from Jailbreak and found a different jailbreak files, each being intended for a specific configuration.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Then, I connected a micro USB cable to my Kindle DX and I connected it to my PC. My Kindle then got into USB key mode.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

I opened the Kindle reader from Windows and dragged the Update_jailbreak_0.13.n_dxg_install.bin file in the root directory of my Kindle.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Note that I specifically chose the version with ""DXG"". This brings us back to our first step, where I found the nickname my Kindle nickname. It was DXG, so I installed the dxg_install_bin file.

The next step is to perform the update. To do this, you must first eject and disconnect the Kindle from the PC. I pressed the Kindle DX physical menu button, then I selected update your Kindle.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

This is where things become a little bizarre. Okay, it was already weird from the start, but this time, it was a little more worrying. First, the Kindle updates.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Then, once the update is finished, the Kindle reported a failure, with a small U006 error in the lower left corner of the screen. Fortunately, the instructions of Jailbreak specify that ""it is completely normal, wanted and harmless"".

So, yes, trust the process.

Install the Mobileread Kindlet kit

Then I had to install an MKK file (Mobileread Kindlet Kit), which seems to install a sort of developer certificate. This is documented on this page, and will redirect you to another page to find the file and download it.

I downloaded the MKK zip file and extract its content.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Once again, the repertoire contained a binary -dxg-, which I therefore downloaded on my Kindle DX. Then I ejected my Kindle and launched the Update Your Kindle process. It took a few minutes and a few manipulations for the Update Your Kindle option to appear.

I ended up restarting the Kindle, navigating up to settings, then pressing menu. The update option has then displayed and I chose it.

This time, the Kindle said that the update was successful.

Install Launchpad to test the jailbreak

There are two launchers available for jailbreake Kindles.

One is Launchpad, which works on the old Kindles.

The other is called KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher).

Launchpad uses Kindle's keys to launch applications. KUAL uses a graphical interface to launch applications.

Kual works on the DX, but it is a little difficult to install, especially in this stage, I had not yet confirmed that the jailbreak really worked.

Launchpad settles down quite easily, and I only used it as a quick way to confirm that I could add applications to the Kindle and execute them.

So I installed Launchpad.

According to a scheme that becomes usual, I downloaded the Launchpad Zip File and I decompressed it. Then I found the bin file appropriate and I downloaded it in the root directory of my Kindle. I accessed Settings, then to Menu, and I launched Update Your Kindle.

Launchpad contains a large number of predefined keys sequences. Once the Kindle is mounted as a reader, you can go to the Launchpad repertoire and watch the content of servicecmds.ini. One of these commands is Shift S, which puts your Kindle in screen saving mode.

Test the operation of Launchpad

To test the operation of Launchpad, eject the Kindle of your computer. Then, on the Kindle, press the uppercase twice, then on the S key, all in quick succession. A small ""success"" message should be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and the Kindle should go into standby mode (by displaying one of its famous graphics).

When it worked for me, it indicated that many things worked. This meant that the main jailbreak had succeeded because I was able to execute an additional application which was not that of Amazon. And that meant that I could execute localized orders, even if the interface is a bit clumsy.

Where this tool is quite powerful is that it allows you to define shortcut keys that run scripts on your Kindle. This goes beyond this article, but go to the Launchpad directory at the root of your Kindle device and read the Readme file. It will help you start if you want to configure keyboard shortcuts.

Install KUAL to launch applications

It is now time to install KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher). It is available on the Mobileread Snapshots page. I downloaded the first Tar file from Kual and I extracted the files.

The installation of KUAL is different from the one I carried out previously. The Readme file describes different procedures according to the Kindle you use. For my former Kindle DX, I put the Kindle back in USB key mode and I dragged the KUAL-KDK-1.0.AZW2 file in the Kindle Documents folder.

Kual thus appears as a book on the home page. Just click on it to throw it. And no, I don't know what these letters mean to the right of the name.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Unfortunately, I encountered a problem, as shown in the screenshot below.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

To solve this problem, I read this forum message and I downloaded this correction of the time and date of one of the forum users. This is an update file, so decompress it, slide the bin file corresponding to your device in the root folder of the mounting Kindle, eject the Kindle and run Update Your Kindle (update of your Kindle).

The different Kindle models can encounter different but similar problems. The file whose link is above only concerns Kindle DX models. If you encounter the same problem with another device, do what I did: glue the error message in Google with the ""Kual"" channel and start the treasure hunt.

Once the update process has been completed, a click on Kual made it possible to display a screen containing only KUAL. Here's what it looks like after installing the Koreader electronic book reader.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

Install Koreader

Koreader is a very customizable electronic book reader that supports EPUB, PDF, DJVU, XPS, CBT, CBZ, FB2, PDB, TXT, HTML, RTF, DOC, Mobi and Zip. Let's start with the installation.

There are four different versions of Koreader for the Kindle. To find out which version corresponds to your device, see this page. As I use the Kindle DX, I downloaded the Legacy version from the Koreader distribution page.

The installation consists of decompressing the distribution file, then dragging the Koreader folder to the root of the Kindle, the content of the Launchpad folder in the Launchpad folder of the Kindle and the content of the extensions folder in the Kindle Extensions folder.

Once it is done, just throw Kual, wait a while, then click on Koreader.

Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET

It takes a few minutes to get used to the interface, and navigation is slow enough on the Kindle DX. That said, leaps from the page are not terrible and the reading experience seems just as pleasant as when the DX was able to download and display the Kindle books.

A new life for old electronic devices

I spent a few hours to urge insults during this operation. But now I have a device that works again.

A big thank you to the dedicated coders and the members of the forum who have developed and documented these jailbreaks for the benefit of the Kindle community.",zdnet

As soon as a victim clicks on a phishing link, the phishing kit asks the MX Record of the victim's email domain to determine the service provider used. On this basis, a fake login page is generated in real time, which is deceptively based on the actual registration portal of the respective provider. The special feature: Morphing Meerkat uses configurations that are actually intended for other, legitimate purposes as the basis for personalized phishing attacks. It is a kind of ""living-off-the-country"" technique in the DNS version, in which attackers cleverly lean on existing IT infrastructures to stay under the radar.

Morphing Meerkat offers cybercriminal series of possibilities

Theft of login data

Once a victim has entered his login data on the fake page, Morphing Meerkat steals this data and sends it to the cybercriminals.

Diversions

In order not to suspect, the phishing kit forwards the victims to the real registration page of the mail provider after some failed login attempts.

Global range

The phishing kit can translate the fake login pages into numerous languages ​​and thus target users around the world.

Individualized traps

The attack is particularly convincing by the dynamic adjustment of the fake page based on the MX Record.

Veiling

The platform uses various techniques to avoid traditional security systems and not be recognized. These include open redirects on Adtech servers and the disguise of code to make the analysis difficult.

Scalability

As a Phaas platform, morphing meave also enables technically less experienced attackers to start large-scale phishing campaigns and thus present a massive threat.

If cybercriminals through a phishing scam such as Morphing Meerkat get into the possession of login data, this can have dramatic consequences, especially for companies. With these potentially, attackers are given access to networking, sensitive data and systems - and can start further attacks from the corporate environment. This can lead to enormous financial damage, loss of reputation and legal consequences for companies. In addition, attackers can specifically send phishing emails to employees or customers via compromised accounts-and thus continue their attacks even more efficiently and cause far-reaching damage.

Organizations can protect themselves against this type of attacks by improving the protection of their DNS. This includes a stricter DNS check so that users cannot communicate with DOH servers. Blocking access to Adtech and File Haring infrastructure that is not required for business can also be a sensible approach. Because if you consistently remove unnecessary services from the network, you remove the basis for many of your gate.",zdnet

""The expectations of Genai's performance are currently falling, since many first feasibility studies fail and the results so far often do not convince,"" said John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Nevertheless, providers of basic models invest billions of billions every year in order to further improve the size, performance and reliability of their Genki models.

https://zdnet.com,Phishing attackers are increasingly relying on Russian 'bullet proof' domains,https://www.zdnet.de/88421278/phishing-angreifer-setzen-zunehmend-auf-russische-bullet-proof-domains/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:08:16 GMT","These domains are operated by 'Bullet-Proof' domain hosts. You are known to have reported malicious websites that are misused for phishing attacks and to ignore and ignore abuse reports. For 2025, the researchers expect a further increase in the use of such domains for phishing attacks.

The main goal of the attackers seems to be the collecting of Microsoft credentials. Links and QR codes are sent by email to lure victims to a fake-microsoft landing page, on which they should then enter their registration data. In order to avoid a quick discovery, the attackers send the links and QR codes via email attachments. Deriance links, often embedded in multi-layered HTML attachments, as well as polymorphic and dynamically generated URLs, an early detection also difficult.

Takedown largely excluded

But even if it succeeds in recognizing an attack, a rapid takedown is largely excluded, since the fake websites and emails are operated via 'Bullet Proof' domains. Abuse reports are often deliberately ignored here by the providers. As a rule, they have their homeland in states in which the laws on cyber crime are only weakly developed or simply not enforced. The result: attackers can initiate large -scale attack campaigns from here and bring minimal disorders to a successful conclusion.

As part of their almost two-month investigations, the researchers from Knowbe4 were able to assign the campaign to around 1,500. 377 of these domains were registered with the 'Bullet Proof' registration office R01-RU alone. More than 13,000 malignant emails were sent from here. 2.2 percent of the observed emails from .ru domains were phishing emails. The frightening: Many of the identified and analyzed phishing emails had successfully overcome professional email security solutions, such as the Exchange Online Protection, Barracuda Email Security Gateway, Mimecast and Cisco Ironport.

Risk factor human

The examination of the knowbe4 Threat Labs shows that simple anti-phishing tools and training courses are no longer sufficient to recognize attacks that target people as a risk factor in good time and ward off successfully. Companies must take a comprehensive view of the risks to which corporate IT is exposed to by their own employees. Phishing training, training and tests with AI have long been personalized, tailored to the individual weaknesses of each individual employee, and automatically used.",zdnet

OpenAI product leader Nate Gonzalez announced in a post on LinkedIn on March 27th, US time that he will release the new feature, which was most requested by business users of ChatGPT. This feature allows ChatGPT to connect to internal knowledge sources. This means that employees can ask ChatGPT to answer questions, provide summary, and generate content for files stored by companies within the company.

The first source of information will be Google Drive, which will be available to use, and will be responding gradually over the next few weeks. Once it becomes available, you will receive a notification to your internal ChatGPT operation administrator that it can now be set up. Once set up, you will be able to connect to the Google Drive storage you use internally, and ChatGPT can look up files and provide the information and assistance you need.

Google Drive is just the first source of information available. Gonzalez said OpenAI plans to introduce more connectivity capabilities. He did not give a specific name, but he listed several categories. This feature will also be available to ChatGPT Enterprise users soon.

Gonzalez said: ""This is just the beginning. The team is already working on a second installment of connectivity features, aiming to accommodate all of the key internal knowledge sources that users currently use, including collaboration tools, project management tools, data analytics platforms, and customer relationship management (CRM). These new connectivity features will soon be available for ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise users.""

At $25 per user per month, ChatGPT Team is aimed at any group that wants to share ChatGPT, which can be entirely or within the company. In contrast, ChatGPT Enterprise is for large businesses with over 150 employees, and fees are determined by the requirements of each company.

Privacy and security are always a concern when you have your company's sensitive data used by AI. Gonzalez emphasized that ChatGPT Team has security and privacy management capabilities that can be managed by operational administrators. It also states that OpenAI does not train models using data from ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise accounts.",zdnet

Will you go home as is? --The interpretation from leading companies",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230968/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","With the growing labor shortage and the spread of cashless payments, unmanned/manned stores are expanding. In this article, we will explain the mechanisms, benefits, and challenges of various unmanned stores, while experiencing the unmanned store systems developed by TOUCH TO GO (TTG) and NTT Data.

Unmanned stores can be broadly divided into ""self-checkout"" types, where customers scan and pay for products without the need for store staff; ""walkthrough types"" types, where customers automatically make payments when they pick up the product and leave the store; and ""vending machine types"", which allow you to operate around the clock without staff. The common benefits are stable store management with no-managers/small people and improved convenience for customers.

The core elements of realizing self-checkout/walkthrough stores are the AI ​​camera on the ceiling and the weight sensor on the product shelf. In many cases, the AI ​​camera on the ceiling captures the movement of customers, and the weight sensor on the shelf that it picks up, linking two types of data to recognize ""who took what"" in real time.

Self-checkout store where you can shop by passing by

TTG, which operates an unmanned payment store system, has steadily increased the number of stores introduced in 2020, starting with the opening of TOUCH TO GO Takanawa Gateway Station Store (Minato-ku, Tokyo), and is a leading figure in the spread of self-checkout stores. FamilyMart utilizes its unmanned payment store system, and as of September 2024, it has 44 unmanned payment convenience stores nationwide.

Stores that have introduced TTG's unmanned payment store system, which is characterized by the fact that visitors do not need to prepare to register as a member when they enter the store, allowing them to enter and pay by passing by. The AI ​​camera and weight sensors can recognize who took what, so there is no need to scan the product barcode at checkout. When a customer stands in front of the register, the product details and total amount are displayed on the display screen.

Since many self-checkout stores allow you to enter the store on your way by passing by, it is believed to go well with stores such as stations where you often stop by. In fact, TTG's unmanned payment store system is used at unmanned stores selling souvenirs on the Tokaido Shinkansen platforms 16 and 17, as well as at take-out stores for Mister Donuts at the commercial facility Atre Shinanomachi. Although there is still an accounting process, it can be said that the reality is that it is aimed at unmanned/maintenance in stores due to the convenience and convenience of purchasing.",zdnet
