Waverton Investment Management and London & Capital Combined into W1m.

The CEO of W1M, Formerly Waverton Investment Management, has said he was conscious of other failed rebrands like abrdn while selecting the firm's new name.

WAVESTON'S MERGER WITH LONDON & CAPITAL LAST YEAR LEFT CEO GUY MCGLASHAN SEARCHING FOR A NAME THAT COULD UNITE BOTH FIRMS without excluding EITHER.

Eventually it landed on w1m, the postcode of the first London & Capital office and a similar name to the acryym of Wim for Waverton Investment Management.

When asked how the firm had avoided having to roll back the rebrand like ABRDN, McGLASHAN Told City Am: ""You clearly want to come up with a name that is not going to be mocked roundly.""

When Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management Merged in 2017, The Company was Dubbed 'Stabledeen' by some in the City.

As a response, the firm adopted the new name ABRDN in 2021, but faced widespread mockery across the media for its moniker.

The firm eventually announced last month that it would be retiring the disemvowelled name, with CEO Jason Windsor stating that it had become a “Distribution”.

Others in the Financial Sector, including Brooks MacDonald, have quickly walked back their rebrands within months of rolling them out.

McGlashan was eager to avoid this with w1m: ""Conscious that there has been a few instances where you might have said there was a bit of a misspell on the rebrand.""

However, beyond being mocked by the media, the ceo was also keen to make sure clients were happy with the rebrand and understood what the firm was still offering.

""Ultimately, a name is a name,"" he concluded.

The merger between the two firms has left w1m as one of the largest wealth managers in the country, with combined assets of over £ 21bn.

After the merger with London & Capital, McGlashan said he was ""keeping an eye out"" for any other opportunities to buy that might fit with the company, but was not ""trawling the market"".

""We have got a very clear idea of ​​who our target market is, and high just worth and ultra high just worth clients,"" he added. ""That's who are going after.""",cityam

Dazn has the global rights to the Club World Cup

Dazn is looking to sublicense its rights to broadcast the Club World Cup in the UK this summer in a bid to take its coverage of the historic tournament to the widest possible audience.

The London-headquartered sports streaming service acquired the global rights to Fifa’s first 32-team edition of the revamped competition earlier this year in a reported $1bn deal and has pledged to show all 63 matches for free worldwide on its app.

It has already reached an agreement for the US market to share some Club World Cup matches with Warner Bros Discovery’s TNT Sports, TBS and truTV and Spanish language network TelevisaUnivision.

With just over two months to go until the action kicks off in the States, Dazn confirmed to City AM that it is exploring a sublicensing arrangement in the UK.

“We’re looking at it at the moment, to try and reach more people,” said Pete Oliver, Dazn’s CEO of Growth Markets.

“We’ve not announced anything on sublicensing. What I can tell you is that all 63 games will be completely available for free on the Dazn app.

“This is probably the first time in many years that people will get access to a tournament like this for free, because the Champions League isn’t free, the Premier League isn’t free, and so on.”

ITV previously showed interest in carrying the Club World Cup, reportedly submitting a cheeky offer to Fifa to show it for nothing, but could face competition from the BBC and Channel 4.

Dazn to send team and talent to Club World Cup

Dazn operates in 200 markets around the world and works with rightsholders including the NFL, Formula 1, NBA, Uefa, the Bundesliga, Serie A and LaLiga.

It is perhaps best known for its wide-ranging coverage of boxing, where it has exclusive deals with promoters Matchroom and Queensberry, and MMA, working with the UFC.

For the Club World Cup Dazn will send its own production team and presenters to the US, with announcements on talent expected over the coming weeks.

“There’s been a bit of cynicism here. What we see, particularly in Europe, South America, the Middle East, is there’s huge excitement for the tournament,” Oliver added.

“I think when it starts, people here will see four games a day for 30 odd days with Real Madrid, PSG, Juventus, obviously Chelsea and Man City. I think people will be very excited about it.”",cityam

The UK expects to be hit by Donald Trump’s tariffs this week, No10 has said, amid frantic discussions to secure an exemption for UK businesses.

The government has been trying to negotiate to spare British exports from the taxes on imports into the US which are set to come into force later this week on what Trump has branded ‘Liberation Day’, claiming the tariffs will boost the US’ domestic economy.

The US president has announced a 25 per cent import tax will be imposed on all imported cars, which is set to hit British luxury car makers such as Aston Martin, on top of a series of tariffs set to take effect on April 2, which could include 20 per cent on all UK goods.

Speaking on Monday, the Prime Minister’s official spokesperson said: “When it comes to tariffs the Prime Minister has been clear he will always act in the national interest.

“We’ve been actively preparing for all eventualities ahead of the expected announcements from President Trump this week, which we would expect the UK to be impacted by alongside other countries.

“Our trade teams are continuing to have constructive discussions to agree a UK-US economic prosperity deal.

“But we will only do a deal which reflects this government’s mandate to deliver economic stability for the British people, and we will only act in the national interest.”

Asked if the government had given up on a deal being signed before Wednesday, the spokesman refused to “put a time frame on those discussions” but that they are “likely to continue beyond Wednesday” and that the UK will “take a calm and pragmatic approach”.

Starmer and Trump discussed the “productive negotiations” the two nations have had towards an economic deal in a phone call on Sunday, and agreed “talks will continue at pace this week”.

US tariffs could damage the government’s hopes of growing the economy, and would come into force just days after Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled public spending cuts – including to welfare – at the Spring Statement in a bid to shore up her narrow fiscal headroom.

Asked if the government would hold another Budget in the event of tariffs, the spokesman said the UK will “reserve the right” to respond “in a way that does protect British industry”.

He added: “We’ll obviously always take an approach that suits the British economy. We’ll have a budget in the autumn, and the OBR will obviously update the forecast at that point.”

Economists believe Trump’s sweeping tariffs could deteriorate the UK’s weak economic outlook if they do come into effect.

The consultancy Capital Economics predict that tariffs will weaken the pound by about 4 per cent this year while inflation could rise 0.5 per cent higher than previously expected.

Bank of England interest rate-setter Swati Dhingra has suggested that Trump’s tariffs will have less of an impact on price growth than many expect.

Pantheon Macroeconomics said that Trump’s tariffs will make the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)’s decision in May “harder” but it has stuck by its prediction that interest rates will be cut.

The hit to GDP growth is the main concern, however.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent fiscal watchdog, said after last week’s Spring Statement that tariffs could hold UK growth back by as much as one per cent in the scenario where Trump slaps 20 per cent tariffs on all goods imports.

Trump’s tariffs alone could destroy Rachel Reeves’ £9.9bn headroom, according to OBR chair Richard Hughes.

“The net result is that the Chancellor’s fiscal headroom is also almost wiped out by the fifth year of the forecast,” said Hughes.

Andrew Griffith, shadow business and trade secretary, said: “This news is potentially a hammer blow not just to British businesses and workers but to his own Chancellor whose creative accounting at the emergency budget fails to include the impact of tariffs.

“Labour claims talks with the US are going ‘well’. But, if this is what well looks like, I wouldn’t like to see what the opposite looks like.

“The Prime Minister has so far failed to come up with the goods, he needs to rekindle our US trade deal. This is just further proof that, when Labour negotiates, Britain loses.”",cityam

Global markets plummeted ahead of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day.’

The latest escalation in Trump’s trade war painted global markets red on Monday.

This new headache came ahead of Trump’s so-called ‘Liberation Day’ on April 2, which has investors bracing for a broad set of fresh tariffs.

The President will slap 25 per cent tariffs on all automotive imports in the US from Wednesday, with more expected to follow.

Shares across the globe tumbled as the President’s latest step of trade aggression triggered yet another sell-off.

The FTSE 100 fell over one per cent by Monday afternoon, with the FTSE 250 down nearly two per cent.

Dow, S&P and Nasdaq suffer ‘Trump Slump’

The Dow slid 300 points as markets opened in the States, before falling over one per cent.

S&P 500 immediately sank by over 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq exchange fell by over two per cent following market open.

Goldman Sachs predicted trade escalations would stunt US economic growth, with economists anticipating three cuts to interest rates throughout the year.

The investment bank projected inflation would hit 3.5 per cent, which marks a leap from the Federal Reserves two per cent target.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Another day, another sell-off on the markets, marking 2025 as one of the most gruelling starts to a calendar year for investors in quite a while,”

He added: “Donald Trump continues to be the key reason why markets are having a bad day.

“He has now threatened to target all countries importing goods into the US with tariffs, further clouding economic prospects around the world.

As backlash to trade escalations mounted, Trump told NBC news on Sunday that he “couldn’t care” if car prices rise because of tariffs.

“People are going to start buying American-made cars,” he added.

FTSE ‘unable to dodge the latest volley of news’

Mould noted in a mid-day update despite March’s “wobby start” the FTSE 100 continued to “confound both the doubters and those who think that stock markets start and end in New York.”

In the last six months the FTSE 100 has gained around four per cent, despite pullbacks from geopoliticial tensions.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: “Despite its performance amid the turmoil as something of a defensive play, the FTSE 100 was unable to dodge the latest volley of news and sunk at the open.”

Commodity producers and banks dragged the index down, with the FTSE 350 Banks index falling nearly two per cent.

This was partially driven by Close Brothers shares sinking nearly nine per cent ahead of the lender’s landmark motor finance hearing set to begin tomorrow. Pets at Home also plunged nearly ten per cent after forecast future troubles in a trading update.

Gold prices hit another record high on Monday as investors retreated to the safety net of the yellow metal. Prices topped $3,100 (£2,395) an ounce.

Meanwhile in Europe, by the mid-afternoon Germany’s Dax and Cac 40 in Paris had lost over 1.5 per cent and Amsterdam’s AEX slumped one per cent.

The woes continued in Asia, with markets across the region marking losses as they closed this morning.

The motor finance scandal heads to the highest court in the land.

Judgement day nears for some of the UK’s biggest lenders as the motor finance scandal heads to the country’s highest court this week.

The Supreme Court will decide whether to uphold the Court of Appeal’s October ruling that it was unlawful for banks to pay a commission to a car dealer without the customer’s informed consent.

The hearings will take place from 1-3 April, as Close Brothers and First Rand look to get October’s judgement overturned.

If an adverse judgement is handed down to the banks, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will confirm an industry-wide redress scheme within six weeks.

Any scheme brought forward by the FCA is predicted to rival PPI on both scale and cost, with analysts predicting major ramifications across the financial industry.

Both a judgment and a redress scheme could come ahead of lenders’ half-year results, with the UK’s top banks set to post a six month update in late July.

In annual results reports, lenders have reserved funds for potential payouts, which have resulted in major losses for the likes of FTSE 100 giant Lloyds.

Total claims could be north of £30bn

Lloyds led the pack for facing the biggest hit in provisions after the bank put aside a near £1.2bn.

Besides Lloyds, major lenders with historical exposure to the matter include Barclays, Bank of Ireland, Close Brothers and Santander.

Analysts at RBC Capital produced an impact assessment that forecasted potential repercussions following the Court’s ruling.

Total compensation could reach £32bn, analysts said, which aligns with ratings agency Moody’s view that claims could top £30bn.

The RBC analysts estimated the base case impact across the banking sector, which included compensation, interest and administration costs, would be £5.9bn.

However, consensus on possible downsides nearly doubled this figure to £10.8bn.

Should the saga steer towards downsides, analysts expect Lloyds to add another £1bn in compensation, bringing its total to £4.6bn when including interest and administrative costs.

Shares across UK lenders sank into the red following to Court of Appeal’s ruling, with Close Brothers losing 6.5 per cent and Lloyds down three per cent.

Following the Treasury’s rejected intervention in the case, Close Brothers shares sunk as much as nine per cent, and Lloyds were down four per cent.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said shareholders would be “watching nervously” with the hearing marking the “next milestone” in the scandal.

Smaller lenders facing ‘existential’ threat

Firms outside of the industry giants who have exposure to car finance have also faced hits, with Secure Trust Bank and Vanquis Banking Group losing between 10 and eight per cent after the Supreme Court brushed off the government’s intervention.

Anna Sherbakova, senior analyst at Moody’s ratings, said: “The continued uncertainty is particularly credit-negative for small banks with high exposure to motor finance, as they need to maintain substantial capital and liquidity buffers for potential consumer compensation costs.”

Read more Close Brothers shares plunge as motor finance costs mount

For the bigger lenders with deeper pockets, Sherbakova anticipated an adverse ruling “would likely be limited given their high levels of capital, strong profitability and ability to adjust financial policies to absorb any potential costs.”

Andrew Foyle, partner at Shoosmiths, said the outcome for smaller lenders could be “existential”.

He added: “The sector has already seen some lenders scale back or pull out of the market completely.

“Ironically, that might be bad for consumers as less choice and less competition in the market tends to result in poorer deals for customers.”

Helen Simm, partner at Browne Jacobson, said: “It seems inevitable that full redress across all disclosure complaints will cause several lenders to exit the market.”

Impact will be ‘far wider’ than car finance

The precedent set by the Supreme Court’s ruling is expected to make waves beyond the banking sector.

Tom Webley, partner at Reed Smith, warned of the “shockwaves” heading towards lenders and wider industries.

Webley said the “huge potential impact” on the economy was the headline reason for the government’s attempted intervention.

The Treasury had amplified lenders’ concerns that resulting fines could trigger a withdrawal of companies from the sector and prevent customers accessing credit to buy cars.

But, Webley highlighted the “impact could be felt by any organisations which provide credit through a commission-earning intermediary.”

“This should be being monitored closely by any entity involved in the provision of finance through intermediaries or whose sales depend on such financing arrangements.”

How did we get here?

The FCA first began investigating the motor finance market in 2016 due to growing concerns over lending practices.

A 2017 report from the regulator titled ‘Motor Finance Market Study’ raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the way car finance dealers were structured.

The regulator introduced stricter rules in 2019 requiring lenders to clearly disclose the total cost of the car finance, including any additional charges or ballooned payments.

The fallout of this led to significant compensation claims as customers believed they were mis-sold or overcharged on their deals.

The use of discretionary commission arrangements (DCA) were forbade in 2021, with the FCA claiming it would save customers £165m a year.

In a landmark ruling in October 2024, the Court of Appeal found it was unlawful for car dealers to receive commissions from lenders without the customer’s informed consent.

Ahead of the Supreme Court battle, the Treasury attempted to intervene in the case sharing fears over the impact on the economy, but was swatted away by the Supreme Court.

Rachel Reeves is doomed to raise taxes in the autumn, the IFS has warned.

Businesses account for over a quarter of all UK tax receipts, according to new research by Thomson Reuters.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would become more “pro-business” than previous governments in the run-up to last year’s election.

But new data by Thomson Reuters raises questions about the Chancellor’s record in office as companies face an “ever more complex tax landscape”, according to Thomson Reuters.

The total paid by companies has almost doubled between 2014/15 and 2024/25, new research has shown.

Analysts said the sharp increase from £114bn to £215bn was driven by an increase in the rate of corporation tax.

The current rate stands at 25 per cent.

The increase in employers’ national insurance will only add to businesses’ share of all tax receipts as the government seeks to raise some £24bn a year.

Multiple other taxes are hammering companies’ income, including business rates and the Digital Services Act.

The Energy Profits Levy also raises funds from profits earned by oil and gas companies. A key business taskforce said ministers should axe the tax, the Financial Times reported.

The North Sea Transition Taskforce said the current rate of 27 per cent on oil and gas profits should be replaced by a more proportionate regime in order to draw greater investment.

The higher load means that businesses now pay around 25.6 per cent of all UK tax.

Firms are also paying more on compliance, according to Thomson Reuters’ executive Jas Sandhu Dade.

“In-house teams are facing an ever more complex tax landscape,” Sandhu Dade said.

Now innovation and technology have become essential to compliance.

“With the volume of their work growing faster than firms’ capacity, technology is quickly becoming an essential way to not only manage the increased workload but also to improve results.

“Tools like generative AI present compliance advantages. Businesses are increasingly investing in AI-powered tools such as e-invoicing software to improve VAT compliance, helping to prevent conflict with HMRC.”",cityam

Primark boss Paul Marchant has resigned after an investigation into his behaviour by Primark’s parent company ABF.

ABF’s share price fell nearly four per cent after the announcement.

ABF Finance Director Eoin Tonge will act as Primark chief executive on an interim basis, while ABF Group Financial Controller Joana Edwards will act as interim ABF Finance Director.

Marchant acknowledged his “error of judgement” and “accept[ed] that his actions fell below the standards expected by ABF”, the company said.

The investigation into Marchant, initiated by ABF and carried out by external lawyers, was initiated in light of an allegation by an individual about his behaviour toward her.

Chief executive of ABF George Weston said he was “immensely disappointed”.

“At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential. Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.

“Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual,” Weston said.

ABF said the company seeks to provide a “safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment” where employees and third parties are treated with “dignity and respect”.

“It is, indeed, a very disappointing, to say the least, end for Mr., Marchant and all at Primark and

ABF, where he has overseen the development of a fine value-based retailer with strong prospects

for growth,” Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said.

“That said, we concur with the views of Mr., Weston around the bigger factor of dignity

and respect being more important than any one person, no matter how senior.”

‘The change at the top will be unsettling’

Marchant has led the multi-billion pound company, known for its high street presence and fast-fashion fare, since 2009.

He led Primark through a period of significant growth and international expansion, with the retailer now boasting more than 450 stores across 16 countries.

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown: ’The change at the top will be unsettling particularly given that Primark delivered a very mixed bag of results at the last count.

“Primark continues to be the main story for ABF, bringing in around half of the group’s revenue, but performance has been very varied across regions.”

In its latest set of quarterly results, the brand reported UK sales of 0.3 per cent while overall sales fell 1.9 per cent.

Primark, which relies on in-store rather than online shopping, has suffered from low footfall as well as lower consumer spending in the UK.

“It’s clearly concerning investors who may be mindful that it could be an even greater challenge to revitalise Primark’s revenue – given that full-year guidance was lowered slightly from mid-single-digit to low single-digit growth.”

As WH Smith disappears from the high street, Will Bosanko looks at why the brand failed, and asks whether there is a future for TG Jones

WH Smith’s disappearance from UK high streets marks the quiet end of a once-iconic British brand. After months of speculation, the books and stationery chain is set for a £76m sale to Modella Capital, with plans to rebrand 480 stores as TG Jones.

But this isn’t just another story of high street decline. It’s a stark case study in what happens when a brand loses relevance. The business has failed to ruthlessly articulate what it stands for, leaving consumers confused about its story.

So, where did WH Smith go wrong?

The confusing ‘WHS’ rebrand

Let’s start with a lack of clarity. It became increasingly unclear what the WH Smith brand stood for, why it mattered or how it fitted into modern life. And in today’s landscape, relevance is everything. If people don’t know your value, they’ll go elsewhere.

Take its tentative “WHS” rebrand trial in 2023. It lacked confidence, failed to cut through and only deepened consumer confusion. A brand refresh isn’t just about a new logo or design tweak, it requires a clear articulation of the business vision and its value to all audiences. Without that, even the most established brands can lose their footing.

WH Smith’s failure to evolve

This wasn’t just a branding misstep; WH Smith failed to evolve. Businesses and brands must move in lockstep with changing consumer behaviour. As digital consumption soared and customer expectations shifted, WH Smith clung to a tired paper goods formula.

Where was the reinvention? The standout proposition? The compelling reason to choose WH Smith over Amazon, Waterstones or the convenience of supermarket bookshelves? It never materialised.

Away from the high street, the software giant Adobe offered a masterclass in reinvention, leaning into the market shift towards digital-first subscription-based models. Rather than clinging to legacy revenue streams from its Photoshop and Illustrator products, it committed to repositioning itself as a cloud-based, AI-driven creative solutions company.

While WH Smith’s travel division thrived, serving a captive airport audience, the core high street business stagnated. The company became a textbook case of inertia: not adapting, not differentiating and, ultimately, not surviving.

The road ahead: A shot at reinvention

Now, with a focus on its more successful travel division, WH Smith has one shot to reset. But success will require more than just maintaining presence in airports and train stations.

To remain relevant, it must define a sharp, compelling offer for today’s travellers. That means understanding what it uniquely brings to the journey, beyond convenience. It also requires building a brand fit for purpose to communicate that evolved role with clarity and confidence.

No half-measures. No hesitation. Without a distinctive and meaningful role, the travel division risks following the high street business into irrelevance.

Will it survive as TG Jones?

Meanwhile, for TG Jones, the acquisition and name reset is both an opportunity and a risk. A blank slate allows reinvention, but it also demands a bold and decisive strategy. If the brand is to resonate, it can’t rely on nostalgia or attempt to replicate WH Smith’s past success. The formulaic name alone spells a potential problem there.

Instead, Modella Capital must instil this empty vessel with a clear, differentiated proposition from day one. It must rebuild belief among customers, employees and stakeholders alike. That means creating a compelling retail experience that aligns with modern shopping habits and innovates where WH Smith stagnated. This way, it will establish credibility, not just presence, on the high street.

Relevance isn’t just a nice-to-have; it is the fundamental difference between growth and disappearance.

The stormy economic outlook overseas creates an opportunity for the UK to act as a safe harbour for investment, writes City of London Corporation policy chairman Chris Hayward

The Chancellor has taken some necessary steps to shore up the nation’s finances, and in recent weeks major investment moves, from the Lower Thames Crossing to the ongoing work around the £70bn National Wealth Fund, signal serious backing for infrastructure investment. We welcome it. But now’s the time to go further.

The stormy economic outlook overseas creates an opportunity for the UK to act as a safe harbour for international investment.

The City remains the engine room of the UK economy, fuelled by inward investment driving sorely-needed productivity growth in London and beyond. But we must do more. And the government’s recent announcement that HM Treasury and the Office for Investment will work in partnership with the City Corporation to create a concierge service for foreign direct investment is to be greatly welcomed.

To grow, to compete and to lead globally, the UK’s financial and professional services (FPS) sector needs two things: strong foundations at home, and ambition abroad.

At home, that means economic growth, regulatory predictability and the right skills pipeline. Abroad, it means getting on planes, banging the drum for Britain and securing market access for the sectors driving our economy.

There are immediate opportunities on the table, quick wins that will bring real benefits to businesses on both sides of the trade relationship.

Next week, I’ll be in Switzerland to champion the UK’s world-leading financial and professional services sector (FPS) sector and support the implementation of the Bern Financial Services Agreement (BFSA), the world’s first deal of its kind.

The UK and Switzerland host Europe’s two largest financial centres, whilst being in Europe but outside the EU. Our trade is worth nearly £46bn, half of which is in services. The BFSA sets a new paradigm, one that could become the blueprint for future UK deals.

We’re working with firms to make sure they’re ready to take full advantage.

Negotiations on an enhanced free trade agreement (FTA) between our countries must also tackle critical cross-cutting issues, such as mobility, digital trade and data flows. An aligned FTA and Bern Agreement would streamline processes, unlock new markets and boost jobs and growth in both nations.

My next visit will be to New York, Washington DC and Chicago. The UK and US are natural partners, home to the world’s two leading financial centres. Yet there is more we can do.

In an ideal world, we’d see mutual recognition of financial services and an expanded US-UK Data Bridge. However, trade talks take time. In the meantime, we’re pushing for deeper regulatory dialogue, enhanced technical cooperation and practical tools for innovation.

We’ve seen results before, the UK-US Data Bridge in 2022, joint coordination on financial stability during the Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank crises, and the 2018 Covered Agreement on insurance. Let’s build on that.

Looking ahead to our ongoing EU engagement, when I will visit Luxembourg and Brussels, we recognise that a positive, constructive and forward-looking relationship will be beneficial to both sides.

We welcome the continued improvement of EU-UK relations, which have moved into a constructive space that allows for mechanisms such as the UK-EU Financial Regulatory Forum, to progress. Ongoing regulatory dialogue can enhance bilateral trust and combat any fragmentation.

The City of London, as global financial hub, is uniquely positioned to ease access to global capital markets, bridging investment gaps on both sides of the Channel.

The future of financial services, our largest export sector, depends on collaboration – nationally and internationally.

We’ve made progress. But now is the time to move further and faster.

Shawbrook announced strong growth across its loan and deposit books.

A combination of environmental regulations and falling office attendance means commercial property is struggling and the Spring Statement was a missed opportunity to turn it around, says Dan Drogman

The UK’s commercial property sector is being strangled from all angles, and this year’s Spring Statement was a missed opportunity to relieve that pressure.

Let’s start with the ever-changing landscape that we in the industry face.

Firstly, there are the energy upgrades. With a looming interim 2027 deadline for landlords to upgrade their buildings to meet higher energy standards, the cost of retrofitting remains a major barrier. Over three quarters of London’s office buildings are currently below the minimum legislative standard of EPC C, and will need to be upgraded by 2030 to meet EPC B. That means that an equivalent of 15m sq ft per annum will need upgrading, at an extortionate cost. But retrofitting is good for business. It helps to attract and retain tenants, it avoids assets being stranded and it can future proof a building against future regulations.

From the other direction, businesses are adapting to hybrid working, and landlords are facing higher borrowing costs. A recent Centre for Cities study found that while Londoners are now spending over half their working week in the office, when it comes to office attendance the capital is behind other major cities such as Paris, New York, Singapore and Sydney. These are tricky problems to navigate. Together, they’re a cocktail of pressure squeezing the life out of the sector.



The importance of this sector shouldn’t be overlooked. The industry contributes billions annually to GDP and tax revenues, making it vital not just for net zero ambitions but for the UK’s broader economic recovery too.

So, what can be done?

Targeted Support

Most people in the sector acknowledge and support that carbon emissions are a huge issue for us. Not only do we accept that, it’s also a good business move because better efficiency means cheaper energy bills.



However, we’re seeing that tax relief alone is not enough to unlock large-scale retrofit projects. Many landlords still face tough financial decisions on whether to upgrade, repurpose, or sell assets that no longer meet tenant expectations or regulatory requirements, and assets face being devalued as a result.

For London, where office space demand is evolving, government incentives must go further.



Retrofitting is not just about compliance; it’s about repositioning buildings to remain competitive in an international market increasingly defined by high-quality, tech-enabled, sustainable workspaces.



In our globalised economy, employees demand more from their workplace, so a more ambitious approach, such as targeted retrofit grants or green lending schemes, would go further in making large-scale improvements viable.



Read more Central London’s office market outperforms New York and Hong Kong

Business rates – a barrier to progress

As it stands, once you have completed the upgrade, you’re out of the frying pan and into the fire.



Landlords investing in energy-efficient upgrades are often penalised rather than rewarded.



This outdated system is fundamentally at odds with the UK’s net zero ambitions and must be overhauled to incentivise sustainability.

London’s commercial landlords are already contending with rising operational costs, evolving workplace trends, and tighter ESG requirements.



Business rates reform should be at the heart of the government’s strategy to unlock investment in the sector, allowing landlords to upgrade properties without the fear of an immediate tax hike.

We risk a wave of stranded assets

Without meaningful reform, London risks falling behind global competitors.



The UK’s slow policy response could leave a significant portion of its office stock stranded and unsuitable for modern businesses. This makes them increasingly difficult to lease or sell.

The capital’s commercial market is already experiencing a flight to quality, with prime office spaces attracting tenants while secondary stock struggles. If outdated buildings are left behind, the knock-on effect will be severe resulting in rising vacancy rates, declining investment and weakened economic activity in one of the world’s leading financial centres.

The government has the power to future-proof London’s spaces that support the UK economy and sustainability goals. But to do so, it must take urgent action to remove the financial and regulatory barriers holding the sector back.

As it stands, the Spring Statement has done little to reassure landlords and developers that the government truly understands the scale of the challenge.



It must now listen to the sector and, at what will be a pivotal Autumn Budget later this year, deliver the policies that will drive meaningful change.

Employment rights is always a balancing act between businesses and workers, but Labour’s legislation swings too far in one direction, says Karen Jackson

As an employment discrimination lawyer I’ve devoted my legal career to protecting the rights of workers from discrimination and harassment in the workplace. I see the harsh reality of what really goes on but even I cannot think Labour’s Employment Rights Bill is anything but a howler. There’s not enough space in an article of this length to spell out all its deficiencies but what strikes me the most is both the lack of practical reality and the lack of balance in this Bill.

Employment rights always engage the tricky balance between the rights of the business and the rights of the individual. Whilst the earnest aim of Labour’s Bill is undoubtedly to redress this balance, in my view it swings too far the other way. The Bill takes no account of the burden on SMEs which fuel growth in the UK. It relies too much on secondary legislation to provide the detail of many of the provisions. If it receives Royal Assent it will create uncertainty and stymie growth.

There are some good bits. Fire and rehire is an abusive practice used by employers to place their workers on less favourable contracts. I am entirely in favour of outlawing this. Big corporations use this to bully employees into accepting worse conditions. Some zero hours contracts are abusive but zero hours contracts do have a place and for some employees they offer a welcome way to work flexibly. Some employers are calling for amendments around the zero hours provisions because they employ seasonal workers and need flexibility (fruit pickers, Christmas staff).

Day one employment rights already exist across the protected characteristics of the Equality Act 2010 and selected other areas (whistleblowing) but those rights are balanced against a stringent burden of proof. It is not easy to win a discrimination claim. Introducing a day one right to unfair dismissal is ludicrous. Two years is probably too long. Why not revert to 12 months as previously? Employers must be able to hire and choose the best people for the job. You cannot test the skills and suitability of a candidate until they start work. Day one unfair dismissal rights will be a deterrent to hiring. Unless the detail around probationary periods is nailed down before this becomes law it will be chaos – not to mention the burden on the already beleaguered Employment Tribunals service. These provisions are unworkable and they will kill jobs.

A new level of Orwellian

News that the Fair Work Agency (FWA) is to have seize and enter powers takes the Bill to a new level of Orwellian. If you are running an SME and you inadvertently get your pay calculations wrong can you expect the FWA to barge into your home to seize your laptop? The Bill assumes that much bad conduct by employers is deliberate. In my view it is among big corporates that the worst culprits are to be found. They can buy their way out of any situation with their deep pockets. SMEs already live in fear of Employment Tribunal claims.

Clause 20 of the Bill rightly drew much criticism in the Lords. Since October 2024 employers have been liable for acts of sexual harassment against their employees by third parties. The Bill proposes that non-sexual harassment should be unlawful but is unclear on how this would work. It is also unclear as to how this can be balanced against the fundamental human right of freedom of expression, which is already a battleground across schools, universities and beyond across the UK.

In the Commons reading there was a suggestion that pubs might employ ‘banter bouncers’ to police the conversations of customers. This suggestion was rightly met with derision

In the Commons reading there was a suggestion that pubs might employ ‘banter bouncers’ to police the conversations of customers. This suggestion was rightly met with derision. Should café owners have a sign on the door listing topics of conversation that are not permitted if you wish to eat in their establishment? In a time where oversensitivity and the ability to offend are legitimate concerns how can this possibly work? It is a fetter on free speech. Employees have a right to be protected from harassment but third parties have a right to express their legally protected beliefs. The Equality and Human Rights Commission highlighted their concern about this in a recent press release. In the words of Lord Young of Acton: “That is an extremely complicated area of law, and I do not envy publicans trying to get their heads around that.”

This Bill in its current form should not pass. It has already undergone many amendments on its passage through parliament – I predict it will be significantly watered down in order to become workable. Let’s hope I’m right.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)

The leaking of a US government Signal group showcased one thing in full force: JD Vance’s hatred of Europe is driving foreign policy, writes Eliot Wilson

We have all done it. Including someone in a group chat or an email chain who should not be privy to the contents can be embarrassing or downright damaging. Few of us, however, are members of the Principals Committee of the United States National Security Council, which elevates last week’s flabbergasting breach of security to a new level of seriousness.

While we shake our heads at the national security advisor, a former colonel in the Green Berets, using emojis to sum up US foreign policy, there are some elements of the content we should not overlook. Running through the machismo and frat-house aggression is one very significant thread: the profound antipathy of Vice President JD Vance towards the nations of Europe.

This should not be a surprise. The speech he gave at the Munich Security Conference in the middle of February hardly pulled its punches: he talked about “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values” and warned that “if you’re going to enjoy competitive economies… you need mandates to govern”. This is a man who had not wholly been joking when he predicted that the United Kingdom would be the first “truly Islamist” country to have nuclear weapons.

JD Vance’s group chat messages

The Signal group chat, entitled “Houthi PC small group”, went further still. Vance expressed his reservations about taking military action against Houthi militia to protect commercial shipping because it would benefit Europe far more than the United States.

“3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does,” he complained. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.”

JD Vance did not argue that American interests were not served by air strikes, acknowledging that three per cent of US trade used the route through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Even here, Michael Waltz, the national security advisor, added a qualification.

“The trade figures we have are 15% of global and 30% of container. It’s difficult to break that down to US. Specific because much of the container either going through the red sea still or around the Cape of Good Hope our components going to Europe that turns into manufactured goods for transatlantic trade to the United States. [sic]”

At least a former soldier was able to explain how the global economy works. Even if Vance was correct, though, follow the logic: he was reluctant to support action which would benefit the US economy, because it would benefit Europe more. For him it is a zero-sum game.

Any doubt was removed by his grudging acquiescence. When Waltz went on to say that only the US Navy had the capabilities to defend against the “sophisticated, antiship, cruise missiles, and drones the Houthi are now using”, and was supported by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, Vance conceded. “If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”

‘European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC’

This was not a debate over whether US interests were affected. Even Hegseth, as brutal in his approach to Europe as Vance (“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC”), showed no doubt that the military action was about “Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest”. It is easy enough to see why the disproportionate benefits to Europe would stick in a MAGA craw. But only the Vice President seemed to find it so noxious that it was overpowering.

For all the rhetoric of transactional relationships and hard-headed realism, Trumpism has always been a creed of visceral emotion. The President last week described Europe as “countries which have abused us for decades”, and during his first term said, quite falsely, that the European Union “was set up to take advantage of the United States”. For Trump, Europe is just one entry on a long list of malign actors attempting to bilk America, including Canada, Japan, Taiwan, China, India, Ireland and NATO.

Vance, even in this company, is an outlier. His comments on Signal demonstrate that he is willing to contemplate some disadvantage to America, so long as that to the Europe he so despises is greater. We now know what we suspected: in an administration that is a cold house for Europe, the Vice President is the frostiest presence of all.

In the lead up to the 2024-25 Investec Champions Cup round of 16, City A.M. has put together a barometer in partnership with Investec to assess which teams are hot – and which are not – ahead of this week’s knockouts.

Team of the week: Munster, Ireland

It hasn’t been a smooth season for Munster: they’ve won seven and lost seven matches in their domestic URC and won two and lost two in the Investec Champions Cup pool stages.

But at the weekend, in a local Irish derby against Connacht at the iconic Páirc Mhic Éil, they came out 24-30 winners despite being a man down for most of the game after Alex Nankivell received a red card.

It was testament to the side’s ability to stick with the plan and stay in the game, even while they’re between permanent head coaches at the moment.

And it will put them in good stead ahead of this weekend, when they take on former player Ronan O’Gara’s La Rochelle side over the English Channel.

La Rochelle aren’t what they used to be but have earned a home tie in the round of 16, and can often find a way to win in this competition when nothing but a loss looks possible.

It’ll be a huge challenge for Munster but they look to be finding some form.

Champions Cup who’s hot…

Benetton prepared for their first ever knockout tie in the Champions Cup with an impressive home victory over Cardiff. They take on Castres Olympique, who are usually formidable at home.

Sale Sharks have the squad to cause an upset and have history in beating heavy favourites. Their win over Northampton on Friday is a good appetiser for their attempt to beat champions Toulouse on Sunday.

…and who’s not

RC Toulon know they’ll be playing a weakened Saracens this weekend after the Londoners said they’d rest players. But they haven’t warmed up well, losing 28-26 to Castres at the weekend.

Harlequins have a tough old tie this weekend, heading to Croke Park to take on Leinster. They struggled to compete with Bath last weekend, though, losing 47-28 at the Rec.

Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy has hit out at the club’s transfer spending critics after the north London club made a loss after tax of £26.2m last year.

Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy has hit out at the club’s transfer spending critics after the north London club made a loss after tax of £26.2m last year.

The figure is a reduction on the £86.8m loss suffered in 2022-23 and the accounts for the year to 30 June 2024 showed a huge decrease in Uefa prize money from £56.2m – when the club reached the last 16 of the Champions League – to just £1.3m, in the season Spurs failed to qualify for European competition.

Chairman Levy said: “Since opening our new stadium in April 2019, we have invested over £700m net in player acquisitions.

“I often read calls for us to spend more, given that we are ranked as the ninth richest club in the world. However, a closer examination of today’s financial figures reveals that such spending must be sustainable in the long term.”

Spurs revenue streams

The 63-year-old, who has held his position at Tottenham since 2001, added that the club “cannot spend what we do not have” and will not “compromise the financial stability of this club”.

Much of the club’s loss of income from football has been cushioned by revenue gained from hosting events such as the NFL, rugby and concerts – including a run of Beyonce shows which will return this summer.

The club last year received local authority permission to increase the number of non-football events at the stadium to 30 per year, and will this month host the high-profile boxing bout between Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn.

“I want to thank everyone who supports us through good times and bad. We are resilient and passionate about our club,” Levy concluded. “We shall aim to finish this season as strongly as we can and continue to build for success on the pitch.”

Spurs are 14th in the Premier League, 15 points off the top four with nine games to play.

Elsewhere, Everton recorded a seventh straight loss. Though their £53m deficit is lower than the £89m sum from 2022-23, the club’s total losses over the last seven years are now £570m.

Nottingham Forest, on the other hand, announced a £12m profit after £101m of transfer sales saw them convert a heavy loss of £69m in 2023 into a solid return.

It boasts its own cricket, football and rugby clubs, and is flanked on all sides by the likes of the London Metal Exchange, SAS Institute and the London School of Business and Finance.

It was also the home of Saracens in the City, an event which saw the Premiership club host a pre-season friendly centred around the commercial opportunities the Square Mile provides.

The HAC, however, had seemingly been ditched by the great and good of the sport. Until now.

Because on 1 May the likes of Spain, Harlequins, Saracens and corporate giants will field teams in the inaugural London City 7s.

London travesty

“It’s been two years now since the sevens [World Series] has not happened in London, and the fact that there’s no leg of the new World SVNS series in Europe, let alone London, is a bit of a travesty,” organiser Dan James tells City AM.

“We want to step into that space with a bit of gusto and do something exciting.”

James used to work with World Rugby developing the current HSBC SVNS Series, which has ditched London completely having been a popular destination for fans on the circuit.

But the London City 7s will see a mix of international, domestic and invitational teams playing against each other across the Thursday, while the bar remains open until 2am.

It is, James hopes, the beginning of a new franchise model that will take in key global cities with a mixture of teams, local and international, involved.

“The way we’re positioning this is that it is the first Thirsty Thursday of the summer,” he says. “It’s getting darker later, hopefully a bit warmer, and it is just before the bank holiday weekend.

“So you’re expected to be in the office for half of the day but you can probably get away with being out for the afternoon for some lubricated networking.”

London City 7s bonanza

There’s no disguising it, the London City 7s is certainly a throwback to the traditions of the Square Mile Thursday – where the haunts are five deep at the bar and the sun shines on the avenues that converge on the Bank interchange.

This event seems to encapsulate the urge to keep the City relevant and modern in our sporting calendar, with events such as the London Marathon also playing that role, while tapping into the cultural habits that have made the Square Mile such a networking hub.

And commercially speaking, James and the London CIty 7s are already seeing the benefits of choosing the financial district.

Bomb Squad Lager – created by Springbok double Rugby World Cup champions Steven Kitshoff and Malcolm Marx – is on board while Stadium Support Services is helping with the venue and Looseheadz is the charity partner.

But what is the bigger picture? James insists there’s a space for this, given how disunited sevens as a rugby discipline is.

“So the way we want to position this,” he adds, “Is one leg of a city series, so four to six locations around the world as part of a franchise tournament – an IPL [Indian Premier League cricket] or LIV Golf-style event.

“But we’ve got to do London and do it very well first.

“Hopefully, if this does go well, when it does go well, we’ll then be moving into that global space very aggressively, to pull together something that rugby hasn’t had before.”

Sun, sangria and City sevens

What’s better than sun, sangria and sevens? Sun, sangria and sevens in the City.

London City 7s appears to fill the gap left by the sevens circuit when it ditched the UK.

Spain are confirmed as the first international team, with exciting rumours surrounding which other jet setters could land in the capital to take part, and Saracens and Harlequins will send teams too.

Throw in some corporate fun and networking and the foundations are there for a superb event, with both general admission and hospitality tickets available to purchase.

“If we can give it the foundation to stand on,” James concludes. “I think it can play a big part in revitalising rugby as a sport for the younger audiences.

“Rugby is not even in the top 20 of most engaged sports for the younger generation of Gen Z which is really damning.

“This is a shorter game with less politics – it’s very engaging. We’ve got a very good opportunity here to try and recapture that younger market while still delivering something which serves the old boys.”",cityam

https://cityam.com,The Porsche Taycan is brilliant. Why is Porsche struggling to sell it?,https://www.cityam.com/the-porsche-taycan-is-brilliant-why-is-porsche-struggling-to-sell-it/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:30:26 GMT","The Porsche Taycan is brilliant. Why is Porsche struggling to sell it?

The Porsche Taycan epitomises the malaise in today’s EV market like no other car. On the face of it, this is probably the best electric vehicle you can buy. It’s comfortable, efficient, looks futuristic and is beautifully built. Plus it drives, well, like a Porsche. So why did worldwide Taycan sales plummet by 49 percent in 2024?

In a word: depreciation. Rapid improvements in battery technology, coupled with car buyers’ increasing scepticism towards EVs, mean you can pick up a three-year-old Porsche Taycan with average miles for less than half what it cost new. At the time of writing, there are 884 used Taycans for sale on Auto Trader, with prices from just £36,000.

Granted, if you’re a company car driver who chose an EV because of the tax benefits, that won’t matter. But any private buyer getting into (and then out of) a Taycan is going to take a heavy five-figure hit. This might be a luxury car, but nobody likes to lose money.

The long ranger

However, if your business is paying the bills, or perhaps you’re reading this in 2028, when the updated Taycan is three years old and 50 percent of the price, this is still a very compelling EV indeed. And the positive financial news is that the most affordable model, as tested here, is really all the Taycan you need.

On with the review, then. The base Taycan – called simply ‘Taycan’ – starts from £86,500 and is the only version with a single electric motor and rear-wheel drive (all others use a motor on each axle to power all four wheels). A battery with 82kWh of usable capacity comes as standard, but my car had the optional 97kWh Performance Battery Plus (£4,454).

Thus equipped, the Taycan achieves 416 miles of range in the official WLTP test: impressive for a car that can also hit 62mph in 4.8 seconds. Being able to recharge at 320kW also means you could potentially add 200 miles in 10 minutes – if you can find a public charger offering that level of juice.

Riding on air

Launched in 2019, the Taycan has recently undergone a mid-life refresh. The new model is almost identical – only the lights and front air intakes look different – but then its design hadn’t dated. Whether you opt for the saloon, Sport Turismo estate or Cross Turismo (also an estate, but with raised ride height and more rugged styling), the electric Porsche is still a head-turner.

One notable change is the fitment of air suspension across the range, while pricier versions get an intelligent Active Ride setup. More on that shortly.

Rivals for the Taycan include the BMW i5 M60, Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 and the closely related Audi E-Tron GT, not forgetting the petrol- or hybrid-powered Porsche Panamera. If you must go Musk, there is also the Tesla Model S Plaid, although it’s only available in left-hand drive.

A practical performance car

The Taycan is a large car and its sleek styling isn’t great for interior space. Nonetheless, four adults can travel in comfort, or five at a squeeze if you spec the ‘4+1’ rear seat (£371). Boot space in the saloon is 407 litres: a bit more than a typical family hatchback, albeit with a shallower, less practical shape.

A snug and low-slung driving position immediately makes this ‘family Porsche’ feel like a sports car. Despite relying mostly on touchscreens, the major functions and infotainment are straightforward to use, and the system synced easily with my phone via Apple CarPlay. There are also one-button shortcuts to turn the speed warning bongs and lane assist function off. Good.

The Sport Chrono package fitted here (£1,056) adds a Sport Plus mode for the suspension that drops the car closer to the ground. My test Taycan did without rear-axle steering or a torque vectoring diff, though.

Porsche Taycan on the road

Zero to 62mph in 4.8 seconds is hot hatch territory in 2025, yet the 435hp Taycan definitely feels faster. Perhaps it’s the – literally – electric throttle response or the smooth way it gathers speed, but my impression was of proper Porsche performance. The flagship 1,108hp Turbo GT version, which can blast to 62mph in 2.2 seconds, must be borderline vomit-inducing.

Like all electric cars, the Taycan is simple to drive. Simply click the toggle on the dashboard into ‘D’ and away you go, the two-speed automatic transmission delivering a linear and easily modulated 310lb ft of torque to the rear tyres.

Read more Best sports cars to buy in 2025

The air springs and twin-valve dampers manage the car’s 2,170kg kerb weight well, delivering a firm-edged but comfortable ride. Only the Taycan’s width stands in the way of relaxed progress. Keeping its alloy wheels away from kerbs is tricky in town driving, while on narrow country lanes I involuntarily held my breath every time an SUV squeezed past.

An EV for drivers

Find space to stretch its legs, though, and the Taycan will reward your patience. Its steering is wonderfully lucid and direct, traction is rarely an issue – despite having only two driven wheels – and handling is capable and composed.

Unlike the majority of EVs, this is a car that keen drivers can enjoy. Porsche hasn’t completely overcome all that weight, which you sense most when braking, but it has done a mighty impressive job.

And if you really want to defy physics, Active Ride can oblige. Like the systems on the McLaren 750S and new Land Rover Defender Octa, it uses hydraulically interlinked dampers to counteract pitch, dive and roll. I tried the same setup in the Audi RS E-Tron GT Performance and discovered ‘iron-fisted body control’ that avoided making the car feel artificial or unpredictable. Even so, it’s an expensive option at £6,291 – and arguably overkill on a base Taycan.

Verdict: Porsche Taycan

Porsche engineers will tell you how determined the company was to get its first EV right (OK, its second EV if we count the Egger-Lohner C2 Phaeton of 1898, which was designed by Ferdinand Porsche).

But get the Taycan right, they did. So much so that, five years on and following a mild update, this is still the best sporting electric car on sale. You could commute in one every day, as I did for a week, and it will still tempt you into taking the long route home. If it was my money, I’d stick with this RWD version, but go for the Sport Turismo body style and bigger battery.

Then again, if it was my money, I’d look at the tempting deals on used Taycans instead. The depreciation on new examples remains a worry, but a 2022 Porsche for the price of a middling family crossover seems like a steal.

https://cityam.com,Erin Doherty on surviving Adolescence and hating her phone,https://www.cityam.com/erin-doherty-on-surviving-adolescence-queer-storytelling-and-why-she-hates-her-phone/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 09:15:01 GMT","Erin Doherty on surviving Adolescence, queer storytelling and hating her phone

Erin Doherty talks to City AM The Magazine about surviving Adolescence, shrinking away from fame and why she hates her phone

Erin Doherty rose to fame as the young Princess Anne in The Crown, but this year has found new success working alongside Stephen Graham on two projects, A Thousand Blows and Adolescence. She tells Adam Bloodworth how playing a child psychologist in the latter ‘consumed’ her, the type of queer stories she’d like to tell over the coming years and how she’s been bingeing The Crown long after she left the Netflix show

Erin Doherty had already captured the zeitgeist. Her performance as Princess Anne in The Crown had such subtle power that it made casting director Nina Gold realise working class people could play aristocrats. Then as crime lord Mary Carr in A Thousand Blows, she was lauded as one of the most versatile actors of her generation. Next came Adolescence, in which Doherty plays a child psychologist interviewing a teenager accused of murder, which blew everything else out of the water.

Doherty leads some of the most harrowing scenes in the mini series, which has garnered the biggest audience for any streaming TV show in the UK in a single week. It’s become hard to pop to the shops without people asking “have you seen Adolescence?” – and everyone sounds genuinely unnerved. Asking questions about masculinity and online culture, it follows a 13-year-old boy, Jamie, who’s been accused of murder. Shot as live, each episode is filmed in a single take, with actors allowed to improvise, making its form almost as interesting as its content. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, has already landed the role of young Heathcliff in a forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights.

Doherty says she was genuinely scared during filming. You can’t turn away from her interrogation, which controversially humanises a murder suspect, but also shows the mental health repercussions on the psychologist.

Erin Doherty: filming Adolescence exhausted me, but it was worth it

We start by acknowledging that, by anyone’s standards, it’s been quite the year. “It took a good month to get it out of my system,” says Doherty of Adolescence. “You can’t escape what it’s doing to you, it kind of gets in your bones. There’s no copy and paste formula like, ‘Okay, I’ll do this, and then I’ll be Erin again.’ I was just so consumed and exhausted, just at the level of emotional intensity of this thing.’” Doherty is propelled by the show’s themes about online radicalisation of young men. “I think we all have to hold ourselves accountable for trying to break the cycle in some way.”

Talking over Zoom, Doherty wears a luminescent blue jumper and an even brighter smile. Unlike her most famous roles which veer towards austere, she is cheery and incredibly gracious. The first thing she offers is motherly reassurance about the tech issues I’ve had logging onto our call. “It’s so stressful, but you don’t need that anymore – it’s all gone!” She chats effusively about everything from how she hated school to bingeing The Crown and obsessing over her characters. If a PE teacher were to mark her interview style, they’d commend her for “giving 110 per cent.”

Had it not been for Adolescence, her boxing drama A Thousand Blows, released this February on Disney Plus, would still be brewing in the public consciousness. Doherty’s female crime lord was gently terrifying, with some hilarious lines, and that’s without mentioning the game-changing representation: bad-ass Victorian female crime lords, based on women who actually existed, aren’t your classic prime-time fodder. She spent a year filming that, then went straight into Adolescence, both with Stephen Graham, who invited her into the latter after being impressed by her work on the former: “I didn’t even read the script,” she says. “Whatever he does is just full of pure heart and love and care. I just knew that it was gonna be so vital; he doesn’t take on projects lightly.”

Netflix: Adolescence breaks the record to get the biggest viewership of any mini-series on the platform

The show has become the first streaming show ever to top the UK’s weekly TV ratings. “With something that is so frightening, it’s so easy to avoid it and to just go, ‘What a horrible thing that some people can do, I can’t get my head around it.’ Whereas this show is going, I understand how frightening a prospect that is, but we have to hold ourselves accountable for shining a light and going, ‘How are these events happening?’” says Doherty.

“Especially with our younger generation, we deserve to humanise how they get there, because otherwise, again, they just become this kind of two dimensional evil ‘other’. And actually, I do believe that everyone is born a good person. I don’t think that people are inherently evil. So it’s always necessary, it’s always worthy of our time to pick at that and go, ‘Oh my God, how did you get there?’”

Chuck in eight West End eight shows a week on top of her promotional schedule for Adolescence (she’s currently starring in the play Unicorn) and despite how she clearly loves talking about the show, she admits she’s “sooooo readyyyyyy” for a holiday. I suspect her ability to appear affable even when she’s exhausted has helped her schmooze numerous big-wigs on her way up.

You wonder how our brightest Hollywood hope would fare on a sun lounger. Doherty admits she obsesses over people to a degree that isn’t healthy. “It’s my biggest thing that I battle with,” she says. “I think we’ve all got demons. For me, it manifests as overthinking. I’ll get to the end of the day and I’ll lie in bed and be like, ‘Oh God, I hope that person didn’t take that the wrong way.’” She has to be careful that this approach doesn’t wear her down, because she “grew up a people pleaser.” But her ability to over-analyse can yield positive results, working in favour of forthcoming projects. When she researches roles, “I’ll dig and dig and dig and really try to understand and pick up why people behave the way they behave. I could linger on a specific interaction for a week.”

I don’t need to know what you think about my work. If you want to come up to me and talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online

Growing up in Crawley, West Sussex, as a young girl Doherty and her older sister would take acting classes at the weekends. She was the shy one, but nevertheless remembers the experience changing her. “Something flipped through art,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t have to be Erin anymore.’ That was my first lasting impression of what acting and being someone else could do, mentally. I can put that anxiety down for a couple of hours and just let go. There’s not been anything else that I’ve found so freeing. It’s just in me. I don’t know how I would function without this ability to just let go.”

She took a one-year course at the Guildford School of Acting in 2011, not long after leaving high school. Studying acting at the Bristol Old Vic, she graduated in 2015 and was first inspired to tread the boards after watching Mike Bartlett’s Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre, a vivid, chaotic interpretative dance number about, amongst other things, climate change.

Other Erin Doherty movies and TV shows

Call The Midwife and the BBC miniseries of Les Misérables were early roles, but the part that properly propelled her came in 2019 when she was cast as a young Princess Anne in The Crown. Casting director Nina Gold had thought “playing a whole different social class is one of the most difficult things to do convincingly”, but has admitted, “Erin really blew that theory.” She was captivating as the poised young princess, revealing a vividness to the most reluctantly camera-ready of the late Queen’s children. She still binges The Crown, and is obsessed with Imelda Staunton. “I got to meet her the other day. We were working on an audio book, and she is everything you want her to be. I absolutely binged the last series and thought it was phenomenal.”

Looking back to where it all began, Doherty reminisces about studying musical theatre at her comprehensive school in Crawley. She still has family there, and pops back regularly, but as a whole she cannot wax lyrical about the institution. “I hated school with a passion,” she says. “But the drama department was so pivotal to me.” She’d love to go back and jump in on some lessons. “I have such admiration for teachers but I could never see myself having the skill and ability.”

Erin Doherty on working with Stephen Graham

If not through teaching, she has always been keen to promote the idea of levelling up. Doherty seems genuinely overwhelmed when I read the Nina Gold quote to her. “For her to say something like that, I don’t really know how to deal with that. I’m just grateful she took a chance, and I hope that it encourages other casting directors to keep doing that, because I think without them taking that leap of faith, so many actors wouldn’t get their foot in the door. I think that an actor’s job is to transform.” She’s passionate about “bringing working class actors into the world of screen acting,” and has been inspired by Stephen Graham. “He’s so brilliant at climbing the ladder, looking down and helping people up. That’s so inspiring to me. If I could do what he did for me and is continuing to do for others, I’d be so overjoyed.”

Away from work, Doherty is private, but decompresses by enjoying the small things. “Walks, family, engaging in normal conversation.” You sense she finds the concept of celebrity so bizarre that describing her downtime is a weird notion in itself. Despite whatever’s been written about her (none of which she reads), success has forced her “to really, really lean into my people. I have a very small circle.” She is happily in a relationship, but contrary to newspaper headlines, her girlfriend “isn’t in the industry”.

You can see why Adolescence appealed. She admits she is “awful” at her phone, always leaving her family on read, and says too many of us are addicted to technology. “I don’t think I’m doing it right either,” she says of her scarce digital approach. “I feel like there’s got to be a better balance. I’ve just kind of gone the opposite end of the scale.” Of Gen Z, who are growing up internet natives, she has “such empathy.” “It just completely freaks me out. I don’t know how I’d manage.”

She shies away from public perceptions about her, and is firm about why: “I just want people to watch the show. I don’t necessarily need to know what you think about it. If you want to come up to me and we’ll talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online. That’s not for me.” Instead, her family and set of lifelong friends are her barometer. “They’ll be like, ‘Things are really positive for you. Just know that you’re doing alright.’ I don’t need to look any further. If my people are telling me that it’s all good, then that’s enough.”

Queer representation

As for what’s next, she’s vague, but implies nothing’s firmly on the table yet. She will reveal, though, that more queer storytelling is a priority. “I feel like that’s going to be the route that I go down. Because, as I say, I’m so deeply passionate about telling queer stories and providing that representation. I hope that’s something I’ll get to pursue down the line. Breaking the kind of mould of it being a trope or like a cliche, being the queer friend, or the exploration of the relationships. They do exist, but it’s really rare to find the nuance and the levels of detail of what it means to be queer.” She’s inspired by “the way Steven collaborated with Jack Thorne on Adolescence. I’d love to maybe collaborate with a writer because I don’t know if I’ve got the bravery to be like, ‘And now I’m going to write this thing.’ I hold my hand up, I am definitely an actor.”

She circles back to that much needed holiday, then, on the topic of future roles, offers me a final one of her beautiful thought spirals. “I just like people,” she says. “Trying to figure out why we behave the way we behave, whether that means putting on a corset and walking down the cobbles of East End London or putting on an Adidas tracksuit and exploring what that means in 2025.”

The French judge decided that Le Pen was excluded from participating in elections and also imposed her prison sentence.

Le Pen speaks of ""a political process"" and appeals.

Also read: Macron appoints center politician Bayrou as new prime minister of France: can he bake sweet sandwiches with Marine Le Pen?

The French politician Marine Le Pen and eight others were found guilty of fraud with EU money. As a result, the radical-right politician is excluded from participating in French elections.

A French judge decided that on Monday. Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, two of which are conditional. Le Pen also received a fine of 100,000 euros.

According to the French newspaper Le Monde, the exclusion applies to participation in elections for five years with immediate effect. In 2027 there are again presidential elections in France, so this would mean that Le Pen cannot participate.

Marine Le Pen was present in court, but left the room before the punishment was pronounced. Prosecutors have also demanded a five -year prison sentence and a fine. The defense of Le Pen demanded acquittal. Her lawyers called the lawsuit a political process to eliminate the popular politician.

After her party achieved a major election victory last year, Le Pen was seen as an important contend to the presidency. In addition to Le Pen, more than twenty party members were on trial. Eight of them have also been convicted and may not hold public office.

From 2004 to 2017, Le Pen was in the European Parliament, which in 2015 found possible irregularities in the salaries of parliamentary employees of Le Pen. Money that was intended to pay assistants in the European Parliament, she would then have used it mainly for the payment of party employees in France. Millions of euros would be involved.

Marine Le Pen speaks of 'political process' and appeals

The extreme right -wing French politician Marine Le Pen talks about a political process after her conviction for fraud. Because of that punishment, she is probably unable to participate in the French presidential elections in two years. However, she does not want to withdraw from politics.

""I fight to the bitter end,"" said Le Pen, party leader of Rassemblement National (RN). At the same time, she promotes RN chairman Jordan Bardella, who could make a shot instead of her at the presidency. ""I am actually out of the running,"" she acknowledges. According to her, the court deliberately tried to prevent it from being eligible in 2027.

She criticizes her conviction and compares it with ""practices that we thought were for authoritarian regimes"".

Her lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut has already announced that Le Pen appeals against her conviction. ""It's a blow to democracy,"" he said.

An appeal is the only chance that Le Pen has to participate in the presidential elections in 2027.

Fierce reactions from Le Pen party

French democracy was executed by the conviction of Le Pen, her right hand Jordan Bardella stated in a first reaction.

Now that Le Pen cannot apply for the presidency due to the verdict, the ambitious 29-year-old Bardella is seen as an alternative. He enjoys broad support, a little more even than his mentor, according to a recent opinion poll.

Last week Bardella was the first RN leader invited by the Israeli government. The chairman of RN priority Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was still regarded as a pronounced anti-Semitic. Marine is his youngest daughter.",businessinsider

Musk states that the financial pain is used to put himself and Tesla under heavy pressure.

The richest man in the world has declined around 100 billion dollars by halving the value of the Tesla share.

Tech entrepreneur and austerity adviser Elon Musk admitted last weekend during a political meeting in the US state of Wisconsin that his duties as head of Adviesclub Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) hurt him financially, reports Bloomberg news agency.

""It takes me a lot to be able to do this work,"" said Musk during the meeting. ""What they are trying to do is to put me and Tesla under immense pressure, I think.""

The involvement of Musk in Trump's government has consequences for his image and that of Tesla. Although there are several factors in the game, it is difficult to deny that the declining sale of Tesla’s is in any case partly due to the political activities of Musk. That seems to be especially the case in Europe. As a result, the Tesla share has also fallen considerably in value. It now notes on almost half of the peak that it tangled in mid -December last year.

""My Tesla shares and those of everyone who has Tesla in his investment portfolio are approximately halved. That is a major problem,"" said Musk, who has lost around 100 billion dollars in assets due to the decrease. Although he has retained his position as the richest person in the world.

Musk: share of Tesla will be on top again

Musk thinks that the Tesla share is coming through this difficult time. ""In the long term, Tesla shares will do fine. Maybe this is a chance to buy,"" he said.

Not all analysts agree. According to some analysts, Tesla would still be overvalued. The car brand of Musk is overtaken by the competition on all sides, has an outdated and too expensive range and therefore loses ground on the already difficult market for electric cars. Musk would also not pay enough attention to his company, which can have a negative impact.

This is something that Musk himself has indicated. When Musk was asked in an interview on TV channel Fox how he still ran his companies, he replied: ""With great difficulty,"" followed by a long break and a sigh, but without further explanation. ""I just try to make the government more efficient, to eliminate waste and fraud, and so far we are actually making good progress"".",businessinsider

This is reported by the Polo news site based on anonymous sources involved in the cases.

Apple would be fined for restrictions for app developers and meta for non-compliance with the so-called DMA legislation.

Also read Donald Trump defends Big Tech in Europe, but US government is critical in its own country: can that go together?

This week, the European Commission is expected to be distributing fines to the American tech giants Apple and Meta. This concerns the first major fines in connection with the new Digital Markets Act (DMA), a European law intended to prevent the abuse of market power by large tech companies.

This is reported by the Police's site based on insiders.

Apple would limit App developers by forbidding that they can make users of their apps offers. Meta, in turn, would not have complied with the DMA rules if it concerns the collection and processing of personal data.

Apple was initially on the role for two fines, but one of them was deleted. This involved the standard browser on the iPhone and limitations to adjust it. According to the European Commission, the tech company has made sufficient changes to this, so that a fine would no longer be needed.

All in all, it concerns conclusions based on three studies that the committee started against the two tech giants three years ago. The fines should be known before the end of the week, according to the insiders to Politico. Nothing is known about the amount.

The committee may hand out fines up to 10 percent of the annual turnover of companies.

The distribution of the fines to American companies is currently sensitive. President Donald Trump of the United States has repeatedly expressed himself negatively about the DMA. Trump noted, among other things, that he sees European legislation as ""foreign extortion"".

Trump also stated that the US is investigating the regulations and possibly sets import duties as a retaliation measure.

The threats are taken into account in determining the height of the fines, according to an anonymous source towards polico. But they would not be the most important factor. The new nature of European law plays a more important role, according to the source.

According to sources that business newspaper Financial Times spoke, the European Commission does not dare to intervene too hard and the fines are limited to the minimum height. Brussels would like to do everything to prevent an escalation with Trump.

Big Tech companies, including Meta, openly approached Trump for support against the DMA.

Mills states that the gold price - which reached a new record level last week - things can go to $ 1,820 per Troy Oune (31.1 grams) in the coming five years.

That would mean a loss of 38 percent compared to the current record level of over $ 3,000 per Troy Oune and would erase all the profit of the past twelve months.

The gold price has risen sharply this year, partly because of the geopolitical uncertainty, the threats for the American economy and stubborn inflation. As a result, investors are looking for safe ports.

The unrest in financial markets during the first months of Trump's new presidency brought the gold price to unprecedented levels. Yet gold can come under pressure in the coming years, according to Mills. Against Business Insider, he mentions three reasons why prices will fall in the longer term.

1. The range of gold is increasing

The high gold prices have encouraged raw material producers to win more gold. The higher range will ensure downward pressure on prices in the coming years, says Mills.

According to data from the World Gold Council, gold mining has become increasingly lucrative in recent years. The average profit margin for gold diggers in the second quarter of last year was 950 dollars per ounce, the most profitable period since 2012.

According to the analysis of the World Gold Council, the global gold supply has increased to 216,265 tons in 2024, an increase of 9 percent in five years.

According to Mills, more gold will also be recycled in the coming years and that also ensures a larger offer.

""Gold mines are opened everywhere because it is so profitable,"" says Mills, especially pointing to Australia as one of the largest gold producers in the world. ""I think the offer will increase as a result"".

2. The demand for gold will decrease

Central banks and investors are buying more gold this year to diversify their foreign reserves and as cover against macro-economic uncertainty.

Central banks bought together 1 1,045 tons of gold in 2024. This made this the third year in a row that they bought more than 1,000 tons.

On the investor side, gold funds have reached the highest popularity in years. The inflow into gold ETFs last February was $ 9.4 billion, the highest inflow in almost three years.

However, there are signs that the global demand for gold is starting to decrease. A study by the World Gold Council shows that 71 percent of central banks expect their gold possesses to remain the same in the coming 12 months.

According to Mill, the demand of investors will probably decrease, since worries about the economy are typical factors for the short term. He points out the brief revival of the gold price in 2020, when the Coronapandemie led to major concerns about the economy. But the prices then dropped quickly and only reached earlier peak levels at the end of 2023.

""You have to be careful and not just project the wind on gold,"" says Mills about the record high in the gold price. ""If you look at the development of the gold price in the last 25 to 30 years, you will see that it often goes up and occasionally experiences a small relapse.""

""On the question side you now see a series of supporting factors, which I am not sure if they will last in the long term,"" said the analyst.

3. There are signs that a peak for gold is near

The activity in the gold sector follows a well -known pattern that in the past pointed when prices approached a peak, says Mills.

First, there are many mergers and acquisitions in the gold sector. That is often the case when a market peaks. The number of deals in the gold sector increased by 32 percent in 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

There has also been an increase in the number of gold funds for investors lately and that was also the case with earlier peaks, according to Mills.

""To make a long story short: you have all those things that push the gold price up,"" says Mills. ""At the same time, you have to be very careful with projecting current prices in the long term.""

Many analysts expect gold prices to rise in the short term. Last week analysts from Bank of America increased the expectation for the gold price in the coming two years to $ 3,500 per Troy Oune. Goldman Sachs increased the expectation to $ 3,300 before the end of the year.",businessinsider

This is the conclusion of new research by CyberSecurity experts from Cisco Talos about trends about cyber crime in 2024.

Digital criminals mainly use AI to optimize phishing attacks and to feed AI models with disinformation.

Read also: The Netherlands goes against international trend: fewer incidents with ransomware in 2024

Where until recently it was expected that cyber criminals AI (Artificial Intelligence) would use to carry out more attacks and generate more malware, this is not yet the case.

This is reflected in Monday published research by Cyber ​​Security Cisco Talos about latest trends in cyber crime in 2024.

The reason that AI is not yet used for hard technical solutions, such as better malware, and therefore attack options, is that this still requires too much human help.

So-called Large Language Models (the technology on which AI-Chatbots such as Chatgpt works) still require a lot of control when it comes to writing software code that works well enough. It appears that cyber criminals are not waiting for this, and want to use ai more to take work off your hands.

The cyber security experts from Cisco Talos noticed that with their AI usage, the cyber criminals focus primarily on the old-fashioned attacks such as phishing and obtaining personal data through deception. AI helps immensely, because it becomes much easier to make convincing, personalized, non -distinct messages. This makes it more difficult for, for example, recipients of phishing e-mails to recognize attacks.

AI is also increasingly being used to discover and exploit and exploit many more weaknesses in security software. This trend has been visible for some time, but found even more traction among cyber criminals last year.

The good news is that Just has more strength when discovering weaknesses in software, the defense against this has more thanks to AI. Experts have stated several times to Business Insider that the use of AI for cyber security ensures that it is possible to prevail against malicious parties.

Criminals try to influence AI models by feeding them with misleading data

In addition to direct cyber attacks, criminals in countries such as China and Russia also attempt to influence AI models to stimulate the spreading of disinformation, or to deteriorate the functioning of AI applications.

According to Cisco, millions of websites have now been rigged that are full of fake information that is being conducted to AI-Bots as training data. As a result, AI models are partly trained on misleading information, with which, for example, propaganda can be distributed.

An additional disadvantage of spreading this disinformation is that people, governments and companies can be manipulated in several areas. This can, for example, seeps into political decision -making, with all its consequences.

In general, Cisco Talos researchers stated that the use of AI among cyber criminals is still lagging behind what had expected with. That does not mean that the risk is low, because criminals still have the opportunity to use the power of AI for new ways of attacks. This makes it increasingly important to reinforce the defense with the implementation of AI. Only in this way can the development go fast enough to keep up with the latest innovations of cyber criminals. In other words: traditional security systems are no longer sufficient.

Vice President J.D. Last week Vance visited an American military base on Greenland, where he reprimanded Denmark.

Greenland houses large quantities of natural raw materials that are at stake.

Greenland is not for sale. Denmark and the autonomous board of Greenland have now repeatedly issued that message. Yet US President Donald Trump doesn't seem to worry about it.

The American president continues to hint that the US is considering the annexation of Greenland. According to Trump, the island, which is part of Denmark, would be necessary to strengthen the American defense in the Arctic area. The many raw materials that Greenland houses are also important for the US.

When Trump spoke to the American congress earlier this month, he announced that he wants to take over control of Greenland in any case, Trump will always refuse to exclude a military operation.

Vice President J.D. Vance and his wife Usha arrived in Greenland last Friday. They traveled to the country to visit the American military Basic Pituffik Space Base, which is located on the northwestern coast of Greenland. But even before the American delegation arrived, there was a lot of criticism of the visit.

Trump over Greenland: ""We must have it""

Before Vance left for Greenland, Trump made it clear that the island is needed for ""international security and security. We need it. We must have it,"" he told Podcaster Vince Coglianese in an interview.

But the Danes and Groenlanders do not agree. A recent poll by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and the Greenlandse Krant Sermitsiaq among Groenlanders showed that 85 percent of the inhabitants have no ears to become part of the United States. Only six percent of the respondents do like to become American. The remaining nine percent had no opinion.

Denmark gave the 57,000 inhabitants of Greenland a form of self -government in 2009. With that, the island also obtained the right to declare itself independently of Denmark via a referendum.

Before Vance arrived in Greenland, Prime Minister Mute Eede van Groenland announced that he found the visit ""very aggressive"". Especially since the American adviser for National Security Micheal Waltz came along.

""What does the National Security Consultant do in Greenland? The only goal is to show the power over us,"" said Eede, who is also committed to an independent Greenland. ""His presence in the country helps the American belief in Trump's mission - and the pressure will increase.""

Struggle for raw materials in the Arctic area

During the visit to Greenland, Vance Denmark criticized. The Danes would not properly protect the island against possible aggression of China and Russia. Vance stated that Greenland would benefit from falling under the ""security para"" of the United States, rather than that of Denmark.

""Our message to Denmark is very simple: you did not support the population of Greenland,"" said Vance. ""You have not invested enough in the Groenlanders and you have not invested enough in the security infrastructure of this incredibly beautiful piece of land.""

In recent weeks there have been several protests against Trumps plans in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. Now that the independence of Denmark is within reach, many residents are concerned about Trumps plans to annex the country.

But Trump sees an opportunity for the US to acquire a position in the Arctic area, in a world where global superpowers will compete for the raw materials of Greenland.

Because the country is largely within the polar circle and the ice sheets melt, parts of the country change and strategic shipping channels may appear. That makes Greenland an important target for Trumps 'America-first' agenda.",businessinsider

However, a substantial fall in price does not always mean that the underlying profitability of listed companies has been affected.

Beurs expert Hendrik Oude Nijhuis advises investors to look at the underlying developments more often instead of the daily rates on the stock exchange.

Analysis - Suppose you have worked hard for years and saved 100,000 euros together with great difficulty. You decide to invest this considerable amount in a broad exhibition index, say the S&P 500. The price/profit ratio at that time is 20. After a year the index is 40 percent lower.

How do you view the investment now?

A) You are quite satisfied. After all, you have made 5,000 euros in profit (you invested 100,000 euros and paid the profit 20 times, with which you have earned 5,000 euros in one year time).

B) You are very disappointed. Of the hard -earned money, 40,000 euros went up in smoke.

Of course, both answers are possible. But by far the most investors would really 'choose' for option B. Many people will be very disappointed and strongly consider selling their investment to prevent an even greater loss.

Pay attention as an investor to the underlying profit development in the long term

I advise investors to look at investments more often in way A. So more attention for the underlying course of affairs and less for the price change in the short term. If the underlying developments are good, a positive price trend is ultimately a matter of time.

What many investors tends when races fall sharply, there is virtually no farmer who decides to sell his farm when a casual passer -by makes a bad bid. Or when the harvest is disappointing once. Farmers think in decades, or even in generations. Many an investor can learn something from that.

To maintain industry in the Netherlands, an acceleration of the capture and storage of CO2 and hydrogen is required. With that message, Gasunie came on Monday at the presentation of the annual report. With a new strategy, the company wants to do everything to maintain important industries.

The year 2024 was a turbulent year for the energy transition, in which, according to Gasunie, it became clear that the competitiveness of the Netherlands and Europe is shrinking and the future of industry is threatened. The desired fast transition to a sustainable energy supply is under pressure due to uncertain conditions, high net rates and long lead times for permit processes.

""The Netherlands is currently at a tipping point or we make it more sustainable with or without industry,"" warns Topwoman Willemien Terpstra. ""That happens without, then that is disastrous for the Netherlands and Europe. For our prosperity, employment, sustainable autonomy and also for our environment.""

Gasunie invests € 12 billion in infrastructure for the next 5 years

To speed up the energy transition and contribute to an affordable and sustainable energy supply for Europe, Gasunie up to and including 2030 invests around 12 billion euros in energy infrastructure. Last year the share of green projects in the investment expenditure rose from 20 to 45 percent.

Thanks to these investments, according to Gasunie, industries and households keep perspective to be able to make it more sustainable and the goal remains to become climate neutral in sight before 2050.

Gasunie also wants to construct infrastructure for hydrogen as quickly as possible and the company stimulates the introduction of green gas into its pipelines. But only the efforts of Gasunie are not sufficient, according to Terpstra. ""I therefore call for cooperation, with industry, governments and society to make the energy supply of the future a reality.""

Gasunie achieved a result of 355 million euros in 2024, 75 million euros less than in 2023. Sales fell by 174 million euros to almost 1.6 billion euros. This is mainly because Gasunie has only been a shareholder of Eemssenergy terminal since the end of 2023. Personnel costs also increased.

Professor Thomas Roulet of Cambridge University has rebutted the idea that ""Gen Z is lazy.""

Professor Roule points out that young people only have different ideas about what ""work"" is.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said last week that he doesn't need to ""feel so bad"" Gen Z and Millennials.

Gen Z is often referred to as ""lazy,"" but the younger generation just has a different view on what ""work is,"" a professor at Cambridge University believes.

Professor Thomas Roule, who teaches organizational sociology and leadership at the Judge Business School, defended Gen Z's work ethic in a video posted to the university's YouTube channel.

""Every generation has said that younger generations are lazy at their jobs, and even Socrates is said to be the case,"" Professor Roule said, noting that Greek philosophers considered young people ""conceited lazy.""

""Studies have shown that every generation is the same motivational thing.""

""Expectations for work are changing. Young people want work-life balance as well as growth and purpose. Organizations need to stand up to meet these demands.""

""The third factor is the economic situation. Work would have provided even more stability, 30 or 20 years ago. But that's not always the case now.""

Professor Roule's comments differ slightly from the views of several executives, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.

Last week, Dimon said he had little sympathy for the younger generation. They are likely to live longer and work hours are likely to be shorter.

""I don't feel that bad for Gen Z or Millennials,"" said Dimon, adding that his grandparents were Greece immigrants and came to America ""as they were wearing clothes.""

大手コンビニエンスストアチェーン・ファミリーマートのパン販売が好調だ。2024年度のパンカテゴリーの売上は、コロナ禍前の2019年度比で113％に拡大し、過去10年における最高売上を記録した。

好調を牽引するのが、生パン、スイーツパン、マルチパンといった目新しいカテゴリー群。これらの展開の裏には、コンビニならではの体験価値を重視する同社のパン戦略がある。そして、2025年3月末からは、人気の「生パン」をさらに進化させた新シリーズ「白生パン」を展開。パンカテゴリーで、さらなる躍進を目指す同社の担当者に、その内実を聞いた。

「生パン」はなぜ人気シリーズになったか

鈴木崇義（すずき・たかよし）氏／ファミリーマート 商品本部 スイーツ部 副部長 兼ベーカリー・半生菓子グループ マネジャー。日本大学経済学部経済学科卒。1994年にファミリーマート入社後、スーパーバイザーなどを経て2000年ファミマ・ドット・コム設立時に商品担当として参加。2005年から2016年までパンの企画開発業務。地区MD、エリアフランチャイズへの商品支援などの業務を経て2022年より再びパンの企画開発に復帰する。2025年3月から現職。一級パン製造技能士、パンシェルジュ検定 マスター（１級）の資格を持つ。

好調なファミリーマートのパン販売をリードする存在の一つである「生パン」シリーズ。生地に生クリームを練り込み、しっとりとした食感が特徴の同シリーズは、発売から約2年間で累計2億6000万個を販売する人気商品となっている（※）。はたして「生パン」という発想は、どう生まれたのか。開発を手掛けた商品本部の鈴木崇義氏は、既存のパンに対する「課題の発見」が、原動力になったと振り返る。

※2023年2月末～2025年2月末までの累計販売個数。

「当社では、“定番のパンが一番おいしいコンビニ”を目指して、カレーパン、クリームパン、メロンパンなどの定番商品を現代的な仕様にアップデートしてきました。 そして2023年、次のテーマとして注目したのが、同じく定番であるコッペパンです。ただ、コッペパンの調査を進めたところ、ある課題が浮き彫りになりました。『給食に出てきたパサパサ・もそもそしたパン』、『牛乳で流し込むもの』といったネガティブなイメージを持つ人が多かったんです」（鈴木氏）

そうしたマイナスイメージを、むしろ伸びしろと捉えたことが、後の躍進をもたらすことになる。

「いいイメージばかりではないということは、そこを解決して今の時代の誰が食べてもおいしいコッペパンにすれば、新しいお客様も含めてたくさんの支持を得られると考えました。では、どう解決すればいいか。いろいろ試す中で行き着いたのが、パン生地に生クリームを配合する『生コッペパン』でした。 その背景には、パンやドーナツ、お菓子などのさまざまな製品で見られていた、“生”食感のトレンドもありました」（鈴木氏）

こうして2023年2月、従来のイメージをくつがえす、やわらかくて“しっとり”した食感の新しいコッペパンが登場。開発に際しては細かな配合の調整が重ねられ、菓子パンは口どけの良さを実現するために、フランス発祥のリッチな菓子パン“ブリオッシュ”の製法を、惣菜パンはもちっとした食感を出すため、水を多く含む“多加水”の製法も採用した。

以降、生コッペパンシリーズは、ピーナッツクリーム、ジャム、あんこなどが具材の菓子パンと、焼きそば、卵、コロッケなどが具材の惣菜パンの両方を展開して人気シリーズとなり、現在も定番として販売される。併せて「生パン」の手法は、クロワッサン、フランスパン、ドーナツといったコッペパン以外のパンにも応用されていく。

さらには、このヒットを受けて、生コッペパンの進化形も登場。それが、2024年2月に発売開始した「白生コッペパン」だ。

「糖の量や種類を工夫し、低温で焼き上げることで、きれいな白色と、しっとりもちもちとした食感を実現しました。こちらも配合や焼き具合の調整を重ね、開発に約4カ月を要しました」（鈴木氏）

こうして送り込まれた「白生コッペパン（カスタード＆ホイップ）」もすぐさま人気商品となり、発売初週にパンカテゴリー内売上1位を記録。また、ファミリーマート社員が一番おすすめしたい商品を選ぶ「ファミマ大賞2024」の横綱にも選出され、今も定番商品として販売される。

白生パンを通して「体験」も提供する

フランスパンの固定観念を変えるようなしっとりもちもちを再現した「白生フランスパン（北海道産ダブル練乳ミルク）」

そしてファミマは2025年、生パンシリーズのさらなる新機軸を打ち出す。それが、白生パンの“横展開”だ。

「白生パンの人気を受け、今度は白生というくくりで、他の定番パンにも応用していく試みです。コッペパンにくわえてクロワッサンやフランスパンなど、本来は白くないパンを“白生化”することで、新しいおいしさを発見していただければなと。パンの選定に際しては3000人に対してユーザー調査も行って、白生化したときの期待値と驚きの両方を重視しました」（鈴木氏）

その第一弾として2025年3月25日（火）に発売したのが、「白生コッペパン（つぶつぶいちご＆ホワイトチョコ）」、「白生クロワッサン（ダブル生チョコ）」、「白生フランスパン（北海道産ダブル練乳ミルク）」の3商品だ。

※沖縄県では仕様と価格が異なります。

商品の開発を後押しした背景には、食べ物の選択において食感や見た目の比重が増していることがあった。そしてラインナップの選定の裏にはあったのは、「コンビニが得意な領域に持ち込む」という考え方だ。

今後、同シリーズでは、4月1日（火）発売の「白生クリームパン（ダブルカスタード）」を初めとして、追加のラインアップも複数予定している。※沖縄県を除く

「クロワッサンは本来、サクッとした食感が大きな魅力ですが、袋に閉じ込めるコンビニパンでそれを完全再現するのは難しい。同じくフランスパンも、本来は焼き上がりから2時間くらいが食べ頃で、その後はどんどん固くなってしまう。焼きなおして食べるのが一般的ですが、コンビニパンですべてのお客様に焼きなおして召し上がっていただくというのは、現実的ではありません。 それならば、私たちの得意なことを前面に打ち出そうと。それでこそ、お客さまに新しいおいしさや楽しさをご提供できると考えました」（鈴木氏）

開発に際しては、食感と見た目の両立にこだわった。特にポイントとなったのが、糖分の量と種類だ。パンの焼き色は、糖に由来してメイラード反応やカラメル反応が起こることで付く。ただ、焼き色が付かないようにと糖を減らすと、今度は発酵が起こりにくくなり、パンらしいふくらみやおいしさが不十分になる。

そこで、糖の量や種類、さらには焼成する温度や時間をパン種ごとに細かく調整し、ほどよいバランスを見つけた。そうして、他ではそう見られない“白いクロワッサン”や“白いフランスパン”が完成した。クロワッサンならではの多層構造や、フランスパンならではのがっしり感と肉厚さを持ちつつ、食感はしっとりもちもちで、噛むと生チョコや練乳ミルクの甘みとコクが口いっぱいに広がる──。

「もしかすると、こんなのクロワッサンじゃない、フランスパンじゃないとおっしゃる方もいるかもしれません。ただ、本来パンを選ぶことって、すごく楽しい行為ですよね。だからこそおいしさだけでなく、白いクロワッサンって、白いフランスパンって、どんな味わいや食感なんだろう!?というワクワク感や発見もあわせてご提供できれば思っています」（鈴木氏）

日常に寄り添えることがコンビニの強み

一方、スイーツの繊細な味わいや幸福感に、パンの手軽さとボリューム感を掛け合わせた「スイーツパン」も、ファミリーマートのパン売上を後押しするシリーズの一つとなっている。

同社は2024年10月に、パティシエの世界大会で優勝経験（※）を持つ安食雄二シェフ監修のもと、「ティラミスメロンパン ヘーゼルナッツコーヒークリーム」「塩キャラメル 生フランスパン」「焼きチョコクロワッサン クイニーアマン仕立て」の3商品を発売。185円（税込）とコンビニパンとしては高単価だが、売上は好調に推移し、今後もスイーツパンシリーズを意欲的に展開する予定だ。

※1996年 グランプリインターナショナル・マンダリンナポレオンコンクール（世界大会）日本人初優勝

「物価の高騰で本格ケーキも買いにくくなっている中、菓子パンであれば手軽にスイーツの贅沢感を味わっていただけます。今後も継続的に販売することで、スイーツを食べたいときの選択肢の一つとしてもファミマを想起していただくことを目指します」（鈴木氏）

そしてもう一つ、売上を大きく伸ばしているシリーズが、パンを一袋に複数個入れた「マルチパン」だ。こちらは売上が2019年度比で136％に拡大し、右肩上がりの状況にある。

「マルチパンは、たくさん食べたいニーズを満たすだけでなく、誰かとシェアしたり、何回かに分けて食べたりと、パンの食べ方を広げる存在です。コンビニパンの中ではコストパフォーマンスがいいと評価いただける稀有な存在でもあり、今後マルチパンにも注力していきます」（鈴木氏）

ファミリーマートのこうしたパン展開の根底に流れるのが、コンビニならではの役割や本分をまっとうするという考え方だ。あくまでコンビニは人々の日常の中にあるもの。だからこそ日常に寄り添うことで、一日を少しでも良いものにする──。

「お客さまに言われて嬉しかったのが、『パティスリーやベーカリーは1カ月に1回ぐらいの贅沢。ファミマのパン選びは1日1回のプチ贅沢』というお言葉です。 ほかにも、今日も一日忙しかったけど、お昼に食べたパンがおいしかったとか、思わぬ発見や出合いがあって楽しかった、それを起点に人と会話が弾んだなどによって、『だから、ちょっと良い一日だったな』と思っていただける。ファミマのパンを通じて、一人でも多くの方に、そんな体験をお届けできればなと」（鈴木氏）

あらゆる層が訪れるコンビニだからこそ、価格帯のバランスも重視する。ファミマのパン販売では、低価格帯のものから、定番を中心とした中価格帯、そしてスイーツパンや具材を贅沢に使った高価格帯のものなど、バランスよく網羅している。

そんなファミマのパンの展望について、鈴木氏はこう語った。

「コンビニパンだからこその強みにフォーカスすることと、これまでできなかった手法を開拓することの両面からアプローチし、コンビニパンならではの価値を追求していきます。これまでは展開がちょっと難しかった健康訴求のパンなども、今後はおいしくご提供できるはずです。 物価高で、手軽に買えて食事にもスイーツにもなるコンビニパンの役割は、いっそう大きくもなるでしょう。それらをふまえると、コンビニパンの未来は明るいのかなと」（鈴木氏）

コンビニでできることと、コンビニだからこそできること。それらを大切にしながら、時代に合わせてどう発展させ、アウトプットしていくのか。この先も、ファミマのパン展開に注目したい。",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,"14 points that entrepreneurs should immediately implement on the pitch, directed by veteran VCs",https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/282018d/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT","1分以下の短いピッチでは、あなたがどんな人なのか、何をしているのか、どんな人に向けた商品またはサービスなのか、どんなところが気に入ってもらえそうなのか、いくら調達したいのか、その他の数値的指標にフォーカスすること。

1分間ピッチで投資家とのミーティングを取りつけることに成功したら、ヒントNo.2〜14に移ろう。できなかったら1分間ピッチに戻り、内容を磨いて再挑戦する。

2.ピッチデックはきっちり使う

「どのように進めましょうか。ピッチデック（プレゼン資料）を使ってご説明しましょうか。それとも口頭でざっとお話しした方がよろしいですか？」などと聞くべきではない。

膨大な時間と思考を注いでそのピッチデックを用意したのだ。活躍してもらわなければならない。ピッチデックは会話のナビゲート役であり、会話の代わりになるものではないことを忘れずに。

3.重要なスライドを埋もれさせない

投資家にとって最も重要なスライドがトップに来るようにすること。彼らにこれから何を言おうとしているのか、「サマリースライド」(要約スライド）を使って伝えることは問題ない。通常ピッチデックの後半で登場することの多い収益予想などを最初に持ってくるのは有効な手段だ。

4.スライドのすべてにロゴをつける

誰が遅れて入ってくるか、通りすがりに入ってくるか分からない。ロゴのないピッチデックを使って説明していたら、誰の発表なのか分かってもらえない可能性もある。そんなことのないように、スライドには全ページにロゴをつけること。ステージで発表する時やリモートでのピッチの時は特にだ。

5.スライドにページ番号をつける

これは、リモートでのピッチでも対面でのピッチでも役立つ。話の展開によっては同じ資料の別のページに飛んで説明することもできる。

6.早めに会場入りして準備する

会場には早めに行って機器類をテストし、部屋に慣れておくこと。投資家が部屋に着く前に「エレベーターピッチ」（エレベーターに乗っているくらいの短い時間でプレゼンすること）をすることになっても慌てないように、1枚目のスライドはすぐに出せるようにしておく。

7.不測の事態に備え、バックアップはいくつも用意しておく

アダプターやバックアップはいくつか用意しておこう。バックアップは多い方がいい。

ピッチデックはハードドライブだけでなくクラウドにも置き、USBメモリにも入れ、プリントアウトも用意しておく。どんな不具合が起こるか分からない。

私がコーチングを行っていたある起業家は、会場で電源が落ちてネットワークにも接続できなくなったことがあった。しかしプリントアウトを持っていたのでなんとかピッチを行うことができた。

8.質問は尊重するが、スライドに答えがあるなら、待ってもらえないか聞く

投資家はたいてい切れ者だが、あなたほどそのビジネスについてよく知っているわけではない。質問があったらそれに答え、その後またピッチに戻って説明を続けるようにする。

質問をおざなりにしてはいけないが、この後に答えになるような説明があることを丁寧に伝えるのは決して失礼なことではない。そのスライドまで早く説明した方がいいか、そのスライドに行くまで待ってもらえないかと尋ねてもいいだろう。たいていは待つと言ってくれるはずだ。

9.最初のミーティングからクロージングしようと思わないこと

1回目のミーティングの目標は2回目のミーティングをとりつけることだ。「常にクロージングをめざせ（Always Be Closing）」という“営業のABC”は、1回目のピッチには当てはまらない。

その場で契約がまとまるのは極めてまれなケースで、普通は「シード期」（創業のための準備をしている段階）やその前の段階の「プレシード」期の投資に限られる。ここでなすべきことは、投資家にもっと深く知りたいと思わせるだけの情報を提供することだ。

10.つねに正しくある必要はない。オープンな心で他者の意見に耳を傾けよう

ベンチャーキャピタリストが投資するのは「人」だ。あなたの人となりと考え方を評価している。最初のピッチで伝えるべきことは、あなた自身についてだ。

分かりやすく論理的に話をすべきだが、柔軟性に欠けると思われると、投資家から（VC用語で）「Coachable（指導しがいのある=アドバイスに耳を傾けることのできる）」な人でないと思われることもある。

自信を持って説明しつつも、さまざまな意見に対してオープンな心を持たなければならない。私が好きなベンチャーの格言は「ビジョンはしっかりと持ち、進む道は柔軟に」だ。

11.聞き手のことをよく知る

投資家に会う前に相手のことをしっかりとリサーチしておくこと。

自分の事業の分野に普段あまり投資しない投資家の場合は、時間の無駄になることもある。普段からあなたの分野に投資している相手の場合は、マーケットの基本的なデータや長い前置きは必要ないかもしれない。

12.猿が人間になるまでの進化の過程まで説明しない

上に挙げてきたようなポイントに加えて大切なことは、猿がネアンデルタール人に進化し、やがてスーツを着た人間になったというような、進化の過程を長々とスライドにするのは避けることだ。

もし投資家が、あなたが話そうとしているビジネスの内容につながる分野の「進化」を知らないとしたら（1994年に登場したウェブのように本当に新しいものでない限り）、あなたは間違った部屋にいて、間違った人たちと話しているのかもしれない。

13.エグゼクティブアシスタント（EA）には親切に接すること

パートナーは優先順位をつけてスケジュール通りに仕事を進めるために、エグゼクティブアシスタント（EA）を非常に頼りにしている。

そのため、彼らの意見やフィードバックが非常に意味を持つ。彼らとのやり取りで何か問題があると、投資家に報告されることがある。反対に、彼らに親切に接しておくと、スケジュール調整などで心強い味方になってくれることもある。

14.磨いて、磨いて、磨き抜く

自己最高のピッチデックを持っていくこと。ミーティングの前にプレゼンの練習を繰り返しやっておくこと。

トヨタ、日産、BMW、フォルクスワーゲン、フォード、GM、ロールスロイスなど、世界の大手自動車メーカーを顧客に持つ自動車部品サプライヤー、MINTH（ミンス）グループを知っているだろうか。

2025年1月現在、アメリカ、メキシコ、フランス、ドイツ、セルビア、タイ、中国、そして日本など世界14カ国で77の工場と事業所を持ち、2万3000人以上の従業員を抱えるグローバル企業だ。

国を越え、自動車業界で躍進を続けるMINTHグループの“強さの秘訣”は何なのか。北米事業を統括するジェレミー・コールター氏へのインタビューを通じて紐解く。

「時代を先読みした開発」で基盤を固める

1997年のグループ設立以来、ミンスはアルミを使ったモノづくりを強みとしてきた。現在でも、アルミを用いた外装部品の売上は、グループ全体で約半分を占める主力事業だ。

「『Create Beauty in Motion with Intelligence』をビジョンに成長を続けてきた当グループですが、2000年代に入って大手自動車メーカーで電気自動車（EV）の開発が進むと、他サプライヤーに先駆けて、EV部品の研究開発に乗り出しました。 メーカーとも綿密に連携しつつ時代の波を先読みしたことで、現在では世界で95車種ほどのEV用バッテリーケースを供給するまでになり、その分野では世界トップクラスのシェアを誇っています」（コールター氏）

世界進出は“グローカル”の思想で

ミンスのグローバルフットプリント。 MINTHグループ

ミンスは、成長期の頃から、地域を問わず世界中のクライアントを相手に取引を拡大し、グローバルで強固なネットワークを持つのも特徴の1つ。

「現在、アメリカとヨーロッパ市場での売上が約60％を占めています。中でも、アメリカ・カナダ・メキシコの北米地域は、ミンスにとっての最重要市場と位置づけて展開を広げてきました」（コールター氏）

ミンスがアメリカに初めて進出したのは、2007年のこと。ミシガン州に最初の工場を建設した。

コールター氏はその工場に、2013年に入社。当時の北米事業は工場が1つあるのみで規模も今よりずっと小さく、入社するまで「ミンスという会社のことは知らなかった」と振り返る。

その後、テネシー州やメキシコにも工場を増やし、事業を拡大。現在は3000人ほどの従業員が北米エリアで働いている（2025年1月時点の情報）。

「アメリカのみならず、ミンスの事業展開のポリシーは“グローカル”です。 国境にとらわれず“グローバル”に、かつその地域特有の自動車業界の課題や取り組みにあわせて“ローカル”に事業を展開してきました。その2つの視点が、当社最大の特徴かもしれません」（コールター氏）

「ミンスは、どこの国の企業でもない」

ミシガン州にある北米本社のエントランス。 MINTHグループ

ミンスは、アメリカ進出の約2年前の2005年に香港証券取引所に上場。当時香港を選んで上場する企業は少なかったというが、「最初からグローバル展開を見据えていたからこそ、香港市場での上場を選んだ」と明かす。

「ミンスはどこの国の会社か、国でカテゴライズするのは、非常に難しいことです。 台湾生まれ・カナダ籍の創業者は、台湾で自動車部品事業を学び、市場の成長性に目を付けました。そして中国で創業し、グループの母体企業はケイマン諸島で登記され、2005年に香港で上場したのです。 しかし特にアメリカでは、“中国で創業した企業”というイメージが先行し、固定観念や先入観を持たれてしまい、採用や契約に影響を及ぼすことも少なからずありました。 また、根拠のない情報が出回ることで機会損失につながることも。本来注力したい事業とは別のところで苦労する点が多いのも事実です」（コールター氏）

そんな中ミンスは、あくまでも“グローバルカンパニー”としてビジネスを発展させることを目指している。

「たとえば、日系の自動車部品メーカーは日系のカーメーカーとの取引が多く、アメリカもヨーロッパも然りでしょう。しかし、ミンスは国のカテゴリに縛られずにクオリティや独自性で勝負したいと思っています。 経営陣も非常に多国籍で、私が統括している北米事業でも、アメリカ、インド、メキシコ、ドイツ、中国、日本など世界各国のスタッフが働いています。 転換期を迎えている世界の自動車産業に貢献したい。それが私たちの思いです」（コールター氏）

2030年までに年間売上高80億ドルを目指す

それまで複数の会社で働いてきたコールター氏は、ミンスに入社してまもなく、「とてもユニークな企業だ」と感じたと話す。

「以前私が勤めていた会社は、業務領域の線引きがはっきりしていて、指示された業務を全うすることを従業員に求めていました。 ところが、ミンスは違う。与えられた業務以外の分野にも目を向け、興味を持って能動的に行動することが推奨されます」（コールター氏）

事実、品質管理のエンジニアとして入社したコールター氏は、早い段階でマネージャーに昇格。そして、テネシー州に工場を設立する際、工場長の打診を受けた。「そのような選択肢が自分のキャリアにあるなんて考えたこともなかったし、実現するとは夢にも思わなかった」と言う。

「私がそうであるように、ミンスは経歴や国籍、ジェンダーに関係なく、ベストを尽くして成果を出した従業員に挑戦の機会を与える会社です。 また経営陣も非常にフラットで、いつでもどこでも、誰もが経営層と対話できる環境です」（コールター氏）

常に世界を見据えて行動を続ける経営陣と、挑戦を推奨するフラットなボトムアップ文化。そのエネルギーを武器に、ミンスは2030年に向けて進み続けている。

「グループ全体で、2030年までに年間売上高80億ドルの達成を目指しています。目標としている地域のシェアは、北米30％、ヨーロッパ30％、中国30％、日韓で10％です。 北米市場では、成長性の高い製品をさらに伸ばすことと拠点の拡大を計画しています。日本市場にも高いポテンシャルがあるでしょう。 野心的な目標ですが、これまでもミンスがそうであったように、アグレッシブさと柔軟性をもって突き進んでいきます」（コールター氏）

""The Monsters has rapidly gained global popularity and widespread support, with related sales reaching a significant increase of 726.6% year-on-year,"" the company said in its performance report.

Pop Mart, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, shares have risen by nearly 400% compared to a year ago.

According to several retail analysts interviewed by Business Insider in November 2024, Lovebu's popularity comes from several factors, including ""certified"" by celebrities and the epidemic in Asia.

In April 2024, Lisa, of the popular K-POP girl group BLACKPINK, posted a love story on her Instagram, sparking a boom.

""I think Lovebu's extraordinary popularity lies in its unique design, spiritual connection, exclusivity and its ties with Lisa,"" Sory Park, project manager at Chinese consumer research firm Daxue Consulting, told Business Insider.

The Monsters collection sells in the US from around $8.99 (approximately 1,350 yen) badges to around 58cm stuffed animals worth $179.99.

スマホもカラダも、Be Cool...。

くおぉぉ、そこだ、行け、くらえッ！ …あ、やられちゃった……。

おっと失礼しました。スマホゲームに熱中していたものでして。最近のスマホゲームは本当に面白くて、グラフィックも迫力満点。ついのめり込んでしまうんですよね。

しかし、あまりに熱中しすぎるのも考えもの。高い処理性能を要求するゲームであればあるほど、ゲームをしているうちに大きな負荷がかかって、やがてスマホに熱がこもってしまう。ゲーム中のスマホがかなり熱くなり、バッテリーもガンガン減っていった経験がある人は少なくないでしょう。

このままでは熱をもったスマホがダウンしてしまう…。ついでにゲームに熱中しているプレイヤー自身までアツアツに。一体どうすれば…！

そこで活躍してくれるのが、電気を通すと熱が移動し、片側が冷えてもう片側が熱くなる特性のある｢ペルチェ素子｣を用いた冷却ガジェットを得意とするTORRASの製品。これらをフル活用してクールダウンした姿が下の写真です。

iPhoneの背面にマグネットで貼りついているのは、スマホを冷却しながら充電できる｢冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circle｣。そして首に掛けているのはネッククーラーの｢COOLiFY Cyber ウェアラブルエアコン｣、テーブルには半導体冷却によるひんやりした風を届けてくれる｢COOLiFY iva ハンディファン｣を置いて、全方位からスマホとプレイヤーを冷やしにかかる陣形です。

ゲームにも暑さにも、これなら勝てる！

ここで使ったTORRASの冷却ガジェット・三種の神器を、ひとつひとつ紹介していきましょう。

充電時の発熱を一気に冷却

まずはスマホ充電器、冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circleから。これ、充電も冷却もこなせるため、ゲーマーにこそ使って欲しい充電器なんです。

冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circleは、Qi2対応のワイヤレス充電器。電源アダプターにつないでスマホの背面にマグネットでバチっとくっつければ、スマホの充電端子を使わずともワイヤレス充電ができる、便利な充電ガジェットです。

では、どうして冷却が必要なのか。実はワイヤレス充電をしていると、仕組み上スマホの背面温度が高くなりやすいんです。15Wの高速ワイヤレス充電ができるQi2規格では、その背面温度はもはや熱すぎて触れないレベルに達することも…。

スマホのような機械にとって、高温は最大の敵のひとつ。その熱を抑えるため冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circleには17枚のフィンをもつ冷却ファンとペルチェ素子が搭載されています。

充電中、冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circleの充電面は、ヒンヤリと冷たくなっています。ワイヤレス充電のデメリットとされている余計な熱を冷却することで、スマホのバッテリーやチップ類へのダメージを抑えられるわけですね。

なんといっても、充電＆冷却というこの特性は、充電しながらスマホゲームをしたいというシチュエーションにはピッタリ。

しかも背面にはTORRAS独自のOstandと呼ばれるキックスタンドが内蔵され、スマホスタンドとしても利用できます。充電しながら動画を見る、枕元に置いて寝ている間に充電する、といった用途にもヨシ。

独自の冷却技術で、アツくなったカラダもクールダウン

ゲームに熱中しているとスマホだけでなくプレイヤー自身までアツくなってしまうのはよくある話。そんなときはCOOLiFY Cyber ウェアラブルエアコンで、全身くまなくクールダウンしていきましょ。

こちらは首にかけて使う、いわゆるネッククーラーとも呼ばれるもの。これまでにもTORRASはいくつかのネッククーラー製品を手掛けてきましたが、今回のモデルは歴代でもっともパワフル！

独自のKU3.0チップとグラフェン技術により、首裏に接する面の温度が一気に低下。実際に使ってみると、起動してから10秒もしないうちに冷たさを感じました。夏場には大活躍しそうです。

また、顔の左右だけでなく首の後頭部や背中側にも風をおくる、360度の高速エアフローも特徴。汗ばむ背中とシャツのあいだに風が入るので、汗のベタつきをサラっと流してくれます。

本体のボタンだけでなく、専用アプリからも操作が可能。送風のみ、冷却＋送風、ヒーターの3モードが選択できます。ヒーター性能も優秀で、うなじが温まることで肩周りもポカポカしてきますよ。

夏冬兼用のネッククーラーは、年間通して活躍するのがありがたいですよね。

涼しさをコンパクトに持ち歩こう

より手軽に涼しくなりたいなら、COOLiFY iva ハンディファンでサクっと冷却。冒頭の写真で見せたようにデスクに自立させられるから、卓上扇風機のようにも使える便利なハンディファンです。

小型な本体ファンの中央には独自のCOOLOGY冷却チップを搭載し、電源ONから10秒もしないうちに風が一気に冷えていきます。出てくる風は冷たくて心地良いし、冷たくなったチップをおでこや首などに直接当てても心地良いですよ。

底面にはバッグやストラップなどに引っ掛けるためのカラビナも装備。使わないときは本体底面に収納できるから場所も取らないし、展開すればスタンドとして机の上などでもしっかり自立してくれます。

TORRASの冷却技術で、スマホもカラダも冷えっ冷え

ここで紹介した冷却ワイヤレス充電器 Ostand Polar Circle、COOLiFY Cyber ウェアラブルエアコン、COOLiFY iva ハンディファンは、すべてTORRAS独自の冷却技術を採用。スマホも人間も、熱がこもると調子が悪くなりがちなもの。スマホだけでなく、人間の脳だって冷却しないとうまく働かないし、｢冷やすこと｣って実は重要なんですよね。

確かな冷却性能をもったTORRASの冷却ガジェットたちで、今年はクールに過ごしてみませんか？ というわけで、僕もあらためてやりこみ中のスマホゲームに戻ろうかな。スマホもカラダもクールダウンできてきたし、アツいゲームの再開といこうか！

地域の交通課題はどうしたら解消できるのか——。「地域の足」を支える一方で、労働人口の減少や採算性との両立という難しい課題を抱えている交通事業者。その解決策の一つとして大きな期待を集めているのが自動運転だ。

テクノロジーの社会実装に詳しい日本総合研究所の東博暢氏と、自動運転に力を入れているいすゞ自動車 商用モビリティ推進部 部長の興津茂氏に話を聞いた。

地域交通の現状と課題

日本は今、「供給制約社会」になりつつある。

人口減少が進み、さまざまな業種で労働力不足が叫ばれているが、物流や地域交通を支えてきたドライバー不足もその例外ではない。労働基準法の改正で、トラックやバスなどのドライバーの時間外労働の上限が年960時間となったこともあり、より事態は深刻になっている。

ドライバーが不足すれば、地域商店街の衰退も相まって、特に地方において生活物資の供給が制約され、買い物困難になる。さらに、「地域の足」となっていた地域交通がドライバー不足で減便や廃止されれば、高齢者が家からあまり出なくなり、結果、認知症や寝たきりが増え、社会保障費が上がる。

東博暢（あずま・ひろのぶ）氏／日本総合研究所 リサーチ・コンサルティング部門 プリンシパル。産学官民地域共創による日本の成長戦略の基盤となる先進性の高い技術の社会実装を通じた地方創生を推進、スタートアップ支援やオープンイノベーションを通じた新事業創造を専門とする。その他、スマートシティ政策の推進アーキテクトとしての活動も実施。内閣府をはじめとした政府有識者委員や静岡県等の各自治体の首長のフェロー等、多数歴任。

「移動に関わる制約は、日本全体の大きな問題につながっています。移動のペイン（課題）を解消することが極めて重要になります」（東氏）

ドライバー不足解消のため、自治体主導のもと、乗り合いバスを限られた地域内で運行し、なんとか「地域の足」を確保しているケースも多い。一方で、より高齢化が進み、利用者がバス停までさえもたどり着けない状況も生まれているという。

バス路線が縮小されてしまえば、ヤングケアラー（家族の介護・世話を行う子ども・若者）が家族の病院への送迎ができないなど、問題は膨れ上がる。東氏は「このままでは市民のウェルビーイングは下がる一方だ」と警鐘を鳴らす。

2027年度に自動運転「レベル4」を事業化へ

しかし、決して悲観的な未来だけが広がっているわけではない。ドライバー不足の解決の糸口として大きな注目を集めているのが、自動運転技術だ。

自動車メーカーからスタートアップまで、さまざまな企業が自動運転の実用化にトライしているが、国内においては、いすゞ自動車（以下いすゞ）が積極的に取り組んでいることをご存じだろうか。

同社は2024年4月に発表した新たな中期経営計画「ISUZU Transformation - Growth to 2030（IX）」で、自動運転ソリューション、コネクテッドサービス、カーボンニュートラルソリューションの3領域を新事業として設定し、中でも、自動運転に関しては、2027年度にバスなどの自動運転「レベル4」（特定条件下における完全自動運転）事業化を目指しているという。

興津茂（おきつ・しげる）氏／いすゞ自動車 商用モビリティ推進部 部長。2002年いすゞ自動車株式会社入社。営業部門、アフターセールス部門での業務を経て、2020年より商用モビリティ推進部にて、CASE戦略に関する業務に従事。 現在は、中期経営計画「ISUZU Transformation - Growth to 2030（IX）」にて策定した「運ぶ」を創造する新事業創出に向け、自動運転ソリューションやコネクテッドサービスの企画推進を担当している。

同社の商用モビリティ推進部部長の興津氏は「我々は路線バスを運行する交通事業者ではありませんが、公共交通の路線バスを多く提供している自動車メーカーとして、ドライバー不足の問題を自動運転バスで解決できないかと思っています」と熱を込める。

「自動運転はかなり前から技術陣が取り組んでいますが、いきなり自動運転が実現できるわけではなく、衝突防止やブレーキ制御などの要素技術の積み重ねがあって初めて実現できます。レベル4はハードルが高いのは事実ですが、宣言をしなければ自動運転の事業化は先延ばしになるだけ。いすゞとしてもきちんと宣言して、実現に向けてまい進したいです」（興津氏）

いすゞは2027年度の事業化に向けて、自動運転システムの開発や導入支援を手掛けるスタートアップ「ティアフォー」に出資し、「レベル4」の路線バスの自動運転の開発を共同で進めている。

2022年から福岡空港の国内線と国際線のターミナル間を結ぶシャトルバスを自動運転で運行する実証実験を開始しているほか、2023年度からは福岡県北九州市と神奈川県平塚市の各バス事業者と連携して、実際のバス路線を使って実証実験を続けている。

「北九州空港～朽網駅（JR九州 日豊本線）」の区間で行われた実証実験の様子

2024年度の実証では、バス停からの自動発車、路上駐車の自動回避、信号連携箇所の増加など、より実運用に近い実証を行った。2025年度以降はさらに実運用に近い精度の高い実証を行い、2027年度の実用化に向けて準備を進めている

実証は、いすゞ1社で行うのではない。例えば平塚市の場合は、自治体のほか、バスを運行する神奈川中央交通、総合商社の三菱商事、高精度位置情報技術を持つアイサンテクノロジー、自動運転の社会実装に強みがあるA-Driveの5者とともに共創を進めている。

いすゞの自動運転の実証実験をはじめ、実は自治体や交通事業者以外の多様なステークホルダーを巻き込んだ官民連携モデルの事業体を組んだ実証実験は各地で行われている。

「今まで連携しなかった業種・業態のサービスが横断して地域住民に提供されるとなれば、住民にとっては選択肢が増えるでしょうし、事業会社からしたら価格設定も含めて、新しいメニュー開発の可能性が広がって、面白くなるはず。工夫次第でいろいろなモデルが作られるでしょう」（東氏）

そんな中、2027年度に自動運転「レベル4」の事業化を掲げたいすゞについて、東氏は評価した。

「世界中で、バス以外の車も含めた自動運転が始まっています。下手をしたら、人間の運転よりもスムーズというケースも出始めています。ただ、技術的には可能であっても、地域類型ごとに経済的な合理性があるのか、持続可能性はあるのか、そこまで考えられるかどうか。 まずは強いチームを組成して、できることから始めるしかないでしょう。2030年代になれば、データセンターの分散化、APNネットワークの普及や（オールフォトニクス・ネットワーク）やAIの進展によりがデジタルの環境整備も大きく進むことが期待される為、2027年度に事業化を目指すのはいいスピード感だと思います」（東氏）

地球の「運ぶ」をどう創造するか

自動運転車両が効率的かつ安全な運行を行うためには、道路のデザインを自動運転車両に適したものにするなどの取り組みも必要となる。

今後、自動運転バスの事業化において大きな課題として挙げられるのは、収益性と持続可能性だ。

バス輸送を運営する地方交通事業者の視点では、自動運転車を管理運用する業務オペレーションが追加負担となることを受容できない可能性もある。黎明期は利益が得られない可能性があるなかで、長期的なスパンで普及期までもっていくにはどうすればよいのだろうか。

「自動運転バスの価格は大きな課題だと思います。『複雑な道路を通りたい』などといった技術的課題をクリアするために自動運転車両スペックを向上させると車両価格も上がっていってしまいます。いかに受け入れてもらえる価格にするかというのは我々に課されている課題です」（興津氏）

課題は山積している。ただ、いきなりのジャンプはない。まずは目の前の課題に誠実に向き合う。

「我々いすゞはバスを作ってきた自負があります。バスに求められている安全性や乗り心地を追求してきましたが、それらに加えて、バス事業者様が培ってきた運転のノウハウや安心感などを自動運転バスに反映させなければなりません。自動運転はできるけれど、サポート役の誰かが乗っていないといけない状況では、自動運転バスの普及が進まずドライバー不足の解消にはなりません。一歩ずつ歩んでいく覚悟です」（興津氏）

地球の「運ぶ」を創造する。それが新たにいすゞの掲げたパーパス（使命）だ。まさに新たな「運ぶ」の価値をいかに生み出すのか、いすゞの挑戦はこれからも続く。

Pitfalls of frequent use of women outside the company [Japan Research Institute Survey],https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2504-gender-gap-in-executives/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Japanese companies are trying to increase the proportion of female directors, and formal responses are taking place.

Analyzing the skills held by directors of Japanese companies (TOPIX100), a survey by Japan Research Institute found that there is a clear difference between men and women.

Men were overwhelmingly dominant when it comes to business execution, such as business strategies. In the United States and the United Kingdom, this gender gap is not as large as in Japan.

Yamada Eiji, director of the Japan Institute of Research, believes that this is partly because Japanese companies use a lot of ""outside directors"" rather than in-house training to increase the number of female executives.

In her contribution, Yamada analyzes the differences in the promotion of female executives both domestically and internationally as follows:

Over 20% of TOPIX 100 female directors

In December 2023, the government announced a target of ""19% female executives by 2025,"" which is positioned as the intermediate target of ""30% by 2030"" in the focus policy on women's active participation and gender equality (a women's basic policy) formulated in June of the same year.

In response to this trend, many listed companies are increasing the number of female directors. According to a 2024 survey by Japan Research Institute, the proportion of women on the board of directors of Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime companies reached 16.1%. On the other hand, it is also necessary to verify whether this trend is accompanied by the ""actual situation.""

Let's take a look at this based on data from directors of TOPIX 100 companies, which are likely to be actively promoting female executives.

Trends in the proportion of female boards of directors in TOPIX 100 companies. Created by: Japan Institute

The appointment of female directors in TOPIX 100 companies has certainly increased over the past few years. Specifically, the proportion of women on board meetings was steadily rising from 16.1% in 2022 survey to 21.8% in 2024.

Furthermore, when limiting to newly appointed directors, the proportion of women increased significantly to 28.9% in 2024, compared to 21.8%.

On the other hand, it is too early to use these numbers alone to determine that female executives from Japanese companies are in full swing.









However, the company's attitude is ""polarized.""

Polarizing Japanese companies' responses (comparison within TOPIX 100). Created by: Japan Institute

Let's take a little more careful look at the current situation. First of all, it is not necessarily the case that all companies are following the trend of promoting women.

This is because when comparing the top companies (17 companies) and the bottom (15 companies) in TOPIX 100 with the top companies (17 companies) in the lower companies, the percentage of female directors in the top companies is 27.0%, while the bottom companies are more than doubled, at 13.0%, which makes the company's attitude more polarized.

This is the situation even for TOPIX 100 companies, so it appears that the gap in the efforts of Japanese companies as a whole is even greater.",businessinsider

Analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated his buy rating but trimmed his price target by $19 to $455. That still implies more than 72% upside from where shares closed on Friday. Gengaro lowered his first-quarter and full-year 2025 delivery forecasts, saying a slower-than-expected rollout of Tesla's new Model Y and the timing of its lower-priced vehicle could affect sales volumes. Tesla is expected to unveil a lower-cost electric vehicle, potentially a variant of its Model Y car, in the first half of the year. The company has already cut prices on its Model Y vehicle amid slowing global EV demand and rising competition, particularly in China. Gengaro is also cautious on how anti-Elon Musk crowds could affect sales in the near term. ""The ramp of the new Model Y, the best-selling car in the world in 2024, is clearly a short-term sales headwind,"" Gengaro wrote in a Sunday note to clients. ""As Model Y production ramps in 2025, we expect sales to accelerate. In addition, protests against Elon Musk (damage to Tesla sites, vandalism of customer-owned cars, damage to Superchargers) is a headwind to sales."" TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla stock performance. The analyst cited data from the Stifel Think Tank Group that reflected a fall in Democrats' favorability rating on Tesla and an uptick in Republicans' views on the company. Democrats have been historically much more likely to buy EVs than Republicans, he pointed out. Still, Gengaro remains bullish for the long run given Tesla's strong positioning against other automakers in terms of tariff risks , as well as the expected rollout of its driver assistance software known as full self-driving in Texas by June. The introduction of the lower-cost car and growth in Tesla's energy storage business could also be catalysts for the stock, he said. ""We expect share price volatility to persist in the near term, but remain optimistic on TSLA's medium- to long-term prospects and reiterate our Buy,"" Gengaro said. Tesla has had a rocky year and the stock has given up much of its postelection gain , losing about 34.7% year to date. Shares were down more than 4% in the premarket.

https://cnbc.com,France's Marine Le Pen barred from running for public office for 5 years after embezzlement conviction: Media,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/frances-le-pen-awaits-verdict-in-embezzlement-trial.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Marine Le Pen, member of parliament and French far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National - RN) party leader, arrives at the RN party headquarters in Paris, France, July 1, 2024.

The leader of France's far-right National Assembly Marine Le Pen has been barred from running for public office for five years after being found guilty of misappropriating EU funds, according to Reuters and French media.

The decision is a watershed moment in French politics as it halts her 2027 presidential election hopes and throws her party into disarray after a meteoric rise in popularity in recent years. It's widely expected that Le Pen will launch an appeal against the conviction.

Earlier Monday, Le Pen and eight of the party's MEPs (members of the European Parliament) were found guilty of embezzlement.

The court then announced that the crimes committed by Le Pen and her other co-defendants merited an immediate ban from public office — preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.

Le Pen was also given a four-year prison sentence — two years suspended and two wearing an electronic tag — and fined 100,000 euros, although these will not be implemented while any appeals processes are under way. The ban from public office is immediate, however.

The far-right firebrand leader reportedly left court before hearing how long she might be banned from running for public office. The outcome throws France's powerful right wing into chaos as Le Pen was leading opinion polls ahead of the next presidential vote.

Jordan Bardella, president of National Rally and seen as Le Pen's right-hand man, commented after the sentence that ""today, it is not only Marine Le Pen who is being unjustly condemned: it is French democracy that is being executed,"" he posted on social media platform X.

Le Pen's political allies in Europe rallied around the beleaguered politician after the sentence was announced.

Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated ""I am Marine"" on X after the court's decision, while Italy's Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and head of the populist Lega party, said the court in Paris had ""condemned Marine Le Pen,"" warning there would be repercussions for the EU.

""The ruling against Marine Le Pen is a declaration of war by Brussels, at a time when the warlike impulses of [European Commission President Ursula] Von der Leyen and [French President Emmanuel] Macron are frightening. We will not be intimidated, we will not stop: full steam ahead my friend!""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also commented on the conviction, telling reporters Monday that ""more and more European capitals are going down the path of trampling over democratic norms,"" state news agency Tass reported.",cnbc

Tesla's stock just wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022 and suffered its third-steepest drop in the company's 15 years on the public market.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged 36% in the first three months of the year.

The last time Tesla had a worse stretch was at the end of 2022, when the stock cratered 54%. That quarter included CEO Elon Musk's sale of more than $22 billion worth of Tesla shares to finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, later renamed X. On Friday, Musk said his artificial intelligence startup xAI has acquired X in a deal valuing the social media company at $33 billion.

Tesla's first-quarter drop wiped out over $460 billion in market cap. The majority of the quarter overlaps with Musk's time in the second Trump administration, leading an effort to slash government spending and regulations, and terminating tens of thousands of federal employees.

Musk is leading what's known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. As of Monday, the DOGE website claimed that, through March 24, the program had notched $140 billion in federal spending reductions, a number equal to less than one-third of Tesla's valuation loss in the first quarter.

""My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half,"" Musk said on Sunday night at a rally he held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to promote the right-wing judge he's backing for Tuesday's state supreme court election. ""This is a very expensive job is what I'm saying.""

DOGE's website contained numerous errors previously, causing the group to revise its own claims about its savings. And many of Musk's allegations about waste, fraud and abuse in the federal budget have also been shown to be misleading or false.

Musk recently said on a Fox News interview with Bret Baier, that he and DOGE plan to slash $1 trillion from total federal spending levels by May.

Musk's role in the White House is one factor weighing on Tesla's stock, as it's contributing to waves of protests, boycotts and violent attacks on Tesla stores and vehicles around the world. President Trump's automotive tariffs are also a concern as they involve Tesla's key suppliers, notably Mexico and China. Tariff fears sparked a broader selloff in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq closing the quarter down 10%, its biggest drop since 2022.

Tesla faces other headwinds, such as a steep decline in new vehicle sales, and pressure to deliver on Musk's promises for robotaxis while rivals extend their lead in the market.

Musk has said Tesla will launch a driverless ride-hailing business in Austin, Texas in June, but some analysts are voicing skepticism about the company's ability to meet that deadline.

For about a decade, Musk has promised that existing Tesla cars can be turned into robotaxi-ready vehicles with one more software upgrade. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk said that a forthcoming version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software will require a hardware upgrade as well.

While the first-quarter stock drop has been painful for shareholders, they've experienced similar volatility in the recent past. In the first quarter of 2024, the shares plunged 29% due to declining auto sales and increased competition. But the stock rallied the rest of the year to finish up 63%.

""Long term, I think Tesla stock is going to do fine,"" Musk said at the Green Bay rally. ""So, you know, maybe it's a buying opportunity.""

The mortgage company Rocket is buying competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion, just weeks after acquiring real estate listing company Redfin .

Rocket Cos. said Monday that bringing Mr. Cooper Group Inc. into the fold will create a business representing one in every six mortgages in the United States and give it almost 7 million additional clients. The deal will boost loan volumes, the company said, while lowering client acquisition costs.

""By combining Mr. Cooper and Rocket, we will form the strongest mortgage company in the industry, offering an end-to-end homeownership experience backed by leading technology and grounded in customer care,"" Mr. Cooper Chairman and CEO Jay Bray, who will become president and CEO of Rocket Mortgage, said in a statement.

The U.S. housing market has been slumping for years with homebuyers, and sellers, buffeted by soaring mortgages rates and sky high prices that have put homes out of reach for many Americans.

Companies like Rocket, which is on an acquisition streak, are attempting to create more of a one-stop shopping experience for frazzled would-be homebuyers.

Bray will report to Rocket Cos. CEO Varun Krishna.

Mr. Cooper shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 11 Rocket shares for each share of Mr. Cooper common stock. Mr. Cooper is based in Coppell, Texas.

Rocket shareholders will own approximately 75% of the combined company, while Mr. Cooper stockholders will own about 25%. The combined company's board will have 11 members, with nine being from Rocket and two from Mr. Cooper.

Earlier this month Rocket, based in Detroit, announced that it was buying Redfin in an all-stock deal worth $1.75 billion.

Redfin, which was founded in 2004, has more than 1 million for sale and rental listings on its online platform.

The National Association of Realtors announced this month that existing home sales rose 4.2% in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million units. That was in part thanks to easing mortgage rates and more properties on the market encouraging home shoppers.

The U.S. housing sales began to slump in 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",cnbc

This quarter was plagued by mounting tariff fears from the new administration, which should all come to a head on Wednesday, April 2 — a date President Donald Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day."" Investors are holding out hope that on Wednesday, they'll receive some clarity and relief from the high volatility wracking equities in recent weeks. The S & P 500 , Dow Jones Industrial Average , and Nasdaq Composite are all on pace to end the quarter with losses. The S & P 500 is off more than 5%, while the Nasdaq is down 11%, and both are tracking for their worst quarterly performance since 2022. The Dow is on pace for a 2% loss in the period. Here are the 10 biggest outperformers in the S & P 500 for the first quarter. Coming in at first place was pharmacy retailer CVS Health , which has rallied more than 50% this quarter. On Feb. 12, shares popped 15% in a single day after CVS posted a big beat on its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. All signs point to the once-struggling retail chain beginning to right the ship, especially after CEO David Joyner took the helm last October. Following its earnings blowout, analysts at both Cantor Fitzgerald and Leerink Partners upgraded the stock. ""The pieces are in place for [CVS to return] from what has been a bottoming of operations performance,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Cherny. Another winning name was Philip Morris International . Shares of the tobacco giant have surged 31% in the first quarter. Philip Morris is another stock that belongs to the consumer staples sector. Investors have increasingly flocked to the category for its defensive attributes as emerging tariff policies threaten to shake up global supply chains. Earlier this month, Argus upgraded the stock to a buy rating from hold, citing the firm's nicotine pouches — which are especially popular with younger populations — as a major catalyst. ""We see revenue growth ahead driven by PM's nicotine pouches as management is now better enabled to market this smoke-free product and is committing capital expenses,"" the firm wrote. On the other hand, Deckers Outdoors — which owns brands such as UGG, Hoka and Teva — led the quarter's losses, with its 46% decline. Earlier this month, the stock was trading at lows not seen since 2024, reinforcing recent sentiment surveys indicating that consumers may be growing increasingly bearish on the economy. Beleaguered electric vehicle maker Tesla , down 37% this quarter, came in second place. The stock has eroded much of its post-election gains as investors have increasingly grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's role in the new Trump administration. During a Sunday town hall event in Wisconsin, Bloomberg News reported that Musk said that his role within the newly created Department of Government Efficiency had hurt the stock . Debates have heated up between investors on whether Tesla's fundamentals have justified the stock's recent declines — or whether the market has unduly punished shares. In a recent note, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated his buy rating on Tesla, but cut his price target by $19 to $455. This updated forecast is still 72% above where the stock closed on Friday. ""We expect share price volatility to persist in the near term, but remain optimistic on TSLA's medium- to long-term prospects and reiterate our Buy,"" Gengaro wrote.

President Donald Trump is about to announce his biggest batch of tariffs yet. And while major details about them are shrouded in mystery, one thing is clear: Some trade partners are about to feel a lot more pain than others.

Trump on Wednesday is set to unveil ""reciprocal tariffs"" against other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods, or other policies that the White House considers unfair trade barriers. He has hyped up the kickoff date as America's ""liberation day"" and ""the big one.""

The plan has created significant uncertainty, and many of its core components — including the number of countries impacted, how each country's tariff rate is being calculated, and which nations will be hardest hit — remain unclear.

While Trump has touted the new tariffs as the key to resetting America's economic relationship with the rest of the world, some in his administration have suggested a narrower focus on a handful of prime targets.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a Fox Business interview on March 18, singled out what he called the ""Dirty 15.""

His was referring to the 15% of nations that account for the bulk of U.S. trading volume while imposing hefty tariffs and other ""non-tariff barriers"" on U.S. goods.

Bessent did not name those countries.

Kevin Hassett, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said in a subsequent interview on the network that the administration is looking at 10 to 15 countries that account for America's ""entire trillion-dollar trade deficit.""

Hassett also did not name those countries. Data from the Commerce Department show that in 2024, the U.S. had the highest goods trading deficit with China, followed by the European Union, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Italy, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Austria and Sweden.

The Office of the U.S Trade Representative, in a notice seeking public comment as part of a review of unfair trade practices to be delivered to Trump by Monday, listed 21 countries in which it is ""particularly interested.""",cnbc

Artificial intelligence chip developer Cerebras said Monday that it has obtained clearance from a U.S. committee to sell shares to Group 42, a Microsoft -backed AI company based in the United Arab Emirates.

That clearance came from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and it's a key step for Cerebras in its effort to go public. Cerebras competes with Nvidia , whose graphics processing units are the industry's choice for training and running AI models, but most of its revenue comes from a customer called Group 42.

Cerebras filed to go public in September but has not provided details on timing or size for the initial public offering. The regulatory overhang was tied to the company's relationship with Group 42, which was the source of 87% of Cerebras' revenue in the first half of 2024, made the IPO look uncertain.

""We thank @POTUS for making America the best place in the world to invest in cutting-edge #AI technology,"" Andrew Feldman, Cerebras' co-founder and CEO, wrote in a Monday LinkedIn post. ""We thank G42's leadership and the UAE's leadership for their ongoing partnership and commitment to supporting U.S headquartered AI companies.""

Lawmakers have previously worried about Group 42's connections to China. Last year Mike Gallagher, then a Republican member of Congress from Wisconsin, said in a statement that he was ""glad to see G42 reduce its investment exposure to Chinese companies."" Microsoft later announced a $1.5 billion investment in Group 42.

Both Cerebras and Group 42 had given voluntary notice to CFIUS about the sale of voting shares, according to the Sunnyvale, California-based company's IPO prospectus. Group 42 had agreed to buy $335 million worth of Cerebras shares by April 15, according to the prospectus. The two companies later changed the agreement to say Group 42 would be buying non-voting shares, prompting them to withdraw their notice, because they said they did not believe CFIUS had jurisdiction over sales of non-voting securities.

CFIUS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Just a handful of technology companies have gone public since 2021, as higher interest rates made unprofitable companies less desirable. But in recent months, Cerebras and a few technology-related companies have taken steps toward IPOs, and last week, AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave went public.

CoreWeave shares fell 7% on Monday, its second day of trading.

Though Mensa has opened up about dealing with his mental health, especially as a Black man, in his music and in interviews, he's learned that he can reach a different audience by sharing his experiences on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

""I'm just realizing how I can furthest spread that message and accelerate that conversation through these channels,"" Mensa, 31, tells CNBC Make It.

""I've always had a philosophy that vulnerability is like my superpower.""

On March 20, Mensa recorded a video sitting in his car right after his second-ever Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and shared it on his TikTok and Instagram accounts.

""Something I was talking about [in the meeting] was how my addictions blossomed out of a lifetime of depression,"" Mensa said.

That first post got over 60,000 likes across the platforms, with thousands of users joining in on the conversation in the comments sections.

The reaction to that video helped jumpstart a series on his platform where Mensa has mental health conversations directly with his fanbase.

In the second video of his series Mensa discussed his battle with suicidal ideation.

Mensa tells CNBC Make It that he started drinking alcohol when he was 10 or 11 years old. After several drunken altercations that placed him in jail and a bad car accident after a night of drinking, he realized his relationship with alcohol was detrimental.

""I had to realize, 'What has alcohol been doing for me? I mean, what positive benefit can I even say I've been deriving from this?'"" he says.

Mensa stopped drinking almost four years ago.

""I train myself to be disciplined. And that's probably the most critical part of cutting out alcohol is just having the discipline to say, 'This is my decision.'""

Mensa also strengthens that discipline by practicing meditation: ""I would probably say the single most impactful factor in me managing my mental health in a much more healthy way is meditation.""",cnbc

But the 53-year-old might never have gotten his career were it not for a piece of junk mail from American Express.

Goggins, who grew up poor in a small Atlanta suburb, was a student at Georgia Southern University when he received a letter from the bank inviting him to join.

""I got this invitation from American Express to take on debt,"" he said in a 2019 appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" ""I got pre-approved for a max of probably $500.""

But on top of the offer to open a line of credit with the company came an offer that proved much more appealing for the teenaged Goggins.

""With this invitation came two round-trip ticket [offers]. One was $99 east of the Mississippi. The other was $199 west of the Mississippi,"" he explained. ""This was a time when it cost, like, $1,100 to fly from Atlanta to Los Angeles.""

""I saw it not as an opportunity to buy a bunch of televisions, but to leave,"" he continued. ""I was out. I quit college.""

Thanks to the American Express offer, Goggins said he was able to move to ""a really bad apartment"" in North Hollywood with $300 in his pocket. Working at an LA Fitness gym and as a valet helped Goggins make ends meet while he slowly but surely scratched out a career for himself.

Since 1989, Goggins has appeared in more than 50 movies and over 40 TV shows.

""None of this was ever supposed to happen to someone like me,"" Goggins told Vanity Fair last year. ""My mother made $12,000 a year. I grew up in a little farmhouse. You had to walk through my bedroom to get to the bathroom. And that's all I knew.""

Speaking to GQ earlier this year, Goggins reflected on the opportunities that acting has provided him.

""The first time I made more money in a day than my mother made in a year of work was the greatest and worst day of my life,"" he said.

But none of it would have been possible without that piece of junk mail.

""I'm only here because of American Express,"" he told Colbert. ""[I took it as a sign] from God that I was supposed to come to Los Angeles and be an actor.""

https://cnbc.com,How the stock market may react to different tariff scenarios this week,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/how-the-stock-market-may-react-to-different-tariff-scenarios-this-week.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson says President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on April 2 ""is likely a stepping stone for further negotiations, as opposed to a clearing event."" Wilson's baseline scenario for tariffs is as follows: scope for a higher tariff rate on goods from China product-specific tariffs on imports from the European Union potential de-escalation on levies on Mexico and Canada product-level tariffs on multiple Asian economies The baseline scenario for reciprocal tariffs doesn't necessarily mean the market can't move higher, according to Wilson. He noted that product-level tariffs are ""likely to be more impactful on a sector basis."" However, upside for the S & P 500 is likely at a ceiling of 5,800 to 5,900 in the near term, even if tariffs end up weaker than the baseline case, according to the strategist, who's been at Morgan Stanley for 35 years. To reach the high end of Morgan Stanley's first half range for the S & P 500 (5,500 to 6,100), the market would need to see lighter-than-expected tariff policy, as well as a ""clear reacceleration in earnings revisions breadth, something we are currently not seeing at the index level,"" Wilson wrote in a research note on Monday. The market could sell off to the lower end of the firm's forecast —around 5,500 — if tariffs are more restrictive than expected. This could entail scenarios such as broader tariffs on the European Union, an additional 10% levy on goods from China, or country-level tariffs on other major trading partners such as Vietnam, Japan, Korea and India. ""This is perhaps the outcome the market was starting to price on Friday,"" Wilson said. The broader market, as measured by the S & P 500, is on pace to finish March about 6% lower.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Wall Street banks got meager payout from CoreWeave IPO,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/wall-street-banks-got-meager-payout-from-coreweave-ipo-.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Michael Intrator, founder and CEO of CoreWeave Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, attends his company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market in New York City on March 28, 2025.

Wall Street banks waited a long time for a billion dollar IPO from a U.S. tech company. They're not making much money from the one they got.

The underwriting discount and commissions paid by artificial intelligence infrastructure provider CoreWeave , which hit the Nasdaq on Friday, amounted to just 2.8% of the total proceeds, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That means that of the $1.5 billion raised in the offering, $42 million went to underwriters.

That's on the low side historically. Since Facebook's record-setting IPO in 2012, there have been 25 venture-backed offerings for tech-related U.S. companies that have raised at least $1 billion, with an average underwriting fee of 4%, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. Facebook, in raising $16 billion, paid out the lowest percentage at 1.1%.

Morgan Stanley , which led the Facebook IPO, had the coveted lead left spot on CoreWeave, followed by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs . The three banks are typically the leaders when it comes to tech IPOs. They've been counting on a revival in the market under President Donald Trump after a lull dating back to the end of 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates put a halt on new offerings.

But CoreWeave's initial trading sessions aren't providing much confidence in a rebound. After lowering its price to $40 from a range of $47 to $55, CoreWeave failed to notch any gains on Friday and fell 7% on Monday to $37.20.

Declines in the broader market have weighed on CoreWeave, but investors also have specific concerns about the company, including its reliance on Microsoft as a customer, its hefty level of debt and the sustainability of a business model built around reselling Nvidia's technology.

CoreWeave is the first among venture-backed companies to raise $1 billion or more since Freshworks in September of 2021. Freshworks carried an underwriting fee of 5.3%, while UiPath , which hit the market a few months earlier, paid 5%. In April of that year, AppLovin carried a 2.6% fee, the last time a billion-dollar offering had a lower fee than CoreWeave's.

Among the few more recent IPOs — which all raised less than $1 billion — the fees were much higher. For Instacart and Klaviyo in 2023 and Reddit , Astera Labs , Rubrik and ServiceTitan last year, payouts were all at least 5%.

As lead in the CoreWeave deal, Morgan Stanley was given the highest percentage allocation of shares for clients at 27%. JPMorgan received 25%, and Goldman Sachs got 15%.

Those percentage allocations typically correspond fairly closely to how much of the fees each bank receives, though with a slightly higher amount to the lead bank for the management fee piece.

David Golden, a partner at Revolution Ventures who previously led tech investment banking at JPMorgan, said ""there's a little 'black box' involved in the underwriting compensation"" that's not disclosed in the prospectus. Based on his experience with IPOs and the historical norm, Golden estimated that Morgan Stanley got at least $13 million for its work, amounting to just over 30% of the total payout, while the number for Goldman Sachs would be slightly above $6 million.

Representatives from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Garcia joined the 3-Stock Lunch segment on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Monday to discuss Palantir , General Motors and Coinbase . Here's what she thinks of each: Palantir While Palantir started off the year ""strong,"" Garcia said the defense technology stock has pulled back due both to macroeconomic headwinds as well as company-specific concerns. Palantir trades at 147 times next year's earnings, far above the S & P 500 multiple as well as the company's own 5-year average. ""You're seeing a question of where IT spending is going to go going forward ... (and) people are moving more towards defensive and value"" businesses, Garcia said. ""Probably, the name is not going to hold up well in that environment, so I'd actually stay clear here."" PLTR YTD mountain Palantir in 2025 Despite the recent pullback, Palantir is still up about 11% in 2025. The Denver-based company led by CEO Alexander Karp snapped a nine-month-long advance in March. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a hold rating and a price target suggesting shares may rise more than 6% over the next year. General Motors General Motors is at risk from President Donald Trump's tariff policies. But because GM's valuation is reasonable and its share price has fallen significantly since the election, some of the issues the business faces are already priced in to the stock, Garcia said. ""I would hold this here if you own it,"" she said. ""I'm not jumping in based on some of the headwinds,"" but this probably isn't ""a time to get out either."" General Motors shares have pulled back more than 11% this year. But Wall Street expects a rebound: the typical analyst has a buy rating and price target suggesting more than 28% upside, according to LSEG. Coinbase For Coinbase, Garcia would sell due to the choppiness in crypto assets. ""This is very volatile with cryptocurrency trading, as we've seen,"" Garcia said. ""For that reason, I'd stay away from it."" Coinbase shares have tumbled about 31% in 2025 and the crypto trading platform suffered its worst quarter since 2022. While most analysts surveyed by LSEG rate the stock a hold, the average price target implies the shares will soar more than 80% over the next year.

He got his first job when he was 14 working as a church janitor; by high school, he worked in fast food and earned $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage at the time. It was around that time Robinson decided he wanted to figure out a way to retire as early as possible. And last year, at age 39, Robinson reached his goal with $3.5 million socked away. His goal to retire early fueled his career of maximizing his value in the workforce, changing careers and negotiating higher pay. Here's how.

$5.15 an hour to $1.1 million a year

Robinson, now 40, continued to work fast food jobs through college while studying computer engineering at Tennessee Tech. After graduating, he began his career working for power and energy companies.

For his very first job after college, Robinson says he was offered a position at roughly $32,000 per year. But after doing some research on his industry, ""I thought that it was extremely low because I knew that the average engineer was making $54,000,"" Robinson tells CNBC Make It. He asked the HR representative for the reasoning for the salary, mostly out of curiosity, and ended up successfully negotiating it upward. ""I sent an email back to the person saying, 'What's going on here? The average person [in this role] makes $54,000. They immediately responded and offered me $10,000 more,"" Robinson says. It wasn't the high end he was expecting, but it was Robinson's first job out of college and he now had room to grow into a higher earning potential. Plus, it was a meaningful bump from the original offer.

Just one email led to $10,000 more. Jamal Robinson

""That lesson always stuck with me — that it's extremely important to negotiate your salary,"" Robinson says. ""Just one email led to $10,000 more. And throughout most of my career, I have always aggressively negotiated."" Robinson also asks his peers what they're making and what people above him say is the growth potential for a certain path. ""Sometimes I've just flat out asked 'Hey, how much are you making?' So that way I can make sure that I was fairly compensated."" As he grew in his tech career and worked alongside high earners, ""I would just always ask [financial] questions, and be really deliberate and take advantage of the opportunity of the minds that I had around me that had accomplished more and had been older,"" Robinson says.

Where we stand on Bristol Myers",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/dont-overlook-the-impact-of-pharma-tariffs-says-an-analyst-where-we-stand-on-bristol-myers.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Investors might be underestimating the impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical products, according to one Wall Street firm. That could have negative implications for companies such as Bristol Myers Squibb , though overall market sentiment has been keeping the Club stock afloat. The news In a note to clients Sunday, analysts at Leerink Partners said President Donald Trump's potential pharmaceutical tariffs may have more negative impacts than investors realize — depending on how, exactly, the administration's import duties are structured. The global supply chain for pharmaceuticals and some of the accounting practices associated with it are complex. In any case, analysts said sustained tariffs will raise drug costs for American consumers because even if companies can relocate manufacturing to the U.S., it will take years to execute and ultimately costs more than manufacturing out of the country. ""Although corporations can make adjustments to mitigate the negative impact of tariffs, it could take some time given the complexities of global tax strategies and supply chains and uncertainty related to the durability of tariffs (since President Trump can change his mind),"" wrote the analysts, who have a buy-equivalent outperform rating on Bristol Myers stock. Get Your Ticket for the Annual Meeting! Secure your ticket today for the CNBC Investing Club's upcoming 3rd Annual Meeting on May 2nd in Orlando, Florida! Big Picture Leerink's warning comes a few days before Trump is set to announce a batch of ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Wednesday. Exact details aren't yet known, but Trump said last week that he'll be announcing tariffs on imported drugs at some point "" because we have to have pharmaceuticals."" Bristol Myers' investor relations team responded to Leerink when the analysts asked about the company's tariff risk. According to Leerink, the company said in part: ""We have not commented on our specific exposure to the broad topic of tariffs, as this is a very fluid situation."" Bristol Myers told the analysts that its supply chain is not ""overly reliant on any single country,"" and that it has a broad global manufacturing footprint. In general, U.S. biopharma companies are more concerned about possible tariffs on the European Union and Ireland than the current Trump-imposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, according to Leerink, which reached out to 21 companies and summarized their responses. Ireland is a big hub for the pharmaceutical industry, something that Trump mentioned in recent weeks. Bristol Myers and fellow Club name Eli Lilly , for that matter, both have manufacturing presences in Ireland and other European countries, analysts at Jeffries pointed out in a separate note. Jefferies analysts wrote that Trump has made it clear that he wants biopharma companies ""with foreign manufacturing and tax shields outside the US to bring operations"" back stateside. Bottom Line Despite the looming uncertainties around the biopharma sector, the Club is still bullish on Bristol Myers Squibb. We're very optimistic about Bristol's new schizophrenia drug Cobenfy in the coming years. Plus, the stock has a cheap price-to-earnings multiple and pays a solid dividend, said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. However, he cautions that we would not buy in at current trading levels, which is in the $60's. ""There is a market rotation bidding up defensive stocks like Bristol Myers as they seek to hide out the market selloff,"" Marks said. He was referencing that Bristol Myers is up more than 2.5% in the month of March, compared with a nearly 6% slide in the S & P 500. We'd prefer to add to our position when prices pull back.

Plus, positive news for DuPont",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/signs-of-a-capital-one-discover-deal-dupont-shops-two-brands-.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market update: Stocks made a significant comeback from their early session lows. What's notable is that the S & P 500 began its rebound right after it broke below the March 13 low of 5504.65. This retest comes just two days before the Trump Administration is expected to impose reciprocal tariffs targeting ""all countries."" Dividend increases: To no surprise, TJX Companies formally announced a 13% increase to its quarterly dividend. The company first announced the move last month when it reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. The higher payout pushes the dividend yield to about 1.4%, so TJX is hardly what we would describe as a dividend income stock. But safe, higher-yielding dividend stocks could come back in focus if the 10-year Treasury yield keeps falling. Only two stocks in the portfolio currently have a dividend yield north of 3%: Bristol Myers Squibb and Coterra Energy . Both stocks are outperforming the broader market Monday. Signs of a deal: If you want to gauge the market's sentiment on a merger closing, a simple way is to compare the stock price of the acquired company with the terms of the deal. Capital One is acquiring Discover in an all-stock transaction where one share of DFS gets you 1.0192 shares of COF. In theory, if the deal were to be completed at the close of business Monday, each share of Discover would be worth about $181.18, or 1.0192 times Capital One's stock price of about $177.89 based on current prices. The reason why Discover doesn't trade at the deal terms — the stock is currently $171 — is that the market is less positive the deal will go through. If the discount Discover trades at to the deal terms narrows, the market is giving the deal a higher probability of it closing. If the discount widens, there's a lower probability it closes. We bring all this up because the top-performing stock in the S & P 500 on Monday is Discover Financial Services. The stock is rallying and the merger discount is narrowing after a publication called The Capitol Forum reported late Friday that the Department of Justice may not bring a case against Capital One over its subprime sector and is refocusing its review to how it could impact consumers with no credit history. The story is significant because two weeks ago Capital One shares sold off to about $165 after the same publication reported that the DOJ may challenge the deal. Analysts were quick to come to Capital One's defense , noting that the deal would still be accretive if Discover's subprime portfolio was sold. As a reminder, the deal still needs approval by the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We are also monitoring a lawsuit brought by The Trump Organization as a potential roadblock. Other deals in the works : DuPont is considering the sale of two brands in its safety portfolio, according to Bloomberg . Kevlar and Nomex are reportedly for sale and could be worth around $2 billion in a deal. We're not surprised to see DuPont back in the headlines exploring divestitures — Chairman Ed Breen is known for dealmaking. But what makes this story interesting is that it comes more than two months after the company decided to change its three-company breakout strategy into two by ending plans to separate its water business. One possible reason why DuPont decided to keep the water business was to boost the investment case for New Dupont, which will have exposure to businesses in safety, shelter, and other industrial solutions like health care. As a reminder, the electronics spin-off is expected to be completed on November 1. DuPont shedding its Kevlar and Normex could be a very positive development. If the businesses are sold at a good price, DuPont can take the cash proceeds and buy businesses in secular growing industries like water and health care. By reshaping its portfolio, the New DuPont could fetch a higher multiple in the market, helping the stock narrow its discount to its sum of the parts. Up next: It's a quiet week for earnings. The only notable company reporting after the closing bell Monday is clothing and apparel company PVH Corp . There are no major reports before the opening bell Tuesday. On the data side there is the final read on March S & P Global US Manufacturing PMIs and February JOLTS job openings. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Yet these days she's co-heading her firm's high-yield fixed-income group — and trying to navigate a market that some say has gotten too expensive.

Glass, who was promoted to the position in February after 27 years in the business, at first seemed destined for a career in Japanese language and literature.

She received a bachelors of arts degree in the subject from the University of Pittsburgh and spent her junior year abroad in Japan. She then got a masters degree in Japanese literature from Cornell University in upstate New York. It wasn't until her Ph.D. program that she shifted gears — dropping out and getting an internship at Federated Hermes. It also brought her back home to Pittsburgh, where she grew up.

""I was hired at Federated in our muni bond group and money market group, which was the same group at the time, because they had a lot of exposure to Japanese banks, letters of credit,"" said Glass, who minored in math during college. ""It was a two-year program, where I could learn finance and they were interested in my language skills.""

She was hooked. Glass then went to the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, also in Pittsburgh. She earned her masters in accounting and finance and, in 1999, returned to Federated Hermes, joining their high-yield group as an analyst.

""The reason I ultimately really got interested in the analyst side of this business is because, yes, you need to do math, but you also need to be able to interact with people, read 10-Ks, read 10-Qs, understand strategy,"" Glass said. ""The gray parts of this is really where you're able to shine.""

Together, Glass and co-head Mark Durbiano lead a team of 16 in the high-yield fixed-income group. They manage about $13 billion in U.S. high-yield fixed income strategies as part of Federated's $98 billion in fixed-income assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. Glass is also a senior portfolio manager.

Finding the right stories

The investment process is reliant on research from its analysts, who have a bottom up approach, looking at company balance sheets rather than macroeconomics, she said. She describes the technique as more akin to small-cap equity analysis than investment-grade corporate analysis.

""High yield, it's stories. There's lots of reasons companies are in our market. Our job is to get to know the management teams, understand their priorities, [and] continue to monitor it for the life of the investment,"" she said.

""It's a pretty labor intensive focus to get names in and out of the portfolio,"" she added. ""We want to ride our winners, but we also want to get away from the losers.""

The approach, as seen in its Institutional High Yield Bond Fund (FIHAX), gets kudos from Morningstar. The mutual fund researcher said the Federated fund ""stands out thanks to its long-tenured management team and differentiated investment approach."" FIHAX has a 30-day SEC yield of 5.96% and a 0.75% net expense ratio.",cnbc

Volatility continued on Monday, with stocks falling ahead of the expected implementation of tariffs on Wednesday, in what President Donald Trump is calling ""liberation day."" At one point, the S & P 500 touched its lowest level since September and fell into correction territory. It is now off session lows. Meanwhile, the latest CNBC Rapid Update survey shows that economists expect just 0.3% growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter compared with the 2.3% reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. Dividends make up a larger portion of total returns during periods of slow growth, said Morgan Stanley strategist Todd Castagno. ""With low growth comes a declining interest rate environment, which makes durable, higher yielding dividends relatively more attractive as cash and fixed income become less lucrative,"" he wrote in a March 6 note. ""A steady income stream from dividends may also help damper volatility and provide a little hedge against inflation."" One of Morgan Stanley's dividend ideas is focusing on companies that have increased their dividends by at least 15% quarter over quarter in recent months. Castagno focused on those in the Russell 1000 . ""Over the 6 months following a change in dividend per share, we found that companies that announced an increase saw their stock prices outperform by an average of +3.1%,"" he said. ""Larger increases tended to lead to greater outperformance."" Here are some of the dividend stocks that made the cut. Royal Caribbean , which pays a dividend yield just shy of 1%, raised its payout quarter over quarter by 38%, Castagno said. The cruise operator has an average analyst rating of overweight and nearly 40% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet. On Monday, Jefferies initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating, noting that Royal Caribbean was ""priced to perfection."" RCL YTD mountain Royal Caribbean The cruise operator has come in the crosshairs of the Trump administration over taxes. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the cruise companies are not paying their fair share and vowed that would end. Still, Royal Caribbean has been enjoying strong pricing and booking momentum. CEO Jason Liberty recently told CNBC's Jim Cramer he is not concerned about Lutnick's comments because the company already pays a lot in taxes. He also said tariffs will not be a major challenge because the cruise line mostly buys products from the U.S. Liberty also pointed out that cruising is still cheaper than land-based vacations . ""[Consumers are] still getting a lot of value out of that vacation experience, and our recent surveys of our guests show that, actually, their propensity to cruise is at all-time highs, and their desire to go on vacation is 50% higher than it has been in the past,"" he said in an interview with ""Mad Money."" Shares are down nearly 12% year to date. T-Mobile , on the other hand, is up about 20% so far this year. It has a 1.33% dividend yield and has increased its payout by about 35% quarter over quarter. TMUS YTD mountain T-Mobile The wireless carrier has an overage analyst rating of overweight but just about 0.5% upside to the average price target, per FactSet. In January, T-Mobile posted an earnings and revenue beat for its fourth quarter. The company also gave full-year guidance that topped expectations. Investors in Southern Copper are earning a 2.1% dividend yield. The company raised its dividend quarter over quarter by 17.3%, Castagno pointed out. The stock has an average analyst rating of hold and nearly 3% upside to the average price target, per FactSet. One firm bullish is UBS, which upgraded Southern Copper to buy from neutral earlier this month, citing an attractive risk/reward. SCCO YTD mountain Southern Copper Shares have risen more than 3% year to date. Lastly, Lam Research has increased its dividend quarter over quarter by 15%, Castagno said. It currently pays a 1.27% dividend yield. The stock has an average analyst rating of overweight and 36% upside to the average price target, FactSet data show. Shares are down about 1% so far this year. — CNBC's Julie Coleman contributed reporting. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

https://cnbc.com,BlackRock CEO Larry Fink sees a $68 trillion market by 2040 in a key new area for the firm,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/blackrock-larry-fink-sees-infrastructure-investments-of-68-trillion-by-2040.html,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Monday sent a message loud and clear to investors: The firm isn't the traditional asset manager it once was. In his 2025 letter to shareholders, the BlackRock co-founder detailed the company's transformation, which is focused on expanding into fast-growing markets such as infrastructure and private credit. The news Fink touted infrastructure investing — which includes the buildout of large-scale projects in transportation, digital infrastructure, and energy — as ""an opportunity so vast it's almost hard to grasp."" By 2040, he forecasted that the global demand for new infrastructure investments would total $68 trillion. ""To put that price tag in perspective, it's roughly the equivalent of building the entire Interstate Highway System and the Transcontinental Railroad, start to finish, every six weeks — for the next 15 years,"" he added. In his widely-read letter to investors, Fink also pointed to BlackRock's recent $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the world's largest independent infrastructure fund manager, as a tailwind for future revenue growth. The deal gives BlackRock clients exposure to the multi-trillion infrastructure boom because GIP owns London's Gatwick Airport, key energy pipelines, and more than 40 global data centers. As for private credit, Fink praised BlackRock's decision to buy HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. The deal, expected to close sometime in 2025, will add $148 billion in assets to BlackRock's existing $89 billion private debt platform. Clients continue to increase their allocations to private markets as a ""source of diversification and uncorrelated alpha generation potential,"" Fink said. He pointed to BlackRock's private markets net inflows of $9 billion, citing ""strong demand"" for infrastructure and private credit strategies. ""Client feedback surrounding the recent and planned acquisitions of GIP and HPS has exceeded even our own high expectations, and we expect these to drive significant future net inflows and revenue growth in 2025 and beyond,"" Fink added. He continued, ""BlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we've been — first and foremost — a traditional asset manager. That's who we were at the start of 2024. But it's not who we are anymore."" BLK YTD mountain BlackRock (BLK) year-to-date Big picture Since the start of 2024, portfolio name BlackRock has been on a dealmaking spree . In addition to the $24.5 billion spent on the GIP and HPS deals, the asset manager also recently purchased alternative data provider Preqin for $3.3 billion in October, which should bolster BlackRock's Aladdin portfolio management platform. Most recently, a BlackRock-led group of investors also announced plans to buy port operations near the Panama Canal in a deal worth nearly $23 billion from Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. That deal is now said to be delayed amid growing concerns from China's antitrust regulator, Reuters reported Saturday. It looks like this one is getting bogged down in the politics of the strained U.S.-China relationship. President Donald Trump has said he wants the U.S. to take back control of the Panama Canal. Additionally, the annual investor letter comes during a rocky time for financial stocks in 2025. Shares of BlackRock, down roughly 1.3% on Monday, have shed more than 9% year to date. Fellow Club financial holding Goldman Sachs , which also has a strong foothold in private credit, has tumbled 5.5% year to date. Financials have taken a hit as recession concerns mount on the back of Trump's tariffs, which are set to come to a head Wednesday, with the planned introduction of reciprocal levies on U.S. trading partners. Bottom line It was reassuring to see Fink hold his commitment to expansion into fast-growing markets. We think the recent acquisitions in infrastructure and private credit give BlackRock other ways to satisfy clients' ever-changing needs, while also raking in more and more assets. We were thrilled to see BlackRock reach $11.6 trillion of assets under management last quarter, the highest level in its history. ""These acquisitions will help BlackRock accumulate more assets,"" Jeff Marks, the Investing Club's director of portfolio analysis, said last month . ""The deals should strengthen BlackRock's earnings power and could help the stock re-rate to a higher price to earnings multiple."" The push into different segments also helps offset any weakness that the iShares operator might experience with asset management rivals like Vanguard announcing broad fee cuts for many of its mutual funds earlier this year. BlackRock CFO Martin Small has said that fee reductions won't have a material impact on BlackRock's financials. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BLK, GS.

https://ft.com,CoreWeave’s IPO tested the waters — and missed the mark,https://ft.com/content/519006a9-82c6-4939-afa1-58921a399105,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:30:15 GMT","I have a confession to make. Before I send anything off for publication, I usually run it past someone in my trusted circle, such as a family member, friend, or former colleague. Thousands of people will parse my words, and so I like to test the waters before subjecting myself to the unsparing scrutiny of the FT Alphaville editors or readership.

IPOs go through a similar process. In the US, companies looking to go public can gauge institutional investor interest before formally launching an offering. This “testing the waters” (TTW) process is designed to give investors time to familiarise themselves with the company and provide feedback to the management and underwriters.

TTW was introduced in the US by the JOBS Act of 2012, permitting “emerging growth companies” to privately engage with qualified institutional buyers before or after filing a registration statement. In 2019, the SEC extended this flexibility to all issuers. In theory, TTW reduce the risk of the kind of faceplant that happens when a company and its underwriters market an IPO with an unrealistically high price range or overambitious size.

But theory and practice often part ways. The initial public offering of AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave, initially targeting a $2.7bn raise at $47-55 per share, was slashed to $1.5bn at $40 per share. Even then, the deal barely limped across the finish line, thanks to a last-minute $250mn “anchor” order from Nvidia. The offering reportedly ended up with just three investors holding 50 per cent of the stock, and it seems to have required some stabilisation from lead bank Morgan Stanley to avoid a first-day drop. Hardly a textbook success.

CoreWeave isn’t an isolated case. Earlier this year, the IPO of LNG exporter Venture Global was similarly downsized and downpriced, only for the shares to plunge in the after-market. If the TTW process is supposed to prevent such misfires, what’s going wrong?

It’s not as if investors were hard to reach. CoreWeave, with its AI narrative and blue-chip backers, was a high-profile float. Every institutional investor would have wanted a meeting. Nor were the company’s red flags hidden. Investors on the TTW circuit presumably knew all about the massive debt pile, cash burn, extreme customer concentration, and eyebrow-raising ebitda adjustments.

The original price range and deal size now seem like wildly wishful thinking. While market conditions had softened, the magnitude of the “miss” points to deeper failures. Either investor feedback was a lot weaker than bankers initially led management to believe, or management was unwilling to accept reality — or, more likely, both. Eager to win the mandate, investment banks may have pitched an overly aggressive valuation and then struggled to dial it back once investor feedback came in far lower. And once committed to an optimistic price range, management may have refused to adjust expectations, holding the banks to their own rosy pitch numbers.

It feels like a classic case of “pitch now, adjust never” — everyone gets stuck defending numbers that were never realistic to begin with. As a result, the IPO lacked momentum from the start.

The messaging around order-book coverage only made matters worse. Syndicate banks claimed the IPO was fully subscribed on day one, citing “early mutual fund support and one-on conversions,” and later reported that the book was several times covered. But investors saw through the spin, recognising that much of the demand likely came from hedge funds inflating their orders — standard practice to secure a better allocation if the deal gains traction. Most fund managers know better than to put much stock (pun intended) in such coverage claims. After all, SailPoint’s IPO was supposedly 20 times covered, and yet it still dropped in the after-market.

Another issue involved the Nvidia $250mn anchor order. Typically, anchor investors publicly commit early to signal confidence. Nvidia’s last-minute move suggested an emergency patch rather than a strategic endorsement. Given Nvidia’s multiple roles with CoreWeave — shareholder, supplier, customer — its involvement was always going to be viewed as complicated. The belated timing only reinforced concerns.

With weak demand and a last-minute bailout, only a true believer would have asked for a sizeable allocation of stock, and so it’s no surprise that CoreWeave’s IPO ended up with a highly concentrated order book. According to Bloomberg, half of the shares were allocated to just three investors.

The tight distribution may have prevented aggressive day-one selling, but it stores up a new problem. A successful IPO benefits from a broad base of investors willing to trade the stock in the open market. Without marginal buyers, the stock struggles to find natural demand and tends to grind down over time. CoreWeave will need to outperform financial expectations or hope for a return of AI frenzy in order to attract new buyers.

And the company has its work cut out for it. Unfortunately, investor sentiment was overwhelmingly negative towards the IPO. A poll by RBC Capital Markets — who had no role in the float — found that the vast majority of investors saw no real competitive moat in CoreWeave’s business model. With hindsight, a lower range and smaller size might have created a better platform for CoreWeave’s debut as a public company.

CoreWeave’s IPO didn’t struggle because of bad luck. Every investor I speak with has huge appetite for new listings. The problems began with inflated expectations — likely fuelled by bankers eager to win the mandate and management reluctant to adjust. The TTW process failed to translate into realistic deal terms. Oversubscription claims rang hollow. The Nvidia infusion smacked of desperation. And the concentrated allocation leaves the stock vulnerable.

The broader lesson is that fund managers are wise to the old IPO playbook. Unless banks reform their modus operandi, CoreWeave and Venture Global won’t be outliers but harbingers of more high-profile misfires.

One final note: I didn’t show a draft of this piece to anyone before submitting it. If you think I’m off base, you’re proving my point about testing the waters.",ft
