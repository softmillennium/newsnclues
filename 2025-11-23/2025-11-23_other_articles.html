                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He shared that some people were saying Hurricane Melissa was caused by HAARP or other government technology. After a quick social media search, sadly I did see references to such foolishness. Thankfully, my algorithms must track different parts of the social media landscape because I had missed all of the commotion. Unfortunately, after high-impact hurricanes, HAARP conspiracy theorists always crawl out of social media holes, cracks and crevices. In May, I wrote an article debunking 6 top conspiracy theories about weather. That discussion was motivated by wacky things being said about causation of Texas Hill Country floods. About HAARP, I wrote, “Relatively speaking, the HAARP conspiracy theory might be feeling a little neglected these days. It's one that has been around for a while, but it has been in the shadows lately compared to the new batch out there.” I went on to say, “Like many of these conspiracy theories, HAARP is rooted in real science but has been distorted, conflated, and misrepresented.” University of Alaska's website is a good place to learn about HAARP. It stated, “The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP, is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere.” HAARP exists but has nothing to do with weather manipulation. It's stunning that my fingers even had to type those words, but it is 2025 fringe theories are increasingly discussed in mainstream outlets. Meteorologists like me knew Hurricane Melissa was going to be a problem for Jamaica. In fact, this week I wrote an artcle describing a record 252 miles per hour wind gust measured by one of the instruments dropped from the Hurricane Hunters. Hurricane Melissa was fueled by extremely warm ocean heat content. Sea surface temperatures were quite warm in the central Caribbean Sea for October, and atmospheric conditions were otherwise favorable for explosive intensification. That's meteorology, marine sciences and likely climate warming of ocean waters. If you want a human contribution, that's far more credible than HAARP. Time and time again, I have written about why people cling to conspiracy theories rather than reality or actual facts. After scouring scholarly studies and using my own common sense, here are six reasons people cling to stuff like “HAARP caused Hurricane Melissa” narratives:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A documentary, 'The Age of Disclosure', argues that alleged encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena have been processed within classified defence programmes rather than dismissed as fantasy. The documentary features testimony from former military and intelligence officials who say such incidents have been recorded, studied and filed under restricted national security systems. It also suggests that the handling of reports has limited what elected representatives and the public have been allowed to know. The film arrives amid increasing political interest in unexplained aerial sightings in the United States, where recent hearings and document releases have led to renewed scrutiny of defence secrecy. They argue that long-term classification has shaped public understanding of the subject while raising ongoing questions about oversight and policy accountability. One of the most prominent contributors is Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official previously associated with the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. He claims that certain programmes have been compartmentalised at levels that restrict all but a small number of authorised personnel from reviewing documents, data or technical findings. Stratton is presented as stating that he reviewed multiple reports involving unidentified craft and unexplained technologies. The film frames his testimony as indicative of structured internal documentation rather than isolated accounts or speculation. It suggests that several major powers, including the United States, Russia and China, have conducted efforts to collect information on unidentified materials and technology. These claims cannot be independently verified but form a central part of the film's argument. Another recurring theme concerns alleged proximity of unidentified objects to nuclear installations. Former military personnel describe incidents in which sightings were logged near missile silos and related infrastructure. Analysts interviewed in the documentary suggest that, if accurate, such reports could have implications for national defence policy and strategic planning, according to The Washington Post. All the JFK stuff was suppose to be released in 1992. While the film presents testimonies from senior former officials, scientific commentators and sceptics note that it does not provide independently verified physical evidence. Reviewers have observed that although the documentary includes contributors with knowledge of defence structures, much of its narrative relies on personal accounts rather than material accessible for public examination. Whether it leads to further parliamentary or governmental action remains uncertain, but it reflects a continuing public debate about how much information has been classified over decades and how much may eventually be released.</p>

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. "It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have." Farah spoke to 34 U.S. government insiders, including those from the military and intelligence community officials, about an "80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin,” according to the film's description. Sources, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, discuss the government's work with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs — the formal term for UFOs. Since wrapping up the documentary, Farah said he's learned from "people who are in my film and sources outside of my film" that Trump "has become aware of the base facts and has his team all over trying to learn everything that he needs to know so we can decide a course of action,” he told the outlet. "I know the movie's on his radar a hundred percent, and look, President Trump said on the campaign trail that he intended to declassify what the government knows about this topic,” he said. In July 2024, Trump told influencer Logan Paul that he wasn't a “believer.” He added: “Probably I can't say I am. Months later, in September 2024, when podcaster Lex Fridman asked the president whether he would push to release more footage of UAPs, Trump replied: "I'll do that. The following month, Trump discussed the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth with Joe Rogan, saying the subject has “never been my thing.” When Rogan asked what he thought about the existence of alien life, Trump said: “There's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.” Congress has also held multiple meetings on UAPs. “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety,” she said. Paulina Luna joins other members of Congress who have called to “pull back the curtain” on the government's UAP research. Farah told Entertainment Weekly that he hopes the film's release will lead the government to make public as much as it can regarding UAPs and non-human intelligent life. "For too long, the public has blatantly been lied to, kept in the dark, and misled with a really sophisticated disinformation campaign,” he said. “And I think we're now at a tipping point where not only does the public deserve to know the truth, but it's really essential because the stakes have never been higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When physical sensations and thoughts seem so real that they appear to foresee disaster, you may be engaging in a form of covert avoidance behavior Curiously, this ability to predict the future often manifests itself when one receives bad news and exclaims: “I knew it.” Although it can be stimulating to believe you have magic powers a là Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock in Practical Magic, chances are that you can't predict the future. A case of anticipatory anxiety is much more likely. Meaning — in the words of Silvia Vidal, a psychologist who specializes in anxiety and trauma and who is the author of the Spanish-language book Abraza tus miedos (in English, Embrace your fears) — excessive worry and malaise felt in the anticipation of a potential future event that can be perceived as threatening. “The function of anticipatory anxiety is to prepare us for everything terrible that can occur. The thing is, when our mind imagines everything horrible that could take place — even if there's a low probability of it — it goes from being an adaptive resource to something extremely limiting and painful.” “Every time something unexpected happens, our body can perceive uncertainty as danger, because we understand that if it happens once, it can happen again. Dealing with this insecurity requires a great deal of tolerance for discomfort,” says Vidal. Perhaps that is why, in times of uncertainty, people tend to seek answers and self-knowledge by any means possible, including esotericism. Today, it is common to hear someone say, “I'm going to manifest it” in an attempt to attract a desired reality, or “I'm going to light a candle for you” as an act of generosity that replaces the classic “I wish you luck.” If someone gets back together with their ex, it is automatically assumed that they may have decided to give it a second chance because Mercury is in retrograde. Years ago, people at most knew their zodiac sun sign, but today it is common to be familiar with one's entire chart — at the very least, your ascendent and moon sign. Having your cards read was a practice once seen as extravagant and limited to very specific circles, whereas today, it is common to see groups of friends discussing the meaning of the major and minor arcana, the cards turned face up on a table full of empty beer glasses. There's another important issue to consider here, which is that when you suffer from anxiety, physical sensations and thoughts seems so real that that it can truly feel like disasters are right around the corner. “You may feel that the strength of what you are thinking and feeling is precisely the sign that it is going to happen in real life. Anticipatory anxiety can be summed up as fear of suffering. It clumsily tries to prepare us for the worst with the false sense that if misfortune strikes, a foreseen blow will not hurt as much. Instead of exposing ourselves to the event or uncertainty, we start planning or worrying in an attempt to prevent future discomfort. Paradoxically, that anticipation becomes the main source of present discomfort,” explains Llamas. To avoid such suffering, Llamas advises breaking this pattern of false control and reducing our approval-seeking or sign-seeking behaviors. In addition, she advocates for the usefulness of gradually exposing oneself to uncertainty to see how nothing catastrophic happens, or focusing not so much on what one thinks, but why. After all, no matter how hard we try to predict the future and dodge its low blows, reality always unfolds with unexpected nuance. After a scandal that provokes a complete change in Julie's life and decisions, she arrives at the conclusion that, “I always worried something would go wrong, but the things that went wrong were never what I worried about.” As such, it makes sense to put away the crystal ball and avoid dwelling on everything that could ultimately go wrong while ignoring all the times that your worst-case-scenario predictions failed and things didn't go so bad after all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every November, an old film clip resurfaces on television screens and social feeds: a smiling President John F. Kennedy riding through downtown Dallas, his motorcade gliding past crowds who had waited hours just to catch a glimpse of him. Sunlight flashes off the polished cars, Jackie Kennedy sits beside him in her now-iconic pink suit, and for a moment the scene looks almost cinematic. Then, without warning, the footage cuts to chaos. The memories of November 22, 1963, have never really faded. Even sixty-plus years later, the assassination of John F. Kennedy remains one of the defining moments of American life — a hinge in history where the country felt itself shift in real time. For younger generations, the story has become a haunting mix of archival video, photographs, controversies, and unanswered questions. Each anniversary invites reflection — not just on the tragedy itself, but on the America that existed before those shots rang out in Dealey Plaza, and the one that emerged in their aftermath. The story has been told endlessly, and yet, somehow, it never stops feeling raw. This is a look back — not in the overly sanitized language of textbooks, but in a more grounded, human way. Because on that day in 1963, the country didn't just lose its president. It lost a sense of innocence, a feeling that the world was understandable and the future predictable. And in many ways, the modern American era began with the sound of gunfire in Dallas. To understand why Kennedy's assassination still resonates, you have to picture the nation he was leading. It was a country full of contradictions. The post-war optimism of the 1950s hadn't fully worn off; people still believed in their institutions, still had faith that progress was steady and inevitable. But there were cracks everywhere if you looked closely. The civil rights movement was gaining momentum, and the images coming out of Birmingham, Little Rock, and Jackson were impossible to ignore. Cold War tensions were a constant undercurrent — duck-and-cover drills in schools, the Cuban Missile Crisis barely a year behind the nation, and the looming fear that nuclear war could erupt at any moment. He was only 46 years old — the youngest elected president — with a glamorous family that brought a sense of style and vitality to the White House. When he traveled to Texas that week, it was part political outreach, part goodwill tour, part effort to ease tensions within the fractured Texas Democratic Party. But to the public, it felt almost like a celebration. The president's approval ratings were strong, and crowds across San Antonio, Houston, and Fort Worth had been enormous. Dallas was expected to be just as enthusiastic. Children perched on their parents' shoulders, office workers spilled out onto sidewalks, and reporters noted how surprisingly warm the reception felt. The motorcade route through downtown Dallas was designed to showcase the president to as many people as possible. It moved slowly, only about 10 to 12 miles per hour, making it easy for onlookers to take photos or wave. As the cars turned onto Elm Street and approached the Texas School Book Depository, everything still felt perfectly normal. People close to the scene later described the sound as sharp cracks, like firecrackers or motorcycle backfires. Those images — Kennedy collapsing, Jackie reaching out across the back of the car, Hill jumping aboard — have been replayed thousands of times. Inside Parkland Memorial Hospital, doctors tried desperately to revive the president, but it was immediately clear he wouldn't survive. At 1:00 p.m. Central time, Kennedy was pronounced dead. What followed wasn't just shock — it was an emotional rupture, a sense that something impossible had happened on an ordinary Friday afternoon. The hours immediately following Kennedy's death were frantic and surreal. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in aboard Air Force One. Jackie Kennedy, her suit still stained with blood, stood beside him. Back in Dallas, police scrambled to find the shooter, unaware that the story would quickly outgrow the facts, spawning theories that would last for generations. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested that afternoon. He was a former Marine, defector to the Soviet Union, factory worker, political agitator — a man whose life seemed to ricochet between ideologies and frustrations. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot Oswald on live television. With that single moment, the possibility of answers was sealed away forever. America was left to grapple with fragments, contradictions, and a mountain of unresolved questions. And on the streets, everything simply stopped. People pulled over their cars and cried. The nation entered a kind of suspended disbelief. Kennedy had represented youth, momentum, and maybe even the idea of a country marching toward something better. His death felt like an abrupt turn — a reminder that the future wasn't guaranteed, and the forces shaping the world were darker and more unpredictable than anyone had wanted to admit. Kennedy's funeral on November 25 became one of the most-watched events in television history. Millions watched as John F. Kennedy Jr., only three years old, stepped forward and saluted his father's casket. It remains one of the most heartbreaking images ever broadcast. Heads of state from around the world attended. European leaders saw Kennedy as a symbol of American promise; leaders in Asia and Africa saw him as a figure who championed global development and diplomacy. Even in the Soviet Union, where Nikita Khrushchev had sparred fiercely with JFK during the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was a genuine sense of loss. The funeral wasn't just a goodbye. It was a moment that crystallized the magnitude of what had happened. An era had ended abruptly, violently, and without explanation. Kennedy's death did more than break hearts. It altered the course of American history in ways that are still felt today. Lyndon Johnson would go on to pass the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, and a sweeping set of domestic reforms — initiatives JFK had supported but likely wouldn't have passed as rapidly. The assassination also reshaped how Americans viewed power. After Dallas, political violence became part of the national consciousness. Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and others would be killed in the years that followed. Each death felt compounded by the one that came before. Many historians argue that the 1960s effectively split in half on November 22, 1963. The fracture line runs right through Dealey Plaza. You can't talk about the JFK assassination without acknowledging the enormous gravitational pull of conspiracy theories. They didn't start as fringe ideas. People simply couldn't accept that a single, disaffected man with a $21 rifle could change the course of the world. The Warren Commission tried to provide clarity, but its findings only added fuel to the fire. Some theories were rooted in distrust of the government. But the deeper reason is psychological: Americans don't like the idea that history can turn on something meaningless. It's both sobering and eerie to stand in that space, to realize how ordinary the view looks despite the extraordinary event that unfolded there. Dallas itself has spent decades wrestling with the legacy. In the 1960s, it was widely blamed as a “city of hate,” a place accused of fostering the kind of political extremism that could inspire violence. Today the city embraces history in a more measured way — respectful, reflective, aware that what happened there can't simply be erased. And each anniversary brings visitors, scholars, historians, and everyday Americans who still feel drawn to the place where the trajectory of modern democracy took a sudden turn. A generation has grown up without any living memory of John F. Kennedy, and yet the assassination remains a cornerstone of American storytelling. It appears in documentaries, books, movies, podcasts, political arguments, and cultural references. Part of it is the drama — a young president struck down at the height of his popularity. But part of it is something deeper. In its own way, it marked the end of post-war idealism and the beginning of the more skeptical, more fractured political culture we know today. It also symbolizes a moment when the country's sense of unity — even if imperfect — was suddenly, violently broken. People from all political backgrounds grieved together. If you talk to people who lived through 1963, their memories are vivid in a way younger generations often find surprising. For many, the day still feels personal. It was the first time the modern United States collectively faced mortality in such a visceral way. For younger people, the anniversary is more reflective — a moment to look back at a period that feels both distant and strangely familiar. The emotions that follow national tragedy feel eerily timeless. On each anniversary, you'll find a mix of reactions: historians analyzing facts, families sharing memories, conspiracy theorists reviving debates, students learning the story for the first time. But at the core, there's still a simple truth: the assassination shaped America's identity in ways we're still trying to understand. If anything, the distance makes it easier to see its impact. Yet anniversaries aren't only about mourning. They're about revisiting the lessons that are easy to forget. Kennedy's time in office, brief as it was, symbolized an era of ambition and idealism. His call to civic engagement, his push for public service, his vision of a more active role in global leadership — these ideas still shape political thought today. More than six decades later, Dealey Plaza remains a quiet place. There's nothing outwardly dramatic about the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets. And yet, when the anniversary comes each year, you can almost feel the weight of history settle over it. America didn't just lose a president. It lost a part of itself — a part it's been trying to recover ever since. Alaska born and bred, Washington DC is my home.

Central to the narrative is the figure of Hermann Göring, whose defiance, manipulation, and ultimate downfall are portrayed with chilling realism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new documentary has claimed that former US president George HW Bush (president from 1989 to 1993) was informed about an alien encounter at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964, the New York Post reported. No physical evidence was presented to support the claim. Davis served as a scientific advisor for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) created by Congress in 2007 by the late Sen Harry Reid (D-NV).

"One of them landed on the tarmac and a non-human entity deboarded the craft that landed and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," said Davis as quoted in the report.

Gary Nolan, an immunologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University, described injuries sustained by military personnel who claimed to have come into contact with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), including "horrific" burns and internal scarring.
