A new feature on Elon Musk's X is exposing the truth behind social media accounts across the political spectrum, with account owners apparently misleading followers about where they are posting from. The new feature allows all X users to inspect where a given account is based, usually listing a country or region. Many popular accounts posing as American "patriots" or "constitutionalists" have been exposed as being run from foreign countries since the update rolled out on Friday. One account with the handle "@1776General_" boasts over 140,000 followers and has a user biography describing the owner as a "constitutionalist, patriot and ethnically American." The account for "1776General_" which appears to be posing as an American. Another account, "@AmericanVoice__" had over 200,000 followers before the update rolled out. X head of product Nikita Bier says the new feature should help X users sift out misinformation from their feeds. This is critical for staying informed about important issues happening in the world. Part of this is showing new information in accounts, including the country an account is located in, among other things," Bier wrote. The phenomenon is not limited to American politics, however. Many accounts claiming to have been reporting on alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza also appear to be misleading users. His account has over 197,000 followers, but X says the owner is actually posting from Poland. Dalloul has pushed back on claims that he is lying to his followers, however, posting a video on Saturday that appeared to show him on the ground in Gaza. Many users have argued about whether the video was digitally altered. Screenshots showing the discrepancy between Motasem A. Dalloul's account on X. Another Palestinian-related account, the Quds News Network or @QudsNen, describes itself as the "largest independent Palestinian youth news network" and has over 600,000 followers. The account lists its location as "Palestine," but X says the account is actually based out of Egypt – unlike other accounts that X does list as being based in "Palestine," such as American-Palestinian journalist Mariam Barghouti. A similar account under the name Times of Gaza/@Timesofgaza has nearly one million followers. It claims to provide the "latest news updates and top stories from occupied Palestine." X representatives have said its new feature could be partially spoofed by using a VPN to mask a user's true location. In such cases where a VPN was detected, X added a warning next to the listed location. Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Rubio was expected to join the talks together with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. A view of the US Permanent Mission, in Geneva, Switzerland, Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025. Ukrainian head of presidential administration Andriy Yermak, left, and US Secretary of state Marco Rubio, right, talk to the press as their consultations continue at the US Permanent Mission in Geneva, Switzerland, Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025. GENEVA (AP) — Top European and Ukrainian envoys conferred in Geneva on Sunday ahead of talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio over President Donald Trump's proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine. “We continue working together to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine.” Rubio was expected to join the talks together with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. Before the meeting, Trump on Sunday used a lengthy online post to blast Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance, while notably shying away from criticizing Russia. Trump also took a swipe at U.S. allies in Europe, writing, “UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA.” After Trump's post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was “grateful” for U.S.-led efforts on security and praised U.S. leader directly as talks continued. “The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,” Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. In an earlier post, Zelenskyy also said that there was an understanding the U.S. would take into account “a number of elements” in a peace deal that are important for Ukraine, but did not elaborate further. “There is now an understanding that the American proposals may take into account a number of elements based on the Ukrainian vision and are critically important for Ukraine's national interests.” Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council and a member of Ukraine's Geneva delegation, wrote that although the peace plan proposals were still be finalized, they included “many Ukrainian priorities.” Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs. The proposal, originating from negotiations between Washington and Moscow, acquiesces to many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory. The Ukrainian leader has vowed that his people“will always defend” their home. Speaking before Sunday's talks, Alice Rufo, France's minister delegate at the Defense Ministry, told broadcaster France Info that key points of discussion would include the plan's restrictions on the Ukrainian army, which she described as “a limitation on its sovereignty.” The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened,” Trump said. “One way or the other, we have to get it ended.” Trump didn't explain what he meant by the plan not being his final offer and the White House didn't respond to a request for clarification. A State Department spokesperson denied their account, calling it “blatantly false.” On Sunday, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said the peace plan appeared to be “almost a series of Russian talking points,” had made Europeans “feel like they've been totally left high and dry” and had led to “ferocious pushback.” “My hope is he'll come back and be a bit more reasonable,” Warner said. He said he would talk to the Russian leader about reviving a previous deal from July 2022 that allowed Ukraine to safely ship exports of grain via the Black Sea. Tomorrow I will be asking Putin to revisit the endeavor.” Erdogan's new diplomatic push comes just days after he met with Zelenskyy in Ankara.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione is escorted into Manhattan state court in New York, Sept. 16, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors said Friday that Luigi Mangione's death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded, urging a judge to reject a defense push to dismiss charges and rule out capital punishment over Attorney General Pam Bondi's public statements suggesting Mangione deserves execution. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan also asked U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to deny the defense's bid to suppress certain evidence collected during the arrest last year, including a 9 mm handgun, a notebook in which authorities say Mangione described his intent to “wack” an insurance executive and statements he made to police. “Pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect,” prosecutors wrote in a 121-page court filing, citing prior rulings from the Supreme Court and the 2nd U.S. As for the evidence, which Mangione's lawyers contend was collected without a warrant and without him being read his rights, prosecutors said police officers were justified in searching the suspect's backpack to make sure there were no dangerous items. His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody. Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. In September a judge threw out state terrorism charges against him but kept the rest of that case — including an intentional murder charge — in place. He is due back in court in the state case Dec. 1 as his lawyers seek to bar prosecutors from using much of the same evidence seized upon his arrest. Mangione's next court date in the federal case is Jan. 9. Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims. Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later while eating breakfast at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. The defense argued in a September court filing that Bondi's announcement — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later. Bondi's statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration's flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione's constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said. Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first term, has also offered opinions about Mangione despite court rules against any pretrial publicity that could interfere with the right to a fair trial. In their Friday filing, federal prosecutors countered that Bondi's remarks were irrelevant to the process because there's no evidence that grand jurors who voted to indict Mangione were influenced. “This argument, like others, rests on conjecture rather than evidence,” the prosecution team said. Nor has the defense cited any precedent “suggesting that public commentary renders a grand jury incapable of fulfilling its constitutional role,” they added.</p>

President and CEO of Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections Justin Riemer joined Fox News Digital to discuss redacted voter registration documents belonging to illegal alien and educator Ian Andre Roberts. A legal fight is brewing over a Maryland county board of elections' heavy redactions to the voter registration records of an illegal immigrant who served as superintendent of Iowa's largest school system until he was arrested by federal authorities this year, Fox News Digital has learned. "This was shocking," Justin Riemer, CEO and president of the conservative legal group Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections (RITE), told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview on Friday. "When I saw the news reporting, and they showed screenshots of the registration applications with all this information redacted, I was just shocked." Riemer was reacting to Prince George's County's Board of Elections' recent release of voter registration documents belonging to illegal alien Ian Andre Roberts, which included blacking out Roberts' sex, whether he checked the citizenship box, his date of birth and other information. Roberts, who is originally from Guyana and first entered the U.S. in 1994, was working as the superintendent of the Des Moines public school district when Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in September. Roberts was not legally permitted to work in the country after an employment authorization card expired in 2020, Fox News Digital previously reported. Former Des Moines superintendent Ian Andre Roberts, who was detained by ICE in September. The arrest of an illegal immigrant working in such a high-profile position shocked conservatives and others. It was soon discovered that he was listed as a registered Democratic voter in Maryland, where he previously lived, and that he had a conviction for reckless driving in 2012, the Department of Homeland Security reported in October. "I'm an election law expert, not an immigration expert, but it doesn't take one to see just how… broken the system has been," Riemer told Fox Digital. He has worked in multiple school districts where, if they were doing the proper citizenship and work authorization checks, this should have been caught. It's really just unbelievable how this guy has managed to jump around the country, working in school districts where he's around children." As concern mounted surrounding Roberts, the American Accountability Foundation filed a public records request with Prince George's County to obtain his voter registration application. The county's board of elections complied with the request, but redacted key information, sparking what could turn into a legal showdown. "The American Accountability Foundation called the county out on it and said, '… you're not allowed to redact this information,'" Riemer said, adding that it's understandable for the county to redact information such as an individual's Social Security number or driver's license number, but not a person's gender or whether they answered in the affirmative that they are a U.S. citizen. RITE published copies of the redacted documents, which show 18 black boxes blocking out information across just two pages' worth of documents. Riemer explained the request was made under the National Voter Registration Act – a federal law that simplified voter registration processes when an eligible individual renews their driver's license – which includes a provision allowing public access to such records. Riemer sent a letter to the Prince George's County Board of Elections on Tuesday demanding the county turn over the records to his clients with fewer redactions as allowed by law. Republicans say that illegal alien Ian Andre Roberts being registered to vote in Maryland raises serious concerns about the state's voting processes. "Please provide my clients with the records no later than Monday, December 1, 2025. If you do not remedy such violation within 90 days, my clients will sue you in Maryland federal district court and collect reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses and other costs," Riemer's letter to the county board of elections stated. "If they noticed that Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections was part of this effort to get this information, they should have, because we sued Maryland last year for violating the National Voter Registration Act for restricting public access to registration records just like they're doing here and won that lawsuit in March. Fox News Digital reached out to the Prince George's County Board of Elections for comment on the letter and redactions on Friday afternoon but did not immediately receive a reply. Roberts was criminally charged on Oct. 2 with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms, according to DHS. Riemer said that the case is one of many that show concern over non-citizens being on voter roles is not "political theater" as Democrats have claimed amid conservatives rallying around stronger voter integrity laws nationwide. Oregon, for example, reported registering a couple thousand non-citizens through their DMV," he said. Marshals' custody following his September arrest and is set to be prosecuted, DHS said in October. The federal agency has released the suspect's lengthy history of run-ins with the law that stretch back to 1996, when he was charged with criminal possession of narcotics with intent to sell in New York, a charge for third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle in Queens, New York, in 1998 that was later dropped and the 2012 conviction for reckless driving in Maryland. More recently, Roberts faced charges in 2020 for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and other weapons charges and a 2022 conviction for unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in Pennsylvania. He was found to be in possession of $3,000 in cash, a Glock 9mm pistol and a hunting knife at the time of his arrest. Roberts was criminally charged on Oct. 2 with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms, according to DHS. The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Roberts' license following his arrest and he is no longer permitted to serve as a superintendent in the state.

Do you think that President Trump is a fascist?” Welker asked. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.” Welker also asked about Mamdani accusing Trump of being a “threat to democracy” as many Democratic opponents had during Trump's campaign. I'm coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers.” “That's OK, you can just say it,” Trump said, patting Mamdani on the arm. “I want [Mamdani] to do a great job, and we'll help them do a great job,” Trump said Friday. “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him, a big help, because I want New York City to be great.”Mamdani won just over 50% of the vote in New York City, while his predecessor, Eric Adams, won 67% of the vote in 2021. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the city with 70% of the vote during last year's election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers critical of President Donald Trump's approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war said Saturday they spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio who told them that the peace plan Trump is pushing Kyiv to accept is a “wish list” of the Russians and not the actual proposal offering Washington's positions. A State Department spokesperson denied their account, calling it “blatantly false.” The widely leaked 28-point US-backed peace plan was, according to the White House, the result of a month of work between Rubio and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff along with input from what it said was both Ukrainians and Russians. The plan acquiesces to many Russian demands that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory. Trump says he wants Ukraine to accept the plan by late next week. “This administration was not responsible for this release in its current form,” said Republican Mike Rounds from South Dakota, speaking at a security conference in Canada. “They want to utilize it as a starting point.” Rubio, who serves as both national security adviser and secretary of state, was expected to attend a meeting in Geneva on Sunday to discuss Washington's proposal as part of a US delegation, according to a US official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the American participants before the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. “The peace proposal was authored by the US It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations,” Rubio posted on X. “It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine,” Rubio wrote. Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesperson, said the senators' account was “blatantly false.” A senior Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to detail internal discussions, noted Saturday night that the White House has consistently maintained that the plan was authored by the US but included input from Russians and Ukrainians. The senators earlier Saturday said the plan would only reward Moscow for its aggression and send a message to other leaders who have threatened their neighbors. There's no ethical, legal, moral, political justification for Russia claiming eastern Ukraine,” King said during a panel discussion at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Zelensky, in an address, did not reject the plan outright, but insisted on fair treatment while pledging to “work calmly” with Washington and other partners in what he called “truly one of the most difficult moments in our history.” A large number of US senators made the trip this year in part because of strained relations between Canada and the US Trump has alienated America's neighbor with his trade war and insistence that Canada should become the 51st US state. Many Canadians now refuse to travel to the US and border states like Shaheen's New Hampshire are seeing a dramatic drop in tourism.</p>

Keith Kellogg, the Trump special envoy for Ukraine, describes what's next in the effort to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine on 'My View with Lara Trump.' President Donald Trump's administration is rejecting claims that its most recent plan for a peace deal in Ukraine was really a Russian "wish list." Confusion arose regarding the deal after lawmakers on Capitol Hill claimed they were told by White House officials that the deal was a proposal from the Russian side. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since pushed back on that claim, however. "[Rubio] made it very clear to us that we are the recipients of a proposal that was delivered to one of our representatives," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said at a press conference. According to The Associated Press, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said that Rubio told him and his colleagues that it "was not the administration's plan" but a "wish list of the Russians." Rubio responded to this narrative with a post on social media, writing that the peace proposal "was authored by the U.S." Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended a peace proposal for Ukraine this weekend. "It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine," he added. Rounds released another statement through his press office after Rubio's response. "I appreciate Secretary Rubio briefing us earlier today on their efforts to bring about peace by relying on input from both Russia and Ukraine to arrive at a final deal," Rounds wrote. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. The White House is pushing back on claims that a recent peace proposal for Ukraine was a Russian "wish list." Rubio traveled to Geneva on Sunday to meet with Ukrainian officials alongside Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, where they are expected to hash out Kyiv's misgivings regarding the deal. Trump himself lashed out at Ukraine over the peace talks in a Sunday statement. "UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA," Trump wrote on Truth Social. While the current agreement has not been made public, a leaked draft has been reported to include terms that would halt the fighting in Ukraine while giving Russia concessions like control over Ukrainian territory that the Russian military does not yet control, as well as barring Ukraine from membership in NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not reject the plan outright in an address last week, but he insisted on fair treatment while pledging to "work calmly" with Washington and other partners in what he called "truly one of the most difficult moments in our history."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifty students who were abducted from a Catholic school in northern Nigeria on Friday have returned to their families after they managed to escape, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said on Sunday. Armed bandits kidnapped 303 children and 12 teachers from the St. Mary's Private Catholic school in the country's north-central Niger State on Friday, according to CAN. “The pupils escaped between Friday and Saturday and have reunited with their parents as they could not return to the school after they escaped,” spokesman for CAN's Niger State chapter chairman Most. Rev.Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, Daniel Atori, said in a statement. Atori said 253 children – including 250 students from the school and three children belonging to school staff members – and 12 teachers remain captive. “I feel great pain, especially for the many young men and women who have been abducted and for their anguished families,” he said. Friday's abduction is just the latest in a wave of attacks by armed groups that target vulnerable civilian populations and orchestrate mass abductions for ransom. Earlier this week, gunmen launched an attack on a church in neighboring Kwara State. Armed men also kidnapped 25 female students when they stormed a government girls' boarding school in northwestern Kebbi State. The school's vice principal was shot and killed during this attack. US President Donald Trump has frequently expressed outrage over disputed allegations of a “mass slaughter” of Christians by Islamist insurgents, even threatening military action to protect Christians. Experts and analysts say both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in Africa's most populous country — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth met with Nigeria's National Security Advisor Mallam Nuhu Ribadu on Thursday to discuss the violence in the West African nation. “Under [Trump's] leadership, [the Department of War] is working aggressively with Nigeria to end the persecution of Christians by jihadist terrorists,” Hegseth said on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Is TV getting worse, or are we just not paying attention? It's no secret that the way we consume media these days is different than it was 10 years ago. Who doesn't like to be on their phone while they're watching TV? Well, Hollywood has noticed your attention is split. And as a result, individuals like Kris Jenner and companies like Disney are investing in new forms of entertainment. Filmed quickly and with scrolling in mind, they are short episodes, sometimes as short as 45 seconds, intended to grab the viewer with over-the-top premises. The magazine n+1 reported earlier this year that Netflix executives are asking their screenwriters to “have this character announce what they're doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along” — in other words, dumb down the script so that inattentive viewers can still follow along. Today, Explained co-host Noel King brought that question to Puck News correspondent Julia Alexander. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. If you talk to creatives, the second screen — meaning, the phone that you're watching TikToks on while watching a movie on your big TV — is just a lack of attention that is being paid to the main movie or film on the television. But, if you talk to executives, the question of the second screen is one of: Does the adoration for TikTok, and Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts mean that people will spend less time with our streaming services that they'll cancel, and we have to fight back for those subscribers? Before the phone came around, people would do this with magazines, and they would do it with books, and they would do it with other things. We've just never had as many things competing for such tiny slices of the attention pie. There was reporting in n+1 saying that Netflix executives are telling writers to dumb down the writing in TV shows and movies. Do people who cover the industry, did they know that this was happening? I think it's important to clarify that no one, no executive is out [there] saying, “Dumb this down.” No executive is out in the town saying, “Hey, by the way, make shittier television that's really going to help us when we increase prices again,” right? What they're saying, if this is being said to people — and I have personally never heard it in my reporting — what they would be saying is, “We understand that our audience has less attention than they might have 10 years ago, and our audience has more opportunities to put that attention on another video format, whether they're watching Reels or TikTok. Why do you think the idea of dumbing TV writing down makes us angry? But, the quality of the film, such as Frankenstein, a beautiful Guillermo del Toro movie, has nothing to do with a Netflix executive coming out and saying, “You've got to dumb this down.” It has everything to do with the fact that they're responding to what people are saying with their actions. The Lindsay Lohan Christmas movies, for example, and all those other Netflix fare that we associate with a specific trope are heavily watched. One of the effects of what you're seeing play out is that we had a golden age of television about 15 years ago, a lot of the bigger movie stars, and the writers, and directors in film who didn't want to make Marvel movies and didn't want to make big sci-fi blockbusters moved to TV. We had a great moment of well-written, gorgeous television. Then, what happened was the competition for eyeballs on the TV screen started to really speed up, and you had YouTube come in, and you had Mr. Beast, and all of a sudden, people were watching them on their television screens, and that meant that they were watching less Netflix or less Hulu. So, all of the prestige TV that worked on cable 20 years ago stopped working as much today. So, you're getting a lot more unintentional slop, but it's not because they're trying to produce it, it's that they're trying to produce just more content than ever before. Could you envision a world where viewers say, “We don't want the slop, we want prestige,” or is that unlikely? I actually think that's exactly what's going to happen. The amount of generative AI content, even these micro-dramas a little bit, which, in part, are being made because of generative AI technologies that are allowing them to make things cheaper and faster, is going to increase the amount of content. And so, you might have an Apple TV plus or a Netflix in 20 years, 25 years, be $40, $50 a month, but you'll pay for it, because they will end up leaning into higher-quality programming and backing away from some of the slop as it takes over all of our other content viewing. There is a world where YouTube will eat everyone's lunch. But, it's never going to replace the need to watch a really good movie or a really good TV show. Now, I think the number of those titles will come down, and I think that's going to be really cataclysmic for people who work in this industry, because you'll have fewer jobs. I really do believe that there's a world for some of these streaming services — not all — some of these directors, and actors to continue to leave a really strong mark, but it's going to be a much smaller industry than it has been over the last hundred years. ﻿Do not bring your child to a child-free wedding.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOP leaders in Washington are ramping up pressure on Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt to drop out of the Texas Senate race, warning that his candidacy could cost their party tens of millions of dollars and even upend their midterm map. But a defiant Hunt told CNN in an interview that he is “absolutely” staying in the heated three-way race against long-time incumbent Sen. John Cornyn and firebrand Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, even as senior Republicans accuse him of being a “spoiler” in the race that is now all but certain to lead to a costly runoff. Hunt, a 44-year-old combat veteran and two-term House member, revealed that he planned to officially file for the race this week, setting aside weeks of GOP speculation about whether he would continue with his insurgent Senate campaign or opt to stay in his Houston-area seat instead. “If Senate leadership does not like me being in this race, you know what I say? “This is like a David and Goliath kind of story. I have a couple of smooth stones to throw at him, but guess what? “The people of Texas are looking for an alternative, and it's absolutely my job to give them one,” Hunt said. Like Paxton, Hunt is a MAGA loyalist and courting the endorsement of President Donald Trump, who has been lobbied hard by Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans to clear the field for Cornyn. But that would amount to a huge gamble for Trump. If no candidate wins an outright majority in the primary, then the top finishers would battle in another expensive clash two months later: A May 26 runoff election. Plus, there's real fear that the candidates would be badly battered through months of a grueling primary and runoff – and could give Democrats a shot to pull off an upset in Texas, something the party hasn't done in a statewide race since 1994. And Democrats are salivating at the prospect of facing Paxton, who has weathered scandals in the state including an impeachment effort just two years ago. “He can't win, so this could well be the end of his political career if he decides to make this race, and he may be thinking about that,” Cornyn told CNN, referring to Hunt's decision to run for his seat. The end of my political career – I'm still alive and well.” “The United States Senate is not a retirement community,” he said. Paxton — who remains in a virtual tie with Cornyn in a recent poll — has largely stayed on the sidelines while Hunt and Cornyn largely begin to pummel each other. And Hunt sidestepped criticisms of Paxton, who has made headlines over issues like a messy divorce and for reportedly claiming three houses as his primary mortgage. The stakes of the Senate battle are high, with GOP leaders planning to spend as much as it takes to back Cornyn through both a primary and a runoff, according to multiple people familiar with the internal discussions. Many Cornyn allies are furious at Hunt's refusal to bow out, arguing that money spent to boost Cornyn so far could be much better spent in battleground contests like North Carolina or Michigan in a midterm environment that's likely to favor Democrats. For Democrats to win the Senate, they'll need to pick up four seats, meaning they'll have to hold every one of their own seats while picking up at least two in red states – with one of them potentially Texas, where they have their own messy primary to navigate. The person added that Hunt has been told repeatedly, “including by very senior Republicans,” to bow out of the race because, they say, he has no path to victory. But Hunt says that communication has never come from inside Trump's orbit. Pressed on whether he has ever been discouraged from running by someone in the White House, Hunt said: “Nobody has told me a word.” Behind the scenes, Cornyn and top GOP Senate leaders have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to win over Trump and convince him to endorse as soon as possible. During his last conversation with Trump, Cornyn echoed what GOP leaders have also stressed to Trump: it could save a lot of money for other key races. “We'll spend a lot of money that could be spent more productively elsewhere,” Cornyn said, when asked about his message to the president. “If I'm at the top of the ticket in November, chances are that it will help down ballot races including these congressional seats that are now in litigation. He also recently made a huge break in his own long-time stance on eliminating the filibuster to align more closely with Trump's views. Thune and the Senate campaign chief, Sen. Tim Scott, have also repeatedly made Cornyn's case to Trump, according to people familiar with the discussions. And Thune has personally helped with Cornyn's fundraising operation, traveling to Texas last week and phoning donors to secure more support, another person said. Multiple people close to Paxton, however, believe he is in the strongest position for Trump's endorsement, if, or when, the president decides to choose a side. But him staying out of the race is good for us too. And it's pretty fatal for Cornyn,” one person close to Paxton told CNN. Allies of both Hunt and Paxton told CNN that their campaigns are keeping in close touch with the White House. This summer, Paxton even flew to Scotland for a brief interaction with Trump at his new golf course, as CNN previously reported. “I just confirmed what he already knew, which is that we were now essentially in a tie with Paxton. “Donald John Trump's endorsement is absolutely incredible in any Republican primary in this great nation, but I'm sorry you cannot revive that dead campaign,” Hunt said of Cornyn's bid. “Not even Donald Trump can do that, in my humble opinion. So that's why I got in this race, to give him an option.” Hunt and Paxton have both sharply criticized Cornyn for his complicated relationship with Trump. The GOP incumbent has rarely broken with Trump on a key vote and — as the former Senate GOP whip — helped pass Trump's marquee tax cuts bill during his first term. The senior Texas senator patched up ties with Trump during his 2024 reelection bid. But many hard-right Republicans took notice when Cornyn cut deals with then-President Joe Biden over a pricey bill designed to shore up the US chip-making industry over foreign rivals, as well as a gun safety bill that Cornyn personally shepherded through Congress after a deadly elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022. Cornyn, meanwhile, has attacked Hunt on another matter: Missing votes in Congress altogether, accusing him of missing more than a quarter of House votes just this year. Asked about his missed votes this year, Hunt pushed back. I mean, what do I get a certificate for showing up to work and voting on naming another post office after Sacagawea?” a fiery Hunt said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America hasn't had enough air traffic controllers for more than a decade – and the recent government shutdown might have made it even worse. The stress of not being paid for those 44 days, on top of already harsh working conditions, spurred many to leave the workforce, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing controllers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said it also prompted many to retire early. Replacing them could take years – and the shutdown underscored the stakes when the country lacks controllers: canceled flights, delays and an even more miserable travel experience overall. “Just even losing one is too many, but I can't even fathom how many were lost during the time,” Daniels told CNN Friday. The FAA currently has about 11,000 certified controllers working and estimates it needs 3,000 more. That means hiring more than 6,000, though, to make up for expected departures. America desperately needs more air traffic controllers. Increased retirements and resignations during the shutdown will make filling that gap more difficult. “Long after you all finish covering the shutdown, we are going to be stuck dealing with this problem,” he told reporters. But President Donald Trump said he isn't concerned about losing additional air traffic controllers, especially those who called off work at times during the the shutdown. “If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind!” he said in the post. But there is no quick way to replace an air traffic controller: It takes two to three years of training before controllers can oversee aircraft. Natural attrition was already nearly outpacing hiring, even before the shutdown. Daniels defended those who didn't report to work at times during the shutdown, saying the lack of pay could cause child care issues or other problems. Even Duffy said he understood the financial pressures made it difficult for some to report in. Many controllers who took approved vacations or had sick or bereavement leave and therefore didn't qualify complained the bonus just shows how little appreciated controllers are.

A driver and three of his passengers were wounded, including two children, after a shooting Saturday in Phoenix, Arizona. One man is dead, and three others were shot, including two children, after gunfire rang out Saturday afternoon in an Arizona parking lot. The shooting, which involved a sedan and an SUV, happened at about 2:45 p.m. local time in a business parking lot in south Phoenix. Brian Bower said during a news conference there was a dispute between the two cars, and both then pulled into the parking lot. The dispute continued in the parking lot and a physical fight ensued, according to Bower. Police tape and officers seen near the area of 19th Ave. and Baseline in Phoenix, as officers responded to a shooting on Saturday. A man, woman and two children were in the SUV. Police said multiple rounds were fired and all four people in the SUV were shot. Police have not yet said what led up to the Phoenix shooting. Bower said the suspect, who has not yet been publicly identified, remained at the scene until police arrived. It is unclear what led to the shooting, which left one person dead and three others wounded. Police did not confirm any pending charges against the suspect, noting he was speaking with detectives. Detectives have not yet ruled out the possibility of the incident being related to road rage or self-defense, as there is no indication the two parties knew each other, according to Bower.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 president, sits as Simon Stiell, United Nations climate chief, left, speaks with other U.N. officials during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N. BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to the wrath of extreme weather. But the catch-all agreement doesn't include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries' inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded. The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline, was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil's leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deal shows “that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.” ADDS NAME - Delegates from Colombia, including Daniela Duran Gonzalez, head of international affairs for the Colombian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, front, react during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N. “The alternative is that we don't get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.” “This deal isn't perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.” “This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said, referring to the United States' withdrawal from the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. Some countries said they got enough out of the deal. “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone's environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.” U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.” The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present. After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. Ana Aguilar, operative director at the ministry of environment of Panama, center, speaks surrounded by delegates at a plenary session during the COP30 U.N. The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Critics complained there was not much to the deal. “Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International. Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.” The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. Russia's ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren't prepared to share them with everyone.” An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump scaled back threats he has made to deploy the National Guard to New York City  under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani‘s leadership, saying “other places need it more.” Trump spoke to reporters outside the White House on Saturday, where he was asked if he would still “plan” to send troops to the Big Apple as part of a broader crime crackdown in mostly Democrat-led cities. Right now, other places need it more, but if they need it,” Trump said, before touting his meeting with Mamdani in the Oval Office on Friday. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it.” The comments, while not ruling out a troop deployment, signal Trump is warming to Mamdani after a surprisingly friendly meeting between the two. “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. … I want him to do a great job, and we'll help them do a great job,” Trump said in a press conference following the sit-down. Trump's National Guard deployments have also been beset by legal setbacks, with the Supreme Court currently weighing an earlier one to Chicago. Despite that deployment being blocked in court, Trump has continued to suggest it is necessary to combat crime in the Windy City, most recently as Saturday afternoon, when he claimed “The people are chanting, BRING IN TRUMP!!</p>
