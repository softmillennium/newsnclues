                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest GPUs need a type of rare earth metal called Terbium and there are only 36 companies in the world exploring or producing it. To own Figure Technology Solutions, you have to believe in the potential of financial infrastructure built on blockchain, and trust that tech-driven disruption can reshape consumer finance and capital markets. The recent strong quarterly earnings, combined with the follow-on offering for its Series A Blockchain Common Stock, directly reinforce that bigger vision, Figure isn't just growing fast, it's aiming to set new standards in how investors own and trade equity. However, the risks shift: with aggressive innovation, you're now more exposed to regulatory and market adoption uncertainties, alongside persistent valuation concerns. The follow-on offering looks non-dilutive for existing shareholders, so its short-term market impact appears muted, but it does amplify both Figure's growth story and the stakes of execution. But against these growth ambitions, regulatory risks remain a key watchpoint for investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's down more than 33% from its all-time high above $126,000 in early October, which officially pushes the digital unit into bear market territory defined as at least 20% lower than the record high. Bitcoin's now down about 10% this year, and likely will see more selling which could mean its first annual loss since 2022, experts said. "It seems early in the selloff process," said Hyunsu Jung, chief executive of publicly traded crypto-treasury company Hyperion DeFi. A whirlwind of factors have contributed to crypto's downfall, analysts said. Cryptocurrency tends to trade in line with the riskier growth stocks like in artficial intelligence and technology, which also have been battered lately amid high valuation worries and an uncertain economy. Global interest rate uncertainty and moves to cash by corporate digital asset treasuries and other large crypto holders like investment firm Blackrock are also weighing on crypto, Jung said. That initial sell-off pushed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through several technical support levels on price charts that triggered a cascade of sales among trend followers, exacerbating the decline. Specifically, key signals that prompted more selling according to Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research, include: The sharp decline could force even more sales, some analysts warned. It's "reawakened concerns about a further wave of forced selling, amid worries that retail investors might need to liquidate other assets to meet margin calls," Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid said. Once the dust settles - and no one can say yet when that might be - investors with iron stomachs may want to tip toe in, some experts said. After sifting through corporate 13Fs, or a required Securities and Exchange Commission form for institutional investment managers who oversee at least $100 million in assets under management, LPL Financial's portfolio strategist George Smith found "a large increase in cryptocurrency-related products and blockchain mining firms (underscoring) the growing institutional appetite for digital assets." That could bode well for cryptocurrency because institutional investors are often considered "smart money." Again,"no one should ever invest beyond their risk tolerance," said David Namdar, chief executive of CEA Industries, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Binance Coin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A US lawmaker just dropped a bill that would let Americans pay federal taxes in Bitcoin, funneling BTC straight into the strategic reserve without triggering capital gains. Coinbase is rolling out ETH-backed loans powered by Morpho, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC without selling their holdings. And crypto advocacy groups are pushing Trump to intervene in the Roman Storm case, arguing that writing code isn't a crime. DeepSnitch AI, meanwhile, has now pulled in more than $559K, with its token climbing to $0.02381. The project runs on a network of five coordinated AI agents designed to monitor and decode crypto market activity in real time. Representative Warren Davidson has introduced the Bitcoin for America Act, allowing taxpayers to pay federal taxes in Bitcoin without facing capital gains taxes. Meanwhile, Coinbase just launched ETH-backed loans for US users, letting them borrow USDC against their Ether holdings without selling. And above 65 crypto groups are calling on Trump to drop charges against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm. Storm was convicted of running an unlicensed money transmitting business, but advocates argue that writing open-source code is protected speech. At a time when Bitcoin is getting integrated into government policy, Coinbase is expanding DeFi access, and developers are fighting for clarity, the best altcoins to buy are the ones building on top of this foundation. With market volatility rising, traders are turning to AI-driven tools, analyst outlooks, and even ChatGPT crypto predictions to map where the next major gains could come from. And DeepSnitch AI is surfacing as a rare case, shipping real tools to solve daily retail trader problems. Its five AI agents, or “snitches,” monitor on-chain transactions, social channels, and private alpha groups to deliver real-time intelligence. Proving that the presale was never just smoke and mirrors, SnitchFeed is now live in the internal environment, streaming alerts with enhanced detection logic for mood shifts, FUD storms, and whale activity. The unified dashboard now features a global alert banner, token sentiment visuals, and an active alerts feed. This snitch screens tokens for safety using multi-layered filters that check on-chain metrics, developer activity, contract age, LP locks, and rug flags. And there's also SnitchGPT, acting as your on-chain research assistant, trained on blockchain data to answer questions and decode complex transactions in plain English. You're not digging through block explorers or guessing what a whale wallet is doing. DeepSnitch AI is priced at $0.02381 in presale, where traders can buy deployed technology, not promises. This is the altcoin forecast 2025 opportunity with 100x potential right now, and it's quite likely one of the very best altcoins to buy right now. Ethereum is trading around $2,880, down close to 4% in 24 hours, with a market cap above $347 billion. Ether treasury companies are sitting on millions in unrealized losses, with BitMine alone down $3.7 billion. A bearish fractal from 2022 is playing out again, suggesting ETH could test around $2,500 as the 200-week moving average becomes the last line of defense. But with Ethereum requiring billions in fresh capital to make even modest percentage moves, DeepSnitch AI carries far greater upside potential because smaller inflows can translate into disproportionately larger gains. Chainlink is priced around $13 as of November 21, with a market cap above $9 billion. The token recently got a boost from 21Shares launching LINK ETPs on Nasdaq Stockholm, expanding access for European investors. Some analysts expect Chainlink to grind higher as real-world asset tokenization and institutional DeFi partnerships expand, but its trajectory is likely to be steady rather than parabolic. And while LINK is solid long-term, it's trading at established valuations that cap explosive upside. DeepSnitch AI ranks among the best altcoins to buy, offering AI-powered crypto intelligence tools at a presale price of $0.02381 with above $559K raised and live platform deployment. DeepSnitch AI especially sets itself apart through its credibility and on-chain expert-developed tools, which are already shipping during presale. Undervalued altcoins in presale stage, like DeepSnitch AI, offer higher upside than established coins like Ethereum and Chainlink due to their early-stage pricing and deployed technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As real-world asset (RWA) tokenization surges, the crypto industry is entering unfamiliar territory, bringing traditional equities, private credit, and commercial paper onchain and uncovering potential critical risks along the way. Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder of oracle provider RedStone, says a risk is potentially being overlooked: the weekend gap, where crypto trades 24/7, while Wall Street does not. “Imagine if a Tesla factory explodes over the weekend—traditional markets are closed, but on-chain markets are open,” Kaźmierczak said in an interview with CoinDesk at Devconnect Buenos Aires. This mismatch, he argues, could create what he calls a "price dislocation," where an on-chain asset appears stable, but only because the oracles, which send data from the outside world to a blockchain, have stopped updating prices. Major providers typically freeze equity price feeds when U.S. markets close at 4 p.m. In that window, on-chain versions of Tesla, or any other stock, could keep trading, even if their real-world price should have changed dramatically. Most tokenized stock trading activity is currently focused on centralized exchanges, where trading of these products is often limited during the weekend. If the oracle doesn't update until markets reopen, on-chain protocols could be trading on "ghost" prices, creating massive arbitrage opportunities or leaving lending protocols under-collateralized. While stablecoins are relatively safe, Kaźmierczak pointed out that the market is shifting toward more complex products, such as tokenized portfolios of credit, commercial paper, and equities. If oracles lag during real-world volatility, structured DeFi protocols could be left mispricing assets. In the "Pull" model, users get data delivered on-chain when they interact with a protocol, meaning "the data is always fresh," according to Kaźmierczak. However, he conceded that most protocols still rely on the older model because it is easier to integrate. Until oracles and protocols evolve to account for these timing mismatches, Kaźmierczak suggested that the premise of 24/7 tokenized finance carries inherent risks. “We still need to see how they behave on the weekend,” Kaźmierczak warned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The privacy crypto market has suffered a pullback following an epic rally. There is real competition among the best altcoins to buy now, focused on privacy. The project is a full-stack privacy layer for Solana, centered on encrypted communication, anonymous identity, and hard-to-trace transactions, using AI-assisted routing on top of Solana's high-speed infrastructure. GhostWareOS does not try to compete with Solana, but to cover the privacy gaps of a network designed for throughput and low fees, not native anonymity. Pseudonym and anonymous identity management: users can operate with aliases instead of exposing the same address in every interaction. Encrypted relays: a routing layer that makes it harder to link IP, wallet, and usage pattern, cutting down the trail left for analytics tools. Metadata scrubbing: mechanisms to erase or scramble contextual data that usually allows on-chain behavior to be reconstructed (time of activity, trading pairs, sequence of interactions). Zcash officially presents itself as encrypted electronic cash, the first major cryptocurrency to use zero-knowledge for private peer-to-peer payments. The protocol offers two types of addresses: transparent t-addresses, where balances and transactions are public, and shielded z-addresses, where transaction data is encrypted using zk-SNARKs. XMR is a cryptocurrency where sender, receiver, and amount are all automatically hidden. A cleaner stack with real deployment signals often wins the top slot when traders search for dominance. Beyond ZEC and XMR, the last few years have brought a wave of new privacy projects with different architectural approaches. It is similar to GhostWareOS in its ambition to be a pluggable privacy layer for other ecosystems, but it operates as its own blockchain with a focus on multiple networks, while GHOST is specifically anchored to Solana and its dApp flows on that L1. This is a privacy approach more geared toward the application and credential layer, while GhostWareOS concentrates on behavior and metadata within a specific L1. Some projects are trying to extend privacy across the whole multi-chain DeFi landscape, while others aim to be the home for fully hidden transactions. GHOST, meanwhile, sits in a different spot on that map. It is a privacy layer built natively for Solana, with its own token and an explicit focus on metadata and communications inside that ecosystem. The privacy market in crypto is no longer just shorthand for anonymous payment coins. Zcash has evolved into an encrypted money network with growing adoption of shielded addresses; Monero remains the reference point for default anonymity and strong fungibility; Namada and Manta are exploring different models of multichain, modular, and dedicated-L1 privacy. In a cycle where privacy is once again treated as a leading narrative, it is natural for $GHOST to be considered one of the best altcoins to buy now.

A cryptocurrency company is departing from the London Stock Exchange as part of a restructuring plan. According to TipRanks, Argo Blockchain announced in October that it would delist from the exchange. The move may also impact regulatory protections, trading, and tax consequences for shareholders. Argo Blockchain focuses on large-scale mining powered by clean energy, making it a unique industry player, per TipRanks. That said, crypto has been controversial, with many highlighting the negative impacts of the mining process. For instance, a study by the United Nations University found that in one year, bitcoin produced air pollution equal to burning 84 billion pounds of coal or 190 gas power plants. With T-Mobile, getting a brand-new phone is finally simple — and it only takes 15 minutes per line to switch over. With Easy Switch, you'll get customized insights and recommendations about what plan is right for you. Plus, once you make the switch, your new phone is eligible for same-day delivery. The Natural Resources Defense Council put it another way: One bitcoin consumes the same amount of resources and releases the same amount of pollution as 330,000 credit card transactions. However, some experts believe that crypto could help the planet through environment-focused projects. Forbes outlined an example where a crypto company awarded coins to solar producers for every energy unit generated. Some blockchain companies, like Argo, have decided to take environmental concerns into their own hands. By using 100% hydropower (clean energy) at its Baie Comeau facility, it generates less pollution than others. 💡Dirty Labs makes it easy and affordable to clean your stuff without harsh chemicals What do you think the future of cryptocurrency is? A third company decided to put all the energy that goes into crypto transactions to good use by training artificial intelligence models, which are also resource-intensive. Regardless, what happens to a more planet-focused company like Argo could be a sign for what's to come for the industry's green initiatives. 💰Get TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The foundation of this model lies in constructing a balanced configuration that utilizes load-balanced scheduling techniques. The model incorporates adaptive equilibrium scheduling to analyze interference characteristics that can undermine performance. By employing parameter estimation methods such as joint similarity measurement, the CCT's delay characteristics are analyzed to develop an efficient cross-chain network model. Key formulas illustrate how to track signal-to-noise ratios, aiding in delivering effective long-distance cross-chain coverage. The paper introduces a novel approach to distributed intelligent scheduling using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) combined with smart contracts. This decentralized mechanism addresses the limitations of centralized scheduling, improving scalability and fault tolerance. Each node within the network broadcasts its state information, including CPU and bandwidth availability. Following GNN modeling, nodes develop a task transfer matrix, indicating where and how tasks should be allocated based on load predictions. Smart contracts execute these strategies efficiently, ensuring that overloaded nodes can offload tasks to neighbors, thereby maintaining system equilibrium. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops allow for real-time adjustments, enhancing operational adaptability in port environments. The CCT link model represents a comprehensive framework for managing blockchain-enabled IoT systems in port areas. This blend of technologies ensures a more resilient infrastructure, ultimately streamlining operations and enhancing productivity within port environments.
