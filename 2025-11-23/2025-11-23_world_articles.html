                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The self-described idyllic life of a family of five living in an Italian forest with horses, donkeys and chickens has stalled after a court ordered the children be removed and placed in foster care. Patrol cars were dispatched to remove the children from their home in Abruzzo to a church-run care facility. Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition to reunite the family. The parents, Nathan Trevallion, a 51-year-old British former professional chef, and Catherine Birmingham, a 45-year-old Australian life coach and former equestrian trainer, were named in an order issued by a L'Aquila court as parents of the children – one eight-year-old and six-year-old twins. Giovanni Angelucci, the family's lawyer, says the family heats the home with fireplaces and uses solar panels for light and to charge their devices. The family removed running water to avoid microplastics as well as costs and instead draws fresh water from a well on the property. They don't have an indoor toilet but instead use an outdoor composting toilet. The family's living situation came to light in September 2024 after all five were hospitalized for poisoning after eating wild mushrooms from the forest. After that time, the family was visited by social service officials and law enforcement, but their lawyer said they did not comply with recommendations to have the children receive regular medical care and attend schools. “They are happy, smell good, well-mannered, and well-fed; why break this bond?” he said Friday, according to La Repubblica newspaper. CNN reached out to the family via Birmingham's website, which advises that they don't check electronic communications often. Birmingham runs a life coaching and energy reading business, according to her website, which is filled with images of animals and the children – photos the court order said violated the children's privacy and were posted only to show the appearance of a normal living situation after the social services' investigation began. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her deputy Matteo Salvini have both criticized the court decision. Salvini, who plans to visit the family home next week, told reporters at the Venice Bienniele on Friday that it was “shameful that the State is concerned with private education and the personal life choices of two parents who found Italy a hospitable country, yet it steals their children.” The family purchased the home in 2021, at which time Birmingham wrote on her website, “Recently we found our dream forever home. … With the energy of the place being very special, we bring people to stay for healing and awakening, connecting to the wild, without and within, eating home grown and home cooked organic vegan food.” “I'm a father myself, so I was deeply shocked by the situation,” he told CNN, adding that he believed the situation could be resolved if the family promises to meet certain requirements, including reinstalling running water and meeting with the local school on a weekly basis to assess the children's academic progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a city where football is more than a sport, the gun death of John Beam has provoked an outpouring of emotion Football in Oakland, California, is more than a sport. In many schools, coaches are like parental figures who get young people through vulnerable times, into universities and sometimes even drafted to the National Football League. Beam, 66, was shot in the head at the Laney College athletics field house on 13 November, in what police officers called a “targeted incident”. He died of his injuries in hospital the following day. A 27-year-old man, Cedric Irving Jr, made his first court appearance Tuesday after being charged with Beam's murder. He faces 50 years to life if convicted, along with enhancements alleging he personally fired the gun and that Beam was particularly vulnerable. Beam's death has rocked the northern California port city. Students and family friends came to pay their respects. The sports field, usually filled with players and games, was deserted, but for a flock of Canadian geese. Jack Nelson, a retired teacher, volunteer coach and 1972 alumnus of Skyline high school, where Beam had led the team to 15 Oakland Athletic League titles, said the killing felt like a major moment: “This is huge. Since his death, students had been chanting Beam's name, Nelson said. The other day, he was running past a middle school where students were playing football and after touchdown they all chanted “John Beam! Gun violence remains a pervasive problem for Oakland, even though the city has seen homicides decline recently after pandemic highs. “They're truly life coaches, and regardless of the students' home situation, social economic status, they can become a resource for our youth to develop into kind human beings.” That's exactly the role Beam played in the lives of so many Oakland students, said J'Sharlon Jones, 47, now a website developer in Denver. “I used to call Coach Beam on Father's Day. “Heartaches, shock, denial, and the whole gamut of emotions – the last thing on the bingo card was that happening to Coach,” said Haran Jackson, another former student from Skyline who coach Beam helped get into college. His first encounter with Beam was one of getting told off for kicking a ball back to some female student athletes in a manner that Beam found disrespectful. Growing up in a single-parent home in Oakland, Jackson never imagined he'd get to have a college experience, which changed his life trajectory, getting to see the country and the world. “Coach quarterbacked that whole situation for me,” said Jackson adding: “He really relished in finding the diamonds in the rough, like me.” Beam even set him on his current career, working in theatre and film, with a tip about an audition for runners to do a Nike commercial. “I think the two of you should hook up. On day one of joining the Skyline high school football team, Cotroneo, now a cinematographer and film-maker, dislocated his finger catching the football. “Coach Beam sort of chuckled at me and was like, “Well, hey, football might not work out for you, but we're looking for a video guy,” Cotroneo recalled. From that point forward, he became the football team's videographer, filming home games, road games and editing together highlight reels for players being recruited by colleges. “He was single-handedly responsible for submitting probably six or seven players for full scholarships in each of the years that I was working with the team. And probably most of these guys never had anybody in their family that went to college,” said Cotroneo, adding “he was giving kids a purpose and an outlet.” Cotroneo runs through the numbers of people whose lives were touched by Beam: 30-40 players on a team per year, multiplied that by over 45 years. “And then you factor in that a lot of these guys that end up on the football teams don't necessarily have a strong male role model in their lives,” he adds. Cotoreno had discussed trying to collaborate on film projects with Beam. Beam had read a script for a social horror film that Jackson wrote and wanted to be part of it, according to Jackson, hence the text intro. Beam was always “creating a network”, said Navarro, the OAL commissioner: “He was that person that kind of bridged the connections” – creating opportunities for people in his vast multi-generational network to help each other. Nelson is raising funds to organize an alumni basketball game in Beam's honor, and said there's a 25 foot long sign in the works for Skyline's sports field saying: “John Beam/Anthony Fardella Athletic Complex.” Navarro and Beam collaborated this year on creating the first annual Oakland football classic in October to kick off the league season. The classic will be named after Beam, Navarro said. Jones wants to build a website where all the stories about Coach can live for ever. Cotoreno is scouting a feature film in the Bay and is committed to bringing aboard local youth as his way of giving back and honouring Beam's legacy.</p>

"Currently, there is an understanding that the American proposals may take into account a number of elements that are based on the Ukrainian vision and are critically important for Ukraine's national interests," Zelensky wrote. Politicians in both the U.S. and Europe have spoken out about the leaked 28-point plan that would force Ukraine to cede the unoccupied part of Donbas, cap its army at 600,000 soldiers, abandon NATO aspirations and stationing foreign troops in Ukraine. Russia, in turn, would be expected to promise to not re-attack Ukraine or attack Europe and reflect that in the Russian law. Washington has set Nov. 27 as the deadline for making progress on the deal and may reportedly cut weapons supplies or access to intelligence if Kyiv doesn't cooperate. As Ukrainian leaders reported about progress in negotiations, Trump took to Truth Social to denounce Ukrainian and European handling of the peace process, repeating his recurring criticism. "Ukraine leadership has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts, and Europe continues to buy oil from Russia," Trump wrote. Trump also returned to what has become his perennial refrain when it comes to Ukraine: "I inherited a war that should have never happened." Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and continued its aggression during Trump's first term as president from 2017-2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armed with shovels and wheelbarrows, municipal workers from Tulum, Mexico, were deployed to the resort town's famed beaches in June, tasked with removing large quantities of sargassum that had piled up to cover the crystal-clear waters. Local officials and hotel owners have told CNN that the amount of sargassum this year is the largest they've seen since 2018 – an issue that has contributed to a lower flow of visitors this year. But the seaweed isn't the only problem facing Tulum, a town in Yucatán Peninsula renowned for its idyllic coastlines and archaeological wonders. Other factors, such as the shaky US economy, local insecurity and the management of beaches, are also impacting tourism at this Caribbean destination, a favorite among Americans. Tulum had fewer tourists this summer than in 2024, according to official figures and industry leaders. During the week of August 16-22 this year, hotel occupancy was 53.3%, and the week of September 6-12 was even lower, dropping to 48.1%, according to the tourism secretariat of Quintana Roo state. David Ortiz Mena, president of the Tulum Hotel Association, told CNN that the figures for this period are about four percentage points lower than those of 2024. According to the businessman, inflation in the US, changes in interest rates and even the recent 43-day government shutdown – which paused payments to many federal workers – forced Americans to limit their vacations. But there are already signs of “a clear recovery,” he said. It has a wide range of tourist attractions. His views were shared by Eliazar Mas Kinil, Tulum City Council member with a focus on tourism, industry, commerce and agricultural affairs. So, everything that happens in the United States impacts us,” Mas Kinil told CNN. “In the end, I think American citizens are careful with their resources.” Tulum will have “a much higher season” in December and January, he predicted. To attract more American tourists, officials are also working to improve public safety, an issue that reached a boiling point in March when local Secretary of Security José Roberto Rodríguez Bautista was killed in an armed attack. This means that Americans are urged to exercise increased caution when visiting the state. Hazael Cerón, coordinator of the Center for Tourism Research and Competitiveness at Anáhuac University, said he believes the main challenge is to strategically plan Tulum's development. According to Cerón, Tulum's authorities and business owners must work with academics to analyze travel trends, invest in both hotel and urban infrastructure, monitor the quality of services and prevent excessive charges for tourists. In fact, I think it will be an experiment for other traditional destinations that are also falling behind, like Acapulco or Mazatlán,” he said. Councilman Mas Kinil acknowledged that strategic planning, establishing clear rules on issues such as beach access, and improving tourist services are key aspects for Tulum's future. Mas Kinil recalled that the recent establishment of a natural reserve resulted in new restrictions that now prevent tourists from entering some beaches with disposable objects like plastic bottles and straws. He said access to the beaches is still free for Mexicans and foreigners, and that authorities are working to better explain the rules that aim to protect the environment. They also see the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which Mexico will co-host with the US and Canada, as an opportunity for Tulum to receive more visitors. Chichen Itza and beyond: Mayan ruins in Yucatan, Mexico Ortiz Mena noted that Tulum has 10,800 hotel rooms, ranging from luxury suites to hostels priced between $20 and $22 a night. “It is very likely that this will contribute to the Mexican Caribbean, that people will take advantage of the extensive hotel infrastructure and the excellent connectivity, and this is estimated to mean 1 million more travelers for the Mexican Caribbean in 2026,” he said. Cerón, the researcher, said that while room prices have remained stable, taxi fares and other costs tend to be high, including the price of coconut, which some businesses sell for up to 200 pesos, about $10.50. “Suddenly we see the basket of golden eggs and want to milk it dry, and that's what happened,” he said.</p>

MOSCOW, November 23. /TASS/. Yury Ushakov, Aide to the Russian President for International Affairs, has called Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to India "super major" and expressed hope that it will be fruitful in every sense.

"We and the Indian side are actively preparing for the visit and hope that it will be fruitful in every sense," Ushakov said. The dates have been agreed on for early December, he said, adding that they will be officially announced together with Indian partners. "It will be a super major [visit] because it is even called a state visit," Ushakov said in an interview for VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin's "Moscow. Kremlin. Putin" program.

The most important thing is that "this visit provides an opportunity to put into practice the agreement between the Prime Minister [of India Narendra Modi] and the Russian President that they meet every year for a thorough discussion on both bilateral affairs and current international issues," he said, adding that "in this regard, this visit will, of course, be important.".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With colder weather and snowfall arriving later in the season, retailers say Canadians are putting off their parka purchases. Now, uncertainty makes it feel optional – even like a gamble. With Canada's average winter temperature warming by 3.6 C since 1948, and cold snaps becoming more unpredictable, designing and buying for the season has become more complex, forcing the outerwear market to adapt by displaying winter parkas later in the season and offering coats that work for fluctuating temperatures. Alex Binette, a Toronto-based outerwear buyer for Harry Rosen, has seen these factors affect when stores order their coats and which styles they carry. “We typically won't bring in parkas until November now, whereas before it seemed like people were shopping earlier, anticipating the rush and buying them even in the summer,” he said. Ten Canadian kids' clothing brands to put on your radar Binette noted that even after Boxing Day, when sales hit and the temperature typically drops, outerwear sales fall significantly – perhaps because of post-holiday belt-tightening, he speculated, or optimistic hopes for an early spring. This shift means that customers are buying regular-price outerwear almost exclusively in November and December, putting added pressure on retailers to hit sales targets before the end of the year. As the price of winter jackets – already high to begin with – has increased, much like everything else in recent years, cost plays heavily on consumers' minds. To adapt, Harry Rosen has leaned into hybrid styles that function as both sweaters and outerwear, which have a longer selling window, Binette said. Brands predominantly known for their outerwear, such as Canada Goose, Mackage and Arc'teryx, have also evolved in response. Binette points to a bestseller from Moose Knuckles this season: a cotton fleece zip-up hoodie that isn't weatherproof but that customers are wearing as outerwear. “Wearing a chunky, heavy-gauge sweater as outerwear is the new thing for September, October, even parts of November,” he said. The popular cotton fleece zip-up hoodie from Moose Knuckles retails for $495.Supplied Shoppers generally delay big purchases and buy more reactively, according to David Hardisty, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia. When cold weather arrives later, consumers simply feel less urgency, he said. “You see this with other products too, like road salt,” Hardisty said. “People don't stock up early – they wait until the first freeze and then suddenly it's sold out everywhere.” Canada Goose signalled this shift by hiring French fashion designer Haider Ackermann in 2024 as its first ever creative director, along with the recent opening of a sleek flagship store on Paris's Champs-Élysées. A highly respected name in fashion, Ackermann's hiring indicates the company's intent to shift from utilitarian outerwear to a more diverse brand with fashion credibility in more categories. You can see this in their latest collection which features a variety of layers from tees to graphic hoodies and shorts. Moose Knuckles has followed suit, this month bringing in a new creative team with experience at Stüssy, Comme des Garçons and Moncler – brands known for full collections and high design rather than single-purpose outerwear. Once defined almost entirely by its heavy-duty winter parkas, Kanuk now offers lighter, more adaptable and more fashion-driven pieces without abandoning its cold-weather roots. The brand's latest collections reflect that shift, with denim overshirts, jeans and chunky knits alongside its winter staples. “People want comfort, but with a good look,” Dahan said. In Canada, a country defined by its winters, outerwear has become an uncertain market. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cop30 in Belém wrapped up on Saturday night more than 24 hours later than planned, and with an Amazonian rainstorm thundering down on the conference centre. The UN structure just about held, as it has done these past three weeks despite fire, savage tropical heat and blistering political attacks on the multilateral system of global environmental governance. Dozens of agreements were gavelled through on the final day, as the most collective form of humanity worked to resolve the most complex and dangerous challenge that our species has ever faced. The process very nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by last-ditch talks that went on into the early morning. Veteran observers told me the Paris agreement was on life-support. And the power balance in the world is still so skewed towards gas, oil and coal interests that there was not even a single mention of “fossil fuels” in the main agreement. Yet, for all these flaws, Belém opened up new avenues of discussion on how to reduce dependency on petrochemicals, and it increased the scope of participation by Indigenous groups and scientists. But any judgment needs to take into account the geopolitical minefield in which these talks took place. Here are five threats that will have to be avoided at next year's climate summit in Turkey. Many of the problems that beset the talks could have been avoided if these two climate superpowers – the world's biggest historical emitter and the world's biggest current emitter – had been able to coordinate a shared approach as they used to do before Donald Trump came to power. Instead, Trump has attacked climate science, cursed the UN and staged a summit in Washington with the Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Little wonder Riyadh felt emboldened at Cop30 to stymie any mention of fossil fuels, even though language on this was agreed at Cop28 in Dubai. China, by contrast, was present in Belém and geared towards helping its Brics partner, Brazil, to stage a successful conference. But its advisers made clear that Beijing did not want to fill US shoes when it came to finance, nor to lead alone on any issue beyond the manufacture and sale of renewable energy products. One wants to endlessly expand agricultural frontiers, dig ever deeper for minerals and ignore the toll on forests and oceans. The other says such activities are breaking planetary boundaries with ever more catastrophic consequences for the climate, nature and human health. It was also apparent at Cop30, where the Brazilian hosts sometimes seemed to send mixed messages, according to observers from Asia, Europe and Latin America. While the environment secretary, Marina Silva, was the driving force in pushing for a roadmap away from fossil fuels and deforestation, the foreign ministry – which has spent decades promoting agribusiness and oil exports – was far more hesitant and needed prompting by the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The Amazon rainforest appeared to have been a victim of this, getting only one brief and vague mention in the main negotiating text. Europe has often presented itself as a leader on climate action, but it was heavily criticised at Cop30 for lagging on promises of climate finance for developing countries. As a result, the EU had to delay its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) climate plan and only decided halfway through the Belém conference that it would make a fossil fuel transition roadmap one of its negotiating “red lines”. This was incompetent at best, because such major issues need far more advance coordination. Little surprise that many global south participants were suspicious that this sudden conversion to the roadmap was a ruse or a bargaining chip to delay action on adaptation finance. European politicians said their budgets had shifted towards re-arming in response to the rising threat posed by Russia. As a result, they have slashed overseas development aid and it becomes an ever more difficult challenge to allocate funds for climate finance. None of the four major US news networks sent a team to Belém. Reporters from British and European broadcasters were present, but many said it was hard for them to get space in news programmes for their stories. The UN, which turns 80 next year, is showing its age. Consensus decision making at Cop means any country has a veto. That might have made sense when cold war politics were a global priority, but it is inadequate now humanity faces an existential threat to its planetary home. Dozens of high-ambition nations led by Colombia issued their own Belém declaration and announced plans to hold a parallel process on phasing out fossil fuels, which will have a first conference in Santa Marta, Colombia next April. On the political level, that might be an inevitable break, but the global economy is increasingly moving towards renewable power, which is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and demographic trends are shifting power to the global south. These realities needs to be recognised by a revamped and more dynamic system of global governance. Or the Paris agreement may not make it unscathed from future Cops.</p>

LONDON, November 23. /TASS/. European leaders have prepared a counterplan in response to US President Donald Trump's peace proposals on Ukraine, Sky News reported.

Europe's vision on the issue will be presented on November 23 at a meeting on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine in Geneva, according to the TV channel.

Earlier, the DPA news agency, citing sources in German government circles, reported that Washington's peace plan would be discussed at a meeting of representatives of leading EU countries with their counterparts from the United States and Ukraine in Geneva.</p>

Sekiwake Aonishiki brought a dramatic end to one of sumo's most chaotic tournaments in recent memory by winning his first career title, while securing a historic promotion to ozeki in the process. The 21-year-old Ukrainian walked off with the Emperor's Cup at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament after winning his final match, then defeating yokozuna Hoshoryu in a championship playoff on Sunday at Fukuoka Kokusai Center. That eliminated Onosato from contention for the title and assured Hoshoryu either the title outright or a place in a playoff. It all came down to Aonishiki's bout with ozeki Kotozakura. A victory and he would finish tied with Hoshoryu at 12-3 to set up the title showdown; a loss and the title was Hoshoryu's. Aonishiki, who had beaten the ozeki in both of the last two tournaments, worked in low for a belt hold, while keeping his head squarely placed in Kotozakura's chest. Then in a odd twist that seemed to fit the theme of a peculiar tournament, Aonishiki made a feint to grab a leg and, when Kotozakura pulled his legs back, his feet slipped out from under him and he plunged helplessly to the dirt. Aonishiki's victory over Hoshoryu in the playoff was also far from textbook. The 21-year-old Aonishiki has been on an unprecedented rise up the ranks since his pro sumo debut in September 2023. He needed just 13 tournaments — without ever having a losing record — to reach the third highest rank of sekiwake, the fewest ever excluding former amateur stars who started their careers in the makushita rank. Following Sunday's action, which gave him an aggregate 34 wins over three tournaments, the Japan Sumo Association said a special meeting has been called to decide on Aonishiki's promotion to ozeki, which would make him the fastest to reach the second highest rank. The promotion will be made official on Wednesday. For his efforts, Aonishiki was also awarded both the Outstanding Performance Award and Technique Prize — the fifth tournament in a row in which he has received at least one post-tournament honor. Throughout the tournament, Hoshoryu had to play catch-up after suffering two losses in the first six days. Conversely, Onosato reeled off nine straight wins before suddenly hitting a wall that saw him lose three of his next five matches — and his win over Aonishiki on the 13th day was hardly decisive. Aonishiki's chances for the title had seemed to end with that loss to Onosato, as it left him one win behind the two yokozuna with two days to go. Then fate stepped in and spoiled the scenario, as both Hoshoryu and Onosato were dealt stunning losses on Day 14, with Aonishiki getting back into the picture with his third win over Hoshoryu in three career meetings. Aonishiki followed that up with his win on the final day over Kotozakura, before knocking off Hoshoryu. It marks the second time that Hoshoryu lost out on a title in a playoff, having fallen to Onosato in September. Meanwhile, komusubi Takayasu put himself into position for a possible promotion back to sekiwake — a rank the former ozeki last held in January 2023 — when he earned his kachikoshi eighth win by shoving out No. Yoshinofuji finished with a 9-6 record that included back-to-back victories over Onosato and Aonishiki, which earned him the Technique Prize. 8 maegashira Ichiyamamoto both earned the Fighting Spirit Prize after finishing with 11-4 records. 3 maegashira Ura, who executed a nice somersault in defeat, while Ichiyamamoto drove out No. In a clash of sanyaku wrestlers with losing records, sekiwake Oho forced out komusubi Takanosho to finish at 7-8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll has made an unexpected debut in the Ukraine conflict settlement process. RT takes a look at the 35-year-old official, reportedly US President Donald Trump's new special envoy, who holds one of the most senior civilian posts in the Pentagon hierarchy and has made international headlines with his surprise Ukraine trip. Before being tapped by Trump late last year to become the secretary of the army, Driscoll had kept a low public profile. Driscoll is known to be a friend and former classmate of US Vice President J.D. Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School after his military service on the post-9/11 GI Bill. Driscoll has repeatedly called for an overhaul of the US military's procurement system, which is dominated by the Big Five: Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, and Northrop Grumman. The procurement practices, when they come to light, have repeatedly caused public controversies, ranging from the ballooning costs of F-35 fighter jets, known for having suffered from technical problems, to special, purportedly military-grade bushings that cost some $90,000 per small plastic bag - while civilian analogues cost around $100 at most. “The defense industrial base broadly, and the primes in particular, conned the American people and the Pentagon and the army into thinking that it needed military-specific solutions, when in reality, a lot of these commercial solutions are equal to or better, and we've actually harmed ourselves with that mentality,” he said earlier this month. This week, Driscoll unexpectedly delved into the Ukrainian crisis, bringing the latest US draft peace plan to Kiev and demanding it be signed by next Thursday. The draft has reportedly been widely perceived  amongst Kiev's Western European backers as an “ultimatum” to Ukraine, demanding its “surrender.” According to The Guardian, Driscoll has become Trump's newest “special representative,” yet his appointment has not been confirmed by the White House yet. Earlier this week, AP mentioned the US president's decision on Driscoll's appointment, citing an unnamed official. Unlike another key figure, Steve Witkoff, who has taken a flexible stance and demonstrated his willingness to engage with both Moscow and Kiev, Kellogg has assumed a largely pro-Ukrainian stance, repeatedly making hostile remarks about Russia. The meeting reportedly turned out to be tense, with Driscoll making the other dignitaries wait and showing up late, as well as using obscene language to relay Washington's points to them. “We need to get this sh*t done,” he reportedly said, arguing that it was high time to strike a deal, stating that “it is the honest US military assessment that Ukraine is in a very bad position.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect additional comments from U.S. senators at the Halifax International Security Forum. U.S. politicians have sent a sharp warning that U.S. President Donald Trump's new peace proposal rewards "Russian butchery" and undermines international security. "Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests," U.S. Trump set Kyiv a Nov. 27 deadline to decide whether to accept the demands or lose the support of its most powerful ally. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine faces "an extremely difficult choice," which would lead to either losing its dignity or risking the loss of a key ally. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, senators said that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them in private conversations that 28-point peace plan does not amount to the actual U.S. plan. They want to utilize it as a starting point," Rounds added. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine." Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said on Nov. 21 that he and his allies have launched a discharge petition "to force a vote on crushing Russian sanctions immediately upon our return." "Today, we have officially notified both the Clerk of the House and House leadership," Fitzpatrick said on X, stressing that "Russian-drafted propaganda must be rejected." Republican Rep. Don Bacon said on Nov. 21 that he would be signing the petition, adding that "Congress needs to inject itself into this appeasement by the Administration towards Russia." "Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world's most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin," Wicker said, adding that "the size and disposition of Ukraine's armed forces is a sovereign choice for its government and people." "In particular, any suggestion that we can pursue arms control with a serial liar and killer like Putin should be treated with great skepticism." Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen also said in an interview with CNN that the U.S. should be putting more pressure on Moscow, such as by putting secondary sanctions on companies helping Russia's war efforts, and providing Ukraine's long-awaited long-range weapons to Kyiv. "This is a Putin plan for Ukraine," Shaheen, the most senior Democrat at the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said on Nov. 21. Asami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering Ukrainian military issues, front-line developments, and politics. She previously worked as a business reporter for the Kyiv Post focusing on international trade, infrastructure, investment, and energy. Originally from Japan, Terajima moved to Ukraine during childhood and completed her bachelor's degree in Business Administration in the U.S. She is the winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation's Kurt Schork Award in International Journalism 2023 (Local Reporter category) and the George Weidenfeld Prize, awarded as part of Germany's Axel Springer Prize 2023. She was also featured in the Media Development Foundation's “25 under 25: Young and Bold” 2023 list of emerging media makers in Ukraine. Secretive talks between the U.S. and Russia left out key White House officials and have been ongoing for weeks, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 23. Search and rescue operations in the western Ukrainian city concluded after four days, with 33 confirmed dead and six people still missing. Ukraine's military reportedly struck the Shatura Thermal Power Plant in Moscow Oblast overnight on Nov. 23, Russian Telegram media channels reported. Members of the pro-Ukrainian partisan group Atesh sabotaged an electric locomotive allegedly used for transporting military cargo in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Atesh claimed on Nov. 23. If President Volodymyr Zelensky refuses to accept the terms of the 28-point-plan, "then he can continue to fight his little heart out," Trump added. "Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests," U.S. Nine Ukrainian officials, including Andriy Yermak, Head of the President's Office, and Kyrylo Budanov, the country's military intelligence chief, are set to attend the meeting, according to a presidential decree published on November 22.
