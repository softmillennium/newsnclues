                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix Both McLaren drivers were disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix result after post-race checks. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have been disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix after both their cars were found not to comply with technical regulations. Post-race, the rearmost skid wear on both McLaren MCL39 machines was found to be below the minimum 9mm thickness by technical delegates on inspection. As a result, race winner Max Verstappen has made a significant gain with regards to the 2025 Drivers' Championship, as the Red Bull man now sits level on points with Oscar Piastri on 366. It was also confirmed that McLaren had argued "mitigating circumstances existed in that there was additional and unexpected porpoising at this event, limited opportunity to test due to the weather on Day 1, and shortened practice sessions." McLaren are not the first team to fall foul of skid block infringements this season, with Lewis Hamilton and Nico Hulkenberg also disqualified from the Chinese and Bahrain Grands Prix respectively for similar transgressions. Norris had started on pole for the 50-lap race in Las Vegas and aggressively moved over on Verstappen off the line before running wide at Turn 1 and slipping to third. Eventually recovering to second, Norris dropped back drastically in the final laps as he was told to lift and coast by his team over a possible fuel concern. "I don't know what the issues were. So that's something I'll go and speak to them about in a bit," said Norris post-race and prior to the disqualification. Piastri, meanwhile, had recovered from dropping to P7 on the opening lap after contact with Liam Lawson into Turn 1, finishing fifth on-the-road but initially moving up a position as Kimi Antonelli was handed a five-second penalty for a false start. "I think first lap was eventful to say the least and then a couple of mistakes after that which didn't help," said Piastri post-race prior to the stewards' decision. "Got stuck behind Kimi, got close on one lap and I lost all grip when I tried to get alongside and I couldn't get close enough again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix Max Verstappen kept himself in title contention with victory in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, while the McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were later disqualified from the results. Max Verstappen claimed an impressive victory in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the Dutchman denying Lando Norris in a race that later saw both Norris and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri disqualified from the results. Norris also slipped behind George Russell and only re-passed the Mercedes driver in the latter stages but was unable to mount a challenge on Verstappen, eventually limping home nearly 21 seconds adrift after nursing a late problem. However, following the race it was confirmed that Norris – along with Piastri, who had originally taken fourth place – had been disqualified due to the rearmost skid wear on both cars being found to be below the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations. This promoted Russell – who had held on for the podium despite complaining of his own issues with his Mercedes' steering – up into P2 ahead of team mate Kimi Antonelli, the Italian having put in a fighting drive to finish fourth on-the-road after starting P17. The rookie had held off a charging Piastri and Charles Leclerc in the closing stages, but a five-second penalty for a false start dropped Antonelli behind Piastri in the classification, just one-tenth ahead of Leclerc who fell back in the final laps. While Piastri originally claimed P4 – having slipped as low as seventh at one stage in the early running after being hit by Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls in the opening turn – the Australian's DSQ, alongside that of his team mate, boosted Charles Leclerc to P4, the Monegasque having made an early charge from P9, with Carlos Sainz completing the top-five having put in a measured drive aboard his Williams from Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls. Lawson was P14 after picking up damage on the second lap which required a pit stop, as Franco Colapinto's Alpine completed the classification of finishers. Alex Albon (Williams) retired having at one stage collided with the back of Hamilton which required a new front wing, while Gabriel Bortoleto (Sauber) and Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) both retired with damage after contact at Turn 1 on the opening lap. There was more significant contact further down in the pack, Bortoleto having sent it up the inside of several cars and eventually into the side of Stroll as both retired due to damage, with the incident earning the Brazilian a five-place grid penalty next time out, while Gasly was also sent into a spin before rejoining. Piastri's fightback was helped on the second lap as Lawson picked up damage and was forced to crawl back to the pits under a VSC, and once full racing speed resumed, Leclerc was on the move, passing Bearman for P7 into Turn 14. Out front, Russell began to challenge Verstappen for the lead of the race and the Mercedes driver found himself in the DRS zone for several laps before Verstappen eked out a margin of just over one second on Lap 8, extending that margin to 1.6s by Lap 11. Norris remained over 2s in arrears but well clear of Sainz, who was starting to be caught by Hadjar, Piastri and Leclerc, with Bearman, Alonso and Hulkenberg, on the hard tyre compared with the medium runners ahead, completing the top-10. Pushing to attack Hadjar ahead, a small lock-up into Turn 12 from Piastri allowed Leclerc a run down the back straight before completing the move into Turn 14 for P6 on Lap 12. It damaged the Williams' front wing and forced Albon to pit for repairs as well as being handed a five-second penalty for the incident. Russell, meanwhile, reported over the radio "steering again" as he dropped to 2s adrift of Verstappen by the start of Lap 15, with Mercedes team mate Antonelli handed a five-second penalty for a false start. The Italian had started outside the points in P17 but had already pitted to replace his soft tyres for hards as a VSC was briefly called to retrieve debris from Albon's front wing on the back straight on Lap 16. Russell pitted on the next tour from P2 for the same compound and rejoined in P7, several seconds behind Hadjar, while Norris, who had closed to within one second of Russell, was told to pick up the pace in free air and now found himself three seconds behind Verstappen. Out front, Verstappen had established a lead of three seconds by Lap 32 from Russell as Norris was quickly closing in behind, with Antonelli adrift in P4 from Piastri, Leclerc, Sainz, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Hamilton. Norris was soon in DRS zone of Russell and told by his engineer to overtake in order to chase Verstappen for the lead, overtaking down the back straight before the brazing zone into Turn 14. The main focus turned to Piastri behind, who was challenging Antonelli for P4 but in turn was also coming under immense pressure from Leclerc. Antonelli's pace had been strong over the final stint, however, and meant he was classified ahead of Leclerc in the order by just one-tenth. Sainz capitalised on his strong Qualifying by finishing fifth, just 4s behind Leclerc and more than 10s clear of Hadjar. They were followed by Hulkenberg and Hamilton, both of whom had optimised their hard-medium strategy. Alonso, whose early pit stop put him down the pecking order, claimed 11th and put him just ahead of Tsunoda, who had started from the pits. Gasly recovered from his Turn 1 spin for P13 from Lawson and Alpine team mate Colapinto, as Albon, Bortoleto and Stroll were classified as retirements. "In the race I think everyone was just trying to find a rhythm and see how much you could push, especially in the first stint because being on the more fragile tyre," said Verstappen. "It worked really well, normally the race is always a tough one for us – we are normally not that great on tyres, but today it seemed like we had that a little bit more under control and I could push a little bit more and that unlocked a bit more pace. "I could stay out a bit longer and split basically the race in half. It definitely helped a lot and the car was working pretty well, much more to my liking and it was at the end quite a decent gap. It was just every lap feeling comfortable and not taking too much out of the tyre." For the next stop in a season-closing triple header of races, F1 will travel straight to Lusail for the Qatar Grand Prix from November 28-30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Russell will start the Las Vegas Grand Prix from fourth but remains confident he can fight for victory. George Russell complained that “some sort of steering issue” hampered his efforts after qualifying on the second row for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver was victorious on the iconic streets 12 months ago, and he topped final practice as well as both Q1 and Q2 this time around amid tricky wet conditions. However, he was unable to replicate that in Q3, eventually setting the fourth fastest time. “Q3 didn't really come together for us, but I actually had some sort of steering issue on the last three laps,” said Russell afterwards. I don't think we'd have been on pole because I didn't have a great feel of the car, but it's kind of quite annoying when it happens. “I was really struggling to turn around the corners. I don't know what the issue was, but it just didn't come together in Q3, when Q1 and Q2 had been pretty solid.” Although the last seven Grands Prix have been won from pole position, Russell is confident of his chances to challenge polesitter Lando Norris for victory and break the cycle. “P4 is obviously not the ideal place, but a lot has happened around this track,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix Carlos Sainz will start from third place in the Las Vegas Grand Prix after a wet Qualifying session. Carlos Sainz believes Williams are "becoming stronger every race" after taking an impressive third-place in a wet Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. It marks Sainz's second best Qualifying performance of the season after he started P2 in Azerbaijan – also on a high-speed, low-downforce circuit – before taking a podium in the race. "I'm always optimistic – dreaming is for free and I always try and think about myself doing well," said Sainz when asked if he expected such pace in the wet, having also avoided a penalty after being investigated for a potential unsafe rejoin in Q1. "On extreme wets I was really quick, on inters I knew maybe the others would catch up a bit, but happy with P3. Williams has proved to be best of the rest this season behind McLaren, Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes, with Sainz admitting that although they remain underdogs the team has become stronger across the campaign. "We are becoming stronger every race, every lap that we do together, and it's great to see them supporting us. I would have loved to give them pole today because that would have been a massive cheer then, but we were just not quite there." I'm surprised we were driving in that weather, to be honest. I think my lap was going to be good. I've been quick all weekend, and that's just how it is sometimes."</p>

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix

Alonso: 'Has been a challenging weekend' after P13 finish

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day in Nevada.

On a wild night in Las Vegas, with rain lashing down, it was Lando Norris who played the best hand, taking his seventh pole of the season, ahead of Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz. So what's on the cards for race day, strategy-wise? Let's take a look at the options…

The pre-race sims suggested a medium>hard one-stop was the fastest way to the chequered flag – but very few attempted it. All 20 drivers had saved two sets of hard tyres for the race, and were determined to use them.

The first nine over the line all ran a medium>hard>hard race, with Sergio Pérez in P10 mixing things up with a hard>medium>hard, in a bid to offset his strategy, and make gains from P15 on the grid.
