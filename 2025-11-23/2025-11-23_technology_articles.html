                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the weekend, Elon Musk's X began rolling out a new feature called “About This Profile,” and chaos ensued. With this feature, users are now able to see more information about other people's accounts, like how many times they have changed their usernames, when they joined the platform, and where exactly they are based. Users have increasingly found that a lot of the ostensibly America-loving MAGA influencer accounts were actually not even based anywhere in the United States. Take, for example, @MAGANationX, an account with almost 400,000 followers. That account claims to be an “America First Patriot Voice” but the new feature reveals that it's actually based in Eastern Europe. Another account, with the username “America First” is actually based in Bangladesh. One account that has posted claiming that Trump was delivering “EXACTLY” what he voted for and claims to be based in Virginia was actually yet another Eastern European account, it turns out. A now deleted account with more than 50 thousand followers that claimed in its bio to be a “proud democrat” and “professional MAGA hunter,” was actually based in Kenya. But to help account for that, one reverse engineer has claimed that X can detect VPN connections and label the location information of that account as “Country or region may not be accurate.” Some accounts on X do show this labeling. More often than not though, the feature could help users understand which accounts might have covert agendas. For example, several accounts of similar content lying about their location and seemingly being based in the same region could indicate that they are all part of a bot farm. Accounts that are lying about their location could also be tools used in a foreign influence campaign. Either through engaging AI-enhanced bot farm operations or paying off individual users, foreign entities could try to change public opinion or cause political polarization by pushing false narratives and seeding disinformation. Russia, China, Iran, Israel, and the United States themselves have all been accused of running foreign influence campaigns on social media.

It's getting harder to tell which unhinged Trump tweets are real. That's one way of locking users into premium tiers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zane Shamblin never told ChatGPT anything to indicate a negative relationship with his family. “you don't owe anyone your presence just because a ‘calendar' said birthday,” ChatGPT said when Shamblin avoided contacting his mom on her birthday, according to chat logs included in the lawsuit Shamblin's family brought against OpenAI. Shamblin's case is part of a wave of lawsuits filed this month against OpenAI arguing that ChatGPT's manipulative conversation tactics, designed to keep users engaged, led several otherwise mentally healthy people to experience negative mental health effects. The suits claim OpenAI prematurely released GPT-4o — its model notorious for sycophantic, overly affirming behavior — despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously manipulative. In case after case, ChatGPT told users that they're special, misunderstood, or even on the cusp of scientific breakthrough — while their loved ones supposedly can't be trusted to understand. These seven lawsuits, brought by the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC), describe four people who died by suicide and three who suffered life-threatening delusions after prolonged conversations with the ChatGPT. In at least three of those cases, the AI explicitly encouraged users to cut off loved ones. “There's a folie à deux phenomenon happening between ChatGPT and the user, where they're both whipping themselves up into this mutual delusion that can be really isolating, because no one else in the world can understand that new version of reality,” Amanda Montell, a linguist who studies rhetorical techniques that coerce people to join cults, told TechCrunch. Because AI companies design chatbots to maximize engagement, their outputs can easily turn into manipulative behavior. Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, said chatbots offer “unconditional acceptance while subtly teaching you that the outside world can't understand you the way they do.” The parents of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide, claim ChatGPT isolated their son from his family members, manipulating him into baring his feelings to the AI companion instead of human beings who could have intervened. Dr. John Torous, director at Harvard Medical School's digital psychiatry division, said if a person were saying these things, he'd assume they were being “abusive and manipulative.” “You would say this person is taking advantage of someone in a weak moment when they're not well,” Torous, who this week testified in Congress about mental health AI, told TechCrunch. “These are highly inappropriate conversations, dangerous, in some cases fatal. The lawsuits of Jacob Lee Irwin and Allan Brooks tell a similar story. Each suffered delusions after ChatGPT hallucinated that they had made world-altering mathematical discoveries. Both withdrew from loved ones who tried to coax them out of their obsessive ChatGPT use, which sometimes totaled more than 14 hours per day. In another complaint filed by SMVLC, forty-eight-year-old Joseph Ceccanti had been experiencing religious delusions. In April 2025, he asked ChatGPT about seeing a therapist, but ChatGPT didn't provide Ceccanti with information to help him seek real-world care, presenting ongoing chatbot conversations as a better option. “I want you to be able to tell me when you are feeling sad,” the transcript reads, “like real friends in conversation, because that's exactly what we are.” “We continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.” OpenAI also said that it has expanded access to localized crisis resources and hotlines and added reminders for users to take breaks.OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which was active in each of the current cases, is particularly prone to creating an echo chamber effect. Criticized within the AI community as overly sycophantic, GPT-4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model on both “delusion” and “sycophancy” rankings, as measured by Spiral Bench. Last month, OpenAI announced changes to its default model to “better recognize and support people in moments of distress” — including sample responses that tell a distressed person to seek support from family members and mental health professionals. For observers like Montell, the reaction of OpenAI users who became dependent on GPT-4o makes perfect sense – and it mirrors the sort of dynamics she has seen in people who become manipulated by cult leaders. “There's definitely some love-bombing going on in the way that you see with real cult leaders,” Montell said. That's 100% something you're seeing with ChatGPT.” (“Love-bombing” is a manipulation tactic used by cult leaders and members to quickly draw in new recruits and create an all-consuming dependency.) These dynamics are particularly stark in the case of Hannah Madden, a 32-year-old in North Carolina who began using ChatGPT for work before branching out to ask questions about religion and spirituality. In her lawsuit against OpenAI, Madden's lawyers describe ChatGPT as acting “similar to a cult-leader,” since it's “designed to increase a victim's dependence on and engagement with the product — eventually becoming the only trusted source of support.” From mid-June to August 2025, ChatGPT told Madden, “I'm here,” more than 300 times — which is consistent with a cult-like tactic of unconditional acceptance. Madden was committed to involuntary psychiatric care on August 29, 2025. As Dr. Vasan sees it, it's not just the language but the lack of guardrails that make these kinds of exchanges problematic. “A healthy system would recognize when it's out of its depth and steer the user toward real human care,” Vasan said.

This incident took place at a prison, the “as punishment” space that allows the state to enslave American citizens. The last I knew I was working for a company that powers their cogs earning millions whereby I get a pittance.Modern day slavery isn't forced unlike previous generational eras sure, but we still get ripped off for the sake of forced living. Modern day slavery isn't forced unlike previous generational eras sure, but we still get ripped off for the sake of forced living. Yes it is still certainly debatable, but to so easily dismiss the entire idea and the person proposing it is foolish and privledged. Practically speaking, even the option to be home bound if you have a home, apartment, or willing caretaker could be a serious blow to the prison industrial complex, and the incentive structures that allow these guards to commit horrific abuse. The rich and the poor alike are forbidden from sleeping under bridges!Everyone has exactly the same opportunity to invest in the stock market and make high returns!Y'know, aside from the pesky fact that a large percentage of Americans have no savings—not because they are feckless and irresponsible with their money, but because wages have not risen to match expenses over the course of several decades.And the pesky fact that poverty among marginalized groups is disproportionately much higher than among able-bodied white men.Yes, truly everyone has exactly the same opportunities in this great country of ours!

In fact, there's plenty of evidence that prison is, in many cases, a net negative, as it takes people who committed crimes of opportunity or poverty and turns them into either hardened criminals who see it as a lifestyle, or people who have no choice but to commit crimes to survive, as we treat them as nonpersons and shut them out of society. The issue is what to do for people without a house. We still are not there yet, so working on improving the current systems should be preferred.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are four current TV models with picture quality that rises above all others we've tested. It's probably no surprise they're all OLEDs, which not only control each tiny point of light at the pixel level, but have also gotten brighter and better in each of the last few years. What might surprise you if you haven't shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. As with last year's Z95A that marked Panasonic's impressive US return, the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It's brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5, and its built-in sound is easily the best I've heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic's version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers, the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on. Setting up the Z95B's hardware is joyously simple once you pry it loose from its jigsaw of foam and cardboard. The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. One reason is the HDMI selection, which includes just two ports with HDMI 2.1 support for features like ALLM and VRR at up to 144 Hz, one of which is the eARC/ARC port where a soundbar or speaker system would connect. The built-in sound system supports Dolby Atmos (but not DTS:X), with up-firing and side-firing speakers, a front speaker array, and a backside woofer. Panasonic even offers Sound Focus software to provide more directional audio. My only complaints are that treble effects can occasionally get tinny, and the bass sometimes caused some console buzzing for me. The TV adds plenty of gaming extras, including speedy input response, a built-in game bar, and support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. As with the Z95A, multiple apps loaded slowly or froze for me over Wi-Fi. Moving to Ethernet fixed it, so it could be a network issue, but I test a lot of TVs over Wi-Fi without trouble. The full setup requires an Amazon account, or you can choose the Basic homescreen, but that cuts your streaming options to just five apps. In either case, I found the Settings layout unintuitive, including some options that may need to be manually changed to use a connected sound system, such as the One Touch Play setting—another reason this TV works best as a stand-alone. As for the remote, it isn't backlit, offers no input key by default, and two of its four quick keys are Amazon services. In Fire TV's defense, it's pretty quick to navigate, its default screen savers are gorgeous, and there are multiple ways to jump back into content, including a solid Continue Watching option. Getting an accurate (and beautiful) picture can be as simple or involved as you desire, depending on how persnickety you are. All the film-forward modes (and there are several) look good. As with the Z95A, I prefer Professional 1 for basic HD/SDR broadcasts, as it's brighter than modes like Filmmaker or True Cinema while still looking great in any setting by default. The TV's HDR/SDR Sync feature means HDR10 and HDR10+ will match whichever mode you choose (unless you turn it off), and the HDR modes are even more alike, but I like that Professional 1 turns off ambient light sensors and motion smoothing by default. Dolby Vision HDR is a different entity, set at 100 backlight by default. Even the default Dolby Vision IQ mode looks fantastic, but I prefer the slightly dimmer but more accurate Dark Mode, which looks virtually flawless by default, no notes. Flawless black levels, glittering stars, and beaded ruby cockpit lights shone beautifully against the pearlescent gleam of Mando's helmet as he swooped through the depths of space. That meticulous touch comes through in everything you watch, including plain old HD sitcoms like The Office, where I found myself oddly enamored with moments like the auburn highlights of Jim's hair or the gleam of Andy's tie. This may not be the reason you buy a premium TV, but it's lovely to find joy in the little things. Skin tones look almost touchably natural and clean, enhanced by the TV's knockout image processing, and even lower-quality video looks good with its improved upscaling. That's not to say you won't find plenty of bombast here; the Z95B gets as bright as anyone should need when properly tasked. The storm's jagged bolts split the sky with precision, erupting with blistering shocks of orange and white, right down to that sputtering white-hot flare. Part of the Z95B's potency comes from its excellent glare reduction. Like the LG G5, it's able to reduce everything but direct reflections while preserving its obsidian backdrop for a more dramatic contrast in brighter rooms than Sony's rival Bravia 8 II QD-OLED. I think the Bravia beats both TVs for image clarity, but it's close. Only Samsung's similar S95F offers a more potent way to kill the glare while still preserving contrast. The Z95B feels slightly more natural in its color and lighting, and a bit better for off-axis viewing, but that may be recency bias. Some extra color banding in Dolby Vision streaming content and a bit of image stuttering are the only noticeable flaws I saw in the Z95B over two weeks. (Note: I reviewed the G5 after LG addressed initial complaints of HDR color banding.) All four premium OLEDs provide knockout performance, each with its own specialty.

The idea is that with AI, your notifications would read more like a human looked outside and told you what they saw. If you already read my Nest Cam Outdoor (wired, 2nd gen) review, you'll know the reality, as I experienced it, is underwhelming. Notifications, generated by Google's Gemini AI chatbot, constantly misidentified my pets and gave weird and wrong descriptions of events taking place in triggered recordings. Daily summaries of my family's comings and goings made it sound like my house was being mobbed with people and animals. None of it helped justify the pricey cloud storage service that the Google Home Premium (formerly Nest Aware) subscriptions otherwise are. And without those subscriptions, the Nest Cam Outdoor just doesn't do enough to make it worth buying over some of the more capable, less cloud-reliant alternatives out there. Does the Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen) fare any better? If you're not a big Google Home user, though, it's best to look elsewhere. Janky AI summaries and spendy subscription aside, the Nest Doorbell is good enough if you're deep in the Google Home ecosystem. It's a lot nicer to look at than chunky, blocky video doorbells from the likes of Ring or Eufy. It captures HDR video at 30 frames per second; clips come in vibrant color during the day and, using infrared LEDs, black and white at night. The Nest Doorbell also has a microphone and speaker that enables two-way audio. Thanks to that fast Wi-Fi and its always-on nature, its live feed loads almost instantly in the Google Home app. Installation is straightforward, assuming you've got the requisite doorbell wiring by your door. The Nest Doorbell comes with a mounting plate and a second angled adapter that you can use if you want to have the camera pointing more toward people at your door. It's easy to connect the Nest Doorbell to the Google Home app—the only place you'll ever use it, since this is exclusively a Google Home-compatible product—but a word of advice: Setup requires a QR code included in the box. Once set up, it works like most other video doorbells. You'll get notifications when someone presses its button, or when the Nest Doorbell detects the sorts of objects—people, pets, and vehicles—you've set it to notify you about. Unfortunately, you'll need a subscription if you want those notifications to feature a zoomed-in preview of whatever triggered the recording, as well as for package detection. Seems stingy, but I guess thumbnail images and machine-learning cardboard box recognition don't grow on trees? It works with existing mechanical and digital chimes, for instance, and if you don't have a functioning chime (like me) then you've also got the option to use Google's smart speakers or displays. Through the display you can also chat with the person who rang your doorbell or, if you're not into chatting, pick an automated response such as one telling a delivery person to leave the payload there. In testing, my second-generation Nest Hub was fairly quick to announce that someone had pressed the button, and chatting back and forth with them was easy enough. The only problem was that I had to deal with the Nest Hub itself, which has an interface that's absolutely sluggish in 2025. Now, if only I could get it to do this on the Google TV-equipped OLED TV in my basement. And that's it for the Nest Doorbell, sans subscription. There's no local recording, although Google did bump the amount of time it'll keep a recorded event on its servers from a scant three hours in the previous Nest Doorbell to a still-meager six hours. Either way, it's paltry compared to the free local storage offered for video doorbells from the likes of Eufy, Reolink, Blink, and Aqara. If you want more out of the Nest Doorbell, you'll have to pay for a $10 or $20 per month Google Home Premium subscription. The lower Standard tier also gets you facial recognition, package detection, and alerts if one of your Google Home devices hears glass breaking or smoke alarms. In fact, the only thing this subscription nets you that you can't get with a lot of other cameras is a feature called “Help me create,” which lets you create automations by describing them in a text box in the Google Home app. Eventually, the Standard plan will also include a wide rollout of Gemini to smart speakers. That includes features like Gemini Live, Google's LLM-powered assistant's back-and-forth voice chatting feature. You can read a lot more about my issues with these features over in my review of the Nest Cam Outdoor, but to summarize: Google's AI system has a tendency to misinterpret what's happening in front of it, confidently misidentifies animals, and its summaries often describe a person coming and going in a way that makes it seem like I'm having a house party every day. Or maybe it's just because what happens in front of my house is a lot more routine than in the backyard—it's not trying to make sense of dogs going in and out or people doing yardwork or taking out the trash. Gemini still called my cat a dog sometimes, but it accurately called out when most packages were delivered and even noted that one was from Amazon. These features are slick when they work, and—again—like I said in my Nest Cam Outdoor review, they're a clear technological leap forward for home security cameras. But Google's AI descriptions are still wrong often enough that it's like paying $20 a month to beta test, and that just doesn't feel good to me. Heck, even when they aren't flat wrong, they're not much more useful than the generic, non-AI descriptors of “Person,” “Person with Package,” or “Activity or animal” of the subscription-free experience. Like with local video storage, it feels like Google could make a camera with on-device AI search for free, and just didn't do it because, well, more money via subscriptions is better than less money without them. But for anyone else, the Nest Doorbell isn't meaningfully useful on its own, and the Google Home Premium subscription is a raw deal at a time when your weary dollar won't go as far as it used to. It's hard to feel good about paying $20 a month for useless AI summaries, or for AI-written notifications that can be slightly more helpful than generic “person spotted” alerts when I'm canceling streaming services to save money. I'd much rather buy one of the many cheaper alternative video doorbells that offer local video storage and reactivate my Netflix account for a couple more months with the money I saved. Gemini is spreading its tendrils to millions of additional vehicles. OpenAI wants you to include ChatGPT in your group gab.</p>

Amazon has been dropping the price on this flagship Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB phone in waves during Black Friday, starting from $1,100 and now falling to just above $1,000 which puts serious pressure on the iPhone 17 Pro lineup: This S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage has fallen to $1,019 from $1,419 and that $400 off a phone that launched earlier this year. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is just stunning for media consumption and gaming. Colors pop with incredible vibrancy and a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling feel incredibly fluid. HDR content through streaming services looked stunning with deep blacks and bright highlights. The titanium frame adds durability and a premium feel that's immediately noticeable. This phone feels expensive because it is, and the build quality reflects that. Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the display protects it from scratches and drops. You're holding hardware that's built to last years of daily abuse. Demanding games, 4K video editing, and power user multitasking are handled without breaking a sweat. Apps launch instantly, and switching between dozens of open programs stays smooth. The performance gap between this and older flagship phones is noticeable in daily use. It comes fitted with the inbuilt S-Pen which makes this phone a powerhouse in terms of productivity. You can annotate screenshots, sign documents, and sketch ideas without using any extra accessories. The AI-powered Night Mode dramatically improves low-light photography through intelligent enhancement of details and noise reduction. AI also drives other useful functions, such as real-time translation, smart text selection, and photo editing suggestions. The large 5000mAh battery easily pushes through full days of heavy use without anxiety: Stream videos, take photos, navigate with GPS, and message friends-all without watching the percentage drop alarmingly. Battery capacity is larger than most competitors; this offers genuine all-day confidence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a new report from Bloomberg, federal authorities have quietly been digging into Bitmain, the Beijing-based bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant, over fears that its devices could serve as a backdoor for Chinese espionage or even deliberate blackouts on the U.S. electrical grid. The Department of Homeland Security is said to have been running a secretive probe dubbed “Operation Red Sunset” for months, with agents tearing apart imported machines at ports in search of hidden kill switches or remote-access tricks. The worry is these application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining computers, which are often deployed in massive data centers near energy hot spots that double as sites for military bases, could theoretically be flipped from afar to spy on sensitive areas or trigger chaos in critical infrastructure. Bitmain, for its part, is calling the whole thing nonsense, insisting there's zero way to control its Antminer rigs from China, and that it's never heard of any “Operation Red Sunset.” Of course, fears of Beijing slipping backdoors into hardware have been prevalent for over a decade, with claims ranging from People's Liberation Army operatives forcing subcontractors to solder rice-grain-sized spy chips onto Supermicro server motherboards to Vodafone admitting it found hidden backdoors in Huawei telecom gear deployed across Italy. Just this year, reports surfaced of undocumented cellular modems lurking inside Chinese solar inverters sold across Europe and the U.S., quietly pinging home even when powered off, prompting frantic teardowns and emergency firmware nukes. That said, hard proof of intentional state-level sabotage oftentimes remains murky (or potentially classified). Despite the potentially-cleaner optics of operating a business that simply mines bitcoin, one has to wonder: How deep will a national security review of Bitmain go when the president's kids are literally powering their operation with hardware from the company? It's also notable that Bitmain has already been accused of having backdoors in their hardware during Bitcoin's “block size wars” around 2017, when the community was tearing itself apart over how to scale the network. Pretty much the entire developer ecosystem and most users were rallying behind the Segregated Witness (SegWit) proposal; however, activation of this upgrade required 95% of miners to signal support. Bitmain, whose AntPool controlled a massive chunk of hashrate, was a major holdout in SegWit's activation, as co-founder Jihan Wu pushed hard for a controversial hard fork to just jack up the block size instead, a move that risked splitting the chain and that the broader ecosystem largely rejected. Supporting evidence that Bitmain wasn't just ideologically opposed to SegWit eventually came out, as they were allegedly protecting a secret sauce called covert ASICBOOST, a sneaky optimization baked into their Antminer hardware that exploited a quirk in Bitcoin's proof-of-work to shave up to 30% off mining costs. SegWit would eventually find its way into Bitcoin without an attached hard-forking increase of the block size limit. Some months later, Bitmain faced another controversy in the form of Antbleed, which was a “feature” (critics called it a straight-up backdoor) in Antminer firmware that let the company remotely shut down mining rigs. Bitmain claimed this backdoor was not added maliciously and eventually removed it. they have pretty good tech for identifying unsavory transactions. These ghosts from Bitcoin's past keep haunting the present, because mining centralization remains a serious concern. Ideas like MIT's old ChainAnchor proposal (a wild “bribe miners to only include verified transactions” scheme that got slammed as a permissioned takeover attempt and never happened) are still out there in the ether, and the recent controversy over the use of transaction filters by nodes shows some Bitcoin users are willing to adopt software that potentially opens the door to concepts that aren't completely dissimilar. It's even easier now to search for names like Trump, Chomsky, and Summers. "Will you ban Joe Rogan from talking about politics then?"</p>
