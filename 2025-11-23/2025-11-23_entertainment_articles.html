                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessie J knows how to dominate the stage while she's performing, and there's no doubt that she also knows how to stand out on the red carpet. That's what she did on Thursday, November 20, when she showed up at the Rolling Stone UK Awards 2025 at The Roundhouse in London. She also opted for hoop earrings, which could be seen thanks to the fact that she wore her hair up and slicked back. If you can never predict what Jessie J will look like when she shows up at an industry event, there's a reason for that. Back in April 2012, Glamour asked the star, “You must have a great time being creative with your look. Is it fun to get ready for big events?” She then admitted, “The process isn't always as fun, depending if my eyelashes want to stick or not.” While Jessie J likes to switch up her style, she also embraces a wide range of looks. “I'm just having fun with my style, and like, exploring stuff as I've got more confident as a young woman,” she told Elle UK in September 2012. “Everything for me has no boundaries, it's all about taking risks,” she added. She explained, “You always want to make sure that you're exploring yourself and discovering different layers of your personality and your look.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After cutting his tour short last year due to health struggles, Donald Glover returned to the Camp Flog Gnaw stage this weekend with an update. On Saturday, the artist formerly known as Childish Gambino revealed that he suffered a stroke before postponing his The New World Tour last September, noting at the time that he planned to “focus on my physical health for a few weeks.” I was having lots of fun, really loving seeing you guys out there,” he explained to the crowd during the concert, which live-streamed on Amazon Music. “And I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana, and I did the show anyway. I couldn't really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke. Glover continued, “And The first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx.' The first thing was like, ‘I'm letting everybody down.' A month after postponing the tour, Glover cancelled the remainder, noting that he had to undergo surgery and needed “time out to heal.” Donald Glover has always been one of my favorite artists & celebs in general. Knowin he had a stroke is wow, glad you are okay❤️ @donaldglover  pic.twitter.com/Rl8UQY1Z4i … and they found a hole in my heart,” added Glover on Saturday. And I've gotta be honest, the life I've lived with you guys has been such a blessing. I love seeing and performing for you guys.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carly Waddell recently changed her hair after ending her engagement to Todd Allen Tressler — although she claimed the new ‘do wasn't breakup hair! At the time, she added a few brown strands into her primarily blonde mane. Now, she's changed things up again, but this time in a dramatic way. Taking to Instagram on Saturday, November 22, Carly shared a video that showed off her new look. She added text, saying, “Anyone else do anything crazy the first day of their period…?” From there, the camera angle changes to show Carly with a bold new hair color. Still boasting her long strands, she now has a dark brown mane. Granted, she made this particular move for a very good reason. In the caption of her Instagram post, she wrote, “Feeling a little stuck lately. “So I impulsively died my hair, and impulsively traded in my car for the one I've always wanted this week,” she added. “Started grounding in the earth and mediating when I can.” “Sometimes being a mom, or woman in general is weird because u just pay attention to everyone else but yourself, but I decided lately that I deserve that attention too,” she continued. Along with plenty of emojis making it clear that Carly had made a wise choice when opting for the dark brown shade, the messages seemed to agree. 🔥 That is your colour,” yet another fan of Carly's look wrote. Someone else commented, saying, “Your hair looks beautiful, but I really want to know the car you bought. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

It earned rave exit numbers on Comscore; kids in particular were enthralled. A Comprehensive List of 'Wicked' and 'Wicked: For Good' Brand Collaborations 'Wicked: For Good' Zooms to Huge $30.8 Million in Box Office Previews The cast also includes Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Yeoh. Lilo & Stitch, opening over Memorial Day, collected $147 million for the three-day weekend and $182.6 million for the four-day holiday frame. Chu's film likewise passed up Wicked overseas to rank as the top launch ever for a Broadway adaptation. Lastly, it passed up Superman to become the fourth-biggest, three-day opening of the year to date behind Jurassic World Rebirth, Minecraft and Lilo & Stitch. Other records: Imax ponied up $21.1 million of the bottom line, including $15.5 million domestically to rank as the biggest start ever for a November family friendly title. Wicked: For Good is a needed jolt for the struggling North American box office in particular, which has suffered the worst fall in decades due to a glut of male-skewing pics and a lack of product for females and families. The movie's better-than-expected performance more than proves the buying power of girls and women; nearly 70 percent of audience were females. On the same weekend a year ago, the first Wicked likewise made history in its debut on its way to grossing nearly $750 million globally, a record showing for a Broadway musical adaptation. Such adaptations have been a tough genre for Hollywood to crack, but NBCUniversal entertainment chief and longtime movie studio head Donna Langley has remained intent on doing just that, even after Cats bombed. Elsewhere, Searchlight opened the Brendon Fraser-led specialty dramedy Rental Family nationwide in 1,925 theaters. The critical and audience darling grossed an estimated $3.3 million to place fifth and become the latest adult drama to struggle, but Searchlight is hopeful it will have staying power over the lucrative Thanksgiving corridor. The holiday feast will became even more crowded on Wednesday when Zootopia yaps its way into cinemas. Disney and 20th Century's Predator: Badlands rebounded to come in third with $6.3 million from 3,100 locations for a three-week domestic total of $76.3 million. Paramount's troubled The Running Man tumbled 65 percent in its second outing to $5.8 million from 3,534 theaters for a 10-day domestic total of $27 million and fourth-place finish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six months after “American Idol” season 21 winner Iam Tongi wowed fans by revealing his 115-pound weight loss, it's clear the Hawaii native has continued to focus on his health. On November 18, 2025, Tongi was in New York for a joint party to celebrate the 75th anniversaries of King's Hawaiian and the Bing Crosby Estate, which collaborated with the singer on his new single — a duet with the late, legendary crooner on his holiday classic “Mele Kalikimaka.” Tongi looked happy and healthy as he posed for photos at the event. Tongi was 18 when he won “American Idol,” signed up to audition by his mom just months after his dad died from kidney disease. The teen had little hope he'd make it far on the show, telling People, “I had a bad attitude in the beginning because I felt like there was no reason for me to come on. They were just going to say that I was not good enough. In the two-and-a-half years since becoming the first Pacific Islander to win “American Idol,” Tongi has moved to Nashville, found love with his girlfriend Leah, toured the world, and released new music, including his hit remake of “Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride” for the “Lilo & Stitch” movie released in May 2025. But fans frequently commented on Tongi's social media posts about how worried they were about his weight, urging him to prioritize his health. In March 2025, Tongi revealed on social media that he had been working hard behind the scenes with a trainer to do just that. In May, he told People, “We have a workout session maybe around 11, come back [home], and we go to an ice bath or sauna … or whatever it is. Even “American Idol” mentor Jelly Roll, who has shed over 200 pounds, commented on one of Tongi's workout posts in May, “So inspired by you” And that's why he's the trainer, he knows me better than me 🤣 and after about 10 miles and falling twice 😂 I can say today I struggled but I had so much fun hitting this milestone of riding a bike again after almost 8 years. In a social media post about the song collaboration on November 22, Tongi wrote, “I'm super humbled and so grateful to share my new 2-song EP, created in partnership with the Bing Crosby Estate to celebrate 75 years of Bing's classic ‘Mele Kalikimaka. He continued, “It means a lot to bring this song home with my own cover of “Mele Kalikimaka” (Bing Crosby 75th Anniversary Edition), and even more to get to sing a special duet version with @bingcrosby's original vocals.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Bynes denied the wild rumor that disgraced Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider got her pregnant when she was 13. The “Amanda Show” alum told TMZ that the viral video of her claiming Schneider impregnated her is digitally altered. Bynes, now 39, also told the outlet that whoever made the edited clip attempted to make up “lies for clickbait.” I'm sorry for not making your childhood happy again,” was written atop the video. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Page Six has reached out to Schneider for comment but did not immediately hear back. In last year's “Quiet on the Set” doc, several former Nickelodeon stars claimed that Schneider allegedly fostered a toxic work environment and tormented and humiliated the cast and crew on his TV sets. The “iCarly” creator denied the allegations but said he owed people a “strong apology” for his “embarrassing” past actions. In May 2024, Schneider filed a lawsuit against the documentary producers and creators for implying he sexually abused Nickelodeon child stars. Nickelodeon cut ties with Schneider in 2018 amid reports he was “under a cloud of suspicion over the treatment of some younger stars of his shows.” The producer walked away with a $7 million payout.

Kravitz is midway through his Australian run, which continues Tues., Nov. 25 at Melbourne's John Cain Arena before heading to Mildura on Nov. 28 and Adelaide on Nov. 29. That visit was itself many years in the making, with his only other visits to the country taking place in 1993 and 1994. “Coming to New Zealand for the first time and returning to Australia after so many years is giving my soul the most beautiful energy,” Kravitz wrote in an Instagram post on Nov. 21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators trying to determine Celeste Rivas' cause of death were clear from the start that the 14-year-old girl's remains were “severely decomposed” when found hidden in singer D4vd's Tesla in September. It wasn't immediately clear how freezing or refrigeration might play into a final ruling, but it could make pinpointing a date of death much more difficult. Rolling Stone reached out to the Los Angeles Police Department for comment. According to the outlet, Rivas' head was severed and her limbs were “cut into multiple pieces.” The cause of death “will most likely be ‘undetermined,'” TMZ reported. Earlier this week, sources told NBC News and ABC7 that D4vd is now considered a suspect in the death of Rivas. The platinum-selling singer, born David Anthony Burke, has not been charged with any crime, and his lawyer has not responded to multiple requests for comment. The girl's body was found after staff at a tow yard in Hollywood reported that the vehicle was “emanating a foul odor and attracting flies,” according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by Rolling Stone. Rivas, who would have turned 15 years old the day before she was discovered, had been reported missing by her family on multiple occasions in 2024, according to online missing person fliers. Neighbors there previously told Rolling Stone that it had been seen in various locations around the neighborhood as far back as May.

Burke, 20, has not commented publicly on the teen's death. The rest of his tour was later canceled, and fashion companies Crocs and Hollister pulled back on a campaign that featured Burke modeling a collaboration between the popular brands.
