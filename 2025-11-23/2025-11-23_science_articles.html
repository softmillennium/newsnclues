                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer biology, drug safety studies and aging research may all benefit from a fluorescent sensor created at Utrecht University. This development, described in Nature Communications, enables types of experiments that were not previously possible. DNA in our cells faces continual harm from sunlight, chemicals, radiation and even the normal processes that keep the body functioning. When these repairs fail, the resulting errors can play a role in aging, cancer and several other diseases. For years, researchers struggled to directly observe these repair events as they occurred. Many traditional approaches required killing and preserving cells at different time points, producing only isolated snapshots instead of a continuous view. Scientists at Utrecht University have now introduced a sensor that changes this situation. According to the study published in Nature Communications, this capability opens the way to experiments that were previously out of reach. He notes that common tools such as antibodies and nanobodies often bind too tightly to DNA, which can interfere with the cell's own repair systems. The system relies on a fluorescent tag attached to a small domain taken from one of the cell's own proteins. This domain briefly recognizes a marker that appears only on damaged DNA. "I was testing some drugs and saw the sensor lighting up exactly where commercial antibodies did," he says. "That was the moment I thought: this is going to work." Instead of running many separate experiments to capture different moments, researchers can now watch the entire repair sequence as a single continuous movie. "You get more data, higher resolution and, importantly, a more realistic picture of what actually happens inside a living cell," says Cardoso Da Silva. It can be used as well in real living organisms." Researchers can also reposition damaged DNA inside the nucleus to test how its location influences repair. Although the sensor is not a treatment, it could significantly improve medical research. Many cancer therapies work by inflicting deliberate DNA damage on tumor cells, and early drug development often requires precise measurements of how much damage a compound creates. "Right now, clinical researchers often use antibodies to assess this," Baubec says. "Our tool could make these tests cheaper, faster and more accurate." The team also sees potential uses in clinical settings, such as studying natural aging or detecting exposure to radiation or other mutagenic factors. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have identified a natural process in the brain that can remove existing amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease while also helping preserve memory and thinking ability. This process relies on astrocytes, star shaped support cells, which can be guided to clear out the toxic plaque buildup commonly seen in Alzheimer's. The findings, reported in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that strengthening astrocyte activity could one day help slow cognitive decline linked to neurodegenerative disorders. For this project, the investigators set out to understand how astrocytes change with age and how those changes relate to Alzheimer's disease. "An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain," Choi said. "We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form." In these models, the researchers either increased or removed Sox9 and then monitored each mouse's cognitive performance for six months. During this period, the animals were tested on their ability to recognize familiar objects and locations. "We found that increasing Sox9 expression triggered astrocytes to ingest more amyloid plaques, clearing them from the brain like a vacuum cleaner," Deneen said. "Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques. This study suggests that enhancing astrocytes' natural ability to clean up could be just as important." Choi, Deneen and their colleagues note that additional research is needed to understand how Sox9 behaves in the human brain across time. Still, these results point toward the possibility of developing therapies that harness astrocytes' natural cleaning abilities to combat neurodegenerative disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international group of physicists, including scientists from Washington University in St. Louis, has gathered new measurements that shed light on how black holes draw in surrounding material and release tremendous amounts of radiation and energy. By studying how this light is polarized, scientists can gain valuable clues about the shape and behavior of the extremely hot gas and debris swirling around black holes at extreme speeds. The publication includes contributions from many WashU researchers, including graduate student Ephraim Gau and postdoctoral research associate Kun Hu, who served as corresponding authors. "Polarization is thus useful for learning about all the stuff happening around the black hole when we can't take normal pictures from Earth." "Collaborating with colleagues at WashU, as well as other groups in the U.S. and Japan, on XL-Calibur has been extremely rewarding," said Mark Pearce, an XL-Calibur collaborator and a professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. "Our observations of Crab and Cyg X-1 clearly show that the XL-Calibur design is sound. I very much hope that we can now build on these successes with new balloon flights." By expanding the range of objects studied, researchers hope to create a more complete picture of how matter behaves in these extreme environments. XL-Calibur is supported by a broad collaboration of institutions, including WashU, the University of New Hampshire, Osaka University, Hiroshima University, ISAS/JAXA, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and Goddard Space Flight Center (and Wallops Flight Facility), as well as 13 additional research organizations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of California, Irvine astronomers have identified an exoplanet located within a star's habitable zone, a region where temperatures could allow liquid water to exist on the surface. Liquid water is considered essential for every form of life currently known. "We have found so many exoplanets at this point that discovering a new one is not such a big deal," said co-author Paul Robertson, UC Irvine associate professor of physics & astronomy. These variations can imitate the subtle radial velocity signals astronomers look for, sometimes making it difficult to determine whether a planet is truly present. Even so, the planet's close distance to Earth makes it a strong candidate for direct imaging using the University of California's Thirty Meter Telescope, which is currently under development. The large mirrors planned for TMT could make it possible to directly observe faint worlds such as GJ 251 c and assess whether water may be present. "TMT will be the only telescope with sufficient resolution to image exoplanets like this one. It's just not possible with smaller telescopes," said Corey Beard, Ph.D., data scientist at Design West Technologies, former graduate student from Robertson's group, and lead author of the study. The research team detected GJ 251 c using data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and NEID -- two precision instruments designed for identifying exoplanets, both of which Robertson helped develop. These tools measure the tiny influences an orbiting planet has on its star. HPF recorded these shifts, known as radial velocity signatures, and astronomers used them to confirm that the star is being influenced by an orbiting planet. The team's computational models reached a strong enough level of statistical significance to classify GJ 251 c as an exoplanet candidate, reinforcing the need for direct imaging with TMT to verify its properties. "We are at the cutting edge of technology and analysis methods with this system," said Beard. Beard and Robertson hope their findings will encourage the exoplanet research community to conduct additional studies of GJ 251 c, especially as new ground-based observatories such as the Thirty Meter Telescope move closer to operational status.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These powerful events rarely occur, typically appearing only once every 20-25 years. On May 10-11, 2024, Earth was hit by the strongest event of this kind in more than two decades, known as the Gannon storm or Mother's Day storm. A research effort led by Dr. Atsuki Shinbori of Nagoya University's Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research gathered direct observations during the storm and produced the first detailed view of how such an event squeezes Earth's plasmasphere (a protective region of charged particles surrounding the planet). Monitoring both layers showed us how dramatically the plasmasphere contracted and why recovery took so long," Dr. Shinbori explained. The plasmasphere works with Earth's magnetic field to help block harmful charged particles from the Sun and deep space, offering natural protection for satellites and other technology. Under normal conditions, this region stretches far from Earth, but the May storm forced its outer edge inward from about 44,000 km above the surface to only 9,600 km. Within just nine hours, the plasmasphere was compressed to roughly one-fifth of its usual size. Its recovery was unusually slow, requiring more than four days to refill, which is the longest recovery time recorded since Arase began monitoring the region in 2017. This prolonged disruption can affect GPS accuracy, interfere with satellite operations, and complicate space weather forecasting," Dr. Shinbori noted. As a result, vivid auroras appeared in places that rarely experience them. This storm was powerful enough to shift the auroral zone far beyond its usual location near the Arctic and Antarctic circles, producing displays in mid-latitude regions such as Japan, Mexico, and southern Europe -- areas where auroras are seldom seen. Stronger geomagnetic storms allow the lights to reach increasingly equatorial regions. This reduces oxygen ions that help create hydrogen particles needed to restore the plasmasphere. Negative storms are invisible and can only be detected using satellites. This link between negative storms and delayed recovery had never been clearly observed before," Dr. Shinbori said. Several satellites experienced electrical problems or stopped transmitting data during the event, GPS signals became less accurate, and radio communications were disrupted. Knowing how long Earth's plasma layer takes to recover from such disturbances is essential for predicting future space weather and for protecting the technology that relies on stable conditions in near-Earth space.
