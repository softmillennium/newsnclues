                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City and Manchester United have entered a fierce battle to sign Burkina Faso sensation Mohamed Zongo, the 15-year-old attacking midfielder who dazzled at the U17 World Cup. Both clubs have already held talks with the Tenakourou Academy as Europe's elite begin circling for a prodigy who produced goals, assists and man-of-the-match displays to lead Burkina Faso to the quarter-finals. City and United have both made formal approaches to the Tenakourou Academy as interest intensifies in Burkina Faso wonderkid Zongo as per Africa Foot. City and United held discussions with his academy as recently as Friday, joining Villarreal and Anderlecht in assessing the rising talent. Clubs are now evaluating potential development pathways and financial proposals, but his current academy has not yet committed to any agreement. All options remain open as interest grows, with both Manchester clubs determined not to miss out on a rare profile in the age group. With no deal close and the player still developing domestically, the race has entered an early scouting and negotiation phase rather than a formal bidding stage. Zongo's emergence comes at a time when both Manchester clubs are aggressively expanding their youth recruitment networks. Manchester City, who have built a reputation for signing elite young talent worldwide, view Zongo as another high-upside midfielder who could either break into their first team or generate long-term value within their City Football Group model. His combination of creativity, drive and defensive intelligence aligns with their emphasis on multi-functional, technically strong academy players. United, meanwhile, are undergoing a structural rebuild under INEOS and see youth recruitment as central to restoring the club's identity. 10, box-to-box midfielder or wide playmaker fits well within Ruben Amorim's long-term system, which values intelligence, mobility and ball-carrying ability. Losing a talent like Zongo to their city rivals would be viewed as a major missed opportunity, particularly given his growing reputation as a “next-gen Yaya Toure” based on his physical maturity and all-round influence. His development at the Tenakourou Academy has been tracked closely by scouts, who have highlighted his comfort in multiple roles across midfield. He has been praised for his game awareness, work rate and ability to take responsibility in high-pressure knockout matches, which is rare for a player at just 15. Manchester City and Manchester United are expected to continue discussions with the Tenakourou Academy in the coming weeks as they refine their proposals. Both clubs will present detailed development plans, outlining how Zongo would be integrated, whether through academy progression, loan pathways or targeted mentorship. With no agreement yet in place, the next stage will revolve around establishing which environment best suits his long-term growth. European interest from Villarreal and Anderlecht also ensures the Manchester clubs cannot afford to hesitate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso has been backed to manage Liverpool one day but the pundit making the suggestion does not believe Arne Slot's job at Anfield is under threat. The Reds tried to bring the Spaniard to Merseyside after news of Jurgen Klopp's impending exit was announced in 2024. While he stayed at Bayer Leverkusen before joining Madrid this year, an old team-mate of his thinks a Reds return is possible. Al-Ahli head coach and former Liverpool player Igor Biscan can see Alonso heading to the Premier League side one day. Speaking to BOYLE Sports, Biscan, who played with the Spaniard at Anfield in 2004-5, said: "Xabi Alonso as Liverpool manager? Whenever you watch his teams, they are doing so well, they have a clear structure, and the quality is always there. Who wouldn't want to have a manager like him?" Following Liverpool's humbling 3-0 loss at home to Nottingham Forest on Saturday, question marks have been raised about Slot's future at the club amid a run of six defeats in their last seven games. Moreover, Biscan thinks the Dutchman needs more time to right this ship. I don't think his job is in question. Even if he doesn't win the league, just by doing what he did last year, after what happened before he arrived and how difficult his job was, it was exceptional. Everybody was saying it would be extremely difficult for him to really continue what Jurgen Klopp had done before him. There are so many new players, and you need time to make them work together. I'm really sure that they will start winning again very soon." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Despite their wretched run, which has left them 11th in the table, Biscan thinks Liverpool can still mount a title challenge. While they are eight points behind league leaders Arsenal, which could stretch to 11 if the Gunners beat Tottenham on Sunday, bigger deficits have been clawed back in the past. Now they will have a run of games which, at least on paper, should be easier. Hopefully, if they can win a few in a row, I think they will be back in the title race." The former defender also thinks Alexander Isak, who has struggled since his big-money move from Newcastle United, can come good, too. And yeah, he missed pre-season and then the lack of match fitness, sharpness, for sure, takes away a bit of your ability. But it's the same situation like what we said about Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk, you know, the quality is there. It's just a matter of time before he starts scoring. It's just a matter of getting into the right rhythm, scoring some goals, and then again, a little bit of this momentum back. While things are looking bleak for Liverpool right now, fortunes can change very quickly in football, just as Slot's side have shown for the worse in recent weeks. The Reds, who were top of the table earlier on this season, return to Champions League action on Wednesday at home to PSV Eindhoven. A victory there could give them confidence heading into winnable games against West Ham, Sunderland, and Leeds United.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get the latest breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox. 23 November 2025 - Florentino Pérez's reported remarks tap into one of football's biggest tensions: who really benefits from the modern game's money fans, players and clubs, or governing bodies and executives. Pérez's central claim is that fans should be able to watch football for free, positioning this as both a moral argument and a strategic vision for the sport's future. The idea of universally free-to-air football challenges that business model and instead imagines a system where global reach, sponsorship and technology replace paywalls as the main drivers of income. Pérez's thanks to FIFA over the Club World Cup reflect his view that the revamped tournament, with broad free access in many territories, represents a step toward this “football for all” model. In his public comments, he has framed the competition as a breakthrough made possible by technology, stressing that children around the world being able to watch Real Madrid at no cost aligns with football's global and social role. At the same time, the expanded Club World Cup also carries huge prize money for clubs, showing that “free to watch” does not necessarily mean “less lucrative” for participants, but rather a different route to monetisation. When Pérez accuses UEFA of resisting free access to preserve “huge salaries”, he is reviving a long-running conflict between major clubs and European football's governing body. Somalia urged to complete fiscal federalism as low tax revenue strains justice sector For years, he has argued that UEFA operates as a monopoly, extracting value from elite clubs through centralised control of the Champions League while keeping decision-making and financial upside in the hands of a relatively small executive class. The European Super League project, with its promises of more predictable revenues for top clubs and, in some versions, wider free-to-air distribution, was part of that challenge, even if it provoked fierce backlash from fans who feared a closed, anti-competitive system. Pérez's swipe at the La Liga president, whose salary has been widely reported as higher than that of the Premier League chief despite La Liga generating significantly less commercial revenue, is designed to highlight what he sees as a misalignment between performance and pay in football governance. One vision, which Pérez champions, leans on global free access, direct relationships between major clubs and fans, and a rebalancing of power away from traditional governing bodies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MCALLEN, Texas - McAllen can benefit from the FIFA World Cup being staged in Monterey next summer by accommodating spectators in its hotels. “We've got the World Cup coming to Monterrey. We're working really closely with the City (of McAllen) to be able to land some of that lodging activity,” Suarez said, in a report to an MEDC stakeholders meeting. "We know that that whole of northern Mexico quarter is going to be saturated, and they are in need for some reliever service from hospitality. FIFA World Cup 26, as it is being marketed, takes place in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada between June 11 and July 19. As hosts, the U.S., Mexico, and Canada automatically qualify. In addition to MEDC staff and directors, it comprises invited stakeholders from the community who are asked to give updates on the activity of their organizations. Suarez spoke about bringing more tourists to McAllen when asked how it is that sales tax revenues for the city are up but bridge crossings are down. Do we have lower (hotel) occupancy, and, I guess revenue year-over-year? Are we being supported by government money with the border obstruction efforts?” Suarez was asked. Suarez confirmed that state and federal border security personnel are helping fill the hotels. She responded: “There is a steady business flow, and that continues. We haven't seen a big change there. They're about 70 to 80% government contracts of their property. “There are different players also, and so, like, they're dealing now with the Coast Guard in a really big way. We hadn't seen that government money supporting us. Suarez said it is also important to distinguish between vehicular traffic crossings and pedestrian crossings at the Hidalgo International Bridge. “This (report) is only looking at personal vehicles. And when we look at pedestrian crossings, those are high and there's a lot of pedestrian movement that is then shuttled into McAllen. And so that activity is not reported here. And so we anticipate some of those trends have kept retail sales on the grow.” Adrian Villarreal, president of IBC Bank in the McAllen, gave his analysis. “I think what we've talked about and seen is that because of the crossing issues, yes, they're still coming but they're just coming fewer times. So all hotels, I understand, were full this weekend. And there were a few stores, high-branded stores in the mall, this weekend, where, on Saturday, they were leading their company sales in all of North America. “So, I think on the occupancy-side part of it, they're just not coming as often. So, I'm not surprised that retail sales are still mainly up because there's always that demand to come over here and shop, especially those brand labels.” “We are a finalist for the Democratic State Convention. So we'll be in Houston this weekend with the CVB team to support that. We've also been working really closely with the Governor's Office and his tourism team. We're doing a lot to bring more Mexico tournaments. That's a big game changer for lodging, and it's an important investment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Rose Lavelle scored in the 80th minute and the eighth-seeded Gotham FC beat the Washington Spirit 1-0 on Saturday night to win their second National Women's Soccer League championship. “It was maybe the one moment I had in the game to step up,” Lavelle said. “I keep saying Bruninha did the heavy lifting on that.” It is the first NWSL championship title for Lavelle, who had scored in the 2023 final when she was playing for the Seattle Reign against Gotham in a 2-1 loss. We had a really daunting schedule with the amount of games that we were playing, the travel. I think just like the way that every single individual stepped up in the moments, did what they were asked to, was so huge,” Lavelle said. And so, I think what we faced throughout the season really helped set us up.” After a strong opening 10 minutes of the match for Gotham, with three shots from Jaedyn Shaw, the final began to mature into a tense affair. There were few chances and the best of the first half came when Spirit midfielder Hal Hershfelt perfectly timed a slide tackle and cleaned out Midge Purce with the follow through. The U.S. women's national team star was on limited minutes after suffering a knee sprain in October. They had marginally more control of the ball, 53%, but were outshot by Gotham 12-6 and finished the game without a single shot on target. “As much as I don't want to admit it, I still don't feel like I was my full self tonight, which sucks, because I feel like it's the second year I've gone into a final not feeling like myself,” Rodman said. The second-seeded Spirit (14-6-8) suffered a second consecutive defeat in the NWSL final, having lost last year to the Orlando Pride in Kansas City, Missouri. In 2023, when there were only six playoff spots, Gotham became the first sixth seed to lift the trophy. Coach Juan Carlos Amoros has seven NWSL playoff wins in his career and two championships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gotham FC is once again the reigning National Women's Soccer League champion. Lavelle found the ball and, with a single touch, put it away. “All I had to do was tuck it away.” “I think this playoffs is about showing to ourselves, most of all, what we can do.” GOTHAM FC TAKES A 1-0 LEAD IN THE #NWSL CHAMPIONSHIP 🔥 pic.twitter.com/axaDWBEFdW The first half felt like a master class in defensive ability. While Gotham's attack was highlighted by 21-year-old star Jaedyn Shaw, but the Spirit's backline, anchored by NWSL Defender of the Year Tara McKeown, proved too tough for them to break through. Forward Rosemonde Kouassi carried her momentum from her dominant form in the postseason, with Croix Bethune seemingly out for revenge after missing last year's championship match due to injury. Spirit forward Trinity Rodman made her expected return, though surprisingly early for a player who only recently returned from injury, subbing on for teammate Sofia Cantore in the 57th minute. But all it took was that moment of brilliance from Lavelle to turn this championship around, fueled by 23-year-old Bruninha's vision on the pitch. Gotham head coach Juan Carlos Amoros praised Bruninha's efforts in assisting Lavelle's lone goal of the night. He spoke about his decision to drop Bruninha for veteran defender and captain Mandy Freeman in their starting line-up. “She knows what she needs to do to produce magic, so when I saw her going (with) those step overs, I thought that was a very special moment.” Bruninha entered the pitch for Reale, who went into halftime with a yellow card. Instead of risking another yellow, Amoros played it safe and subbed Reale out. Gotham's goal came as the Spirit weighed a substitution of their own. Midfielder Hal Hershfelt had just re-entered the pitch after sustaining an ankle injury mid-game. Shortly after Gotham's goal, Deborah Abiodun subbed on for Hershfelt. The two sides are familiar foes, with last year's semifinal clash ending in the Spirit's favor following a tense round of penalty kicks. The Spirit coasted to the NWSL final with their confident 2-0 win over Portland Thorns last week, featuring what players described as their best soccer yet. “Having lost the same point last year stings just as bad,” Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury said. “It's a big shock because this group completely believed that we would win. There was really no scenario where we didn't lift that trophy today. It was a great final, came down to a moment of brilliance from Rose Lovelle, and just super proud of the season we've had.” Lavelle secured her first NWSL championship with the win. “We've had such a tough season, and I think this was just the most special way to top it off. I think we couldn't have done it without every single person, like, top to bottom. Gotham players repeatedly said this season has felt like a roller coaster. Captain Tierna Davidson's season-ending injury to start the year. They're pumping us up in the locker room, which I absolutely love,” Sonnett said. “Tierna doesn't show a lot of emotion, but, man, is she jumping around right now.” She described Davidson as “the glue” that holds Gotham together. This championship was not about a single player, Amoros said. It was about Gotham as a collective, and what they were able to achieve together this season. While Gotham will take the time to celebrate, Amoros cautioned his team will soon be preparing to do this all again and play in the FIFA Women's Champions Cup for a spot in the women's Club World Cup in 2028. “Now, we're going to celebrate,” he said in Spanish, before exiting Saturday's press conference. Now we have a very short break, because we have to return for preseason in a month.” They will return, he said, “to keep living the dream.” Melanie Anzidei  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tartan Army footsoldiers will face checks on their social media posts when travelling to America for the World Cup under Donald Trump's strict new visa rules. Scotland blazed into the finals last week after their spinetingling 4-2 win over Denmark on Tuesday night. However, punitive border policies and social media screening were reinstated this year on President Trump's orders. And it means thousands of football fans could be refused entry to the US after border agents were given more powers to turn back travellers at the gate. Officials will be able to review social media activity linked to a traveller's visa application and offensive posts, political content, or even jokes about security or drugs could also cause visa issues under new US “moral character” clauses. Jessie Chambers, from working holiday provider Global Work and Travel, said: “With Trump's administration reinstating stricter entry rules, fans need to treat this World Cup as a high-risk travel event — not a holiday you can book last minute.” Officials have now said fans' euphoric outburst were the equivalent to an “extremely small earthquake”. A second significant amount of seismic activity came moments later when the final whistle sounded last Tuesday night. An official attendance of 49,587 was recorded at the game. Official BGS readings were recorded at Glasgow Geothermal Observatory in Dalmarnock about 2km from Hampden Park.</p>
