                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo Heather Mitchell, 69, retired and living in Tucson, Arizona, is content with her phone even though it is old by smartphone standards. It's hanging in there surprisingly well for a jalopy. I've had issues with it, and still do, but they are minor," said Mitchell. "I love Samsung phones, but can not afford a new one right now. The average American now holds onto their smartphone for 29 months, according to a recent survey by Reviews.org, and that cycle is getting longer. Research released by the Federal Reserve last month concludes that each additional year companies delay upgrading equipment results in a productivity decline of about one-third of a percent, with investment patterns accounting for approximately 55% of productivity gaps between advanced economies. "Think about how much internet speeds have changed in the past decade or more. In the 2010s, 100MB speeds were considered high speed and very good. A short 10 years later and we're operating at 1GB speeds, which is roughly 10 times faster," said Cassandra Cummings, CEO of New Jersey-based electronics design company Thomas Instrumentation. Operating at higher GB speeds requires different electronic hardware, and a lot of the older technology can't handle it. "Those devices were engineered when no one could fathom speeds that much faster would be mainstream," Cummings said. That can be a drain on nationwide networks as well. "Often entire sections of networks or company internal networks are running slower than they would if all devices were up to the newer standards," she added. Cummings doesn't deny that staying up to date with new devices and hardware is expensive. "Many companies, especially small businesses, and individual people can't afford to constantly upgrade to the latest and greatest devices," she said. To ease the transition to new technologies, she says there should be designs that are repairable or modular rather than the constant purge and replace cycles. "So perhaps future devices can have a partial upgrade in say ethernet communications rather than forcing someone to purchase an entirely new computer or device," Cummings said. "I'm not a fan of the throw-away culture we have these days. It may help the economy to spend more and force upgrades, but does it really help people who are already struggling to pay bills?" Indeed, entrepreneurs in the device resale market see the longer-lived tech as a success story that can be improved upon. He adds that when people hold onto their phones or laptops for five or six years, the repair and refurbishment market becomes an active part of the economy. If governments and big tech supported refurbishment properly, aging devices could become part of a sustainable circular economy," Athwal said, improving the second-hand cycle by extending software support, improving access to parts, and treating repair as infrastructure. No need to constantly push upgrades, which financially strains both small and large businesses alike," Athwal said. Still, some device manufacturers have found ways to entice consumers to ditch their older phones for newer ones. For instance, Apple just had one of its most successful new launches with the iPhone 17, and artificial intelligence could be a game-changer. Najiba Benabess, dean of the business school at Neumann University, says rising prices and sustainability concerns are among reasons "America's gadgets are aging out," but the market should be focused on slowing productivity, increasing repair and maintenance expenses, and limited access to software updates and efficiency gains. "Small businesses, in particular, lose valuable hours each year due to lagging systems, creating what economists call a 'productivity drag,'" Benabess said. On a national scale, this translates to billions of dollars in lost output and reduced innovation. "While keeping devices longer may seem financially or environmentally responsible, the hidden cost is a quieter erosion of economic dynamism and competitiveness," she added. Most people still want the newest and most up-to-date phones and tablets, according to Jason Kornweiss, senior vice president of advisory services at Diversified, a global technology solutions provider, but research does show a widening gap between businesses and individuals when it comes to aging devices. "Corporations with hundreds or thousands of people are not investing at the same rate," Kornweiss said, adding that technology is changing so fast IT departments can't keep up with the pace and that bloated corporations need to vet the newest technology, which takes time, and by the time they do the vetting, something new has arrived anyway. Employees look at replacing devices within an organization as too tedious and people cringe when the IT department comes with a new device," Kornweiss said, even when it is a meaningful upgrade, he added. The price to the organization is then paid in lack of productivity, inability to multitask and innovate, and needless, additional hours of work that stack up. Workplace research conducted by Diversified last year found that 24% of employees work late or overtime due to aging technology issues, while 88% of employees report that inadequate workplace technology stifles innovation. Kornweiss says he doesn't expect there's been any improvement in those numbers over the past year. There's a disconnect between the numbers and behavior. Many workers report that aging devices stifle productivity, but like a favorite pair of shoes or an old sweater, they don't want to give them up to learn the intricacies of a new device (which they'll learn and then have to replace with another). "Productivity is hampered and it all has a tangible impact on the economics," Kornweiss said. The biggest commodity a worker has is time, he says, and older devices gobble that up. Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies can be a savior for businesses slow to upgrade, with individuals using their own more functional devices easily able to integrate into most workplace systems these days, Kornweiss said. Another option for companies that don't want to buy a bunch of quickly dated devices is to lease. Kornweiss sees a future where technology continues to advance at warp speed and companies will continue to have trouble keeping up. In 26 years, this is only my fifth phone," Mitchell said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's safe to say that no one is crazy about passwords. A recent survey of 200 CISOs by Wakefield Research, sponsored by security vendor Portnox, showed that a significant majority (92%) of the security leaders said their organizations had implemented or were planning to implement passwordless authentication. CISOs cited improved employee productivity and enhanced user experience as the top benefits. Passwordless authentication verifies user identity without the need for traditional passwords, through alternative methods such as hardware tokens, biometrics, or mobile push notifications. It offers potential benefits such as enhanced security and improved user experience. Training services provider Universal Technical Institute has begun using a passwordless platform from Microsoft, "and as we expand adoption, the benefits show up quickly, with fewer password resets, fewer service desk tickets, and a faster start to the day," said Adrienne DeTray, senior vice president and CIO at the company. "It shows that we're serious about making technology feel lighter and more human again. This is one of those steps that helps remove that administrative drag and makes the ecosystem feel more seamless and connected." It's not just about security, DeTray said, but user experience as well. "Every password reset or lockout slows people down and chips away at their focus," she said. "Passwordless takes that friction out of the day and gives people time back. "For us, this isn't about chasing a trend, it's a direct response to the fact that our previous gold standard, multi-factor authentication, is showing its age," Rao said. "The threat landscape has evolved past what traditional MFA can handle." R Systems' decision to make the move is driven by both security and business enablement factors. "Credential-based attacks remain the top threat vector, with a significant rise in phishing attempts and several near-miss incidents underscoring the urgency to act," Rao said. "We want to promote solutions within our organization that are phishing resistant." On the operational side, password resets have become quite expensive, Rao said. Resets can be costly due to direct labor expenses and significant indirect costs such as lost employee productivity and IT resource drain. In addition, it's critical that the company adhere to compliance requirements such as PCI 4.0, which mandates that users reauthenticate everything they restart or access. "And finally, as we compete for top tech and cybersecurity talent, being a passwordless enterprise signals that we're a forward-thinking, security-first organization." Health-care services provider Diversus Health is also moving to passwordless authentication, using the technology in the form of certificate-based network access control. "Due to recently adopting a bring-your-own-device policy, our internal annual HIPAA compliance audit detected lack of network access control as one of our high-risk threats," said Neil Ford, IT security administrator. "So, we began looking into solutions that could be used to mitigate the threat." Diversus Health earlier this year deployed a system from Portnox that uses certificate-based authentication to verify the identity of devices. "We deploy the certificate through a cloud-based endpoint management solution, so verification with Portnox is transparent to staff," Ford said. "Employees are overcoming decades of password muscle memory and addressing legitimate user anxiety about 'what if I lose my device?' Enterprises need to frame passwordless authentication not as another security mandate, but as a direct benefit to employees through less frustration, faster logins, and the elimination of password resets, Rao said. Before making the shift, R Systems ran small, interactive training sessions to get people comfortable with access tools such as fingerprint identification on their phones. "I cannot stress enough the importance of organizations providing user education," Rao. R Systems passwordless strategy isn't tied to a single vendor, but built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn open standards, "giving us flexibility to choose the right tool for each risk profile," Rao said. "Privileged users such as administrators, developers, and executives use FIDO2 hardware security keys, while the broader workforce relies on passkeys integrated with device biometrics like Windows Hello and Face ID." "We've seen our employee experience improve dramatically, with faster logins and a significant reduction in password-related help desk tickets," Rao said. "Most importantly, passwordless authentication has become a cornerstone of our zero-trust architecture, giving us a stronger, high-assurance identity layer that enables secure access regardless of user or device location."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Concerns about the steep valuations of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and a questionable outlook for an interest rate cut in December weighed on investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. For now, however, Nvidia's solid earnings last week seemed to undermine the idea that everything tied to AI investment is in a bubble. These experts can help provide key insights into a company's growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Windows and Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is viewed as one of the major beneficiaries of the AI boom. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal first quarter, with revenue from the Azure cloud business growing by 40%. Recently, Baird analyst William Power initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy rating and a price target of $600. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also optimistic on MSFT, giving it an "outperform" rating and a price target of $628. "Microsoft is leading the AI revolution with infrastructure and applications, aided by its OpenAI relationship, providing an end-to-end AI platform for enterprises and consumers alike," said Power, explaining his optimism. Power sees MSFT's partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI as a key differentiator, helping it run AI at scale and speed. The 5-star analyst said that after a commitment to invest $13 billion, Microsoft recently announced an incremental $250 billion Azure investment over several years. He noted that MSFT's revenue growth in Q1 FY26 was accompanied by a solid operating margin of 49% and free cash flow margin of 33%. Microsoft's strong margins are ensuring continued double-digit EPS growth, he said. Power believes in Microsoft's near- and long-term potential, despite any immediate pressure stemming from AI capital spending concerns. Online travel agent (OTA) Booking Holdings (BKNG) is another pick this week. Impressed by the Q3 performance and attractive valuation, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt upgraded BKNG to buy from hold with a price targe of $6,000. "Booking remains the best-positioned OTA in our view," benefiting from several positives, from the company's scale and diversification to solid liquidity to free cash flow conversion, Devitt said. The top-rated analyst also noted management's impressive history of successfully executing major strategic initiatives. Devitt highlighted Booking Holdings' widening market share in alternative lodging while optimizing costs and driving efficiencies. The company's cost savings are supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives to achieve longer-term targets, he said. Additionally, Devitt discussed Booking's impressive growth across key metrics in the third quarter amid better-than-anticipated global travel demand. Third-quarter gross bookings growth of 14% surpassed management's guidance by 400 basis points, the analyst said. ASs a result, Devitt raised his 2025 gross bookings growth estimate by 100 basis points from his prior forecast, to 11.5%. Further, he expects BKNG to report adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year margin expansion of about 180 basis points. Devitt also upgraded his rating for food delivery platform DoorDash (DASH) to buy from hold with a price target of $260. TipRanks' AI Analyst rates DoorDash "neutral" with a price target of $211. DASH shares took a hit when the company announced mixed third-quarter results and said it expects to spend "several hundred million dollars" on new initiatives and development in 2026. Devitt believes that the pullback in DASH shares presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity, with the stock now trading at about 17.7x his 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate. Devitt admits that the higher level of spending will hurt near-term margins, but argues such investments in growth initiatives are warranted given that they'll expand DASH's addressable market and bolster its product offerings. Specifically, Devitt highlighted management's plans to direct incremental investments toward three key areas: "(1) creating a cohesive global tech platform, (2) building new verticals and products, and (3) scaling geographic expansion." Overall, Devitt is bullish on DoorDash, believing it has held a dominant position in the U.S. food delivery sector. Moreover, he noted the company's solid execution across strategic initiatives as management pushes for long-term sustainable growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss a draft plan presented by Washington to end the war in Ukraine, after Kyiv and its allies voiced alarm over what they saw as major concessions to the aggressor Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has championed the 28-point plan, said on Sunday that Ukraine had not been grateful for American efforts over the war, even as U.S. weapons continue to flow to Kyiv via NATO and Europe keeps buying Russian oil. On Friday, Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had until Thursday to approve the plan, which calls on Ukraine to cede territory, accept limits on its military and renounce ambitions to join NATO. For many Ukrainians, including soldiers fighting on the front lines, such terms would amount to capitulation after nearly four years of fighting in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. With the U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the main talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials got under way in Geneva on Sunday afternoon in a stiff atmosphere at the U.S. mission, soon after Trump complained in a Truth Social post that Ukraine's leadership had shown "zero gratitude" to the U.S. for its efforts and Europe continued to buy Russian oil. European allies said they had not been consulted. As officials began meeting, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the goal was to craft a plan acceptable to Ukraine, which could be used in a negotiation with Russia. Before heading to Geneva, Rubio insisted on X that Washington had authored the plan after remarks from some U.S. senators suggesting otherwise. Europeans have submitted a modified version of the U.S. plan for Ukraine that pushes back on proposed limits to Kyiv's armed forces and territorial concessions, according to a document seen by Reuters on Sunday. The draft U.S. plan, which includes many of Russia's key demands and offers only vague assurances to Ukraine of "robust security guarantees," comes at a perilous moment for Kyiv. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that Ukraine's borders cannot be changed by force, its army cannot be left vulnerable to attack and that the European Union must have a central role in a Ukraine peace deal. Russia has been making gains on parts of the front, albeit slowly and, according to Western and Ukrainian officials, the advances have been extremely costly in terms of lives lost. The transportation hub of Pokrovsk has been partially taken by Russian forces and Ukrainian commanders say they do not have enough soldiers to prevent small, persistent incursions. Zelenskiy himself has been under pressure domestically after a major corruption scandal broke, ensnaring some of his ministers and people in his close entourage. He has warned that Ukraine risked losing its dignity and freedom — or Washington's backing — over the U.S. plan. Zelenskyy welcomed the diplomatic efforts in Geneva, saying that he hoped they would lead to a result. Ukraine relies heavily on U.S. intelligence and weapons to sustain its war against Russia. Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff arrived on Sunday for the hastily convened Geneva meeting. "Nothing will be agreed on until the two presidents get together," the official said, referring to Trump and Zelenskyy. U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll was also in Geneva for the talks, where Ukraine's delegation is led by the head of Zelenskiy's office, Andriy Yermak. Yermak said his delegation met with the national security advisers from Britain, France and Germany and would next hold talks with the United States. European and other Western leaders have said the U.S. peace plan was a basis for talks to end the war but needed "additional work". Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday about Ukraine and share the outcome with European and U.S. allies.

Zelenskiy himself has been under pressure domestically after a major corruption scandal broke, ensnaring some of his ministers and people in his close entourage. He has warned that Ukraine risked losing its dignity and freedom — or Washington's backing — over the U.S. plan. Zelenskyy welcomed the diplomatic efforts in Geneva, saying that he hoped they would lead to a result. Ukraine relies heavily on U.S. intelligence and weapons to sustain its war against Russia. Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff arrived on Sunday for the hastily convened Geneva meeting. "Nothing will be agreed on until the two presidents get together," the official said, referring to Trump and Zelenskyy. U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll was also in Geneva for the talks, where Ukraine's delegation is led by the head of Zelenskiy's office, Andriy Yermak. Yermak said his delegation met with the national security advisers from Britain, France and Germany and would next hold talks with the United States. European and other Western leaders have said the U.S. peace plan was a basis for talks to end the war but needed "additional work". Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday about Ukraine and share the outcome with European and U.S. allies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers critical of President Donald Trump's approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war said Saturday they spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio who told them that the peace plan Trump is pushing Kyiv to accept is a "wish list" of the Russians and not the actual proposal offering Washington's positions. A State Department spokesperson denied their account, calling it "blatantly false." The secretary of state doubled down on the assertion that Washington was responsible for a proposal that had surprised many from the beginning for being so favorable to Moscow. The widely leaked 28-point U.S.-backed peace plan was, according to the White House, the result of a month of work between Rubio and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff along with input from what it said was both Ukrainians and Russians. The plan acquiesces to many Russian demands that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory. Trump says he wants Ukraine to accept the plan by late next week. "This administration was not responsible for this release in its current form," said Republican Mike Rounds from South Dakota, speaking at a security conference in Canada. "They want to utilize it as a starting point." The bipartisan group of senators, who are veteran legislators and among those most focused on foreign relations, stood together at the press conference as they relayed Rubio's message on the call. Rubio, who serves as both national security adviser and secretary of state, was expected to attend a meeting in Geneva on Sunday to discuss Washington's proposal as part of a U.S. delegation, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the American participants before the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations," Rubio posted on X. "It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine," Rubio wrote. Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesperson, said the senators' account was "blatantly false." A senior Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to detail internal discussions, noted Saturday night that the White House has consistently maintained that the plan was authored by the U.S. but included input from Russians and Ukrainians. The official said the plan had always been considered by the administration as a helpful place to start continued negotiations with an eye toward working to a more lasting peace plan. The senators earlier Saturday said the plan would only reward Moscow for its aggression and send a message to other leaders who have threatened their neighbors. There's no ethical, legal, moral, political justification for Russia claiming eastern Ukraine," King said during a panel discussion at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Zelenskyy, in an address, did not reject the plan outright, but insisted on fair treatment while pledging to "work calmly" with Washington and other partners in what he called "truly one of the most difficult moments in our history." In its 17th year, about 300 people gather annually at the Halifax International Security Forum held at Halifax's Westin hotel. The forum attracts military officials, U.S. senators, diplomats and scholars but this year the Trump administration suspended participation of U.S. defense officials in events by think tanks, including the Halifax International Security Forum. A large number of U.S. senators made the trip this year in part because of strained relations between Canada and the U.S. Trump has alienated America's neighbor with his trade war and insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Many Canadians now refuse to travel to the U.S. and border states like Shaheen's New Hampshire are seeing a dramatic drop in tourism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes, even the healthiest-looking person might have high cholesterol. GDP growth has been running north of 3% for the last two quarters. But there are serious dangers lurking beneath the surface of our economy, and it is better to clearly identify them than to ignore them in favor of broad aggregate measures. Major employers in industries like homebuilding and restaurants are looking shaky, and they offer ominous signs about the direction of the overall economy. The problem with relying on broad bundles of data is that things typically appear placid on an aggregate level right up until things go wrong. In a genuine downturn, the consensus typically assumes a gradual, linear increase in unemployment, similar to the slow, steady grind we are currently experiencing. When things truly turn south, it usually comes as an abrupt shift that results in a negative self-reinforcing feedback loop. There is no real way of knowing when labor market conditions will transition from linear to nonlinear. That things seem to be evolving in a stable fashion now doesn't negate the possibility of an unstable move later. Don't just take my word for it, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently acknowledged that sectors of the economy are already in serious downturn territory. Residential housing: There are several signs that employment in home construction is about to hit the skids. Building permits also indicate a potential weakness in future construction activity. Add this up, and it's clear that the industry is likely holding onto too many workers relative to its current activity levels. Restaurants: We've seen major casual dining establishments, such as Chipotle and Sweetgreen, post weaker sales growth in recent quarters, largely due to weakness in certain consumer cohorts, including 25-34 year olds. Despite this, many chains have said they plan to absorb higher food input prices caused by supply shocks, thereby squeezing their margins. Slower sales and slimmer profits are not a recipe for more hiring. In fact, declining measures of productivity per worker in food services & drinking places suggest that many of these restaurants are overstaffed and may be a signal that layoffs are on the horizon. Beyond these big four, there are industries with a smaller employment footprint that also appear to be softening: It's taken a while to unfold, but the labor slowdown has played out in a standard way: job openings have declined, hiring rates have cooled as companies have slowed their pace of recruiting, and we're now beginning to see an increase in layoffs from historically low levels. The workers at the margins — like younger people and Black Americans — have felt it more than those in more secure positions, which is also not unusual. Recession-like dynamics across several different industries increase the risk of additional layoffs in those same key sectors in the quarters ahead. Just because conditions seem to be gradually cooling today does not close the door on a more abrupt shift in labor market conditions later. Because consumption has been a source of support for the economy, a deeper slowdown in the jobs market would create a nasty downward spiral: People cut back on their spending as they lose their jobs, which dries up sources of revenue for businesses that then lay off more workers in response, which further shrinks the amount of household spending, and so on. But while America's economic ocean appears placid at 30,000 feet, beneath the surface, several riptides are brewing. Neil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ms Jo Malone CBE became a millionaire after selling her namesake perfume brand in 1999, and decades later has only one regret: never being able to use her name again. Malone founded fragrance brand Jo Malone London in 1990 and sold it to the Estée Lauder Companies nine years later — along with the rights to use her name in any business. "I don't look back and think to myself: 'If I'd waited another five years, I could have made double the amount,'" the 62-year-old British entrepreneur said on an episode of CNBC's "Executive Decisions" podcast with Steve Sedgwick. But she added: "I think the one thing I regret — and they [Estée Lauder] may not have bought the company [without it] — is the use of my name. Under British law, when you sell a business built on your name, you usually sell the goodwill and the right to use that name, Simon Barker, partner and intellectual property head at Freeths law firm, told CNBC Make It. Once you've sold the business, using your name for a similar business could cause consumer confusion and breach your contract or infringe any trademarks the buyer now owns. It could also amount to "passing off" — a British legal concept that stops someone from misleading the public into thinking their goods or services are connected to another business. Malone's later businesses only use her first name to ensure they don't violate her agreement with Estée Lauder. "I don't want to cause any problems, but I feel the law needs to change, actually, in this, because people are selling their businesses with their names, and if you're saying you can't use your name for the rest of your life, that's a lifelong non-compete," she said. "I think the law is going to have to look at the way businesses are sold and how that non-compete comes in," she added. Malone is one of a number of British entrepreneurs who have sold an eponymous brand only to regret it later. Fashion designer Karen Millen sold her business in 2004, and agreed not to use her name in a competing business globally. She later challenged the restrictions, but a court ruled that using her name would cause consumer confusion. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Emanuel, the designer behind Princess Diana's wedding dress, sold her business — including the rights to use her name — to a company that later transferred those rights to new owners. So if you say: I won't use my name for a competing business, then the new buyer can enforce that covenant against you." American makeup artist and entrepreneur Bobbi Brown also sold her namesake cosmetics company to Estée Lauder in 1995 and was contractually obliged not to use her name commercially in a way that would compete with the brand. This "protects against the unauthorized commercial use of somebody's name, image or likeness," Barker explained. "Where the difference lies is that you'll almost certainly lose the right to use your name for similar goods or services because of the contractual restrictions, but the right of publicity might still allow you to control other uses of your name and advertising or endorsements." "I would say to people, anyone that is looking at acquisition, especially if your name is attached to your business, think through all the implications first," Malone said. "Think about those things, because you will sacrifice things, and you will have to give and yield, and you will gain something else, but never do it solely, just for money." However, there are some caveats, as oftentimes, without the original name, the brand doesn't retain as much value in acquisitions. He said founders should consult advisors and potentially ask for "watered-down restrictions." "But of course, it's not always as simple as that, because somebody will be waving many millions of pounds at you," he added. "And if you say: 'I want all of this,' they're likely to turn around and say: 'Well, we're not going to give you as much then.'"
