Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max. The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8. In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max). If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus. While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV. Don't live in either of those places? A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user. ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Novak Djokovic saw off Alex de Minaur, Jannik Sinner takes on Grigor Dimitrov as the fourth round continues The first players out on Centre Court on Monday were Novak Djokovic, who continues his bid for a record-equalling eighth title in SW19, and Alex de Minaur, with Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek set to be in action later. Djokovic, 38, also played down injury concerns despite clutching his stomach throughout, having suffered a stomach issue in round one. Five-time major winner Swiatek is through to the quarter-finals after a 6-4 6-1 win over Denmark's Clara Tauson in just 65 minutes. Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below. Grigor Dimitrov was beating Jannik Sinner and deservedly so. Sinner goes to Dimitrov and embraces his stricken opponent. Jannik Sinner is through but he has not won tonight and admits so himself. He returns to court but shakes his head and retires from his match while two sets up against Jannik Sinner. Dimitrov seems to be in a real state, mentally, and who can blame him? Dimitrov, it seems, will continue – but only after leaving the court for now. Dimitrov holds serve to make it 2-2, then drops to the grass on his backside, clutching his chest. He seems to be struggling with a pectoral issue, perhaps? Sinner comes over to check on him, as do a couple of trainers... Back underway on Centre Court, where Sinner does what he failed to manage in the first two sets and wins his opening service game of the set. Sinner does not have the best record in long matches, or in five-sets in general at the grand slams, but he can start improving that by coming from behind against Dimitrov. At this point, it's a long way to go, though. This has been a vintage performance from the 34-year-old, and certainly a below-par display from the World No 1, who has been struggling with an elbow injury. The Italian will need to come from two sets down, and from under the roof on Centre Court. Who saw this twist coming after Sinner stayed alive? Dimitrov plays a sensational return game and breaks straight back! The ice-man brings some fire to Centre Court as he avoids going two sets down.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time Novak Djokovic overcame an uncharacteristically unsteady start to avoid what would have been his earliest exit at Wimbledon since 2016, coming through for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Alex de Minaur in the fourth round Monday. But Djokovic turned things around enough to grab the middle two sets and then really took control after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. Djokovic will be appearing in his 63rd Slam quarterfinal. By match's end, he had faced a hard-to-believe 19 break points. Despite producing merely four clean winners of his own in the opening set, de Minaur accumulated nearly twice as many points as Djokovic, 27-14. That's because Djokovic contributed a whopping 16 unforced errors. “I can't remember when I've seen him play a worse set than this,” John McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, said on the BBC telecast. He reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or shouting and glaring in the direction of his guest box or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone. At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel — usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions — on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that. This could have been Djokovic's soonest setback at Wimbledon since he was eliminated in the third round by Sam Querrey nine years ago. That one was even more shocking, because it ended Djokovic's 30-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included championships at the preceding four major tournaments in a row, making him the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold each of those trophies simultaneously. Djokovic won his men's-record 24th major title at the 2023 U.S. Open. 1 Jannik Sinner at the French Open last month. He keeps showing why it's not preposterous to think he could, though, such as his diving volley winner earlier in the tournament or the way Djokovic broke to lead 2-1 in the second set on a 35-stroke exchange Monday. The comeback officially was on, and soon enough, he was closing the third set with a winner to cap a 27-shot point.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu's Wimbledon run ended in the third round at the hands of Aryna Sabalenka, curtailing her earnings despite having already amassed a six-figure sum at SW19. The British starlet, famed for her 2021 U.S. Open victory and causing a stir with an outfit that defied Wimbledon's strict dress code, was eliminated following straight-set losses to Sabalenka. Earlier, Raducanu had outplayed Mimi Xu and Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu showcased a tenacious performance against Sabalenka, stretching the first set to a tiebreak, yet ultimately couldn't match the Belarusian's power. For reaching round three, the 22-year-old claims £152,000 (approximately $207,000) in prize money. Nonetheless, taxes won't allow Raducanu to keep all her winnings. She's up against significant tax deductions, which are poised to cut her Wimbledon prize money by almost half. Tax specialist Paul Barham from Forvis Mazars broke this down for Express Sport, stating: "Assuming that Emma is an additional rate taxpayer (due to her high earnings), the tax rate that will apply to the prize money will be 45 percent, resulting in a UK tax liability of £68,400 (around $93,000). "Assuming Emma is resident in the UK, she is also likely to have Class Four National Insurance to pay at two percent on this income, resulting in a National Insurance liability of £3,040 (around $4,000). "Therefore, her take-home pay after tax and NIC would be £80,560 (around $109,000). "These figures represent the liabilities before taking into account any deductible expenses such as travel and accommodation costs and coaching fees. Right now, it's so soon after the match. I think it's better for me to kind of feel a bit of the pain right now and then process it better that way. "I think it's difficult to see that right now, having just come off the court. At the same time, I'm playing Aryna, who is No. I have to be proud of my effort today." Meanwhile, Sabalenka is gearing up for a quarterfinal clash with Laura Siegemund after her win against Elise Mertens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron Norrie said he relishes playing Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Tuesday and will continue to compete with the competitive energy that has driven his success, regardless of what other people think. Norrie reached the quarter-finals by holding his nerve in a bruising five-set battle with the Chilean qualifier Nicolás Jarry on Sunday. Asked last week about the impact of the crowd on their second-round match, Frances Tiafoe focused immediately on Norrie's cheering: “He was super‑amped,” Tiafoe said. “He was saying ‘c'mon' from the first game, which is definitely annoying, but that part bothered me more than the crowd.” Norrie also tends to encourage himself in French and Spanish, which led to a tense moment with the Spaniard Roberto Carballés Baena in Metz last November after the British player recovered to seal a three-set win: “You say ‘vamos!' all the time, looking right in my face,” Carballes Baena said. As he looked to his upcoming match against Alcaraz, Norrie, 29, took these criticisms in his stride: “[When] a couple of people have not been too happy with it, I think it's been in a big match. I think they want to win the match as well, so it's understandable to maybe take it personally. But for me, I'm just aiming it at my team and aiming it at some people and some friends in the crowd. I think some of the points are maybe not worthy of saying ‘vamos' or saying ‘c'mon' but it was a match that I really had to do that, because those points that don't mean a lot, if you lose those ones, you can get broken, and the match can go away from you very quickly.” After their match at the Italian Open in 2023, Novak Djokovic also took issue with Norrie's frequent fist‑pumping. As he faces off against Alcaraz, the two-time defending champion and French Open champion who is on a 22‑match winning run, Norrie vowed that he will not shy away from the occasion. “There's a lot of big matches, and we're playing and we're competing for [our] livelihood out there. Despite the gulf between their achievements, tennis is a game of match-ups and Norrie has at least caused Alcaraz trouble. The Spaniard has won four and lost two against Norrie but the Briton has won two of their past three meetings. At times, Norrie has been able to wear the world No 2 down with his shot tolerance and physicality, luring him into lengthy rallies and exposing Alcaraz's lack of patience. The pair have a great relationship and train together frequently at tournaments. For me facing him is almost a nightmare, to be honest. So I'm not surprised at all seeing his level.” Alcaraz, though, has improved dramatically since Norrie won their most recent meeting, in the 2023 Rio Open final. He presents a completely different challenge across best-of-five-sets at grand slams and the grass courts only accentuate his complete game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marin Cilic has fired a broadside at the All England Club after the 2017 finalist bowed out of Wimbledon. And in a morning start, the Italian beat Cilic 6-4 6-4 6-7 7-6 to set up a quarter-final showdown with Novak Djokovic. The Croatian admitted 23-year-old Cobolli had played “at a great level”, he was furious at the scheduling of his fourth round match. Cilic, winner of the 2014 US Open, said: “I feel bitter. Why is there a need to play at 11 o'clock? The practice courts open at 9.30 - this morning, I had to warm up indoors. It was really difficult to play on. Indeed, he admitted: “I think it helped me a lot to play on Court Two. But Cobolli is almost certain to be on Centre Court against 38-year-old Djokovic and said: “I don't want to think about the court. I just want to enjoy the day. "I don't want to think about the other player. And while he was not enamoured with the scheduling, Cilic was full of praise for his conqueror, saying: “Flavio played at a great level. There were not many things he did wrong. He was doing lots of things very cleanly. He served well and was putting me in a lot of tough positions. “He played fantastically and it is great for him to be in his first quarter-final.” Wimbledon 2025 has finally begun, and fans can still buy tickets to the sporting event right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With his 101st singles win at Wimbledon on Monday, Novak Djokovic advanced to his 16th quarter-final at the grass-court Grand Slam and moved within four victories of equalling Roger Federer's record 105 match wins at the event. "It's probably the first time he's watching me and I've won the match," Djokovic said in his on-court interview. "It's great to have Roger here, a huge champion and someone I admired and respected a lot. We've shared the stage for so many years and it's great to have him back in his most successful and favourite tournament, no doubt."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic overcame a slow start to defeat Alex de Minaur in the Round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday. Djokovic dropped the first set of the match before he ultimately moved one step closer to his eighth Wimbledon title with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over de Minaur. Now, he's set to face Flavio Cobolli in the quarterfinals. Djokovic didn't start Monday on a high note, as his serve was broken in the first game of the match. Djokovic got back on track in the second set, taking an early 3-1 lead. He was ultimately unable to convert, as Djokovic avoided potentially being down by two sets. He finished with six aces compared to just one for de Minaur. Djokovic also converted six of 13 break points, while de Minaur struggled following his success in the opening set. Djokovic gave a shoutout to fellow tennis legend Roger Federer, who was in attendance, after the match concluded. Djokovic has now advanced to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the 16th time in his career and will face Cobolli on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's most iconic streetball tournament, Quai 54, made a powerful return this Saturday, opening in spectacular fashion at the historic Roland-Garros stadium. Traditionally home to tennis royalty, the Parisian venue transformed into an electrifying arena where basketball, hip-hop, and street culture collided most boldly. Founded in 2003 by Hammadoun Sidibé and Thibaut de Longeville, Quai 54 has evolved from humble outdoor courts into a global celebration of sport and urban identity. Named after a local Paris bus stop — “Quai 54” — the event has grown into a world-class cultural phenomenon, previously held at iconic locations like the Trocadéro and now, Roland-Garros. Each edition brings together elite basketball talent, top DJs, dancers, and artists, creating an unmatched blend of athleticism, music, and community energy. This year's opening carried profound emotional weight. Held on July 5, it marked the 50th anniversary of Cape Verde's independence, turning the tournament's opening day into a powerful tribute to the island nation's resilience, pride, and cultural spirit. The moment was set with the soulful performance of the Cape Verdean national anthem by Lucyle Cruz, followed by a mesmerizing batuku dance — a traditional rhythm deeply rooted in Cape Verdean heritage. The stadium pulsed in unity, a shared heartbeat between players, fans, and performers. Among those lighting up the court was William Tavares, younger brother to NBA and Real Madrid star Edy Tavares. Tavares, currently exploring professional opportunities, brought both heart and hustle to the floor. “I'm a 4 or 5 who can shoot and dribble. When asked about the uniqueness of Quai 54, his face lit up: For Tavares, basketball is deeply intertwined with family and identity. He began playing to protect his brother: Then I fell in love with the game — and it's been joy ever since.” Now in its 22nd edition, Quai 54 proves once again that it's far more than just a tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Stevens, Chief Operating Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy Division, Middle East, Africa & Türkiye at Accor says, “Through our global partnership with Roland-Garros, we're proud to bring this iconic French sporting experience to the region. More than a themed stay, this collaboration celebrates culture and sport in the heart of Dubai, aligning with the UAE's vision to become a global hub for lifestyle, tourism, and innovation in hospitality.” These fully transformed properties with Roland-Garros-inspired design, programming, and fan zones allow guests to live the tournament spirit wherever they are,” says Kerry Healy, Chief Commercial Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific at Accor. It transforms a signature suite into an immersive, grand slam-inspired tennis retreat, offering guests a chance to experience the Parisian tournament in the heart of Dubai. But this activation is just one part of a much larger play for emotional loyalty, immersive experiences, and global brand storytelling. ALL Accor branding is prominently featured on-site at Roland-Garros, from courtside signage to hospitality spaces and fan activations. These insights revealed a strong appetite for premium, lifestyle-driven sports content among global audiences. “That's why we extended the experience beyond the screen, rebranding select hotels and creating immersive Roland-Garros atmospheres on property, to engage tennis fans and guests locally in an authentic, emotionally resonant way,” comments Healy. Open from May 27, 2025, to May 2026, the immersive suites and hotel transformations launched at Pullman flagship properties in Paris, Tokyo, and São Paulo – each being the first and only officially licensed Roland-Garros themed suites ever created in their respective countries. The suite highlights an immersive in-room design with bespoke Roland-Garros décor, exclusive gaming content, and curated culinary offerings, aimed at engaging tennis fans, design lovers, and cosmopolitan travellers alike. In parallel, Pullman Dubai Downtown activated live tournament screenings and themed events at Breadhouse Bistro & Bakery to further amplify the Grand Slam energy for guests and locals. In-hotel activations, like watch parties, themed dining menus, and immersive fan zones, supported converting locals and walk-ins into brand advocates, making the experience accessible even without a suite booking. Hyper-targeted digital ads on platforms like Meta and YouTube, tailored by market (including the UAE, France, Japan, Brazil, and more), are being used to reach tennis audiences during high-intent moments – especially around key tournament dates. While not explicitly targeted at high-net-worth individuals, the Roland-Garros audience naturally overlaps with Accor's luxury and premium segments. But there's also a strong generational element to the marketing initiative. “Younger demographics, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly drawn to brands that offer more than just a product or service. They want emotionally resonant experiences, personal relevance, and digital-first engagement. She continues, “By elevating ALL Accor as not just a loyalty program but a cultural connector, linking tennis, travel, and lifestyle, we're speaking directly to younger consumers who want to align with brands that share their passions in travel, sport, and unique experiences.” The initiative aligns with ALL Accor's broader mission: to evolve its loyalty program into a global lifestyle brand. At the 2024 tournament, Accor launched Advantage ALL.com, a new platform connecting tennis fans with privileged access to hotels, curated experiences, and exclusive rewards. Healy says, “Our partnership reflects a long-term strategic commitment to elevating ALL Accor, our loyalty program, as a global lifestyle and hospitality brand, particularly in the world of sport,” says Kerry Healy, Chief Commercial Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific at Accor. “This platform connects tennis fans with the world of ALL Accor, offering privileged hotel access, loyalty rewards, and curated lifestyle experiences. As a result, the branded suite aims to deliver a Grand Slam experience while aligning with ALL Accor's ongoing mission to connect guests with culture, sport, and lifestyle experiences. “Our work with Roland-Garros is a blueprint for how we blend brand, sport, lifestyle, and loyalty into a cohesive and enduring global platform, one that creates real value for guests, hotel owners, and the broader Accor ecosystem,” comments Healy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu will lose a huge amount of her Wimbledon prize money after raking in six figures at SW19. It followed one-sided wins over Mimi Xu and Marketa Vondrousova in her opening two matches. Raducanu put up a good fight against Sabalenka, taking the first set to a tiebreak, but the Belarusian ultimately proved too strong. She will be paid handsomely for making it to the third round, with the 22-year-old entitled to receive £152,000 in prize money. The former US Open champion will not get to keep it all, though. She will be presented with a hefty tax bill, which will see almost half of her Wimbledon prize money taken away. Paul Barham, tax partner at Forvis Mazars, told Express Sport: "Assuming that Emma is an additional rate taxpayer (with other income over £125,140), the tax rate that will apply to the prize money will be 45 per cent resulting in a UK tax liability of £68,400. "Assuming Emma is resident in the UK, she is also likely to have Class Four National Insurance to pay at two per cent on this income resulting in a National Insurance liability of £3,040. Therefore, her take home pay after tax and NIC would be £80,560. "These figures represent the liabilities before taking into account any deductible expenses such as travel and accommodation costs and coaching fees. Raducanu was visibly emotional in the wake of her defeat to Sabalenka, admitting that it was hard to see the positives in her post-match press conference.

Sabalenka, meanwhile, has set up a quarter-final date with Laura Siegemund after beating Elise Mertens in the fourth round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While that campaign ultimately came to a halt in the semis, where Australia's Ashleigh Barty finally managed to stop Anisimova in her tracks, it was clear that the latter was here to stay. In the summer of 2022, Anisimova lost her father and coach, Konstantin. Goes without saying, the incident rocked Amanda's world. To cope with the stress and turmoil, Amanda declared in May 2023 that she would go into an indefinite hiatus in order to find balance inside her head. Well, looking at how 2025 is panning out for the 23-year-old, it can be safely assumed that Anisimova has found the closure she needed. However, for those who have walked a similar road, the burden that you inevitably carry on is apparent, even as the 2025 Qatar Open champ continues to reach new heights. In a YouTube upload by Tennis Channel on July 6, ex-pro player Jim Courier opened up on how the scar might still be lingering inside Anisimova's mind despite playing some of the best tennis of her career at SW19. Talking about how life caught Amanda off-guard, Courier said, “She burst on the scene as a semi-finalist at Roland Garros, right? Young woman playing the sport, and then life intervenes. She had some real stuff…Her father passed away, took some time away to regroup, and now she's on the verge of making another semi-final here against Pavlyuchenkova,” noting that Anisimova can very well defeat the Russian when they cross paths at the Wimbledon quarterfinal tomorrow. So, it's going to be deeper in meaning for her,” the former professional tennis star kept speaking his mind about why Anisimova's run at the British Slam is so noteworthy. While Courier noted that pain and loss in personal life can be a great motivator, it also comes with a caveat.

But we do understand why Courier feels that the young American has a lot on her mind even while making waves at Wimbledon. Just days before stepping into the thick of things at Wimbledon, Anisimova talked about how her recent years have been more like a whirlwind of things, and how she came up with creative ideas to tackle those head-on. “I feel like tennis is such a rollercoaster. Maybe I could compare it to rap because I get pretty serious on the court – sometimes a bit aggressive,” she told Olympics.com about how hip-hop is the music genre that she finds similar to her playing style.

And she managed to find her calm in art. It was definitely something that I really enjoyed off the court, for a few hours to reset my mind,” Anisimova said on June 29 about how Vincent van Gogh was the one who inspired her to pursue her love for the arts. However, in every step of the way, her team kept their hand on her shoulders, making sure that Amanda didn't have to navigate through the troubled waters all by herself.
