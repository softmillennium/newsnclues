                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Studies suggest mindfulness meditation can improve cognition, but few researchers have examined whether virtual mindfulness meditation apps are effective. In a new eNeuro paper, Andy Kim et al., from the University of Southern California, assessed attention control in adults following about a month of mindfulness meditation guided by a mobile app. In participants of all ages, mindfulness improved attention control as measured by reliable eye movement tasks established to assess how quickly people orient their attention. A control group that listened to an audio book did not have this cognitive improvement. Notably, self-reported measures of cognitive ability, including attention and distractibility, suggest that participants were not aware of the cognitive improvement from meditation. Future work may probe whether longer-term mindfulness interventions strengthen the effects observed in this study. Kim, A. J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immune checkpoint pathways regulate T cell function and play pivotal roles in the treatment of both cancer and autoimmune diseases. One key component of these pathways is Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3)-a classical immunosuppressive receptor that has long posed unresolved questions regarding its biological mechanisms. In a new study published on June 30 in Cell, researchers from the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University, and the School of Medicine at Zhejiang University have systematically demonstrated that LAG-3 inhibits T cell activity by positioning itself in close proximity to the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, rather than by simply binding to a ligand. This study is the first to systematically reveal the conditional activation mechanism of the inhibitory receptor LAG-3, which is regulated by its classical ligand, Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II). Instead of functioning through simple ligand binding, LAG-3 depends on MHC-II-mediated spatial proximity to the T cell receptor (TCR), enabling cis co-localization with the TCR complex and subsequent phase separation, thereby effectively suppressing CD4+ T cells. The strong dependence of LAG-3 on spatial and contextual activation suggests that it is not easily triggered in vivo. However, this very feature presents a unique opportunity for the precise modulation of autoreactive T cells in autoimmune diseases. Based on this mechanism, the researchers developed an innovative bispecific T cell silencer (BiTS) antibody that simultaneously targets LAG-3 and TCR. This antibody selectively regulates pathogenic T cells expressing LAG-3 and shows significant therapeutic efficacy in multiple autoimmune disease animal models. The study introduces the concept of "cis-proximity-dependent immune checkpoint," highlighting that LAG-3 does not function as a conventional receptor reliant solely on ligand engagement. Instead, its activity is tightly controlled by its spatial proximity to the TCR within the immune synapse. This conditional mechanism helps explain the limited efficacy of LAG-3 monotherapies in cancer treatment, while also providing a rationale for its potential use in treating autoimmune diseases. The researchers further propose a novel therapeutic strategy of "cis-inhibitory bispecific antibodies" for autoimmune treatment. This strategy has great potential to drive the development of next-generation precision immunotherapies that target pathogenic T cells, opening new avenues in autoimmune disease intervention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pairing of two experimental drugs inhibits tumor growth and blocks drug-induced resistance in ovarian cancer, according to a preclinical study led by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The research reveals a promising strategy against this hard-to-treat malignancy, and more generally demonstrates a powerful new approach for the identification of effective regimens to treat genetically diverse cancers. Ovarian cancer is genetically diverse in the sense that it can be driven by mutations in many different genes. This complicates the standard strategy of developing drugs to target common driver mutations. In the study, published July 7 in Cell Reports Medicine, the researchers applied a new precision medicine approach focused not on individual mutations but instead on the activation of growth signaling pathways specific to ovarian tumor cells. Using this pathway level data, they identified a new combination treatment strategy that selectively targets ovarian tumor cells and reduces ovarian tumor growth in preclinical models. We're excited by the potential of using this combination in ovarian cancer, and we think this approach will be useful to identify effective treatments against other cancers that don't contain highly recurrent targetable mutations." According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 250,000 women are living with ovarian cancer in the United States, and there are roughly 20,000 new cases each year. Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the ovaries followed by chemotherapy, but recurrence is common, and the five-year survival rate is only about 50%. In general, oncologists recognize that they need better treatment options. Dr. Hopkins and his team analyzed existing datasets on ovarian tumor samples to show that, despite their diversity, the mutations underlying these cancers commonly lead to the hyperactivity of a cell-growth pathway called the MAPK pathway. Screening a set of drug compounds for growth-slowing effects in 32 different cell models of human cancers, they found that an experimental drug called rigosertib, which targets the MAPK pathway and is being tested against other cancer types, showed enhanced efficacy against ovarian cancer. The team therefore did a second round of screening, this time with combinations of rigosertib and different PI3K/mTOR inhibitors-the idea being to hit tumors more effectively by blocking both the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. They found that although rigosertib on its own outperforms standard platinum-based chemotherapy in preclinical models, combining it with an PI3K/mTOR inhibitor works even better. "We're also working to identify more of these tumor specific dependencies in ovarian cancer that could offer further options for second-line therapy-because currently there are no curative second-line therapies available for this cancer," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While immunosuppressive medications are critical to prevent rejection of transplant organs, they also come with plenty of downsides. But what if there was a way to prevent organ rejection without using these medications? That goal fuels the work of Mark Stegall, M.D., a longtime Mayo Clinic transplant researcher. He leads a team of researchers developing pioneering therapies to prevent organ rejection without the need for immunosuppression. A recently published study in the American Journal of Transplantation is offering hope for patients. The goal was to see whether people who simultaneously received both a kidney and stem cell transplant from a closely matched sibling could discontinue all immunosuppressive medications after a year. The study found that 75% of participants were able to stop taking the medication for more than two years. At Mayo Clinic, three patients participated, with two off immunosuppression medications for over three years and one on a low dose. I've been involved in transplant research for more than 30 years, and we've done quite a few amazing things. It's been a goal - to be able to safely get transplant recipients off immunosuppression - for longer than I've been doing this. It is also a cornerstone of Mayo Clinic's Transforming Transplant Initiative, which has the bold goal of ensuring everyone who wants a transplant can get one and to make transplants more successful. To qualify for the clinical trial, the transplant recipients and donors needed to be siblings whose tissue types closely matched. The goal was to wean recipients off immunosuppression medication after a year. For Minnesota native Mark Welter, the results have been better than he imagined. Four years ago, he needed a kidney transplant due to polycystic kidney disease, an inherited condition that causes cysts to grow on the kidneys. The Mayo Clinic patient volunteered to be a part of the clinical trial in hopes of not having to worry about immunosuppression medication the rest of his life. His younger sister Cindy Kendall immediately stepped forward to donate a kidney and her stem cells to help her brother. "Being able to see him get off those medications has been amazing," Cindy says. Mark has not taken immunosuppression medication for more than three years. I actually feel like I did before the transplant, which has been the greatest thing," Mark says. "It's almost like the transplant didn't happen." This clinical trial only involved siblings with closely matching tissue types. Researchers want to know if stem cell transplants can prevent rejection in recipients paired with a less closely matched donor. "Even in closely matched siblings, immunosuppression is needed lifelong. Our goal is to find ways to reduce or stop immunosuppressive medications after transplant so patients can have longer lasting kidneys with fewer side effects," says Andrew Bentall, M.B., Ch.B., M.D., a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most species have developed resistance to all major classes of synthetic insecticides, many of which pose both environmental and health risks. Biopesticides, derived from living organisms, may mitigate chemical insecticide resistance and offer an environmentally friendly way forward. This week in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, researchers report that bacterial isolates collected from the Mediterranean island of Crete act as insecticides against Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes, which can transmit human pathogens such as West Nile Virus and Rift Valley Fever Virus. Those metabolites might guide the development of biopesticides with minimal ecological side effects, the researchers noted. They degrade more quickly in the environment and therefore don't accumulate, and they often don't kill such a wide range of different insect species as chemical insecticides." He co-led the new study, conducted in Crete, together with molecular biologist John Vontas, Ph.D., at the IMBB. For the new work, they collected 186 samples from 65 locations across Crete. The samples included topsoil, soil from around plant roots, plant tissues, water samples and dead insects. They then exposed C. pipiens molestus larvae to water solutions containing some of the most promising isolates found in the samples. Those 37 isolates represented 20 genera, many of which have not previously been identified as potential biopesticides, said Dimopoulos. This is promising, Dimopoulos noted, because it suggests that an insecticide based on these bacteria would not depend on the microbes staying alive. The findings have implications not only for controlling mosquitoes but also as safe biopesticides to use for controlling agricultural pests. The researchers have now begun studying the chemical nature of those insecticidal molecules more closely and identifying whether they are proteins or metabolites. They're also mapping out the spectrum of pesticidal activity demonstrated by the bacteria, including screening the isolates against other strains of pathogen-bearing mosquitoes and agricultural pest insects. Biopesticides often degrade quickly and require multiple applications, Dimopoulos said, and finding the right way to formulate and deliver the compounds will be a challenge in the future. "It's now entering the basic science phase to understand the molecules' chemical structures and modes of action, and then we'll shift to a more applied path, really aiming at prototype product development," he said. "There is a major push toward developing ecologically friendly insecticides." Bacteria isolated from biodiverse Mediterranean island habitats yield a large array of biopesticidal metabolites against mosquito larvae.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by Cambridge researchers has shed light on how neural stem cell grafts could help restore myelin in the central nervous system. The findings suggest that neural stem cell-based therapies hold promise as a potential treatment for chronic demyelinating disorders, particularly progressive multiple sclerosis. This damage is a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Despite advancements in treatments, current therapies mostly focus on managing symptoms but do not halt or reverse the damage and neurodegeneration caused. This shows the critical need for a more profound understanding of how MS progresses and to explore how stem cell technologies could help MS treatment. While neural stem cell transplants present a promising avenue for repairing the damaged central nervous system, the limits of their capacity to repair are being investigated by researchers. This research provides critical evidence that induced neural stem cell grafts can effectively turn into myelin-producing cells within the damaged central nervous system, suggesting a potential new way to treat progressive MS." The goal of this research is to see how these therapies may mitigate brain atrophy and slow the progression of MS. "Our findings represent a significant step forward in understanding how stem cell therapies can be harnessed to combat chronic demyelinating disorders," said Stefano Pluchino, Clinical Professor of Regenerative Neuroimmunology at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, the study's senior author. "We are particularly excited about the potential to develop central nervous system directed therapies that not only manage symptoms but also address the underlying neurodegenerative processes in progressive MS. This is a major step forward in the research towards directed therapies for chronic demyelinating disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis." This compelling evidence demonstrating the ability of neural stem cell grafts to generate new myelin in vivo within laboratory animals exhibiting MS-like lesions carries significant implications for ongoing research and the development of clinical trials. One group dedicated to developing innovative stem cell therapies for people with progressive MS is RESTORE, a collaborative European and US consortium which includes a number of leading scientists from Cambridge University including Prof. Pluchino & Dr. Peruzzotti-Jametti. Supported by the International Progressive MS Alliance - Experimental Medicine Development Award Scheme 2025, RESTORE's mission is to pioneer a groundbreaking efficacy clinical trial using neural stem cell-based therapy for progressive MS. A core focus of the group's approach is placing patients at the heart of research, actively involving and engaging people with MS to ensure that the work addresses their needs, values, and perspectives. The success of this study will help support the RESTORE consortium in their goal of pursuing therapies for the benefit of patients with progressive MS, and shows that neural stem cell transplantation can lead to meaningful remyelination and improved neurological outcomes in patients. It is hoped this can potentially pave the way for more effective clinical trial designs and ultimately, a fully biological disease-modifying therapy. Dr Catherine Godbold, Senior Research Communications Manager at the MS Society, said: "More than 150,000 people live with MS in the UK and it can be debilitating, exhausting and unpredictable. Neural stem cell therapy for MS is still in the very early stages of research, but these results with mice are invaluable. They help us understand how neural stem cells might one day be able to unlock desperately needed myelin-repair treatments. We're proud to have supported this study and hope it can bring us another step closer to stopping progression for everyone with MS." Peruzzotti-Jametti, L., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contact sports are becoming increasingly popular in Africa, raising concern about the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The authors propose a multifaceted approach that includes improving medical infrastructure, increasing funding, addressing sociocultural barriers to brain donation, and educating healthcare professionals. These efforts are essential to prevent serious long-term health consequences and prepare Africa for the growing challenge ahead. Engaging in contact sports such as rugby, boxing, and American football often results in repeated head injuries, now recognized as the cause of a progressive neurodegenerative disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE leads to neuronal damage that can cause memory loss, mood swings, and behavioral changes. Diagnosing CTE remains a major challenge, as symptoms may take years to appear. While medical professionals and sports communities in North America and Europe have begun addressing the risks of CTE, Africa continues to lag behind. In a recent letter to the editor, Dr. Abdulbasit Opeyemi Muili, a medical student at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Nigeria, alongside colleagues from Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria and Moi University, Kenya, highlights the continent's significant research and awareness gap. Their work was published online in the Chinese Neurosurgical Journal on 1 February, 2025. Calling to attention the urgent need for better awareness on CTE, Dr. Muili, notes, "Without intervention, Africa is at risk of delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment which plagued the USA in the early 2000s, potentially straining healthcare systems and affecting public health outcomes in the continent." The African community has long engaged in contact sports such as boxing and rugby. Despite this, there are no recorded studies reporting the incidence or prevalence of CTE in Africa. The lack of awareness on CTE is very concerning as the community and healthcare system appears unprepared and unequipped to face this challenge. Medical professionals are unfamiliar with CTE and it is likely to go unreported or confused with other mental health problems or dementia. The authors highlight a significant research gap in CTE studies in Africa, pointing to the absence of large-scale epidemiological or clinical investigations. Even small-scale clinical case reports are rare, leaving CTE an unrecognized and underreported threat in the region. Comprehensive neuropathological evaluation—essential for confirming CTE—requires specialized facilities and trained professionals, both of which are limited across much of Africa. In the absence of such resources, CTE cases are more likely to be misinterpreted or overlooked altogether. Compounding this issue is the limited availability of research funding, which discourages efforts to launch clinical trials or retrospective studies. Cultural and religious resistance to post-mortem brain donation further hinders progress. However, in many African communities, including among the Zulu and Yoruba populations, brain donation remains a cultural taboo, limiting opportunities for pathological study. Improving on the existing medical curriculum to include the risk factors, symptoms, and disease pathology of CTE will ensure preparedness. They point out that local government should support CTE research by funding large-scale studies and recommend international collaborations to build local expertise. Ultimately, the authors issue a 'wake-up call' to both African and global health communities: addressing the CTE research gap now is critical to avoiding future strain on Africa's healthcare systems and to improving long-term outcomes for athletes at risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Macrophages are immune cells with a split personality: some fight tumors, while others help them grow. In breast cancer, most macrophages fall into the latter camp—dubbed M2-like—fueling tumor progression and dampening immune responses. This shift is influenced by the tumor microenvironment, where limited nutrients and oxygen force immune cells into a metabolic tug-of-war. One pathway under scrutiny is serine biosynthesis, regulated by the enzyme PHGDH. Though its role in metabolism is well documented, how PHGDH influences macrophage behavior has remained unclear. A collaborative team from Sun Yat-sen University and Zhejiang Cancer Hospital published a new study (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0398) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, revealing that the metabolic enzyme PHGDH plays a surprising role in breast cancer immunity. Instead of staying confined to metabolic pathways, PHGDH translocates into the nucleus of macrophages, where it suppresses genes key to glutamine metabolism. By doing so, it steers immune cells away from an immunosuppressive state and toward tumor-fighting behavior. They found that PHGDH expression is diminished in tumor-associated macrophages, and that these cells show reduced activity in serine biosynthesis and glycolysis—two pathways essential for immune activation. Remarkably, PHGDH was observed relocating to the nucleus during macrophage polarization. This suppression reined in glutamine metabolism, a key fuel source for M2-type immunosuppressive macrophages. To test function, the team manipulated PHGDH levels in both human and mouse macrophages. Mouse models showed that macrophages engineered to overexpress PHGDH slowed tumor growth and reduced cell proliferation. Further experiments revealed that glutamine supplementation or STAT3 inhibition could counteract PHGDH loss, reinforcing the regulatory loop between metabolism, transcription, and immune polarization. This study turns our understanding of PHGDH on its head. We've long known PHGDH as a metabolic enzyme, but to find it functioning inside the nucleus, directly regulating immune behavior, was unexpected. That's a paradigm shift in how we think about metabolism and immunity." The discovery that nuclear PHGDH reprograms macrophages offers a compelling new therapeutic strategy. By targeting PHGDH or its downstream partners, it may be possible to rewire the immune landscape of tumors—turning so-called "bad" macrophages into allies of cancer treatment. These findings could enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies, particularly in cancers resistant to checkpoint blockade. Moreover, PHGDH levels could serve as a biomarker to stratify patients or monitor treatment responses. Nuclear PHGDH regulates macrophage polarization through transcriptional repression of GLUD1 and GLS2 in breast cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that excess weight is linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women with cardiovascular disease. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. Although higher body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it's unclear whether this risk differs among women with and without cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. To investigate, a team led by Heinz Freisling, PhD, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization) analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and UK Biobank on 168,547 postmenopausal women who did not have, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate. After a median follow-up of 10.7 years in EPIC and 10.9 years in UK Biobank, 6,793 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer. The development of type 2 diabetes did not seem to affect breast cancer risk: women with or without type 2 diabetes had a similarly elevated breast cancer risk related to higher BMI. The combination of overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) and cardiovascular disease was estimated to lead to 153 more cases of breast cancer per 100,000 people per year than expected. The findings of this study could be used to inform risk-stratified breast cancer screening programs. This study should also inspire future research to include women with a history of cardiovascular diseases in weight loss trials for breast cancer prevention."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UCLA Health researchers have identified four distinct pathways that lead to Alzheimer's disease by analyzing electronic health records, offering new insights into how the condition develops over time rather than from isolated risk factors. Unlike previous research that focused on individual risk factors, the UCLA analysis mapped sequential diagnostic patterns that revealed how conditions progress step-by-step toward Alzheimer's disease. We found that multi-step trajectories can indicate greater risk factors for Alzheimer's disease than single conditions. Understanding these pathways could fundamentally change how we approach early detection and prevention." - Vascular disease pathway: Cardiovascular conditions that contribute to dementia risk The study found that approximately 26% of diagnostic progressions showed consistent directional ordering. For example, hypertension often preceded depressive episodes, which then increased Alzheimer's risk. "Recognizing these sequential patterns rather than focusing on diagnoses in isolation may help clinicians improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis," said lead author Dr. Timothy Chang, assistant professor in Neurology at UCLA Health. When validated in an independent population, these multi-step trajectories predicted Alzheimer's disease risk more accurately than single diagnoses alone. This finding suggests that healthcare providers could use trajectory patterns for: - Enhanced risk stratification: Identifying high-risk patients earlier in disease progression The validation in the All of Us Research Program - a diverse, nationally representative cohort - confirmed that these trajectory patterns apply across different populations and demographics. The team analyzed 5,762 patients who contributed 6,794 unique Alzheimer's progression trajectories. Using advanced computational methods including dynamic time warping, machine learning clustering, and network analysis, researchers mapped the temporal relationships between diagnoses leading to Alzheimer's disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Study: High diversity of dietary flavonoid intake is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic diseases. Increased flavonoid consumption is linked to better health outcomes, but the impact of broadening the range of flavonoids has not been studied. A recent paper published in Nature Food demonstrates the health-promoting effects of consuming multiple types of flavonoids and increasing the total quantity. Multiple flavonoid categories depend on the chemical structure, including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavon-3-ols, flavanones, and flavones. Multiple studies show that increased flavonoid consumption from different subclasses is associated with lower incidences of chronic disease. Different flavonoids have varying types of bioactivity, depending on bioavailability and metabolism. They are potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules, which may explain why they inhibit the development of chronic diseases driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Flavonoids are also heart-protective, improving endothelial structure and function and slowing down age-related tissue deterioration by inhibiting senescence pathways. Additionally, their suppression of cell proliferation is a key mechanism in preventing cancer. The study cohort included 124,805 UK adults aged 40 years or more, predominantly female (56%). Less than 10% smoked, but 60% were overweight or obese. The median flavonoid consumption was 792 mg/day, with nine flavonoids being consumed on average daily. Flavan-3-ols were the most significant component by far, at 87%. Other categories, anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavanones, made up 4.5% each, with flavones accounting for <1%. Black or green tea was the primary source of flavonoids, at 67%, while apples made up 6% and red wine 5%. Oranges, satsumas, orange juice, and dark chocolate each accounted for 1%. People with higher dietary flavonoids had less diversity overall, relying primarily on tea for their flavonoid intake. In contrast, those with a more diverse flavonoid consumption derived it from fruit and red wine. Those with the highest flavonoid diversity had a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality, a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and a 20% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence. No statistically significant association was observed for neurodegenerative disease with total flavonoid diversity. Quantitatively, compared to the lowest quintile, participants in the second quintile of flavonoid intake (about 500 mg/day) had a 16% lower risk of death from all-cause mortality. The risk of other diseases was lower by 9%-13%. For neurodegenerative disease, a 20% lower risk was observed only at the highest quintile of total flavonoid intake, not diversity. These associations remained after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and other medical risk factors. Although no statistical interactions were observed between diversity and quantity (Pinteraction > 0.05), both factors independently predicted disease outcomes, suggesting that higher intakes of both contribute more than either factor alone. In particular, an increased variety of flavan-3-ols and flavanones in the diet reduced the all-cause mortality independent of absolute intake. Quantitatively, the consumption of flavan-3-ols was linked to a stable reduction in mortality risk in the second and higher quintiles. Conversely, a lower chronic disease risk mainly appeared at the fourth or fifth quintile compared to the first. Class-wise, the most significant reductions included a 13% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus for flavan-3-ols and a 7% lower cancer risk for all flavanones. For flavones, an 18% lower risk of neurodegenerative disease and a 13% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus were observed at the highest quintiles. Similar benefits were observed for diversity in flavonoid-rich foods. Rather than consuming one or a few flavonoids in higher amounts, it is better to include a broad variety of flavonoid-rich foods. Prior research on flavonoid benefits has led to the recommendation that 400-600 mg of flavan-3-ols be consumed. This recommendation could potentially be modified to include the guideline that multiple sources be included in the diet for maximum benefit. The study also used a novel approach to measuring dietary diversity: applying Hill's effective number, a metric that accounts for both the variety and proportional intake of different flavonoid compounds. According to this study, mortality and chronic disease risk are reduced among people who had the greatest variety of flavonoids in their diet, both as foods and as specific subclasses. These results are biologically plausible due to the known ability of different flavonoids to suppress platelet aggregation and reduce atherosclerosis risk, increase insulin sensitivity and antioxidant capacity, and inhibit inflammation. They also antagonize cancer development processes by killing tumor cells and preventing their proliferation. “These findings suggest that consuming several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, may lower risk of all-cause mortality and chronic disease.” However, it is essential to note that this was an observational study, and while associations were strong, causation cannot be confirmed. Future studies should validate these findings and explore the sustainability of flavonoid-rich foods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike ADA1, which primarily functions intracellularly, ADA2 can be secreted or trafficked to lysosomes. Deficiency in ADA2 (DADA2) leads to systemic vasculitis marked by elevated TNF-α levels, excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and impaired differentiation of monocytes into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Research demonstrates that intracellular ADA2 localizes within endolysosomes of macrophages, and its reduction correlates with heightened TNF-α secretion. This suggests ADA2 modulates lysosomal adenosine levels, influencing inflammatory pathways. In pneumonia patients, elevated ADA2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) align with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, while cord blood exhibits low ADA2, fostering an immunosuppressive milieu. Secreted ADA2 binds apoptotic cells, reducing extracellular adenosine and activating immune responses, highlighting its dual intra- and extracellular roles in inflammation. CD16⁺ monocytes, key TNF-α producers, show lower intracellular ADA2 compared to classical CD16⁻ subsets. This disparity mirrors findings in DADA2 patients, where ADA2 deficiency leads to unregulated TNF-α release. CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) enhance ADA2 retention in lysosomes, potentially stabilizing the enzyme and dampening TNF-α production. Such dynamics underscore ADA2's role in balancing immune activation. Clinical data reveal ADA2 as a biomarker in pneumonia: BAL levels rise during acute phases and decline post-treatment, correlating with cytokine profiles. This positions ADA2 as a prognostic tool for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, ADA2 regulates lysosomal adenosine, which may influence DNA methylation and gene expression. ADA2 also binds apoptotic cells via interactions with DNA and proteoglycans, suggesting a role in resolving inflammation by clearing immunomodulatory adenosine. Experiments with THP-1 cells show adenosine-induced apoptosis, mitigated by ADA2's enzymatic activity. These findings propose ADA2 as a safeguard against cytotoxic adenosine accumulation, linking its intracellular activity to cell survival and immune homeostasis. GM-CSF reduces ADA2 levels, promoting M1 polarization and TNF-α secretion, while M-CSF sustains ADA2, favoring anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Enzyme replacement therapy shows limited efficacy, as extracellular ADA2 fails to curb TNF-α in DADA2 monocytes, emphasizing the importance of intracellular ADA2. Targeting lysosomal ADA2 activity emerges as a potential strategy to modulate macrophage polarization and inflammation. Elevated ADA2 in tuberculosis and HIV underscores its role in chronic infections, while low cord blood levels align with neonatal immune tolerance. The enzyme's dual function—lysosomal adenosine regulation and extracellular immune activation—positions it as a multifaceted therapeutic target. Future research could explore ADA2's interaction with nucleic acids and its impact on Toll-like receptor signaling, offering insights into autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Intracellular concentration of ADA2 is a marker for monocyte differentiation and activation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This multicenter study investigates the association between hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dosage and COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in China, aiming to clarify conflicting evidence from prior research. Leveraging data from multiple medical centers, the analysis focuses on determining whether low-dose HCQ confers mortality benefits with acceptable safety, contrasting with potential risks of higher doses. By systematically evaluating clinical outcomes across different HCQ dosage groups, the research seeks to provide evidence-informed guidance for antiviral therapy in COVID-19 management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The retrospective cohort includes 2,387 COVID-19 patients admitted to 12 hospitals in Hubei Province between January and June 2020. Baseline characteristics are compared across groups, with adjustments for age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), disease severity (mild, severe, critical), and concurrent medications (antibiotics, glucocorticoids). The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality, while secondary endpoints include treatment-related adverse events (AEs), such as QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Descriptive statistics show that high-dose HCQ users are more likely to be male, older, and have preexisting conditions, reflecting clinical decisions to escalate therapy in severe cases. Univariate analysis reveals significantly lower mortality in the low-dose HCQ group (15.2%) compared to non-HCQ (22.8%) and high-dose HCQ (28.9%) groups (p<0.001 for both comparisons). After propensity score matching (1:1:1 matching), the low-dose group maintains a survival advantage (adjusted HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.90, p=0.008), while the high-dose group exhibits higher mortality (HR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.67, p=0.018). Subgroup analyses by disease severity show consistent benefits of low-dose HCQ in severe (HR=0.72, p=0.023) and critical (HR=0.65, p=0.011) patients, but no significant effect in mild cases. Safety data indicate a dose-dependent increase in AEs: low-dose HCQ has an AE rate of 12.7%, comparable to non-HCQ (10.9%, p=0.21), while high-dose HCQ shows a significantly higher rate (22.4%, p<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression identifies high-dose HCQ (HR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.12-1.87, p=0.005) and older age (HR=1.08 per year, p<0.001) as independent risk factors for mortality, while low-dose HCQ (HR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, p=0.04) and early treatment initiation (within 5 days of symptom onset, HR=0.64, p=0.002) are protective. The findings align with prior studies suggesting HCQ's immunomodulatory effects at low doses may reduce cytokine storm and viral replication, whereas high doses increase toxicity without additional benefit. Mechanistically, HCQ's inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling and enhancement of autophagic antiviral responses are hypothesized to be dose-dependent, with therapeutic windows narrow enough to distinguish protective vs. toxic effects. Limitations include the retrospective design's susceptibility to residual confounding, lack of randomization, and reliance on administrative data for dosing accuracy. Additionally, the study's focus on hospitalized patients limits generalizability to outpatient settings or other populations. Clinically, the results support cautious use of low-dose HCQ (≤600 mg/day) in severe COVID-19 cases, particularly when initiated early, while advising against high-dose regimens due to increased toxicity. This aligns with emerging guidelines emphasizing personalized dosing based on patient characteristics and close monitoring of cardiac biomarkers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore HCQ's role in combination with other antiviral agents, such as remdesivir or nirmatrelvir. In summary, this study provides observational evidence that low-dose hydroxychloroquine is associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly those with severe illness, when administered within the first week of symptoms. Low dose of hydroxychloroquine is associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality: a multicenter study in China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By using a genetic technique developed at UT Southwestern Medical Center that forces cells to rid themselves of mitochondria, researchers are gaining new insights into the function of these critical organelles. Their findings, published in Cell, add to fundamental knowledge about the role of mitochondria in cells and evolution and could eventually lead to new treatments for patients with mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which can affect numerous organ systems. Jun Wu, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern Mitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms, including animals, plants, and fungi, whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They have their own genetic material, passed down exclusively through females of a species. Mitochondria are thought to have originated as prokaryotic cells – which lack membrane-bound organelles – and to have invaded ancestral eukaryotic cells and formed a symbiotic relationship with them. Researchers have long known that these organelles serve as cells' powerhouses, generating the energetic molecule adenosine triphosphate that fuels all cellular operations. However, recent studies have shown mitochondria play direct roles in regulating cell death, differentiating stem cells into other cell types, transmitting molecular signals, aging, and developmental timing. Although mitochondria appear to perform many of these roles through "crosstalk" with the DNA in a cell's nucleus, how they perform this function – and what happens if this crosstalk ceases – has been unknown. To help answer these questions, Dr. Wu, Dr. Schmitz, and their colleagues took advantage of a pathway called mitophagy that cells normally use to dispose of old or damaged mitochondria. Using genetic engineering, the researchers forced cells to degrade all their mitochondria – a process known as "enforced mitophagy." The researchers used this process on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), a type of cell typically formed early in development that can differentiate into other cell types. They had similar results with different types of mouse stem cells and hPSCs harboring a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation, suggesting enforced mitophagy can be a viable tool for depleting mitochondria across species and cell types. An analysis of the affected genes showed the hPSCs appeared to retain their ability to form other cell types and that they could partially compensate for the lack of mitochondria, with proteins encoded by nuclear genes taking over energy production and certain other functions typically performed by the missing organelles. Then the researchers, in an attempt to better understand crosstalk between mitochondria and the cell nucleus, fused hPSCs with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from humans' closest primate relatives – including chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan. Next, using enforced mitophagy, the scientists created hPSCs devoid of human mitochondria and fused them to non-human primate PSCs, again creating cells carrying nuclear genomes from both species, but this time only non-human mitochondria. An analysis of composite cells containing either human or non-human mitochondria showed that the mitochondria were largely interchangeable despite millions of years of evolutionary separation, causing only subtle differences in gene expression within the composite nucleus. Interestingly, the genes that differed in activity among cells harboring human and non-human mitochondria were mostly linked to brain development or neurological diseases. However, Dr. Wu said, more research – especially studies comparing neurons made from these composite PSCs – will be needed to better understand these differences. Finally, the researchers studied how depleting mitochondria might affect development in whole organisms. They used a genetically encoded version of enforced mitophagy to reduce the amount of mitochondria in mouse embryos, then implanted them into surrogate mothers to develop. However, those missing about a third of their mitochondria experienced delayed development, catching up to normal mitochondrial numbers and a typical developmental timeline by 12.5 days after fertilization. Together, the researchers say, these results serve as starting points for new lines of research into the different roles mitochondria play in cellular function, tissues and organ development, aging, and species evolution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diet may play a key role in maintaining vaginal health by shaping microbial composition through nutrient and metabolite interactions. Study: Dietary habits and vaginal environment: can a beneficial impact be expected? They found that women who consumed more animal protein, particularly processed and red meat, and alcohol, displayed a shift towards less healthy vaginal microbial communities, whereas those who consumed more of certain plant-derived nutrients, specifically α-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid found in nuts and seeds), showed more protective bacterial profiles. Moreover, higher intake of total carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch was negatively correlated with Gardnerella spp., suggesting these nutrients may help protect against vaginal dysbiosis. Researchers proposed animal protein might negatively impact the vaginal environment through mechanisms like increased inflammation or the production of ammonia/sulfides during fermentation, potentially raising vaginal pH. In reproductive-aged women, vaginal health is largely maintained by the presence of Lactobacillus species, which help prevent infections by inhibiting the growth of harmful microbes. When Lactobacillus levels drop and anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella and Prevotella, become dominant, a condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) can occur. BV is marked by shifts in vaginal metabolites and is linked to higher risks of sexually transmitted infections and complications during pregnancy. Advances in gene sequencing have allowed researchers to classify vaginal microbial communities into five community state types (CSTs). CSTs I, II, III, and V are dominated by different Lactobacillus species, with L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii considered protective. CST IV, in contrast, reflects a dysbiotic state associated with BV and is largely devoid of Lactobacillus. Although several factors such as sexual behavior, stress, and hormones are known to influence vaginal microbiota, the role of diet, especially macronutrient intake, has been understudied. Previous findings suggest that animal protein may increase the risk of BV, while higher fiber and carbohydrate intake could be protective. This study aims to elucidate the impact of dietary patterns on the vaginal microbial and metabolic environment in young women. Plant-derived omega-3 (α-linolenic acid) might interact with vaginal lactobacilli, possibly being converted into other fatty acids within the vaginal ecosystem, contributing to its beneficial effects. This cross-sectional study included 113 sexually active, non-pregnant women aged 19–30 from Italy. The goal was to determine associations between dietary patterns, microbiota composition, and vaginal metabolites. Participants were excluded if they had used antibiotics in the past month, were menstruating at the time of sampling, had chronic illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or urogenital infections, or had ever been pregnant. Each participant provided two self-collected vaginal samples during the late follicular phase. One was tested for sexually transmitted infections; the other was used for metabolomic analysis (1H-NMR spectroscopy) and microbiota profiling via 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial communities were classified into community state types (CSTs) using the VALENCIA tool, and Lactobacillus species were identified with high specificity using a custom reference database. Dietary intake over the past year was assessed through a validated food frequency questionnaire with 188 food items grouped into 24 categories. Statistical analyses included correlation studies, diversity indices, and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders such as stress, contraceptive use, age, and body mass index (BMI). Beneficial bacteria like L. crispatus were linked to specific protective compounds, including branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine) and the antioxidant 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, suggesting potential roles beyond just lactic acid production. The study analyzed the vaginal microbiota and dietary intake of 113 healthy young women with a median age of 21 years. Microbiota samples were categorized into CSTs, with CST I, II, and V dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, CST III by L. iners (considered a 'transitional' species with fewer protective capabilities), and CST IV by bacteria associated with vaginal dysbiosis (such as Gardnerella and Prevotella). CST IV exhibited higher microbial diversity and lower abundance of L. crispatus. Multinomial regression revealed that a higher balance of animal proteins (especially from processed and red meats) was significantly associated with CST IV, suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and animal protein consumption. Alcohol intake was also positively associated with CST IV and specifically correlated with higher levels of Gardnerella and Ureaplasma. Conversely, a greater intake of α-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid from plant sources, such as nuts and seeds) was negatively associated with CST III, suggesting a healthier L. crispatus-dominated environment. Moreover, higher intake of total carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch was negatively correlated with Gardnerella spp., suggesting these nutrients may help protect against vaginal dysbiosis. Correlation networks showed distinct relationships among bacteria, nutrients, and metabolites. For example, L. crispatus was positively associated with amino acids and beneficial metabolites (e.g., 4-hydroxyphenyllactate), while CST IV bacteria correlated with simple sugars (e.g., glucose) and alcohol intake. No significant association was found between Mediterranean diet adherence (as measured by the MEDI-LITE score) and microbiota composition. Network representing the Spearman correlation values among bacterial, metabolite and macronutrient abundances. Edges thickness is proportional to the correlation coefficient. This study highlights associations between dietary macronutrient intake and vaginal microbiota composition. Higher animal protein and alcohol intake were linked with CST IV, indicative of vaginal dysbiosis, while α-linolenic acid intake favored CSTs dominated by beneficial Lactobacillus species. Additionally, carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch demonstrated protective effects against dysbiosis-associated bacteria. These findings suggest diet may influence vaginal microbial balance through immune modulation, pH alteration, and bacterial translocation via the gut-vagina axis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, President Lee Ho Seong) has successfully developed a nanomaterial capable of simultaneously performing cancer diagnosis, treatment, and immune response induction. Compared to conventional nanomaterials that only perform one function, this new material significantly enhances treatment efficiency and is expected to serve as a next-generation cancer therapy platform utilizing nanotechnology. Currently, cancer treatments primarily include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, these treatments have significant limitations, as they not only affect cancerous areas but also cause damage to healthy tissues, leading to considerable side effects. Cancer treatment using nanomaterials has emerged as a next-generation technology that aims to overcome the limitations of conventional treatments. Additionally, personalized treatments based on individual genetic profiles are now possible, offering a therapy that significantly reduces side effects while improving effectiveness compared to traditional methods. The KRISS Nanobio Measurement Group has developed a new nanomaterial that not only allows real-time monitoring and treatment of cancerous areas but also activates the immune response system. The nanomaterial developed by the research team is a triple-layer nanodisk (AuFeAuNDs), with iron (Fe) inserted between gold (Au). PA is a technique that visualizes the vibrations (ultrasound) generated by heat when light (laser) is directed at the nanodisk. Furthermore, this nanodisk can perform three different therapeutic mechanisms in an integrated manner, which is expected to treat various types of cancer cells, unlike materials that are limited to single therapies. While conventional nanomaterials used only photothermal therapy (PTT), which involves heating gold particles to eliminate cancer cells, the nanodisk developed by the research team can also perform chemical dynamic therapy (CDT) by utilizing the properties of iron to induce oxidation within the tumor, as well as ferroptosis therapy. After treatment, the nanodisk also induces immune response substances. The developed nanodisk prompts cancer cells to release danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) when they die, which helps the body recognize the same cancer cells and attack them if they recur. In animal experiments, the research team confirmed that the generation of warning signals through the nanodisk led to an increase in immune cell count by up to three times. Unlike conventional nanomaterials, which are composed of a single element and perform only one function, the material developed in this study utilizes the combined properties of gold and iron to perform multiple functions." This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT's 'Next-Generation Advanced Nanomaterials Measurement Standard System Establishment Research Project' and was published in February in Chemical Engineering Journal (Impact Factor: 13.4).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The review introduces the molecular subtypes of breast cancer and outlines how altered amino acid metabolism supports tumor growth. It explores key amino acid pathways—including glutamine, serine, glycine, aspartate, arginine, and tryptophan—and their roles in energy production, redox homeostasis, biosynthesis, and immune modulation. It also highlights the involvement of specific transporters and enzymes, and discusses emerging clinical applications, such as metabolic imaging and personalized therapies based on metabolic dependencies. Amino acid metabolism is fundamentally linked to breast cancer subtype biology and therapeutic resistance. Different subtypes show distinct metabolic dependencies that can be exploited for targeted therapy. Understanding and manipulating these metabolic networks could pave the way for more effective, precision-based interventions in breast cancer care. The work entitled " Amino Acid Metabolism in Breast Cancer: Pathogenic Drivers and Therapeutic Opportunities " was published on Protein & Cell (published on Feb. 20, 2025).
