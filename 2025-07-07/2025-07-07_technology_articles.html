                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And if the deal flow in the past two months is any indicator — with Databricks buying Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up cloud management firm Informatica for $8 billion — momentum is building for more. The acquired companies may range in size, age, and focus area within the data stack, but they all have one thing in common. These companies are being bought in hopes the acquired technology will be the missing piece needed to get enterprises to adopt AI. Without it, there simply isn't value — a belief shared by enterprise VCs. In a TechCrunch survey conducted in December 2024, enterprise VCs said data quality was a key factor to make AI startups stand out and succeed. And this is where I believe you're seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy.” But is this strategy of snapping up companies built before a post-ChatGPT world the way to increase enterprise AI adoption in today's rapidly innovating market? The data industry has grown into a sprawling and fragmented web over the past decade — which makes it ripe for consolidation. From 2020 through 2024 alone, more than $300 billion was invested into data startups across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook data. The data industry wasn't immune to the trends seen in other industries like SaaS where the venture swell of the last decade resulted in numerous startups getting funded by venture capitalists that only targeted one specific area or were in some cases built around a single feature. The current industry standard of bundling together a bunch of different data management solutions, each with its own specific focus, doesn't work when you want AI to crawl around your data to find answers or build applications. It makes sense that larger companies are looking to snap up startups that can plug into and fill existing gaps in their data stack. Fivetran helps companies move their data from a variety of sources into cloud databases. For the first 13 years of its business, it didn't allow customers to move this data back out of said databases, which is exactly what Census offers. “Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they're actually pretty different,” Fraser said at the time. “This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible,” Mohan said. “We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions, you can do open source, they can go to Kafka, but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it's an overlap.” The broader market plays a role here, too, Mohan said. Data startups are struggling to raise capital, Mohan said, and an exit is better than having to wind down or load up on debt. For the acquirers, adding features gives them better pricing leverage and an edge against their peers. “If Salesforce or Google isn't acquiring these companies, then their competitors likely are,” Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don't know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].” This trend brings big benefits to the startups getting acquired. The venture market is starving for exits and the current quiet period for IPOs doesn't leave them a lot of opportunities. Getting acquired not only provides that exit, but in many cases it also gives these founding teams room to keep building. “At this point in time, acquisition has been a much more favorable exit strategy for them,” Hernandez said. And I think Informatica is a good example of that, where even with a bit of a haircut from where Salesforce was talking to them last year, it's still, you know, was the best solution, according to their board.” As Dhillon pointed out, the database companies being acquired weren't necessarily built to easily work with the rapidly changing AI market. “I don't know that a stand-alone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.” CoreWeave acquires data center provider Core Scientific in $9B stock deal Threads is nearing X's daily app users, new data shows</p>

But a leaked slide published on Sunday by X86 is dead&back reveals that the new CPU could feature up to 192 high-performance cores as well as eight or 16 DDR5 memory channels. Intel's rumored specs for the Xeon 7 'Diamond Rapids' processor include up to 192 cores, an eight-channel or 16-channel memory subsystem, and a thermal design power of 500W. We already know that Intel's Diamond Rapids processors will use 2nd Generation MRDIMM memory modules, which will support data transfer rates higher than 8800 MT/s supported by existing Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids.' If these next-generation processors support 12,800 MT/s memory modules, the entire memory subsystem of these CPUs would support a peak bandwidth of over 1.6 TB/s, representing a significant increase compared to existing designs (approximately 844 GB/s for Granite Rapids). If the slide accurately depicts Diamond Rapids, then the CPU will use up to six chiplets: up to four compute tiles (produced using Intel 18A fabrication process and packing up to 48 cores) and two I/O tiles that will control memory interfaces, PCIe 6.x lanes with or without CXL on top, UPI, and even additional PCIe 4.x lanes. Intel's Diamond Rapids processors for data centers will use high-performance cores based on the Panther Cove microarchitecture. The upcoming Xeon 7 'Diamond Rapids' processors will reportedly belong to the Oak Stream platform that will support one, two, or four sockets as well as PCIe Gen 6 interconnections. The CPUs will come in an LGA9324 package, which enables Intel to support up to 16 DDR5 memory channels and an unknown number of PCIe 6.x lanes as well as deliver up to 500W of power and considerably more at peaks. The slide says that Intel plans to release its Diamond Rapids processors in 2026. However, by now, Intel has not formally announced that the CPU has been taped in or powered on, which is a bit surprising. To that end, we can only wonder when in 2026 these processors will become available. Intel's Xeon 'Diamond Rapids' processor will have to compete against AMD's EPYC 'Venice' CPUs based on the Zen 6 architecture and featuring up to 256 cores.

In 2013, a trio of academics showed convincing evidence that increased trade with China beginning in the early 2000s and the resulting flood of cheap imports had been an unmitigated disaster for many US communities, destroying their manufacturing lifeblood. The results of what they called the “China shock” were gut-wrenching: the loss of 1 million US manufacturing jobs and 2.4 million jobs in total by 2011.If in retrospect all that seems obvious, it's only because the research by David Autor, an MIT labor economist, and his colleagues has become an accepted, albeit often distorted, political narrative these days: China destroyed all our manufacturing jobs! It's reflected in rising calls for US protectionism, President Trump's broad tariffs on imported goods, and nostalgia for the lost days of domestic manufacturing glory. Our editor at large David Rotman recently spoke to Autor about what he considers a far more urgent problem——what some are calling China shock 2.0—and the lessons it holds for today's manufacturing challenges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The fishermen of Puerto Morelos, on Mexico's Caribbean coast, risk their lives every time they head out to sea to fish or dive for lobsters. Their bounty is dependent on luck, as the weather often makes it impossible to go out, while on other days the hooks they cast come back empty. These workers set out every day to find the best lobsters possible for the affluent vacationers who come to the region, while they and their families, cut off from many of the benefits of tourism development, get by on fish full of microplastics. Omar Oslet Rivera-Garibay, a researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, documented the lives of these fishermen in a recent study. He and his colleagues report that while members of the Pescadores de Puerto Morelos fishing cooperative harvest and sell high-value seafood products to satisfy tourists' appetites, they are left with only the fish caught near the town's beaches for their own consumption. It has little commercial value and is contaminated with tiny plastic fragments. Contaminants were found in 57 percent of the fish, with over a thousand microplastic particles recovered. During the closed season, the cooperative's members only use methods such as this “rosary line” with multiple lures. Handline fishing is a traditional method that has long been used in the shallow waters near Puerto Morelos. It consists simply of a line and a hook, and can be used to catch fish such as croaker, which can be eaten but have little commercial value. Two other methods are used to catch more valuable species. A línea de rosario (“rosary line”) consists of multiple lines with a series of branched hooks, and is used in deeper waters, about 20 nautical miles from the coast. It is used to catch snapper, grouper, and pigfish. Lobster is caught by free divers using spearguns. The least-prized fish, containing more microplastics, are taken home by fishermen to feed their families; the high-value fish are sold to tourists here in the state of Quintana Roo, which each year receives more than 20 million visitors who spend more than $20 billion. Rivera-Garibay highlights the dangers of microplastics in fish. Microplastics contain potentially hazardous chemicals, such as plastic monomers and additives, and they absorb toxic contaminants from the environment, like harmful microbes and algae that may cause illnesses in humans,” Rivera-Garibay says. But while they are desperate to earn money, on the June day when I visited them, they preferred to spend the entire day sitting on dry land rather than earn ill-gotten gains from poaching. The pirates he speaks of don't have permission to fish and are overexploiting a limited resource, without facing any legal consequences. Fishing is taking place when it shouldn't, juveniles are being caught, and as a result, the lobster population is falling, says Sánchez. Ezequiel Sánchez Herrera learned to fish when he was a child, and ever since then he's always been near the sea. It generates around 150 million pesos, or $8 million, in revenue in the state, according to data from the National Aquaculture and Fisheries Commission (Conapesca). Tourists sunbathe while a tour operator disembarks from his boat. Fishermen usually catch it using spearguns while free diving, which is risky. According to Sánchez, one of the cooperative's members nearly died at the beginning of the year from decompression sickness, or “the bends.” He surfaced faster than he should have, causing nitrogen in his blood and tissues to form bubbles, which can damage tissues and block blood vessels. The closed season for lobster lasts for four months, and Sánchez and the other fishermen often find themselves struggling. “Sometimes people give me a hard time and ask why we are the only ones who respect the closed season. I need to make payroll every month, pay for the members' health insurance, and keep all the permits in order. Yesterday, one bastard got only 70 pesos [less than $4] because they came back with only a few kilos of fish, and today we couldn't go out at all because of the bad weather,” says Sánchez. If we sell them something today, they pay for it three months later. Actually, three months from when you send them the invoice. How could we survive as a cooperative like that? Imagine if I waited three months to pay a fisherman for what he brings in today,” Sánchez complains. Cooperatives like the one in Puerto Morelos need to sell their catches quickly due to the demands of their members, and also because of inadequate storage facilities, which are usually basic storage centers without freezers or ice machines. As the cooperatives struggle, they are being replaced by private actors, experts say, with large facilities and sufficient capital that allows them to export to foreign markets, including the United States and Asia. Whatever happens, Sánchez says that they will not go out to catch lobsters until July, when the closed season ends. This article was originally published by WIRED en Español.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ukrainian Major General Vladyslav (Владислав Клочков) Klochkov says Russia is field-testing a deadly new drone that can use AI and thermal vision to think on its own, identifying targets without coordinates and bypassing most air defense systems. With the Jetson Orin as its brain, the upgraded MS001 drone doesn't just follow prescribed coordinates, like some hyper-accurate doodle bug. “It identifies targets, selects the highest-value one, adjusts its trajectory, and adapts to changes — even in the face of GPS jamming or target maneuvers,” says Klochkov. Even worse, the MS001 is allegedly operating in coordinated drone groups, persisting in its maximum destructive purpose despite the best efforts of Ukraine's electronic warfare and other anti-drone systems. We are fighting inertia.” What he appears to wish for is an acceleration of Ukraine's own assault drone capabilities. The Major General seems particularly disappointed in the Ukrainian system of procurement rounds, slowing field-testing and deployment of improved responses to new Shahed drone generations. Shahed drones are originally an Iranian design but have gained great notoriety due to their sustained use by the Russian army to attack Ukrainian targets. Western tech sanctions are supposed to neuter this kind of military threat from nations like Russia and Iran. This news indicates that such trade barriers are leaky, at best, and probably not taken seriously enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using the Ohio liberal arts school's student directory, they found students' home addresses and looked them up on Zillow to see how much their families' homes cost. “It became a kind of controversial thing that people were talking about,” says Kornman, 25. While some found it endlessly entertaining to dive into the finances of a student body where almost one in five students come from families in the top 1 percent, the popular pastime struck a nerve with a particular crowd. '” But she found out that one of the main crusaders against the resource was a student who grew up in a multimillion-dollar home in SoHo, Manhattan. And another student who, she says, was “outwardly saying that they were broke and they grew up in poverty” was just one Zillow search away from being found out. Zillow, the hugely popular and addictive real-estate platform launched in 2006, has gone from simply a tool to buy and sell homes to a full-fledged phenomenon. It's used by 227 million unique visitors every month and had 2.4 billion visits in just the first quarter of 2025. (The company has such a vice-grip on real estate listings, it was recently sued by Compass for its alleged attempted monopoly on online home listings.) It's calculated using “millions of data points” including public records, MLS (multiple listing service) feeds, tax assessments, recent sales, and updates provided directly from homeowners, according to Claire Carroll, a spokesperson for Zillow. Carroll says the estimates are fairly accurate, with a median error rate nationwide of just under 2 percent for on-market homes and 7 percent for off-market homes. The price history, which includes dates of past sales with corresponding prices, is sourced through public property records, county tax assessors, and local MLS. Zillow also provides an estimation of monthly rent for rental units. Zillow does not give users the option to hide their home's Zestimate and price history. “Open access to this kind of public information is a really important part of a fair housing market,” says Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert. Like Kornman, Gillian Williams, 27, took up this pastime in college, using a database provided by her school, the University of Delaware. “It was just interesting to be like, ‘Oh my gosh, I didn't know you're from—your parents own a multimillion dollar house in the Hamptons,'” she says. “Years ago I went over to a new friend's apartment, and immediately on my walk home I was looking up how much she probably paid and then doing a little bit of math to be like, ‘Well, if you're paying that much money for rent, what is your salary? She says she based her calculation on the widely accepted idea that people should spend a maximum of 30 percent of their monthly income on housing. Salary is just one of the insights she's gained through extrapolating data from Zillow. “It's kind of an easy way to find out if their family is helping them pay,” she says. And after discovering how much a friend paid in rent, she asked how they manage to pay their bills and learned that they were struggling with significant credit card debt. Vivian Tu, a financial literacy content creator and author known as @yourrichbff on TikTok and Instagram, says young people today are particularly susceptible to spending outside of their budget. “I think a huge part of that is the comparison game. Back in our parents' generation, we had ‘keeping up with the Joneses,'” she says. “All of a sudden you're not comparing yourself to people who are relatively your net-worth equal. You're comparing yourself to everybody on Earth, and you are starting to see levels of insurmountable wealth, like unimaginable wealth, that the vast majority of us will never ever obtain,” says Tu. Today's young adults came of age in a moment marked by a growing backlash towards income inequality and an unfettered class of billionaires, a sentiment reflected in the popularity of shows like Succession and The White Lotus. Zillow's public pricing details give people who want to gawk at or mock the rich an opportunity to do just that within their inner circles. Anna Goldfarb, author of Modern Friendship, says these discoveries can lead people to make assumptions and judgments about their friends' priorities. So there's a real risk here of looking deeply into finances, because you're sort of putting your friendship on the line, like, ‘Do we share values?' It's not that explicit, but it's definitely implied that, well, if you know your friend is in debt and makes terrible financial choices, and then you look up her home on Zillow, you're going to make all sorts of judgments about that,” Goldfarb says. But knowing that a friend appears to be doing well because they're getting a lot of help can also ease people's insecurities rather than just stoke them. New York Magazine recently reported that nearly half of parents in the US provide financial support to their adult children and that, among American adults under 43, only about one-third support themselves without help from their parents. But despite the fact that parent-subsidized lifestyles have become commonplace, a sense of shame and secrecy surrounding generational wealth persists. “There's such a lack of financial transparency in our world,” Barker says. “You have no idea if they pulled all of their money from all of their retirement accounts, if somebody helped them, if they borrowed money from a friend or somebody else and then planned on paying them back. “We don't actually have a clear financial picture of how they were able to make that happen.” “I love shows like House Hunter and anything on HGTV,” says Andrea Zlotowitz, 35. “I recognize that there are some sensitivities talking about money and knowing what people spend on things,” says Zlotowitz. “So it's certainly not something that I would later bring up to a friend, but it lives rent-free in the back of my mind.” Regardless, some think this behavior is within the bounds of the new social contract brought on by the information age: I can learn anything I want about you, and you can learn anything you want about me—we just won't talk about it. One person even likened it to vetting people before a first date. There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin</p>
