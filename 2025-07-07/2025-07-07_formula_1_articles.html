                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 British Grand Prix: Best race start onboards Lewis Hamilton assessed the British Grand Prix as a “difficult race”, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that his Ferrari had been a “very hard car to drive” in the mixed conditions at Silverstone. After showing flashes of strong pace during the weekend, Hamilton lined up in P5 on the grid for his home race and suggested that he would not give up hope of a podium. That dream very nearly came true as the 40-year-old found himself in fourth and chasing down third-placed Nico Hulkenberg in the latter stages of the Grand Prix, before ultimately missing out on the rostrum by just over five seconds. Sharing his reflections after jumping out of the car, Hamilton said: “[It was a] difficult race, not a great one from my side. Not ideal, but we got some points at least.” Hamilton's pace appeared to drop off slightly as he embarked on a second stint on the intermediate tyres before switching to the soft compound in the final phase. Asked to summarise that segment of the race, he explained: “The tyres [were] dropping off, the car doesn't like low-speed corners, lots of understeer, and I started knocking out the left front and then just couldn't keep up.” Despite the disappointment of missing out on a top-three result, Hamilton could still take the positives from racing in front of his home crowd. “They've been incredible this weekend and it's been amazing to see so many people switch to red and, yeah, got some points.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 British Grand Prix: Best race start onboards Max Verstappen faced a tough afternoon at the British Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver dropping backwards after a spin before recovering to fifth place. Max Verstappen has given his take on a “very difficult race” at the British Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver admitting that he had “no pace” on an afternoon that saw him recover to P5 following a spin at the second Safety Car restart. After lining up in pole position, Verstappen initially led before being overtaken by McLaren's Oscar Piastri on Lap 8 of 52. From there Verstappen embarked on a recovery drive and crossed the line in fifth place, while Lando Norris took victory ahead of Piastri and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg. “It was just a very difficult race for us, but even after that spin I had no pace,” the four-time World Champion conceded when reflecting on his race. “I was just stuck with that group and it was just very difficult to drive, and naturally of course we knew that it was going to be difficult in the wet with that [low downforce] rear wing that we had on the car. “But even then I think we were still struggling a lot, and even also in the last few laps on the slick tyres were quite a handful to drive. A few things to look at of course, but we were no match anyway with the McLarens, and on the other hand when we have a difficult day we try to of course collect the points. In terms of what the approach would be going forward – after a weekend in which a strong Qualifying performance was followed by a tougher race day – Verstappen said: “Just go to the next one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Russell and Kimi Antonelli reflect on their British Grand Prix experiences from a very wet Silverstone. George Russell was left to rue a British Grand Prix where "everything went wrong at every single point", as Mercedes had a race to forget at Silverstone. The Briton came home in 10th place on Sunday, having started fourth, as the Silver Arrows' gambles failed to pay off in a Grand Prix that saw a mid-race rain shower, two Virtual Safety Car periods and two full Safety Cars. With Fernando Alonso having pitted for slicks half a lap before, it became apparent that Alonso was struggling and soon Russell was also in a similar position. In the end he did hold onto P10 at the flag, which was a small consolation from a very disappointing Grand Prix. “Everything just went wrong at every single point to be honest,” Russell explained. "I feel at the beginning, pitting to slicks was not a stupid decision as we knew it was going to be dry for 25 minutes. “But we had 15 minutes' worth of [Virtual] Safety Car and that didn't allow us to warm the tyres, it didn't allow us to [utilise] the gains of when it was dry. “Then at the end maybe I called to pit one or two laps early, but I wasn't expecting the hard tyre and of course then it all just went wrong. Really disappointing day, if you play it safe, you'll come home with a safe result and that's not really what we were going for.” Despite having a new set of mediums, Mercedes didn't fit those or any of the softs onto Russell's car – which Lance Stroll used to good effect in the early stages of the race. And, as Nico Hulkenberg showed with his run from P19 to third, there were big points available to anyone who made the right calls in a dramatic race. At the moment unfortunately we don't have that luxury." So yeah, just a shame to have ended with another DNF.”</p>
