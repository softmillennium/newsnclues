Democrats and media outlets across the country have been quick to politicize the devastating flooding in Texas that killed at least 91 people by blaming climate change, President Trump, race and government cuts. "It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent," former Washington Gov. "I think climate change is obviously a part of it," Dem. "And they surely exist, in & out of government. But cutting vital services like the weather service has predictable, hazardous consequences – especially when catastrophic weather events are becoming more frequent!" Democrats and media outlets across the country have been quick to politicize the devastating flooding in Texas that killed over 90 people by blaming climate change, President Trump and race. "Accurate weather forecasting helps avoid fatal disasters," Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X in response to reports that a specific meteorologist position in the area was unfilled at the time of the flood. "There are consequences to Trump's brainless attacks on public workers, like meteorologists." Murphy was one of several critics on the left to invoke Trump's name. "It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week," Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X. "The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott," added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into "the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service." Crews work to clear debris from the Cade Loop bridge along the Guadalupe River on Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Ingram, Texas. "We saw the affects (sic) this weekend," Martin wrote on X. "Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. The result was predictable: A bad forecast leading to the death of children in a horrific flood," added California state Sen. Scott Wiener. "These jobs are meant to coordinate disaster response and save lives." "The Big Ugly Bill's elimination of climate action laws and cutbacks in the National Weather Service couldn't come at a worse time as the deadly flooding in Texas has shown," Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., posted on X. "Those incidents are likely to get worse as Republicans ignore the reality of climate change." Several meteorologists have pushed back in recent days on Democratic claims that Trump administration cuts to NOAA, NWS and other government agencies directly contributed to the tragedy. "The event has nothing to do with climate change," meteorologist Chris Martz posted on X. "And, the tragedy had nothing to do with DOGE cuts.If you are someone who has exploited this catastrophe because you just don't like Trump, you need to take a serious look in the mirror." Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and "they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm," but he added that unfilled leadership positions were "clearly a concern." A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt & Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb," said Texas-based meteorologist Avery Tomasco. First responders scan the banks of the Guadalupe River for individuals swept away by flooding in Ingram, Texas, Friday, July 4, 2025. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it "shameful and disgusting" to see that, in the wake of this tragedy, people are politicizing what took place. ﻿"It's shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left's first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts and other public reporting," Jackson said. "The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance. The Trump administration is grateful to the first responders who sprung into action to save hundreds of lives during this catastrophe, and will continue to help the great state of Texas in their recovery efforts."

(AP Photo/Chris Seward) CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — A woman was killed when floodwaters from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal swept her car from a rural road and forced dozens of people to flee their homes, officials in North Carolina said Monday. Multiple swift water rescues were conducted in Alamance, Orange, Chatham and Durham counties overnight and several areas have declared local states of emergency, officials said. About 120 roads were closed Monday across the state, but several major roads had reopened, including parts of Interstate 40 and 85 in Alamance County, according to Gov. An 83-year-old Pittsboro woman was killed when her car was swept off a rural Chatham County road by floodwaters on Sunday night, according to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. The Chapel Hill Fire Department and neighboring agencies completed more than 50 water rescues, many of them in areas where floodwaters entered or threatened to enter apartments, officials said. I don't want to go through that again.” Floodwaters inundated Chapel Hill's Eastgate Crossings shopping center, where the red-framed glass doors of a Talbots store were blown in and debris-specked white mannequins littered the floor. Next door, at the Great Outdoor Provision Co., manager Chad Pickens said kayaks ended up 30 feet from where they had been on display and shelves in the shoe room were toppled like dominoes. “The bottom line is these are just things, and while it hurts to lose things, it's a lot different to losing people,” Pickens said. Hua Jiang said he put in an order at the Shake Shack around 8:45 p.m. Sunday and about 10 minutes later, water started flowing through the doors. “It's unfortunate, but that's life,” Jiang said, wiping sweat from his brow on Monday morning. A facility used to service local government vehicles in Carrboro, a town near Chapel Hill, was also significantly damaged as rushing floodwaters rose more than 3 feet (about 1 meter), the town's public works director, Kevin Belanger, said at a news conference Monday. Several solid waste trucks and police cars were totaled from the storm, he said. In Chatham County, authorities were searching Monday for two canoers who went missing during the storm, according to a county sheriff's office news release. They were last seen launching their canoe on Jordan Lake late Sunday afternoon and their canoe was recovered Sunday night, authorities said. That level was only eclipsed by Hurricane Fran in 1996 when the stage reached 32.83 feet (10.01 meters), according to a post from the National Weather Service's Raleigh office. Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression Sunday after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Flood watches were in effect for parts of eastern Virginia, southern and eastern Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. Forecasters warned of dangerous surf and rip currents at beaches from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states for the next couple of days.</p>

Marites Buenafe, 62, of Kentucky, was visiting Alaska's capital city when she did not return from a hike. The Alaska Department of Public Safety said her body was found by an Alaska Army National Guard helicopter crew late Thursday below the ridge line of Gold Ridge. Marites Buenafe, 62, is listed as a doctor for UK HealthCare. State troopers and Juneau Mountain Rescue were able to recover Buenafe's body with help from Temsco Helicopters and the National Guard. The Norwegian Bliss cruise ship passes through John Hopkins Inlet in Glacier Bay, Alaska on Thursday, July 11, 2019. On July 1, the Juneau Police Department heard from Buenafe's relatives that she had left for a hike that morning and had plans to take a popular tourist tram partially up a mountain overlooking downtown Juneau before walking to Gastineau Peak and Gold Ridge, according to the state Department of Public Safety. She had gotten off the Norwegian Bliss and did not return to the vessel by its departure time. The 62-year-old woman's relatives called authorities after she failed to return to the cruise ship as it was docked in Juneau, Alaska. "We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the guest," a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Our CARE team is providing support to the guest's family and our thoughts are with them during this difficult time."

The decision to end TPS for the two nations comes weeks after DHS terminated the same status for Haiti and months after terminating TPS for Venezuelans. A federal judge has since blocked that termination amid an ongoing legal battle. "Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News Digital. "It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago." President Donald Trump speaks with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem as they tour a migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida, on July 1, 2025. "Honduran citizens can safely return home, and DHS is here to help facilitate their voluntary return," Noem said. "Honduras has been a wonderful partner of the Trump Administration, helping us deliver on key promises to the American people. We look forward to continuing our work with them." Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) told Fox News Digital that revoking TPS will affect roughly 76,000 migrants currently living in the U.S., with 72,000 from Honduras and 4,000 from Nicaragua. "The impacts of a natural disaster impacting Nicaragua in 1999 no longer exist," a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "The environmental situation has improved enough that it is safe enough for Nicaraguan citizens to return home. This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that TPS remains temporary." DHS sources have informed Fox that Nicaraguans and Hondurans in the U.S. with TPS are being encouraged to use the CBP One app to facilitate a secure departure, including a complimentary plane ticket and a $1,000 exit bonus. Greg Abbott, discuss the ongoing efforts for recent flooding along the Guadalupe River during a news conference in Ingram, Texas, on Saturday. Created by Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS allows individuals from countries affected by natural disasters, war, or other dangerous, unusual circumstances to seek refuge in the U.S. This program can be renewed in 18-month increments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security has moved to terminate a form of humanitarian relief for migrants from Nicaragua and Honduras residing in the United States, according to an announcement from the department and draft notices published in the Federal Register. The Trump administration has stripped protections from multiple nationalities in the US who were protected from deportation and allowed to temporarily live in the country, arguing that conditions at home no longer justified those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, has prompted legal challenges nationwide — and has been blocked by federal judges in some instances. The latest move would affect approximately 72,000 migrants from Honduras and 4,000 from Nicaragua, according to government estimates. Honduras was initially designated for TPS in 1999 based on an environmental disaster, according to a draft notice in the Federal Register. Nicaragua was similarly designated for TPS in 1999 because of an environmental disaster. “Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that — temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago.” TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore the protections are limited to people already in the United States. Past Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections, though some Republicans have argued the relief shouldn't have been extended multiple times.</p>

Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on a drive-by shooting outside a Chicago nightclub that left multiple casualties and injuries on ‘The Faulkner Focus.' During a bloody Fourth of July weekend, more than 50 people were shot and six killed in Chicago, a notorious hot spot for violent crime. Several mass shootings and drive-by shootings accounted for the violence that occurred between midnight on Thursday, July 3, and Sunday night, according to ABC 7, which tracked the violence. On Saturday morning alone, a mass shooter injured four, three critically, in a drive-by attack in the city's Little Village neighborhood. Several suspects inside an SUV opened fire on the victims while they sat in their own vehicle, according to the report.

A 30-year-old man was then found dead with a gunshot wound to the head on the city's West Side. Within the span of minutes on Friday night, police reportedly responded to a spate of shootings, all on Chicago's South Side. The Chicago Fire Department cleans up the crime scene where numerous people were wounded in a shooting at Artis Restaurant and Lounge at 311 W. Chicago Avenue on July 3, 2025. A 36-year-old man identified as Marco A. Velasquez-Sierra was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head, according to the report, and nobody is in custody following that shooting. Around the same time, two unidentified male suspects opened fire on a crowd of people, injuring seven, two critically. No one is in custody following that shooting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 10 people have died and 29 people have been injured in anti-government protests across Kenya on Monday, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Kenyan police used tear gas and water cannon on protesters marking the 35th anniversary of a pro-democracy rally that has stirred anti-government resentment among Kenyan youths, who were already enraged over allegations of corruption, police brutality and abductions of government critics. The East African country has been hit by a wave of bloody protests that began last year over an unpopular finance bill that raised taxes amid a cost-of-living crisis. At least 16 people were killed and hundreds injured during anti-government protests last month. Dozens more died during the anti-tax demonstrations in 2024. On Monday, several parts of Kenya saw gatherings as people marked the anniversary of the July 7, 1990, pro-democracy march known as Saba Saba. At least 37 people were arrested across 17 of Kenya's counties, according to the KNCHR. In the capital Nairobi, Kenyan security forces repelled protesters with tear gas and water cannon hours after blocking major roads leading into the city. Earlier in the day, police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga told CNN he was unaware of any deaths. CNN affiliate Citizen TV reported that at least five people were shot dead in protests across the country, including two people who were shot dead in the Kangemi neighborhood of Nairobi. Video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows a civilian in Kenya's Kiambu County stepping out of a car surrounded by armed officers, and then being whipped repeatedly by one of them. The civilian covers their head to protect themself, but does not appear to be threatening the officer in any way. “We are not ready to go back (home) because who will fight for our rights then? We will be here till evening,” protester Francis Waswa told Reuters. Related article 16 dead and hundreds injured in Kenya protests, Amnesty International says In a statement on Sunday night, the human rights body said those who entered the building “violently disrupted a press conference by Kenyan mothers calling for an end to arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings targeting protesters ahead of Saba Saba demonstrations.” Earlier on Sunday, Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said security agencies were “on high alert to deal decisively with criminals and other elements of ill intent who may seek to infiltrate peaceful processions to cause havoc, mayhem, or destruction of property.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Joe Biden was implored by his closest advisers to participate in his ill-fated debate against now-President Donald Trump, which ended his campaign and precipitated former Vice President Kamala Harris replacing him as the 2024 Democratic nominee. In a six-page memo, dated April 15, Biden's advisers underscored how the then-president should debate Trump “as early as possible” because the Commission on Presidential Debates schedule would have started on Sept. 16 when many battleground states had already commenced early voting and voter registration deadlines would have passed. The advisers also suggested that Biden debate Trump twice during his campaign and agree to a plan with his opponent as quickly as possible so he could “enter the debate process from a position of strength.” The memo, poised to be published in Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf's upcoming book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, additionally detailed advice regarding debate preparation in “three parts.” “Intensive prep in the lead up to the debate, similar to what was done around [State of the Union]-prep — we would build out debate prep at Camp David for at least a five-day stretch leading up to YOUR debate appearances,” Biden's advisers wrote. Instead, Biden's June 27 debate against Trump punctuated the public perception the former president was too old to remain commander in chief, walking stiffly onto the CNN set, coughing twice during his first answer, and then losing his train of thought within the first 15 minutes in response to a question about the care economy and drug prices. He, too, was captured looking at Trump with his mouth agape. Despite the memo, Dawsey, Pager, and Arnsdorf simultaneously report that the advice that Biden should debate Trump as early as possible was not unanimous. One donor reportedly told Biden's advisers to “find an excuse” for the former president not to debate after a concerning appearance during a Chicago fundraiser, the trio writes in an excerpt published by Politico on Monday. 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America comes after the Wall Street Journal reported last weekend that Hunter Biden asserted his presence in his father's White House, attempting to pressure the Democratic National Committee into paying his legal fees amid federal prosecutions for tax and gun crimes, participating in administration phone calls, and encouraging his father to pardon him as he did before the end of his one and only term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sent a letter to Department of Commerce acting Inspector General Roderick Anderson, asking him to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service affected the response to the tragic Texas floods. There have been questions about whether NWS staff cuts due to the Trump administration's cost-saving mission could have led to a slower response to the floods, though the Department of Homeland Security has strongly rejected those claims. At least 82 people are dead from a deluge that hit central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend. Among the 82 dead are nearly two dozen children, most from Camp Mystic, a summer camp near the Guadalupe River. “Following the disastrous and deeply devastating flash flooding in Texas this weekend, I urge you to immediately open an investigation into the scope, breadth, and ramifications of whether staffing shortages at key local National Weather Service (NWS) stations contributed to the catastrophic loss of life and property during the deadly flooding,” Schumer wrote in the Monday letter. Experts previously warned that cutting staff or funds to NOAA could lead to more weather-related deaths because of slower warnings and less accurate forecasts. They explained that positions such as warning coordination meteorologist, science officer, hydrologist, and other vital forecasting, meteorology, and coordination roles were vacant. “The roles left unfilled are not marginal, they're critical. These are the experts responsible for modeling storm impacts, monitoring rising water levels, issuing flood warnings, and coordinating directly with local emergency managers about when to warn the public and issue evacuation orders. To put it plainly: they help save lives,” Schumer wrote. However, the same outlet also reported that the failure to adopt a new local warning system, or “last mile” efforts, also contributed to residents not seeing the many alerts from NWS. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the New York Times that the “timely and accurate forecasts and alerts for Texas this weekend prove that the NWS remains fully capable of carrying out its critical mission.”Independent experts denied that the forecasting or warnings were insufficient. It's always about getting people to receive the message,” Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist based in Wisconsin, told NBC News. Nevertheless, Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, seemed to blame the NWS for inaccurate rainfall forecasts. “The amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts,” he said. As a result of all the rain, dangerous flash floods occurred. Flash floods can overwhelm places with water very quickly. Camp Mystic was one of the most affected sites, and its director, Dick Eastland, reportedly gave his life while trying to save children from the flooding. Trump said he will visit Texas on Friday to survey the flood damage. “I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies. … That's part of what I mean,” Castro said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — The Justice Department‘s Civil Rights Division is undergoing a complete internal transformation under President Donald Trump's second term — not just of enforcement strategy but of personnel, institutional practices, and long-held assumptions about how federal civil rights laws should be applied. “When my memos went out, that culture changed,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the division, told the Washington Examiner in an exclusive interview. Dhillon explained to the Washington Examiner that many of the attorneys who left had worked under previous Democratic administrations and were not receptive to Trump's directives. “People are very upset with that — a lot of the career staff,” Dhillon said. She said she delivered clear guidance to the division's more than 400 attorneys and support staff within weeks of taking office about new enforcement priorities aligned with Trump administration directives. “We all know what the laws are, but within those laws, prosecutors and government lawyers have discretion as to their goals and their priorities,” Dhillon said. Dhillon said the decision has had sweeping implications for how the federal government oversees civil rights compliance across education, employment, and federal contracting. That decision “made clear it is illegal to discriminate against anybody, not just minorities, in hiring,” she said. Her office is investigating the University of California system's “UC 2030 Capacity Plan,” which includes diversity-based faculty recruitment goals. While her division has not made any final determinations about UC, she suggested that other institutions may soon face scrutiny. Others, such as Harvard, remain “recalcitrant” and are suing the United States, she said. In late May, Dhillon's office announced it was pulling out of proposed consent decrees with police departments in Minneapolis and Louisville — two cities that had been under federal investigation following the high-profile police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which led to a summer of riots and unrest in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Those consent decrees, initiated during the Biden administration, were intended to impose federal oversight over local law enforcement, including mandatory reforms to training, discipline, and officer recruitment. “These were based on cherry-picked statistics and flawed legal theories,” she said. She cited the high court's recent decision in the United States v. Skrmetti, which upheld Tennessee's ban on transgender procedures for minors under rational basis review. “There's a rational basis for protecting children from irreversible harm,” she said. Despite the limited holding in Skrmetti, which applies mainly to states seeking to fortify laws protecting children from gender alteration procedures, she also suggested the decision's reasoning could likely influence other areas of law. I think the Supreme Court has answered that in at least one context, and I think that context is going to be easily translatable into other areas.” Trump himself chose to pardon 23 people convicted of violating the FACE Act, a law that has come under intense scrutiny from the Right due to allegations of its uneven application against anti-abortion advocates' First Amendment protections to protest outside clinics. Still, Dhillon contended that FACE Act prosecutions have occurred — even under Biden — against perpetrators who attack faith-based pregnancy centers, underscoring that an important pillar going forward is that the FACE Act can and should be utilized against “houses of worship.” “It's an important law as well, and so we aren't going to be criminalizing speech that doesn't rise to the level of interference. OK, so that's my promise,” she said, adding, “There is a cultural shift that has to happen outside the building, but inside the building, we're not going to be abusing those laws now.” One day after Dhillon's interview, the Supreme Court announced it would hear two more cases that could define the next chapter in civil rights law: Little v. Hecox and B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education, both of which ask whether state laws banning biological male athletes in female sports violate the Constitution or Title IX. The eventual rulings in the girls' sports cases next term could clarify whether gender identity is covered under federal education law, a key question for DOJ oversight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgia Republicans are sounding alarms over Derek Dooley's floated Senate bid, calling the former football coach's potential run a risky distraction in what many see as the GOP's top pickup opportunity of 2026. Dooley, a former Tennessee football coach and son of University of Georgia legend Vince Dooley, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in early June that he plans to decide in the coming weeks whether to enter the Republican primary. Several GOP operatives, lawmakers, and strategists interviewed by the Washington Examiner questioned Dooley's political experience, name recognition, and fundraising ability, warning that another untested candidate could risk a top-tier pickup and complicate the party's efforts to grow its narrow Senate majority. But insiders caution that the stakes are too high to risk nominating a political newcomer in what's expected to be one of the cycle's most expensive and competitive races. So far, three candidates have officially entered the race: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), state Insurance Commissioner John King, and activist Reagan Box. Several others are weighing bids, including Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA) and Rich McCormick (R-GA), Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and state Sen. Greg Dolezal. One conservative activist argued the current lineup has failed to inspire confidence. “And whoever thought up the Derek Dooley idea must be trying to pull a prank.” Brian Kemp, who recently took himself out of the running for Senate. “He's a guy whose fame was being fired by Georgia's biggest rival 14 years ago,” the operative said. “On its surface, I have no concept of what the narrative would be.” That year, GOP leaders backed Kelly Loeffler over Trump's preferred pick, then-Rep. Doug Collins. She lost to Democrat Raphael Warnock in a runoff, while Jon Ossoff defeated David Perdue, giving Democrats control of the chamber. With Trump back in the White House and Republicans aiming to protect and expand their Senate majority, party strategists say they can't afford another mistake. “All a Dooley candidacy does, in my mind at this point, is make it more confusing,” said Jay Morgan, a veteran of Georgia GOP politics. “It doesn't bring any clarity to how Republicans get this seat and thereby make it more likely we keep the Senate majority in January 2027.” Despite Kemp's support, Morgan argued that Dooley lacks the grassroots base and broad appeal needed to break through a crowded primary. Unlike Herschel Walker, who entered with star power, Dooley starts from “ground zero.” After two bruising Senate losses, Morgan warned, Republicans shouldn't take chances. He added that Dooley likely wouldn't be in the mix if Brian Kemp weren't governor and questioned, “How much of the governor's political capital is he willing to loan him?” He went on to lead programs at Louisiana Tech and Tennessee, where he was fired in 2012 after three losing seasons, including a loss to rival Vanderbilt. Since then, he's held assistant coaching roles with the Miami Dolphins, Dallas Cowboys, University of Missouri, New York Giants, and most recently served as an offensive analyst at the University of Alabama. Should Dooley choose to enter the race, he wouldn't be venturing into uncharted territory. Now, as talk of a Senate run swirls, Dooley's backers are framing him as the kind of outsider who could defy expectations, much like others who've shaken up Georgia politics before. “It shouldn't surprise anyone that political consultants and politicians hate the idea of an outsider shaking up the race for U.S. Senate and are already attacking someone who hasn't even announced their candidacy,” said Cody Hall, a senior adviser to Gov. Dooley's team says he has held meetings with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and engaged with “many people and organizations” as he explores a potential Senate bid. While some Georgia Republicans remain deeply skeptical, others are urging caution, pointing to Kemp's long record of defying expectations. The operative added, “It would be a mistake for anybody looking at Georgia politics to not trust Gov. His support would be incredibly beneficial and invaluable to anybody in a race like this.” Others see Dooley's emergence as a necessary spark in an otherwise sluggish contest. “This race is absolutely, like, lethargic,” said Ryan Mahoney, a Georgia Republican strategist. Mahoney noted that despite months on the trail and millions of dollars spent on ads, candidates such as Carter and King haven't generated much excitement. “When the [Dooley] trial balloon was floated … people had questions and thoughts and opinions, but no one was saying, ‘Nope, I'm on Team Carter. He argued that concerns about Dooley's outsider status are typical of political gatekeeping. “Everyone loves being the outsider, until they're the insider, and then they're upset that outsiders want to come in and disrupt their game.” One Georgia State GOP lawmaker warned, “At the end of the day, we need a governing partner in Washington.” The lawmaker added, “We've seen what happens when we lose focus and nominate someone who can't win a general election.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Undeterred by the limits of hydrology or climate, metro areas from Las Vegas to Miami have gotten one thing undeniably right. They have long led the country in housing construction, resulting in a relative plenitude and affordability that shames coastal cities in California and the Northeast, as well as a booming industry of takes imploring blue cities to learn from red states on housing. But that abundance is already becoming a thing of the past. Across Sunbelt metros like Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta, housing supply growth has actually plummeted since the early 2000s, to rates almost as low as in hyper-expensive coastal cities, according to a new working paper by the leading urban economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko. Housing costs in these metros, while still lower than major coastal cities, have surged as a result. Gyourko, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who decades ago documented slowing housing growth in superstar cities like New York and San Francisco, told me he was surprised to find the same pattern again unfolding, as if on a 20-year lag, in a region known for its lax regulations and enthusiasm for building things. Although metro Phoenix, to unpack one example, is building a similar absolute number of homes as it did in the early 2000s, its population has grown by more than 58 percent since the turn of the century, so as a share of its current housing stock — the number that most matters, Gyourko says — it's now building far less. If that trend continues even as demand to live in the Sunbelt remains undimmed, he said, “you would expect them to start to look more and more like Los Angeles.” By 2045, Arizona might be facing unaffordability and population loss crises much like those choking California today. “The concepts ‘Sunbelt city' and ‘suburb' are nearly synonymous,” as historian Becky Nicolaides put it. But the slowdown in new housing builds across the region, Glaeser and Gyourko found, has been especially pronounced in well-off, low-density suburbs with desirable amenities like good schools. These suburbs have plenty of room to densify and welcome more neighbors — they just aren't doing it. “America's suburban frontier,” the authors warn, “appears to be closing.” In most parts of the US with a growing economy and good jobs, the housing market has become badly broken to a degree that transcends the usual explanations, like regional differences in construction licensure rules or environmental review requirements — although those factors, without a doubt, matter. Housing markets are complicated, and economic shocks like the Great Recession and the recent spike in interest rates have surely played a role. But the downturn in housing builds predates both those things, Glaeser and Gyourko found, suggesting a deeper cause. It's one of the most taken-for-granted facts of modern American life: the suburban model itself, and all its attendant political, regulatory, and financial problems. Since the end of World War II, housing supply growth in the United States has overwhelmingly been driven by suburban sprawl radiating ever outward from city centers. Instead of building up, with density, we largely built out. But that engine may be running out of steam — and as a strategy for filling our national housing shortage, it's failing spectacularly. “It hasn't been working in the supply-constrained coastal markets for four decades. What's new is it looks like it's starting not to work in the Sunbelt,” the country's fastest-growing, most economically dynamic region, Gyourko said. The strangeness of housing policy in the US can be summed up like this: On a national level, we long for growth. On a local level, we do everything possible to smother it. That contradiction stems, in part, from our dependence on sprawl. America is a nation of suburbs — that's certainly not changing any time soon. That image is a pretty accurate reflection of what American cities used to look like by default. Our suburbs, too, once looked much like this — remnants of the pattern can still be seen in places like Oak Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), University City, Missouri (outside St. Louis), or Brookline, Massachusetts (neighboring Boston). Of course, what dense, older suburbs like Brookline or Oak Park have in common is that, like the cities they neighbor, they were largely laid out before mass car ownership. It was only relatively recently that suburbs became synonymous with a specific, car- and sprawl-oriented development style. But those choices make a lot more sense when framed by the daily realities of mid-century urban life. Much of the prewar urban housing stock was genuinely terrible — many people lacked access to a full bathroom or even a flush toilet. Cities were still manufacturing centers and had the pollution to go with it. Americans who could afford to move were understandably pulled toward modern, spacious houses being built on an unprecedented scale in new tracts outside the city. By 1970, most Americans dwelling in metropolitan areas — meaning a core city and its adjacent areas — were living in suburbs, and by 2010, most Americans were, full stop. Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, which in the decades after World War II grew from little more than desert towns to megacities, developed in a particularly suburban, car-dependent form. But there was a problem that slowly made itself felt: Though they were themselves the product of a major transformation, postwar American suburbia relied on a restrictive set of rules that made suburban neighborhoods, once built, very difficult to change. Irrationally rigid regulations on housing remain in place across the country today. These rules are set out by a system known as zoning: local regulations on what kind of things can be built where. Zoning, including single-family-exclusive zoning, first spread across the US in the early 20th century (before that, development was far more freewheeling and improvised). At first glance, the idea of zoning seems reasonable enough: Factories that emit toxic pollutants should probably be kept away from residential areas, for example. Zoning codes include legions of other rules, often including minimum size requirements (effectively banning starter homes) and mandatory parking spots for at least two cars. Apartments, in many areas, are zoned out of existence. But the US, despite our national reputation for freedom and individualism, is relatively unique in having such a prescriptive segregation of land uses governing what people are allowed to do with what is, don't forget, their own property, as Sonia Hirt, an architecture and planning professor at the University of Georgia, explains in her book Zoned in the USA. We're also unusual in granting privileged status to one specific, costly, and resource-intensive type of housing. “I could find no evidence in other countries that this particular form — the detached single-family home — is routinely, as in the United States, considered to be so incompatible with all other types of urbanization as to warrant a legally defined district all its own, a district where all other major land uses and building types are outlawed,” Hirt writes. Suburban-style zoning has become widespread not just in suburbs proper, but also in core cities, many of which have adopted similar zoning codes that would have made their original growth and housing diversity impossible. For mid-century home buyers, the costs of our suburban revolution were distant. But it didn't take long for those costs to become felt nationally. By rigidly defining what a community is allowed to look like, suburban zoning has done more than simply shape the physical form of our cities. It has also made it all but impossible for many communities to adapt and grow, as human societies always have, which has created severe distortions in housing markets. “These neighborhoods are frozen at their current number of households, no matter how much the surrounding city transforms. No matter how desirable the area is or how high rents get,” he wrote in his recent book Escaping the Housing Trap. And when housing becomes scarce relative to the number of people who want to live in the community, it simply becomes more expensive. Los Angeles, incredibly, downzoned its residential areas to such an extent between 1960 and 1990 that its total population capacity, as measured by the number of households it's zoned to accommodate, declined from 10 million people to about 4 million, which is the level the city's population has hovered around for the last decade. The upshot is that many of America's metropolitan areas have become dominated by what economist Issi Romem identified in 2018 as a “dormant suburban interior.” After World War II, cities and suburbs built out and out, mostly low-density single-family homes, before they largely stopped building altogether because zoning laws forced them to maintain an inflexible suburban form. Despite a few pockets of dense growth, most residential areas have been locked out of building incrementally and thickening up, even as demand to live there increases. When a high-demand city refuses to allow greater housing density, the dynamic becomes progressively more toxic, not just because homes become more scarce, but also because market incentives can push developers to replace cheaper, smaller single-family houses with more costly McMansions (as opposed to, in a healthier market, building apartments or a set of townhomes that could house more people in the same amount of space, for less money per household). In expensive cities, proposals to build more housing have, famously, often been blocked by angry neighbors (derisively called NIMBYs) who rely on a labyrinthine tangle of zoning laws to foil change that they don't like. Now, that vicious cycle is poised to catch up with the South and Southwest, where, Glaeser and Gyourko believe, the decline in housing starts is likely a function of incumbent residents using regulation to make it harder to build. (And plenty of anecdotal evidence from local housing fights in the Sunbelt, Slate reporter Henry Grabar has noted, points to the same thing.) Suburbia offered Americans an implicit bargain: Neighborhoods would never have to change, and we could instead accommodate more people by sprawling outward forever. To a great extent, that's what's happened, and it's given us lots of single-family homes, but also a mind-boggling expanse of costly, deteriorating infrastructure, nightmare commutes, unrestrained greenhouse gas emissions, sedentary, disease-promoting lifestyles, and one of the highest car crash death rates in the developed world. I put this question to Gyourko: Once the most distant, low-density exurbs of, say, Dallas declare themselves full, why don't developers simply keep building the next ring of sprawl 50-plus miles away? “People don't want to live that far,” he said (he later clarified that we don't know the precise outer limit beyond which housing demand dwindles). In the early 2010s, many core cities, including Denver, Atlanta, and Washington, DC, grew faster than suburbs, due to a combination of younger generations' increasing interest in urban lifestyles and a collapse in suburban home construction after the Great Recession. Some of the most expensive homes in the country are consistently those located in dense, vibrant prewar cities, a clear signal that there's high demand for those amenities. Plenty of cities and states, especially since the post-2020 run-up in home prices, have finally begun to take their largely self-inflicted housing shortages seriously. The sheer volume of new laws meant to make it easier to build homes has been overwhelming, reflecting the morass of local obstacles. If it sounds draconian for states to interfere in cities' and suburbs' policies, consider that the US is unusual in its hyperlocal control over housing. Although huge barriers remain, we're just beginning to see the contours of a major shift in how housing in America gets regulated and built. In other words, he said: “Let people do things.” “A city is the ultimate form of emergent order. “The basic instinct of zoning is that we can sit down and write out the exact appropriate types of uses, scale of those uses, and exactly where those uses can go — and it's just such a presumptuous way to govern a city.” The deeper implication is not just that we need more housing, but also that suburbs must be allowed to function like the miniature cities they are. “No neighborhood can be exempt from change,” as Marohn put it. Zoning exclusively for detached single-family homes, for example, has never made much sense, but it especially doesn't make sense in 2025, when most Americans live in household sizes of two or one. But because zoning codes are enormously complicated, repealing one barrier often isn't enough to actually allow multifamily housing to get built — things like height limits or excessive parking minimums can still make it infeasible. “Housing is like a door with a bunch of deadbolts on it,” Alli Thurmond Quinlan, an architect and small-scale developer based in Fayetteville, Arkansas, told me. “You have to unlock all the deadbolts, but as soon as you do, there's an enormous amount of human creativity” that rushes in. She stresses that communities shouldn't be afraid of going too far in repealing zoning rules, and that if anything, they should err on the side of going further. Removing parking requirements made it possible to build this lovely set of densely clustered cottages — a development style that can blend harmoniously into suburban neighborhoods — in Atlanta at a significantly lower cost: Right now, what little density is being added to cities and suburbs often comes in the form of large apartment buildings (you may know them as “gentrification buildings”). There's nothing wrong with those, and they have an important role to play in mitigating the housing shortage. Yet many people don't want them built in single-family neighborhoods. “The dormant suburban sea is so vast that if the taboo on densification there were broken, even modest gradual redevelopment — tearing down one single-family home at a time and replacing it with a duplex or a small apartment building — could grow the housing stock immensely,” Romem wrote in 2018. At the dawn of mass suburbanization, Americans had legitimate reasons for wanting to move out of cities, where substandard housing and overcrowding were still commonplace. But “one generation's solutions can become the next generation's problems,” as journalists Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder) and Derek Thompson wrote in their book Abundance. For me, this subject is personal: I've lived in apartments literally my entire life, a form of housing often treated as second-class, if it's even permitted to exist. America gave me everything, but our national housing reality made things far more difficult for her than they needed to be. There's no shortage of wonky policy ideas about how to fix housing in the US — and they go far beyond just zoning codes (you don't want to hear me get started on building codes or impact fees). We will also need a society-wide paradigm shift beyond policy: The financial and real estate industries will need to relearn models for supporting incremental densification, which, experts consistently told me, have fallen by the wayside since the entrenchment of sprawl and restrictive zoning. As Marohn points out in Escaping the Housing Trap, “a community that has lost all affordable starter housing already has changed irreversibly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Here's what a new vision of the suburbs could look like. Undeterred by the limits of hydrology or climate, metro areas from Las Vegas to Miami have gotten one thing undeniably right. They have long led the country in housing construction, resulting in a relative plenitude and affordability that shames coastal cities in California and the Northeast, as well as a booming industry of takes imploring blue cities to learn from red states on housing. But that abundance is already becoming a thing of the past. Across Sunbelt metros like Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta, housing supply growth has actually plummeted since the early 2000s, to rates almost as low as in hyper-expensive coastal cities, according to a new working paper by the leading urban economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko. Housing costs in these metros, while still lower than major coastal cities, have surged as a result. Gyourko, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who decades ago documented slowing housing growth in superstar cities like New York and San Francisco, told me he was surprised to find the same pattern again unfolding, as if on a 20-year lag, in a region known for its lax regulations and enthusiasm for building things. Although metro Phoenix, to unpack one example, is building a similar absolute number of homes as it did in the early 2000s, its population has grown by more than 58 percent since the turn of the century, so as a share of its current housing stock — the number that most matters, Gyourko says — it's now building far less. If that trend continues even as demand to live in the Sunbelt remains undimmed, he said, “you would expect them to start to look more and more like Los Angeles.” By 2045, Arizona might be facing unaffordability and population loss crises much like those choking California today. “The concepts ‘Sunbelt city' and ‘suburb' are nearly synonymous,” as historian Becky Nicolaides put it. But the slowdown in new housing builds across the region, Glaeser and Gyourko found, has been especially pronounced in well-off, low-density suburbs with desirable amenities like good schools. These suburbs have plenty of room to densify and welcome more neighbors — they just aren't doing it. “America's suburban frontier,” the authors warn, “appears to be closing.” In most parts of the US with a growing economy and good jobs, the housing market has become badly broken to a degree that transcends the usual explanations, like regional differences in construction licensure rules or environmental review requirements — although those factors, without a doubt, matter. Housing markets are complicated, and economic shocks like the Great Recession and the recent spike in interest rates have surely played a role. But the downturn in housing builds predates both those things, Glaeser and Gyourko found, suggesting a deeper cause. It's one of the most taken-for-granted facts of modern American life: the suburban model itself, and all its attendant political, regulatory, and financial problems. Since the end of World War II, housing supply growth in the United States has overwhelmingly been driven by suburban sprawl radiating ever outward from city centers. Instead of building up, with density, we largely built out. But that engine may be running out of steam — and as a strategy for filling our national housing shortage, it's failing spectacularly. “It hasn't been working in the supply-constrained coastal markets for four decades. What's new is it looks like it's starting not to work in the Sunbelt,” the country's fastest-growing, most economically dynamic region, Gyourko said. On a local level, we do everything possible to smother it. That contradiction stems, in part, from our dependence on sprawl. America is a nation of suburbs — that's certainly not changing any time soon. That image is a pretty accurate reflection of what American cities used to look like by default. Our suburbs, too, once looked much like this — remnants of the pattern can still be seen in places like Oak Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), University City, Missouri (outside St. Louis), or Brookline, Massachusetts (neighboring Boston). Of course, what dense, older suburbs like Brookline or Oak Park have in common is that, like the cities they neighbor, they were largely laid out before mass car ownership. It was only relatively recently that suburbs became synonymous with a specific, car- and sprawl-oriented development style. But those choices make a lot more sense when framed by the daily realities of mid-century urban life. Much of the prewar urban housing stock was genuinely terrible — many people lacked access to a full bathroom or even a flush toilet. Cities were still manufacturing centers and had the pollution to go with it. Americans who could afford to move were understandably pulled toward modern, spacious houses being built on an unprecedented scale in new tracts outside the city. By 1970, most Americans dwelling in metropolitan areas — meaning a core city and its adjacent areas — were living in suburbs, and by 2010, most Americans were, full stop. Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, which in the decades after World War II grew from little more than desert towns to megacities, developed in a particularly suburban, car-dependent form. But there was a problem that slowly made itself felt: Though they were themselves the product of a major transformation, postwar American suburbia relied on a restrictive set of rules that made suburban neighborhoods, once built, very difficult to change. Irrationally rigid regulations on housing remain in place across the country today. These rules are set out by a system known as zoning: local regulations on what kind of things can be built where. Zoning, including single-family-exclusive zoning, first spread across the US in the early 20th century (before that, development was far more freewheeling and improvised). At first glance, the idea of zoning seems reasonable enough: Factories that emit toxic pollutants should probably be kept away from residential areas, for example. Zoning codes include legions of other rules, often including minimum size requirements (effectively banning starter homes) and mandatory parking spots for at least two cars. Apartments, in many areas, are zoned out of existence. But the US, despite our national reputation for freedom and individualism, is relatively unique in having such a prescriptive segregation of land uses governing what people are allowed to do with what is, don't forget, their own property, as Sonia Hirt, an architecture and planning professor at the University of Georgia, explains in her book Zoned in the USA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police Brigadier General Nicolas Torre speaks during a hearing on the arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Manila, Philippines, March 20, 2025. MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighters, the Philippine police chief said Monday. The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano. The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region. The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere. National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias “Totoy,” provided crucial details. The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin. “I was very shocked,” Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. “It firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.” Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings. While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe. Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Typhoon Danas brought heavy winds and torrential rains to parts of Taiwan early Monday, killing two people and injuring more than 300 on the island's densely populated west coast. The typhoon lost intensity and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved into the Taiwan Strait on a forecast path to China. The typhoon made landfall on the west coast late Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 144 kph (89 mph). It dumped more than 60 centimeters (24 inches) of rain in places, causing landslides and flooding. Two deaths were reported in the southwestern city of Tainan, according to the National Fire Agency. One person died when their vehicle was struck by a falling tree, while another died after his respirator malfunctioned due to losing power. At least 334 people suffered injuries, while more than 3,400 people were forced to evacuate – mostly from mountainous areas around the southern port city of Kaohsiung. Areas of southern and eastern China made preparations ahead of the storm, which is expected to reach the mainland Tuesday afternoon. Authorities in southern Guangdong province called hundreds of vessels to port and evacuated more than 2,000 people from offshore facilities. Two cities in the eastern Zhejiang province suspended ferry services and construction work. Danas earlier intensified seasonal monsoon rains in the Philippines' northern mountains, flooding low-lying villages and forcing more than 3,000 people to flee to emergency shelters. Taiwan routinely sees tropical storms between July and October, but they are more common on its sparsely populated eastern coast facing the Pacific. Associated Press video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, writer Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, and news researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The legal defense team for Sean “Diddy” Combs' celebrate and hugged after their client was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put one of hip-hop's most celebrated figures behind bars for life. The rapper was convicted of lesser prostitution-related offenses. NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “Diddy” Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after winning acquittals on potential life-in-prison charges, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America. “They all said: ‘We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'” attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after a jury acquitted Combs of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Combs, 55, remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time already served. After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the “I'll Be Missing You” singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges. “I said: ‘Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'” he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man. “You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,” Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, “is simply not sex trafficking.” Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a “no brainer.” “The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday. “No one knows what to think,” Agnifilo said. Defense attorneys for Sean “Diddy” Combs, including from left, Brian Steel, Alexandra Shapiro, Marc Agnifilo and Teny Garagos, Anna Estevao, Nicole Westmoreland, Jason Driscoll and Xavier Donaldson, far right, line up for a group photo outside Manhattan federal court after Sean “Diddy” Combs was denied bail after being convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges, Wednesday, July 2, 2025, in New York. “I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: ”We have to get a bail application together,” he recalled. “It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.” Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction. He credited “a dream team of defense lawyers” against prosecutors who almost always win. Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy — belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them — last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses. Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team “had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities. Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination. For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest. “He's doing OK,” said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune” that can erase them,” he said. For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom. '” recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures. Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse. “We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.</p>
