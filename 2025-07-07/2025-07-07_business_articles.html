                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence-oriented cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave said Monday it will acquire Core Scientific, a data center infrastructure provider, in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $9 billion. Shares of both companies rallied at the end of June after the Wall Street Journal reported that talks were underway for an acquisition. "I think that, like many things that we do, it takes the market some time to internalize the value proposition that we are representing to the market and how it all fits together," CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC in an interview. In a presentation to investors, CoreWeave said the move will eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations and significantly enhance operating efficiency. "We're not paying rent, right, for the next 15 years," Intrator said. The deal expands CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of gross capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data center footprint, with another gigawatt available for future growth. Of Core Scientific's 1.3 gigawatts, 840 megawatts are allocated to CoreWeave's contracts at five locations, Nitin Agrawal, CoreWeave's finance chief, said on a call with analysts. After the deal closes, CoreWeave said it will be able to choose to divest Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining business, which was responsible for 89% of Core Scientific's first-quarter revenue, or make it ready to handle AI workloads. "We have gone through the conversion process," Intrator said. CoreWeave is in the middle of an upgrade with Galaxy Digital, he said. The cost associated with converting cryptocurrency sites is less than it is for setting up new AI data centers, Intrator said. Plus, CoreWeave will be able to pursue investments from infrastructure-oriented vehicles and other sources that could result in a lower cost of capital, Agrawal said on the investor call. As of March 31, CoreWeave's weighted average rate on its short-term debt was 10.1%. It has worked with CoreWeave since 2018, Intrator said. CoreWeave went public in March, and even after Monday's pullback, its shares are worth four times more than they were at it was looking to join the Nasdaq. When CoreWeave began working on infrastructure for AI, some people said the company should be building its own data centers, but it would have been a difficult pitch to investors, Intrator said. It's constructing its own data centers, separate from Core Scientific, as it competes with major cloud infrastructure sellers such as Amazon Web Services. "When you look at the hyperscalers, they have some infrastructure that they build, and they have some infrastructure that they use third parties to deliver, and there's a reason that they do that, and those reasons kind of are applicable to us, too, and so that's what you're seeing," Intrator said. Shareholders of Core Scientific will receive 0.1235 CoreWeave shares for each share they hold. The two companies could have come together earlier. Last year Core Scientific said it had rejected CoreWeave's unsolicited offer to buy all outstanding shares. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Trump's Second Term:

Blackouts in the US could double by 2030 amid an expected increase in power demand brought on by AI, according to a Trump administration report that blames the expected energy shortfall on the closures of coal and natural gas power plants and overreliance on renewable energy.

A 100% “surge in power outages” is expected within five years if planned power plant closures remain on schedule without new units to replace them, the Energy Department, which is releasing the report on Monday, said in a statement. “Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies,” it said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that there would be several trade announcements over the next 48 hours, adding that he expects "it's going to be a busy couple of days." However, Bessent did not specify which countries would be involved. Although Capgemini's shares have fallen more than 5% so far during today's session, shares of its takeover target WNS are telling a different story. WNS's U.S.-listed stock was last seen 15.7% higher in pre-market trade, as investors reacted to the news that it would be bought by France's Capgemini in a $3.3 billion cash deal. WNS offers businesses technology outsourcing and analytics services. Currys plc shares retreated in the Monday session, after RBC Capital analysts downgraded the stock over its specular run this year. But a turnaround plan, marked by the sale of a Greek subsidiary for 200 million euros ($235 million) in 2024 and a focus on profitable major markets like the U.K., attracted investors' attention, sending the shares higher. With shares trading at £1.24 as of Friday ($1.7) — an increase of about 180% from the lows of October 2023 — RBC downgraded Currys to "Sector Perform", adding that the stock had reached a more "reasonable" valuation. "Currys has a strong relative market position, some further self-help opportunities and is building what it calls more 'stabilisers' into the business, to reduce its macro and seasonal risk. This includes adding new products and more recurring revenues," said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain in a note to clients. The company's board also rebuffed attempts by activist investor Elliot Management to take over the firm for £0.67 ($0.84) per share in February 2024. Daimler Truck reported a 20% drop in its North American business for the second quarter from last year, a trend that's continued since early 2025. The company said it recorded 13% growth in its Asia business, excluding China and India, and 5% growth in buses sold worldwide. In India and China, where it operates under the Mercedes-Benz Trucks brand, second-quarter sales fell by 0.5% from last year. Shares have had a muted reaction and were up 0.6% at 10.50 a.m. in London. European markets have been open for almost an hour now, and oil and gas stocks are still leading regional losses. The Stoxx Oil and Gas index was last seen trading 1.3% lower. Oil prices fell after the OPEC+ alliance agreed to a bigger-than-expected production increase. Shares of French tech firm Capgemini have tumbled to the bottom of the regional Stoxx 600 index, shedding 2.7% by 8:45 a.m. in London. In a trading update released ahead of its second-quarter financial results, the firm said it now expects integrated gas output to be in a range of 900,000 to 940,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared with a 890,000 to 950,000 boe/d guidance for the period issued during the company's first-quarter results outlook. Shell warned of "significantly lower" trading results in the second quarter, compared with the previous three-month period, for both its integrated gas division and its chemicals and products unit, where it anticipates to be "below break-even" over the period. "Shell has issued successive positive trading updates over the last couple of years, and it looks like the positive streak has been broken." Shell shares were down 2.18% at 08:13 a.m. London time after the release. Major bourses are also moving in opposite directions, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.1%, the French CAC 40 little changed, and Germany's DAX gaining 0.4%. French tech firm Capgemini announced on Monday that it will buy U.S.-listed WNS in a $3.3 billion cash deal. That translates to $76.50 per share in the technology outsourcing firm — a 17% premium on its July 3 closing price. Capgemini is aiming to capitalize on WNS' generative and agentic artificial intelligence offerings, which it said would attract significant investments. The U.K.'s largest residential gas and electricity supplier, Octopus Energy, is planning a £10 billion ($13.6 billion) demerger of its technology arm Kraken, Britain's Sky News reported over the weekend. China's Finance Ministry said on Sunday that it was restricting government purchases of medical devices from the EU if they exceeded 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). It's a retaliation against the bloc saying last month it would ban Chinese firms from competing for EU public tenders for medical devices worth more than 60 billion euros ($70 billion) a year. Europe-listed shares look set for a mixed open today. Futures tied to the regional Stoxx 50 were last seen trading 0.1% higher, while those tied to London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX were last 0.2% lower and 0.2% higher, respectively. Futures tied to France's CAC 40 are around 0.3% lower this morning. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries that orient themselves along the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." Trump's announcement, which did not elaborate on any specific policy of BRICS, came as the group's meeting is underway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The bloc's leaders took aim at Trump's sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement dated July 6, warning against "unjustified unilateral protectionist measures, including the indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs."

US Stocks:

Ark Investment Management LLC CEO Cathie Wood

Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management LLC is moving into the fast-growing market for buffer ETFs designed to limit equity losses, at a time when her tech funds continue to bleed assets.

The investment firm last week submittedBloomberg Terminal paperwork to launch four exchange-traded funds that seek to protect investors against modest losses in the equity market while still offering upside. The idea is simple: When stocks drop, the ETFs cushion the fall, shielding investors from some losses. When the market rises, they deliver gains, though these are capped, too. </p>

The $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus by Saks Fifth Avenue's owner last year was supposed to create a luxury powerhouse. Instead, both department stores are losing customers and sales to competitors including Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. 

Sales at Saks Fifth Avenue fell 16% during the quarter that ended in June from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which tracks debit and credit purchases. During the same period, combined sales at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman sank 10%. The slowdown accelerated over the three months, with June showing the biggest drop at the three retailers. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said the Trump administration will make "several" trade-related announcements in the next 48 hours, signaling imminent progress even as U.S. tariff deadlines appear to be shifting. Speaking on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Bessent also declined, yet again, to rule out the possibility that he could serve as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, if President Donald Trump asks him to. Bessent said foreign trade officials are rushing to make deals with the United States before July 9, when high tariff rates on dozens of countries' goods are set to snap back into effect. "So my, my mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals." "It's going to be a busy couple of days," he added. But Bessent also repeated the administration's new line, rolled out over the holiday weekend, that country-specific tariff rates will not be collected until Aug. 1. His remarks came one day after Trump said his administration could send as many as 15 letters to U.S. trade partners between Monday and Wednesday, dictating new tariff rates that would be imposed on their exports to the United States. Trump also said "some deals have been made," suggesting the administration could unveil a mix of bilateral trade agreements and unilateral tariff letters this week. Bessent said on CNBC that the letters would be "pretty standard." "It's just, 'Thank you for wanting to trade with the United States of America. On Sunday night, Trump said in a Truth Social post that tariff "Letters, and/or Deals," will be sent out starting Monday at noon ET. Earlier in the day Sunday, Trump gave a vague answer when he was asked if U.S. tariff rates will be changing on Wednesday, or not until Aug. 1. I think we'll have most countries done by July 9. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was standing next to Trump on an airport taxiway, added, "But they go into effect on Aug. 1 ... the president is setting the rates and the deals right now." The White House did not respond to several requests from CNBC for more clarity on the trade timeline. Bessent was also asked again Monday about the possibility that he could succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends next May. "I will do what the President wants," Bessent said. "But I think that we are making great gains here at Treasury, we've had a busy five, six months out of the box, and we've got a lot to do."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla stock dropped sharply on Monday as traders reacted to Elon Musk's announcement that he would start a new political party. Musk's announcement that he would start an "America Party" is the latest chapter in the Tesla CEO's political saga this year, and Monday's move is a sign that investors are weary of another potential distraction from his work at the EV maker. The Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said there was a "sense of exhaustion" over Musk's political activities. Trump responded by saying Musk had gone "off the rails." "Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story," Ives wrote in a note published on Sunday. "That relief lasted a very short time and now has taken a turn for the worst with this latest announcement," Ives wrote. Tesla shares peaked at about $480 in December as investors wagered Musk's close association with Trump would benefit Tesla. But the pair's relationship has deteriorated in recent months as they've clashed over government spending. Ives predicted that Tesla's shares would be "under some pressure" on Monday as investors worry about Trump viewing Musk as a competitor instead of an ally. "Musk/Tesla do not need to keep poking the bear as Trump can create more hurdles for Musk/Tesla/SpaceX over the coming years," Ives wrote. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk announced the party in an X post on Saturday, saying, "Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom." In response, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that Musk had gone "completely off the rails." The EV maker faced protests, boycotts, and attacks over Musk's work with DOGE. Still, Tesla shareholders have long indicated that they don't think Musk can be replaced as CEO. In June last year, shareholders approved Musk's controversial $55 billion pay package, which was largely seen as a referendum on his leadership. There was concern among investors that if the pay package had been thrown out, Musk might lose interest in the EV giant and divert attention to his other ventures.</p>

US Stocks:

CoreWeave Inc. signage during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, on March 28.

CoreWeave Inc. is dropping $9 billion on the data-center operator Core Scientific Inc. in an effort to gain more direct control over the physical assets powering the artificial-intelligence boom.

In buying Core Scientific in an all-stock deal, CoreWeave will inherit more than a gigawatt of data-center capacity across the US — much of which is already contracted out to serve its clients in training, deploying and using AI models. CoreWeave said Monday that controlling more of its supply chain will eliminate some lease expenses, reduce costs including those associated with financing projects and “future-proof” its revenue growth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Risa Morimoto, a senior lecturer in economics at SOAS University of London, in England. The following has been edited for length and clarity. However, I believe some of my students have been using AI to generate essay content that pulls information from the internet, instead of using material from my classes to complete their assignments. AI is supposed to help us work efficiently, but my workload has skyrocketed because of it. I have to spend lots of time figuring out whether the work students are handing in was really written by them. The world is changing, so universities can't stand still. I've worked at SOAS University of London since 2012. Initially, my teaching style was exam-based, but I found that students were anxious about one-off exams, and their results wouldn't always correspond to their performance. Students chose their topic and consolidated theories into an essay. I'd maybe catch one or two students cheating by copying huge chunks of text from internet sources, leading to a plagiarism case. Even two or three years ago, detecting inappropriate AI use was easier due to signs like robotic writing styles. Now, with more sophisticated AI technologies, it's harder to detect, and I believe the scale of cheating has increased. These examples are typically referenced on the internet, which makes me think the students are using an AI tool that is incorporating them. Some of the essays will cite 20 pieces of literature, but not a single one will be something from the reading list I set. While students can use examples from internet sources in their work, I'm concerned that some students have just used AI to generate the essay content without reading or engaging with the original source. AI tools are easy to access for students who feel pressured by the amount of work they have to do. Over the past year, I've sat on an academic misconduct panel at the university, dealing with students who've been flagged for inappropriate AI use across departments. It can be hard to make decisions because you can't be 100% sure from reading the essay whether it's AI-generated or not. The university is encouraging lecturers to change their teaching and assessment practices. At the department level, we often discuss how to improve things. I send my two young children to a school with an alternative, progressive education system, rather than a mainstream British state school. Seeing how my kids are educated has inspired me to try two alternative assessment methods this coming academic year. I'll ask my students to choose a topic and produce a summary of what they learned in the class about it. My aim is to make sure the assignments are directly tied to what we've learned in class and make assessments more personal and creative. The old assessment model, which involves memorizing facts and regurgitating them in exams, isn't useful anymore. ChatGPT can easily give you a beautiful summary of information like this. Instead, educators need to help students with soft skills, communication, and out-of-the-box thinking. In a statement to BI, a SOAS spokesperson said students are guided to use AI in ways that "uphold academic integrity." They said the university encouraged students to pursue work that is harder for AI to replicate and have "robust mechanisms" in place for investigating AI misuse. "The use of AI is constantly evolving, and we are regularly reviewing and updating our policies to respond to these changes," the spokesperson added. Do you have a story to share about AI in education?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Search and rescue operations continue in central Texas, where catastrophic flooding on Friday has killed more than 80 people. During a Sunday press conference, after the usual updates, officials made what has become a familiar request during recent natural disasters: Don't fly your personal drones over the disaster area. "We know that people want to volunteer, but what we are starting to see is personal drones flying," Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice told reporters. "These personal drones flying is a danger to aircraft, which then risks further operations." The Kerrville Police Department echoed Rice's remarks on Sunday. There is a no-fly zone in Kerr County for private drones," the department said on its Facebook page. Greg Abbott on Sunday, Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Suelzer of the Texas National Guard said the department had launched an MQ-9 Reaper drone to perform assessment operations. "It's truly an eye in the sky for our search and rescue people," Suelzer said. Though drones are now commonly used in military and law enforcement operations, they are also popular among civilians, mostly for photography and shooting video but also for those looking to help search after disasters. In 2021, the Dixie fire spread across Northern California. The flames ripped through communities, displacing residents and burning nearly a million acres of land. That July, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said an unauthorized drone had impeded emergency operations. "Drones restrict firefighters' ability to protect lives, property, and natural resources. Hurricane Helene battered the southeastern US in late 2024. Amid the search and rescue efforts, the US Department of Transportation shared an X post asking consumer drone operators to stay clear. "Do not fly your drone near or around rescue and recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene," the agency said. The FAADroneZone, the agency's site for drone services, said in a separate X post that "interfering with emergency response efforts may result in fines or criminal prosecution." At the time, some online observers thought volunteer drone operators were being barred from assisting in relief efforts, which sparked a backlash. "These restrictions occur at the request of local authorities or law enforcement. FAA does not put these into place without requests," a spokesperson told Fox News. The agency added that "anyone looking to use a drone or other aircraft to assist in Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery efforts should coordinate with first responders and law enforcement on scene to ensure they do not disrupt life-saving operations." In January, a series of wildfires erupted across the Los Angeles region, causing widespread damage and forcing hundreds of thousands to evacuate their homes. In addition to emergency firefighting efforts on the ground, officials deployed two Super Scoopers, which are amphibious aircraft that collect water to drop on wildfires. An unauthorized civilian drone struck one Super Scooper, forcing it out of service. "We would like to remind everyone that flying a drone in the midst of firefighting efforts is a federal crime and punishable by up to 12 months in prison or a fine of up to $75,000," a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson said at the time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney and Universal recently sued Midjourney, accusing it of using tech to rip off their famous characters. But inside entertainment companies, it's a whole different story. The AI on the Lot conference in May has doubled its attendance to 1,200 over three years, while AI editing company Runway attracted some 1,000 people to its third film festival. The tantalizing promise of AI is that it could solve big problems in the entertainment business, like content discovery and high production costs. "No matter how you feel about AI tools in the media and entertainment business, they're here to stay," said Peter Csathy, who advises media companies. Investors are climbing on board companies like Ecco, an AI startup that helps people find titles across multiple streamers using queries like "find me all the shows about F1." It has raised $7 million from Ben Silverman, Shaquille O'Neal, and others. One such investor is Ishan Sinha, a consumer partner at Point72 Ventures. He said the hype around AI-generated video hasn't translated into consumer interest. He sees the most potential in companies that use AI to promote distribution through personalization, translation, and IP ownership. "We believe the winning consumer businesses aggregate eyeballs — they have some type of a hook, whether it's content aggregation, playlists, proprietary IP, etc., that acquires and retains users," he said. Point72 Ventures' investments include GlobalComix, which uses AI to bring recommendations and language translation to comic book and manga readers that they couldn't otherwise find, and Cheehoo, which is working with studios to simplify animation. Toonstar, a startup behind "StEvEn & Parker," uses AI for tasks ranging from developing storylines to creating images and says it can make episodes at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. Others chasing the animation or independent creator opportunity are Further Adventures, a new studio that's investing in digital creators and independent filmmakers; Invisible Universe, an animation studio backed by Seven Seven Six; and Promise, an AI studio backed by Peter Chernin's North Road, Andreessen Horowitz, and Google. "AI can't really make stories that are enduring," deFaria told BI. Metaphysic, which was known for de-aging Tom Hanks and Robin Wright for the Robert Zemeckis film "Here," was acquired in February by DNEG Group's AI company Brahma. Papercup's voice-cloning IP was acquired in June by RWS, a content solutions company, while its team was acquired by Scale AI. AI is also being applied to speed the dubbing process, recreate the voices of bygone actors, and restore old films and TV series. One player, Deepdub, which uses AI to dub movies and shows, just extended its tech to real-time dubbing of live sports commentary, esports shoutcasting, and breaking news coverage. This can involve everything from AI in the script reading phase to scouring video libraries to generate new ideas for titles based on what's performed well in the past. One, Paris-based Moments Lab, recently raised a $24 million round from backers including Oxx and Orange Ventures to expand its AI tools that are used by Warner Bros. Moments can make clips for social media seven times faster than the conventional approach, cofounder Phil Petitpont recently told BI, citing internal research. He said media companies would be able to use AI to help make full-length documentaries based on their video libraries in several months, while predictive modeling tools that can suggest audience-boosting changes are a year away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tech industry is now split between two starkly different job markets. On one side, there's a stalled job market where more workers are staying put. On the other there is a rapidly expanding artificial intelligence sector that's reshaping the talent landscape. To help founders understand the situation, Atli Thorkelsson, head of talent network at Redpoint Ventures, created a slide deck on the state of tech hiring. He presented it at the firm's third annual InfraRed Summit, which brings together founders of up-and-coming companies in cloud infrastructure. The deck includes data cobbled together from Pave, a compensation management tool; TrueUp, a tech jobs marketplace; and SignalFire, an early-stage venture capital firm. Thorkelsson notes that the charts throughout the deck represent fast-growing tech firms. Since Redpoint used data from vendors that mainly serve tech clients with open roles, those companies end up overrepresented. Here's an exclusive look at the 13-slide deck that Redpoint shared with founders. Red lines show machine learning and AI engineers; white lines indicate software engineers.</p>
